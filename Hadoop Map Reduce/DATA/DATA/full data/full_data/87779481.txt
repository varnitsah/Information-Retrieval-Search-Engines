interesting double consonants etc      contents     villa rubein     a man of devon     a knight     salvation of a forsyte     the silence     villa rubein     preface  writing not long ago to my oldest literary friend i expressed in a moment of heedless sentiment the wish that we might have again one of our talks of longpast days over the purposes and methods of our art and my friend wiser than i as he has always been replied with this doubting phrase could we recapture the zest of that old time  i would not like to believe that our faith in the value of imaginative art has diminished that we think it less worth while to struggle for glimpses of truth and for the words which may pass them on to other eyes or that we can no longer discern the star we tried to follow but i do fear with him that half a lifetime of endeavour has dulled the exuberance which kept one up till morning discussing the ways and means of aesthetic achievement we have discovered perhaps with a certain finality that by no talk can a writer add a cubit to his stature or change the temperament which moulds and colours the vision of life he sets before the few who will pause to look at it and sothe rest is silence and what of work we may still do will be done in that dogged muteness which is the lot of advancing years  other times other men and modes but not other truth truth though essentially relative like einsteins theory will never lose its evernew and unique qualityperfect proportion for truth to the human consciousness at least is but that vitally just relation of part to whole which is the very condition of life itself and the task before the imaginative writer whether at the end of the last century or all these aeons later is the presentation of a vision which to eye and ear and mind has the implicit proportions of truth  i confess to have always looked for a certain flavour in the writings of others and craved it for my own believing that all true vision is so coloured by the temperament of the seer as to have not only the just proportions but the essential novelty of a living thing for after all no two living things are alike a work of fiction should carry the hall mark of its author as surely as a goya a daumier a velasquez and a mathew maris should be the unmistakable creations of those masters this is not to speak of tricks and manners which lend themselves to that facile elf the caricaturist but of a certain individual way of seeing and feeling a young poet once said of another and more popular poet oh yes but be cuts no ice and when one came to think of it he did not a certain flabbiness of spirit a lack of temperament an absence perhaps of the ironic or passionate view insubstantiated his work it had no edgejust a felicity which passed for distinction with the crowd  let me not be understood to imply that a novel should be a sort of sandwich in which the authors mood or philosophy is the slice of ham ones demand is for a far more subtle impregnation of flavour just that for instance which makes de maupassant a more poignant and fascinating writer than his master flaubert dickens and thackeray more living and permanent than george eliot or trollope it once fell to my lot to be the preliminary critic of a book on painting designed to prove that the artists sole function was the impersonal elucidation of the truths of nature i was regretfully compelled to observe that there were no such things as the truths of nature for the purposes of art apart from the individual vision of the artist seer and thing seen inextricably involved one with the other form the texture of any masterpiece and i at least demand therefrom a distinct impression of temperament i never saw in the flesh either de maupassant or tchekovthose masters of such different methods entirely devoid of didacticismbut their work leaves on me a strangely potent sense of personality such subtle intermingling of seer with thing seen is the outcome only of long and intricate brooding a process not too favoured by modern life yet without which we achieve little but a fluent chaos of clever insignificant impressions a kind of glorified journalism holding much the same relation to the deeplyimpregnated work of turgenev hardy and conrad as a film bears to a play  speaking for myself with the immodesty required of one who hazards an introduction to his own work i was writing fiction for five years before i could master even its primary technique much less achieve that union of seer with thing seen which perhaps begins to show itself a little in this volumebinding up the scanty harvests of 1899 1900 and 1901especially in the tales a knight and salvation of a forsyte men women trees and works of fictionvery tiny are the seeds from which they spring i used really to see the knightin 1896 was itsitting in the place in front of the casino at monte carlo and because his driedup elegance his burnt straw hat quiet courtesy of attitude and big dog used to fascinate and intrigue me i began to imagine his life so as to answer my own questions and to satisfy i suppose the mood i was in i never spoke to him i never saw him again his real story no doubt was as different from that which i wove around his figure as night from day  as for swithin wild horses will not drag from me confession of where and when i first saw the prototype which became enlarged to his bulky stature i owe swithin much for he first released the satirist in me and is moreover the only one of my characters whom i killed before i gave him life for it is in the man of property that swithin forsyte more memorably lives  ranging beyond this volume i cannot recollect writing the first words of the island phariseesbut it would be about august 1901 like all the stories in villa rubein and indeed most of my tales the book originated in the curiosity philosophic reflections and unphilosophic emotions roused in me by some single figure in real life in this case it was ferrand whose real name of course was not ferrand and who died in some sacred institution many years ago of a consumption brought on by the conditions of his wandering life if not a beloved he was a true vagabond and i first met him in the champs elysees just as in the pigeon he describes his meeting with wellwyn though drawn very much from life he did not in the end turn out very like the ferrand of real lifethe figures of fiction soon diverge from their prototypes  the first draft of the island pharisees was buried in a drawer when retrieved the other day after nineteen years it disclosed a picaresque string of anecdotes told by ferrand in the first person these twothirds of a book were laid to rest by edward garnetts dictum that its author was not sufficiently within ferrands skin and struggling heavily with laziness and pride he started afresh in the skin of shelton three times be wrote that novel and then it was long in finding the eye of sydney pawling who accepted it for heinemanns in 1904 that was a period of ferment and transition with me a kind of long awakening to the home truths of social existence and national character the liquor bubbled too furiously for clear bottling and the book after all became but an introduction to all those following novels which depictsomewhat satiricallythe various sections of english society with a more or less capital s  looking back on the longstretchedout body of ones work it is interesting to mark the endless duel fought within a man between the emotional and critical sides of his nature first one then the other getting the upper hand and too seldom fusing till the result has the mellowness of full achievement one can even tell the nature of ones readers by their preference for the work which reveals more of this side than of that my early work was certainly more emotional than critical but from 1901 came nine years when the critical was in the main holding sway from 1910 to 1918 the emotional again struggled for the upper hand and from that time on there seems to have been something of a dead beat so the conflict goes by what mysterious tides promoted i know not  an author must ever wish to discover a hapless member of the public who never yet having read a word of his writing would submit to the ordeal of reading him right through from beginning to end probably the effect could only be judged through an autopsy but in the remote case of survival it would interest one so profoundly to see the differences if any produced in that readers character or outlook over life this however is a consummation which will remain devoutly to be wished for there is a limit to human complaisance one will never know the exact measure of ones infecting power or whether indeed one is not just a long soporific  a writer they say should not favouritize among his creations but then a writer should not do so many things that he does this writer certainly confesses to having favourites and of his novels so far be likes best the forsyte series the country house fraternity the dark flower and five tales believing these to be the works which most fully achieve fusion of seer with thing seen most subtly disclose the individuality of their author and best reveal such of truth as has been vouchsafed to him john galsworthy     to  my sister blanche lilian sauter     villa rubein     i  walking along the river wall at botzen edmund dawney said to alois harz would you care to know the family at that pink house villa rubein  harz answered with a smile  perhaps  come with me then this afternoon  they had stopped before an old house with a blind deserted look that stood by itself on the wall harz pushed the door open  come in you dont want breakfast yet im going to paint the river today  he ran up the bare broad stairs and dawney followed leisurely his thumbs hooked in the armholes of his waistcoat and his head thrown back  in the attic which filled the whole top story harz had pulled a canvas to the window he was a young man of middle height square shouldered active with an angular face high cheekbones and a strong sharp chin his eyes were piercing and steelblue his eyebrows very flexible nose long and thin with a high bridge and his dark unparted hair fitted him like a cap his clothes looked as if he never gave them a second thought  this room which served for studio bedroom and sittingroom was bare and dusty below the window the river in spring flood rushed down the valley a stream of molten bronze harz dodged before the canvas like a fencer finding his distance dawney took his seat on a packingcase  the snows have gone with a rush this year he drawled the talfer comes down brown the eisack comes down blue they flow into the etsch and make it green a parable of the spring for you my painter  harz mixed his colours  ive no time for parables he said no time for anything if i could be guaranteed to live to ninetynine like titianhe had a chance look at that poor fellow who was killed the other day all that struggle and thenjust at the turn  he spoke english with a foreign accent his voice was rather harsh but his smile very kindly  dawney lit a cigarette  you painters he said are better off than most of us you can strike out your own line now if i choose to treat a case out of the ordinary way and the patient dies im ruined  my dear doctorif i dont paint what the public likes i starve all the same im going to paint in my own way in the end i shall come out on top  it pays to work in the groove my friend until youve made your name after

good time good cigars good wine i hate discomfort no my boy i must work it on the usual lines i dont like it but i must lump it one starts in life with some notion of the idealits gone by the board with me ive got to shove along until ive made my name and then my little manthen  then youll be soft  you pay dearly for that first period  take my chance of that theres no other way  make one  humph  harz poised his brush as though it were a spear  a man must do the best in him if he has to sufferlet him  dawney stretched his large soft body a calculating look had come into his eyes  youre a tough little man he said  ive had to be tough  dawney rose tobacco smoke was wreathed round his unruffled hair  touching villa rubein he said shall i call for you its a mixed household english mostlyvery decent people  no thank you i shall be painting all day havent time to know the sort of people who expect one to change ones clothes  as you like tato and puffing out his chest dawney vanished through a blanket looped across the doorway  harz set a pot of coffee on a spiritlamp and cut himself some bread through the window the freshness of the morning came the scent of sap and blossom and young leaves the scent of earth and the mountains freed from winter the new flights and songs of birds all the odorous enchanted restless spring  there suddenly appeared through the doorway a white roughhaired terrier dog blackmarked about the face with shaggy tan eyebrows he sniffed at harz showed the whites round his eyes and uttered a sharp bark a young voice called  scruff thou naughty dog light footsteps were heard on the stairs from the distance a thin high voice called  greta you mustnt go up there  a little girl of twelve with long fair hair under a widebrimmed hat slipped in  her blue eyes opened wide her face flushed up that face was not regular its cheekbones were rather prominent the nose was flattish there was about it an air innocent reflecting quizzical shy  oh she said  harz smiled goodmorning this your dog  she did not answer but looked at him with soft bewilderment then running to the dog seized him by the collar  scrruff thou naughty dogthe baddest dog the ends of her hair fell about him she looked up at harz who said  not at all let me give him some bread  oh no you must noti will beat himand tell him he is bad then he shall not do such things again now he is sulky he looks so always when he is sulky is this your home  for the present i am a visitor  but i think you are of this country because you speak like it  certainly i am a tyroler  i have to talk english this morning but i do not like it very muchbecause also i am half austrian and i like it best but my sister christian is all english here is miss naylor she shall be very angry with me  and pointing to the entrance with a rosytipped forefinger she again looked ruefully at harz  there came into the room with a walk like the hopping of a bird an elderly small lady in a grey serge dress with narrow bands of claretcoloured velveteen a large gold cross dangled from a steel chain on her chest she nervously twisted her hands clad in black kid gloves rather white about the seams  her hair was prematurely grey her quick eyes brown her mouth twisted at one corner she held her face kindlooking but long and narrow rather to one side and wore on it a look of apology her quick sentences sounded as if she kept them on strings and wanted to draw them back as soon as she had let them forth  greta how can you do such things i dont know what your father would say i am sure i dont know how toso extraordinary  please said harz  you must come at onceso very sorryso awkward they were standing in a ring harz with his eyebrows working up and down the little lady fidgeting her parasol greta flushed and pouting her eyes all dewy twisting an end of fair hair round her finger  oh look the coffee had boiled over little brown streams trickled spluttering from the pan the dog with ears laid back and tail tucked in went scurrying round the room a feeling of fellowship fell on them at once  along the wall is our favourite walk and scruffso awkward so unfortunatewe did not think any one lived herethe shutters are cracked the paint is peeling off so dreadfully have you been long in botzen two months fancy you are not english you are tyrolese but you speak english so wellthere for seven years really so fortunateit is gretas day for english  miss naylors eyes darted bewildered glances at the roof where the crossing of the beams made such deep shadows at the litter of brushes tools knives and colours on a table made out of packingcases at the big window innocent of glass and flush with the floor whence dangled a bit of rusty chainrelic of the time when the place had been a storeloft her eyes were hastily averted from an unfinished figure of the nude  greta with feet crossed sat on a coloured blanket dabbling her finger in a little pool of coffee and gazing up at harz and he thought i should like to paint her like that a forgetmenot  he took out his chalks to make a sketch of her  shall you show me cried out greta scrambling to her feet  will gretawill how often must i tell you i think we should be goingit is very lateyour fatherso very kind of you but i think we should be going scruff miss naylor gave the floor two taps the terrier backed into a plaster cast which came down on his tail and sent him flying through the doorway greta followed swiftly crying  ach poor scrufee  miss naylor crossed the room bowing she murmured an apology and also disappeared  harz was left alone his guests were gone the little girl with the fair hair and the eyes like forgetmenots the little lady with kindly gestures and birdlike walk the terrier he looked round him the room seemed very empty gnawing his moustache he muttered at the fallen cast  then taking up his brush stood before his picture smiling and frowning soon he had forgotten it all in his work     ii  it was early morning four days later and harz was loitering homewards the shadows of the clouds passing across the vines were vanishing over the jumbled roofs and greentopped spires of the town a strong sweet wind was blowing from the mountains there was a stir in the branches of the trees and flakes of the late blossom were drifting down amongst the soft green pods of a kind of poplar chafers buzzed and numbers of their little brown bodies were strewn on the path  he passed a bench where a girl sat sketching a puff of wind whirled her drawing to the ground harz ran to pick it up she took it from him with a bow but as he turned away she tore the sketch across  ah he said why did you do that  this girl who stood with a bit of the torn sketch in either hand was slight and straight and her face earnest and serene she gazed at harz with large clear greenish eyes her lips and chin were defiant her forehead tranquil  i dont like it  will you let me look at it i am a painter  it isnt worth looking at butif you wish  he put the two halves of the sketch together  you see she said at last i told you  harz did not answer still looking at the sketch the girl frowned  harz asked her suddenly  why do you paint  she coloured and said  show me what is wrong  i cannot show you what is wrong there is nothing wrongbut why do you paint  i dont understand  harz shrugged his shoulders  youve no business to do that said the girl in a hurt voice i want to know  your heart is not in it said harz  she looked at him startled her eyes had grown thoughtful  i suppose that is it there are so many other things  there should be nothing else said harz  she broke in i dont want always to be thinking of myself suppose  ah when you begin supposing  the girl confronted him she had torn the sketch again  you mean that if it does not matter enough one had better not do it at all i dont know if you are righti think you are  there was the sound of a nervous cough and harz saw behind him his three visitorsmiss naylor offering him her hand greta flushed with a bunch of wild flowers staring intently in his face and the terrier sniffing at his trousers  miss naylor broke an awkward silence  we wondered if you would still be here christian i am sorry to interrupt youi was not aware that you knew mr herr  harz is my namewe were just talking  about my sketch oh greta you do tickle will you come and have breakfast with us today herr harz its our turn you know  harz glancing at his dusty clothes excused himself  but greta in a pleading voice said oh do come scruff likes you it is so dull when there is nobody for breakfast but ourselves  miss naylors mouth began to twist harz hurriedly broke in  thank you i will come with pleasure you dont mind my being dirty  oh no we do not mind then we shall none of us wash and afterwards i shall show you my rabbits  miss naylor moving from foot to foot like a bird on its perch exclaimed  i hope you wont regret it not a very good mealthe girls are so impulsivesuch informal invitation we shall be very glad  but greta pulled softly at her sisters sleeve and christian gathering her things led the way  harz followed in amazement nothing of this kind had come into his life before he kept shyly glancing at the girls and noting the speculative innocence in gretas eyes he smiled they soon came to two great poplartrees which stood like sentinels one on either side of an unweeded gravel walk leading through lilac bushes to a house painted dull pink with greenshuttered windows and a roof of greenish slate over the door in faded crimson letters were written the words villa rubein  that is to the stables said greta pointing down a path where some pigeons were sunning themselves on a wall uncle nic keeps his horses there countess and cuckoohis horses begin with c because of christhey are quite beautiful he says he could drive them to kingdomcome and they would not turn their hair bow and say goodmorning to our house  harz bowed  father said all strangers should and i think it brings good luck from the doorstep she looked round at harz then ran into the house  a broad thickset man with stiff brushedup hair a short brown bushy beard parted at the chin a fresh complexion and blue glasses across a thick nose came out and called in a bluff voice  ha my good dears kiss me quickprrt how goes it then this morning a good walk hein the sound of many loud rapid kisses followed  ha fraulein good he became aware of harzs figure standing in the doorway und der herr  miss naylor hurriedly explained  good an artist kommen sie herein i am delight you will breakfast i tooyes yes my dearsi too breakfast with you this morning i have the hunters appetite  harz looking at him keenly perceived him to be of middle height and age stout dressed in a loose holland jacket a very white starched shirt and blue silk sash that he looked particularly clean had an air of belonging to society and exhaled a really fine aroma of excellent cigars and the best hairdressers essences  the room they entered was long and rather bare there was a huge map on the wall and below it a pair of globes on crooked supports resembling two inflated frogs erect on their hind legs in one corner was a cottage piano close to a writingtable heaped with books and papers this nook sacred to christian was foreign to the rest of the room which was arranged with supernatural neatness a table was laid for breakfast and the sunwarmed air came in through french windows  the meal went merrily herr paul von morawitz was never in such spirits as at table words streamed from him conversing with harz he talked of art as who should say one does not claim to be a connoisseurpas si betestill one has a little knowledge que diable he recommended him a man in the town who sold cigars that were not so very bad he consumed porridge ate an omelette and bending across to greta gave her a sounding kiss muttering kiss me quickan expression he had picked up in a london musichall long ago and considered chic he asked his daughters plans and held out porridge to the terrier who refused it with a sniff  well he said suddenly looking at miss naylor here is a gentleman who has not even heard our names  the little lady began her introductions in a breathless voice  good herr paul said puffing out his lips now we know each other and brushing up the ends of his moustaches he carried off harz into another room decorated with piperacks prints of dancinggirls spittoons easychairs wellseasoned by cigar smoke french novels and newspapers  the household at villa rubein was indeed of a mixed and curious nature cut on both floors by corridors the villa was divided into four divisions each of which had its separate inhabitants an arrangement which had come about in the following way  when old nicholas treffry died his estate on the boundary of cornwall had been sold and divided up among his three surviving childrennicholas who was much the eldest a partner in the wellknown firm of forsyte and treffry teamen of the strand constance married to a man called decie and margaret at her fathers death engaged to the curate of the parish john devorell who shortly afterwards became its rector by his marriage with margaret treffry the rector had one child called christian soon after this he came into some property and died leaving it unfettered to his widow three years went by and when the child was six years old mrs devorell still young and pretty came to live in london with her brother nicholas it was there that she met paul von morawitzthe last of an old czech family who had lived for many hundred years on their estates near budweiss paul had been left an orphan at the age of ten and without a solitary ancestral acre instead of acres he inherited the faith that nothing was too good for a von morawitz in later years his savoir faire enabled him to laugh at faith but it stayed quietly with him all the same the absence of acres was of no great consequence for through his mother the daughter of a banker in vienna he came into a wellnursed fortune it befitted a von morawitz that he should go into the cavalry but unshaped for soldiering he soon left the service some said he had a difference with his colonel over the quality of food provided during some manoeuvres others that he had retired because his chargers did not fit his legs which were indeed rather round  he had an admirable appetite for pleasure a manabouttowns life suited him he went his genial unreflecting costly way in vienna paris london he loved exclusively those towns and boasted that he was as much at home in one as in another he combined exuberant vitality with fastidiousness of palate and devoted both to the acquisition of a special taste in women weeds and wines above all he was blessed with a remarkable digestion he was thirty when he met mrs devorell and she married him because he was so very different from anybody she had ever seen people more dissimilar were never mated to paulaccustomed to stage doorsfreshness serene tranquillity and obvious purity were the baits he had run through more than half his fortune too and the fact that she had money was possibly not overlooked be that as it may he was fond of her his heart was soft he developed a domestic side  greta was born to them after a year of marriage the instinct of the freeman was however not dead in paul he became a gambler he lost the remainder of his fortune without being greatly disturbed when he began to lose his wifes fortune too things naturally became more difficult not too much remained when nicholas treffry stepped in and caused his sister to settle what was left on her daughters after providing a lifeinterest for herself and paul losing his supplies the good man had given up his cards but the instinct of the freeman was still living in his breast he took to drink he was never grossly drunk and rarely very sober his wife sorrowed over this new passion her health already much enfeebled soon broke down the doctors sent her to the tyrol she seemed to benefit by this and settled down at botzen the following year when greta was just ten she died it was a shock to paul he gave up excessive drinking became a constant smoker and lent full rein to his natural domesticity he was fond of both the girls but did not at all understand them greta his own daughter was his favourite villa rubein remained their home it was cheap and roomy money since paul became housekeeper to himself was scarce  about this time mrs decie his wifes sister whose husband had died in the east returned to england paul invited her to come and live with them she had her own rooms her own servant the arrangement suited paulit was economically sound and there was some one always there to take care of the girls in truth he began to feel the instinct of the freeman rising again within him it was pleasant to run over to vienna now and then to play piquet at a club in gries of which he was the shining light in a word to go on the tiles a little one could not always mourneven if a woman were an angel moreover his digestion was as good as ever  the fourth quarter of this villa was occupied by nicholas treffry whose annual sojourn out of england perpetually surprised himself between him and his young niece christian there existed however a rare sympathy one of those affections between the young and old which mysteriously born like everything in life seems the only end and aim to both till another feeling comes into the younger heart  since a long and dangerous illness he had been ordered to avoid the english winter and at the commencement of each spring he would appear at botzen driving his own horses by easy stages from the italian riviera where he spent the coldest months he always stayed till june before going back to his london club and during all that time he let no day pass without growling at foreigners their habits food drink and raiment with a kind of big dogs growling that did nobody any harm the illness had broken him very much he was seventy but looked more he had a servant a luganese named dominique devoted to him nicholas treffry had found him overworked in an hotel and had engaged him with the caution lookhere dominique i swear to which dominique dark of feature saturnine and ironical had only replied tres biens msieur     iii  harz and his host sat in leather chairs herr pauls square back was wedged into a cushion his round legs crossed both were smoking and they eyed each other furtively as men of different stamp do when first thrown together the young artist found his host extremely new and disconcerting in his presence he felt both shy and awkward herr paul on the other hand very much at ease was thinking indolently  goodlooking young fellowcomes of the people i expect not at all the manner of the world wonder what he talks about  presently noticing that harz was looking at a photograph he said ah yes that was a woman they are not to be found in these days she could dance the little coralie did you ever see such arms confess that she is beautiful hein  she has individuality said harz a fine type  herr paul blew out a cloud of smoke  yes he murmured she was fine all over he had dropped his eyeglasses and his full brown eyes with little crowsfeet at the corners wandered from his visitor to his cigar  hed be like a satyr if he wasnt too clean thought harz put vine leaves in his hair paint him asleep with his hands crossed so  when i am told a person has individuality herr paul was saying in a rich and husky voice i generally expect boots that bulge an umbrella of improper colour i expect a creature of bad form as they say in england who will shave some days and some days will not shave who sometimes smells of indiarubber and sometimes does not smell which is discouraging  you do not approve of individuality said harz shortly  not if it means doing and thinking as those who know better do not do or think  and who are those who know better  ah my dear you are asking me a riddle well thensociety men of birth men of recognised position men above eccentricity in a word of reputation  harz looked at him fixedly men who havent the courage of their own ideas not even the courage to smell of indiarubber men who have no desires and so can spend all their time making themselves flat  herr paul drew out a red silk handkerchief and wiped his beard i assure you my dear he said it is easier to be flat it is more respectable to be flat himmel why not then be flat  like any common fellow  certes like any common fellowlike me par exemple herr paul waved his hand when he exercised unusual tact he always made use of a french expression  harz flushed herr paul followed up his victory come come he said pass me my men of repute que diable we are not anarchists  are you sure said harz  herr paul twisted his moustache i beg your pardon he said slowly but at this moment the door was opened a rumbling voice remarked morning paul whos your visitor harz saw a tall bulky figure in the doorway  come in called out herr paul let me present to you a new acquaintance an artist herr harzmr nicholas treffry psumm bumm all this introducing is dry work and going to the sideboard he poured out three glasses of a light foaming beer  mr treffry waved it from him not for me he said wish i could they wont let me look at it and walking over to the window with a heavy tread which trembled like his voice he sat down there was something in his gait like the movements of an elephants hind legs he was very tall it was said with the customary exaggeration of family tradition that there never had been a male treffry under six feet in height but now he stooped and had grown stout there was something at once vast and unobtrusive about his personality  he wore a loose brown velvet jacket and waistcoat cut to show a soft frilled shirt and narrow black ribbon tie a thin gold chain was looped round his neck and fastened to his fob his heavy cheeks had folds in them like those in a bloodhounds face he wore big drooping yellowgrey moustaches which he had a habit of sucking and a goatee beard he had long loose ears that might almost have been said to gap on his head there was a soft black hat large in the brim and low in the crown his grey eyes heavylidded twinkled under their bushy brows with a queer kind cynicism as a young man he had sown many a wild oat but he had also worked and made money in business he had in fact burned the candle at both ends but he had never been unready to do his fellows a good turn he had a passion for driving and his reckless method of pursuing this art had caused him to be nicknamed the notorious treffry  once when he was driving tandem down a hill with a loose rein the friend beside him had said for all the good youre doing with those reins treffry you might as well throw them on the horses necks  just so treffry had answered at the bottom of the hill they had gone over a wall into a potato patch treffry had broken several ribs his friend had gone unharmed  he was a great sufferer now but constitutionally averse to being pitied he had a disconcerting way of humming and this together with the shake in his voice and his frequent use of peculiar phrases made the understanding of his speech depend at times on intuition rather than intelligence  the clock began to strike eleven harz muttered an excuse shook hands with his host and bowing to his new acquaintance went away he caught a glimpse of gretas face against the window and waved his hand to her in the road he came on dawney who was turning in between the poplars with thumbs as usual hooked in the armholes of his waistcoat  hallo the latter said  doctor harz answered slyly the fates outwitted me it seems  serve you right said dawney for your confounded egoism wait here till i come out i shant be many minutes  but harz went on his way a cart drawn by creamcoloured oxen was passing slowly towards the bridge in front of the brushwood piled on it two peasant girls were sitting with their feet on a mat of grassthe picture of contentment  im wasting my time he thought ive done next to nothing in two months better get back to london that girl will never make a painter she would never make a painter but there was something in her that he could not dismiss so rapidly she was not exactly beautiful but she was sympathetic the brow was pleasing with darkbrown hair softly turned back and eyes so straight and shining the two sisters were very different the little one was innocent yet mysterious the elder seemed as clear as crystal  he had entered the town where the arcaded streets exuded their peculiar pungent smell of cows and leather woodsmoke winecasks and drains the sound of rapid wheels over the stones made him turn his head a carriage drawn by redroan horses was passing at a great pace people stared at it standing still and looking alarmed it swung from side to side and vanished round a corner harz saw mr nicholas treffry in a long whitish dustcoat his italian servant perched behind was holding to the seatrail with a nervous grin on his dark face  certainly harz thought theres no getting away from these people this morningthey are everywhere  in his studio he began to sort his sketches wash his brushes and drag out things he had accumulated during his two months stay he even began to fold his blanket door but suddenly he stopped those two girls why not try what a picture the two heads the sky and leaves begin tomorrow against that windowno better at the villa call the picturespring     iv  the wind stirring among trees and bushes flung the young leaves skywards the trembling of their silver linings was like the joyful flutter of a heart at good news it was one of those spring mornings when everything seems full of a sweet restlessnesssoft clouds chasing fast across the sky soft scents floating forth and dying the notes of birds now shrill and sweet now hushed in silences all nature striving for something nothing at peace  villa rubein withstood the influence of the day and wore its usual look of rest and isolation harz sent in his card and asked to see der herr the servant a greyeyed cleverlooking swiss with no hair on his face came back saying  der herr mein herr is in the garden gone harz followed him  herr paul a small white flannel cap on his head gloves on his hands and glasses on his nose was watering a rosebush and humming the serenade from faust  this aspect of the house was very different from the other the sun fell on it and over a veranda creepers clung and scrambled in long scrolls there was a lawn with freshly mown grass flowerbeds were laid out and at the end of an avenue of young acacias stood an arbour covered with wisteria  in the east mountain peaksfingers of snowglittered above the mist a grave simplicity lay on that scene on the roofs and spires the valleys and the dreamy hillsides with their yellow scars and purple bloom and white cascades like tails of grey horses swishing in the wind  herr paul held out his hand what can we do for you he said  i have to beg a favour replied harz i wish to paint your daughters i will bring the canvas herethey shall have no trouble i would paint them in the garden when they have nothing else to do  herr paul looked at him dubiouslyever since the previous day he had been thinking queer bird that painterthinks himself the devil of a swell looks a determined fellow too nowstaring in the painters faceit seemed to him on the whole best if some one else refused this permission  with all the pleasure my dear sir he said come let us ask these two young ladies and putting down his hose he led the way towards the arbour thinking youll be disappointed my young conqueror or im mistaken  miss naylor and the girls were sitting in the shade reading la fontaines fables greta with one eye on her governess was stealthily cutting a pig out of orange peel  ah my dear dears began herr paul who in the presence of miss naylor always paraded his english here is our friend who has a very flattering request to make he would paint you yesboth together alfresco in the air in the sunshine with the birds the little birds  greta gazing at harz gushed deep pink and furtively showed him her pig  christian said paint us oh no  she saw harz looking at her and added slowly if you really wish it i suppose we could then dropped her eyes  ah said herr paul raising his brows till his glasses fell from his nose and what says gretchen does she want to be handed up to posterities a little peacock along with the other little birds  greta who had continued staring at the painter said ofcourseiwanttobe  prrt said herr paul looking at miss naylor the little lady indeed opened her mouth wide but all that came forth was a tiny squeak as sometimes happens when one is anxious to say something and has not arranged beforehand what it shall be  the affair seemed ended harz heaved a sigh of satisfaction but herr paul had still a card to play  there is your aunt he said there are things to be consideredone must certainly inquireso we shall see kissing greta loudly on both cheeks he went towards the house  what makes you want to paint us christian asked as soon as he was gone  i think it very wrong miss naylor blurted out  why said harz frowning  greta is so youngthere are lessonsit is such a waste of time  his eyebrows twitched ah you think so  i dont see why it is a waste of time said christian quietly there are lots of hours when we sit here and do nothing  and it is very dull put in greta with a pout  you are rude greta said miss naylor in a little rage pursing her lips and taking up her knitting  i think it seems always rude to speak the truth said greta miss naylor looked at her in that concentrated manner with which she was in the habit of expressing displeasure  but at this moment a servant came and said that mrs decie would be glad to see herr harz the painter made them a stiff bow and followed the servant to the house miss naylor and the two girls watched his progress with apprehensive eyes it was clear that he had been offended  crossing the veranda and passing through an open window hung with silk curtains hart entered a cool dark room this was mrs decies sanctum where she conducted correspondence received her visitors read the latest literature and sometimes when she had bad headaches lay for hours on the sofa with a fan and her eyes closed there was a scent of sandalwood a suggestion of the east a kind of mystery in here as if things like chairs and tables were not really what they seemed but something much less commonplace  the visitor looked twice to be quite sure of anything there were many plants bead curtains and a deal of silverwork and china  mrs decie came forward in the slightly rustling silk whichwhether in or out of fashionalways accompanied her a tall woman over fifty she moved as if she had been tied together at the knees her face was long with broad brows from which her sandygrey hair was severely waved back she had pale eyes and a perpetual pale enigmatic smile her complexion had been ruined by long residence in india and might unkindly have been called fawncoloured she came close to harz keeping her eyes on his with her head bent slightly forward  we are so pleased to know you she said speaking in a voice which had lost all ring it is charming to find some one in these parts who can help us to remember that there is such a thing as art we had mr chere last autumn such a charming fellow he was so interested in the native customs and dresses you are a subject painter too i think wont you sit down  she went on for some time introducing painters names asking questions skating round the edge of what was personal and the young man stood before her with a curious little smile fixed on his lips she wants to know whether im worth powder and shot he thought  you wish to paint my nieces mrs decie said at last leaning back on her settee  i wish to have that honour harz answered with a bow  and what sort of picture did you think of  that said harz is in the future i couldnt tell you and he thought will she ask me if i get my tints in paris like the woman tramper told me of  the perpetual pale smile on mrs decies face seemed to invite his confidence yet to warn him that his words would be sucked in somewhere behind those broad fine brows and carefully sorted mrs decie indeed was thinking interesting young man regular bohemianno harm in that at his age something napoleonic in his face probably has no dress clothes yes should like to see more of him she had a fine eye for points of celebrity his name was unfamiliar would probably have been scouted by that famous artist mr c but she felt her instinct urging her on to know him she was to do her justice one of those lion finders who seek the animal for pleasure not for the glory it brings them she had the courage of her instinctslionentities were indispensable to her but she trusted to divination to secure them nobody could foist a lion on her  it will be very nice you will stay and have some lunch the arrangements here are rather odd such a mixed householdbut there is always lunch at two oclock for any one who likes and we all dine at seven you would have your sittings in the afternoons perhaps i should so like to see your sketches you are using the old house on the wall for studio that is so original of you  harz would not stay to lunch but asked if he might begin work that afternoon he left a little suffocated by the sandalwood and sympathy of this sphinxlike woman  walking home along the river wall with the singing of the larks and thrushes the rush of waters the humming of the chafers in his ears he felt that he would make something fine of this subject before his eyes the faces of the two girls continually started up framed by the sky with young leaves guttering against their cheeks      v  three days had passed since harz began his picture when early in the morning greta came from villa rubein along the river dyke and sat down on a bench from which the old house on the wall was visible she had not been there long before harz came out  i did not knock said greta because you would not have heard and it is so early so i have been waiting for you a quarter of an hour  selecting a rosebud from some flowers in her hand she handed it to him that is my first rosebud this year she said it is for you because you are painting me today i am thirteen herr harz there is not to be a sitting because it is my birthday but instead we are all going to meran to see the play of andreas hofer you are to come too please i am here to tell you and the others shall be here directly  harz bowed and who are the others  christian and dr edmund miss naylor and cousin teresa her husband is ill so she is sad but today she is going to forget that it is not good to be always sad is it herr harz  he laughed you could not be  greta answered gravely oh yes i could i too am often sad you are making fun you are not to make fun today because it is my birthday do you think growing up is nice herr harz  no fraulein greta it is better to have all the time before you  they walked on side by side  i think said greta you are very much afraid of losing time chris says that time is nothing  time is everything responded harz  she says that time is nothing and thought is everything greta murmured rubbing a rose against her cheek but i think you cannot have a thought unless you have the time to think it in there are the others look  a cluster of sunshades on the bridge glowed for a moment and was lost in shadow  come said harz lets join them  at meran under schloss tirol people were streaming across the meadows into the open theatre here were tall fellows in mountain dress with leather breeches bare knees and hats with eagles feathers here were fruitsellers burghers and their wives mountebanks actors and every kind of visitor the audience packed into an enclosure of high boards sweltered under the burning sun cousin teresa tall and thin with hard red cheeks shaded her pleasant eyes with her hand  the play began it depicted the rising in the tyrol of 1809 the village life dances and yodelling murmurings and exhortations the warning beat of drums then the gathering with flintlocks pitchforks knives the battle and victory the homecoming and festival then the second gathering the roar of cannon betrayal capture death the impassive figure of the patriot andreas hofer always in front blackbearded leatherngirdled under the blue sky against a screen of mountains  harz and christian sat behind the others he seemed so intent on the play that she did not speak but watched his face rigid with a kind of cold excitement he seemed to be transported by the life passing before them something of his feeling seized on her when the play was over she too was trembling in pushing their way out they became separated from the others  theres a short cut to the station here said christian lets go this way  the path rose a little a narrow stream crept alongside the meadow and the hedge was spangled with wild roses christian kept glancing shyly at the painter since their meeting on the river wall her thoughts had never been at rest this stranger with his keen face insistent eyes and ceaseless energy had roused a strange feeling in her his words had put shape to something in her not yet expressed she stood aside at a stile to make way for some peasant boys dusty and roughhaired who sang and whistled as they went by  i was like those boys once said harz  christian turned to him quickly ah that was why you felt the play so much  its my country up there i was born amongst the mountains i looked after the cows and slept in haycocks and cut the trees in winter they used to call me a black sheep a loafer in my village  why  ah why i worked as hard as any of them but i wanted to get away do you think i could have stayed there all my life  christians eyes grew eager  if people dont understand what it is you want to do they always call you a loafer muttered harz  but you did what you meant to do in spite of them christian said  for herself it was so hard to finish or decide when in the old days she told greta stories the latter whose instinct was always for the definite would say and what came at the end chris do finish it this morning but christian never could her thoughts were deep vague dreamy invaded by both sides of every question whatever she did her needlework her versemaking her painting all had its charm but it was not always what it was intended for at the beginning nicholas treffry had once said of her when chris starts out to make a hat it may turn out an altarcloth but you may bet it wont be a hat it was her instinct to look for what things meant and this took more than all her time she knew herself better than most girls of nineteen but it was her reason that had informed her not her feelings in her sheltered life her heart had never been ruffled except by rare fits of passiontantrums old nicholas treffry dubbed themat what seemed to her mean or unjust  if i were a man she said and going to be great i should have wanted to begin at the very bottom as you did  yes said harz quickly one should be able to feel everything  she did not notice how simply he assumed that he was going to be great he went on a smile twisting his mouth unpleasantly beneath its dark moustachenot many people think like you its a crime not to have been born a gentleman  thats a sneer said christian i didnt think you would have sneered  it is true what is the use of pretending that it isnt  it may be true but it is finer not to say it  by heavens said harz striking one hand into the other if more truth were spoken there would not be so many shams  christian looked down at him from her seat on the stile  you are right all the same fraulein christian he added suddenly thats a very little business work is what matters and trying to see the beauty in the world  christians face changed she understood well enough this craving after beauty slipping down from the stile she drew a slow deep breath  yes she said neither spoke for some time then harz said shyly  if you and fraulein greta would ever like to come and see my studio i should be so happy i would try and clean it up for you  i should like to come i could learn something i want to learn  they were both silent till the path joined the road  we must be in front of the others its nice to be in frontlets dawdle i forgotyou never dawdle herr harz  after a big fit of work i can dawdle against any one then i get another fit of workits like appetite  im always dawdling answered christian  by the roadside a peasant woman screwed up her sundried face saying in a low voice please gracious lady help me to lift this basket  christian stooped but before she could raise it harz hoisted it up on his back  all right he nodded this good lady doesnt mind  the woman looking very much ashamed walked along by christian she kept rubbing her brown hands together and saying gracious lady i would not have wished it is heavy but i would not have wished  im sure hed rather carry it said christian  they had not gone far along the road however before the others passed them in a carriage and at the strange sight miss naylor could be seen pursing her lips cousin teresa nodding pleasantly a smile on dawneys face and beside him greta very demure harz began to laugh  what are you laughing at asked christian  you english are so funny you mustnt do this here you mustnt do that there its like sitting in a field of nettles if i were to walk with you without my coat that little lady would fall off her seat his laugh infected christian they reached the station feeling that they knew each other better  the sun had dipped behind the mountains when the little train steamed down the valley all were subdued and greta with a nodding head slept fitfully christian in her corner was looking out of the window and harz kept studying her profile  he tried to see her eyes he had remarked indeed that whatever their expression the brows arched and rather wide apart gave them a peculiar look of understanding he thought of his picture there was nothing in her face to seize on it was too sympathetic too much like light yet her chin was firm almost obstinate  the train stopped with a jerk she looked round at him it was as though she had said you are my friend  at villa rubein herr paul had killed the fatted calf for gretas fest when the whole party were assembled he alone remained standing and waving his arm above the cloth cried my dears your happiness there are good things herecome and with a sly look the air of a conjurer producing rabbits he whipped the cover off the soup tureen  soupturtle fat green fat he smacked his lips  no servants were allowed because as greta said to harz  it is that we are to be glad this evening  geniality radiated from herr pauls countenance mellow as a bowl of wine he toasted everybody exhorting them to pleasure  harz passed a cracker secretly behind gretas head and miss naylor moved by a mysterious impulse pulled it with a sort of gleeful horror it exploded and greta sprang off her chair scruff seeing this appeared suddenly on the sideboard with his forelegs in a plate of soup without moving them he turned his head and appeared to accuse the company of his false position it was the signal for shrieks of laughter scruff made no attempt to free his forelegs but sniffed the soup and finding that nothing happened began to lap it  take him out oh take him out wailed greta he shall be ill  allons mon cher cried herr paul cest magnifique mais vous savez ce nest guere la guerre scruff with a wild spring leaped past him to the ground  ah cried miss naylor the carpet fresh moans of mirth shook the table for having tasted the wine of laughter all wanted as much more as they could get when scruff and his traces were effaced herr paul took a ladle in his hand  i have a toast he said waving it for silence a toast we will drink all together from our hearts the toast of my little daughter who today has thirteen years become and there is also in our hearts he continued putting down the ladle and suddenly becoming grave the thought of one who is not today with us to see this joyful occasion to her too in this our happiness we turn our hearts and glasses because it is her joy that we should yet be joyful i drink to my little daughter may god her shadow bless  all stood up clinking their glasses and drank then in the hush that followed greta according to custom began to sing a german carol at the end of the fourth line she stopped abashed  heir paul blew his nose loudly and taking up a cap that had fallen from a cracker put it on  every one followed his example miss naylor attaining the distinction of a pair of donkeys ears which she wore after another glass of wine with an air of sacrificing to the public good  at the end of supper came the moment for the offering of gifts herr paul had tied a handkerchief over gretas eyes and one by one they brought her presents greta under forfeit of a kiss was bound to tell the giver by the feel of the gift her swift supple little hands explored noiselessly and in every case she guessed right  dawneys present a kitten made a scene by clawing at her hair  that is dr edmunds she cried at once christian saw that harz had disappeared but suddenly he came back breathless and took his place at the end of the rank of givers  advancing on tiptoe he put his present into gretas hands it was a small bronze copy of a donatello statue  oh herr harz cried greta i saw it in the studio that day it stood on the table and it is lovely  mrs decie thrusting her pale eyes close to it murmured charming  mr treffry took it in his forgers  rum little toad cost a pot of money i expect he eyed harz doubtfully  they went into the next room now and herr paul taking gretas bandage transferred it to his own eyes  take caretake care all he cried i am a devil of a catcher and feeling the air cautiously he moved forward like a bear about to hug he caught no one christian and greta whisked under his arms and left him grasping at the air mrs decie slipped past with astonishing agility mr treffry smoking his cigar and barricaded in a corner jeered bravo paul the active beggar cant he run go it greta  at last herr paul caught cousin teresa who fattened against the wall lost her head and stood uttering tiny shrieks  suddenly mrs decie started playing the blue danube herr paul dropped the handkerchief twisted his moustache up fiercely glared round the room and seizing greta by the waist began dancing furiously bobbing up and down like a cork in lumpy water cousin teresa followed suit with miss naylor both very solemn and dancing quite different steps harz went up to christian  i cant dance he said that is i have only danced once butif you would try with me  she put her hand on his arm and they began she danced light as a feather eyes shining feet flying her body bent a little forward it was not a great success at first but as soon as the time had got into harzs feet they went swinging on when all the rest had stopped sometimes one couple or another slipped through the window to dance on the veranda and came whirling in again the lamplight glowed on the girls white dresses on herr pauls perspiring face he constituted in himself a perfect orgy and when the music stopped flung himself full length on the sofa gasping out  my god but my god  suddenly christian felt harz cling to her arm  glowing and panting she looked at him  giddy he murmured i dance so badly but ill soon learn  greta clapped her hands every evening we will dance every evening we will dance  harz looked at christian the colour had deepened in her face  ill show you how they dance in my village feet upon the ceiling and running to dawney he said  hold me here lift meso now ontwo he tried to swing his feet above his head but with an ouch from dawney they collapsed and sat abruptly on the floor this untimely event brought the evening to an end dawney left escorting cousin teresa and harz strode home humming the blue danube still feeling christians waist against his arm  in their room the two girls sat long at the window to cool themselves before undressing  ah sighed greta this is the happiest birthday i have had  cristian too thought i have never been so happy in my life as i have been today i should like every day to be like this and she leant out into the night to let the air cool her cheeks     vi  chris said greta some days after this miss naylor danced last evening i think she shall have a headache today there is my french and my history this morning  well i can take them  that is nice then we can talk i am sorry about the headache i shall give her some of my eau de cologne  miss naylors headaches after dancing were things on which to calculate the girls carried their books into the arbour it was a showery day and they had to run for shelter through the raindrops and sunlight  the french first chris greta liked her french in which she was not far inferior to christian the lesson therefore proceeded in an admirable fashion after one hour exactly by her watch mr treffrys birthday present loved and admired at least once every hour greta rose  chris i have not fed my rabbits  be quick theres not much time for history  greta vanished christian watched the bright water dripping from the roof her lips were parted in a smile she was thinking of something harz had said the night before a discussion having been started as to whether average opinion did or did not safeguard society harz after sitting silent had burst out i think one man in earnest is better than twenty halfhearted men who follow tamely in the end he does society most good  dawney had answered if you had your way there would be no society  i hate society because it lives upon the weak  bah herr paul chimed in the weak goes to the wall that is as certain as that you and i are here  let them fall against the wall cried harz dont push them there  greta reappeared walking pensively in the rain  bino she said sighing has eaten too much i remember now i did feed them before must we do the history chris  of course  greta opened her book and put a finger in the page herr harz is very kind to me she said yesterday he brought a bird which had come into his studio with a hurt wing he brought it very gently in his handkerchiefhe is very kind the bird was not even frightened of him you did not know about that chris  chris flushed a little and said in a hurt voice  i dont see what it has todo with me  no assented greta  christians colour deepened go on with your history greta  only pursued greta that he always tells you all about things chris  he doesnt how can you say that  i think he does and it is because you do not make him angry it is very easy to make him angry you have only to think differently and he shall be angry at once  you are a little cat said christian it isnt true at all he hates shams and cant bear meanness and it is mean to cover up dislikes and pretend that you agree with people  papa says that he thinks too much about himself  father began christian hotly biting her lips she stopped and turned her wrathful eyes on greta  you do not always show your dislikes chris  i what has that to do with it because one is a coward that doesnt make it any better does it  i think that he has a great many dislikes murmured greta  i wish you would attend to your own faults and not pry into other peoples and pushing the book aside christian gazed in front of her  some minutes passed then greta leaning over rubbed a cheek against her shoulder  i am very sorry chrisi only wanted to be talking shall i read some history  yes said christian coldly  are you angry with me chris  there was no answer the lingering raindrops pattered down on the roof greta pulled at her sisters sleeve  look chris she said there is herr harz  christian looked up dropped her eyes again and said will you go on with the history greta  greta sighed  yes i willbut oh chris there is the luncheon gong and she meekly closed the book  during the following weeks there was a sitting nearly every afternoon miss naylor usually attended them the little lady was to a certain extent carried past objection she had begun to take an interest in the picture and to watch the process out of the corner of her eye in the depths of her dear mind however she never quite got used to the vanity and waste of time her lips would move and her knittingneedles click in suppressed remonstrances  what harz did fast he did best if he had leisure he saw too much loving his work so passionately that he could never tell exactly when to stop he hated to lay things aside always thinking i can get it better greta was finished but with christian try as he would he was not satisfied from day to day her face seemed to him to change as if her soul were growing  there were things too in her eyes that he could neither read nor reproduce  dawney would often stroll out to them after his daily visit and lying on the grass his arms crossed behind his head and a big cigar between his lips would gently banter everybody tea came at five oclock and then mrs decie appeared armed with a magazine or novel for she was proud of her literary knowledge the sitting was suspended harz with a cigarette would move between the table and the picture drinking his tea putting a touch in here and there he never sat down till it was all over for the day during these rests there was talk usually ending in discussion mrs decie was happiest in conversations of a literary order making frequent use of such expressions as after all it produces an illusiondoes anything else matter rather a poseur is he not a question that of temperament or a matter of the definition of words and other charming generalities which sound well and seem to go far and are pleasingly irrefutable sometimes the discussion turned on arton points of colour or technique whether realism was quite justified and should we be preraphaelites when these discussions started christians eyes would grow bigger and clearer with a sort of shining reasonableness as though they were trying to see into the depths and harz would stare at them but the look in those eyes eluded him as if they had no more meaning than mrs decies which with their pale watchful smile always seemed saying come let us take a little intellectual exercise  greta pulling scruffs ears would gaze up at the speakers when the talk was over she always shook herself but if no one came to the sittings there would sometimes be very earnest quick talk sometimes long silences  one day christian said what is your religion  harz finished the touch he was putting on the canvas before he answered roman catholic i suppose i was baptised in that church  i didnt mean that do you believe in a future life  christian murmured greta who was plaiting blades of grass shall always want to know what people think about a future life that is so funny  how can i tell said harz ive never really thought of itnever had the time  how can you help thinking christian said i have toit seems to me so awful that we might come to an end  she closed her book and it slipped off her lap she went on there must be a future life were so incomplete whats the good of your work for instance whats the use of developing if you have to stop  i dont know answered harz i dont much care all i know is ive got to work  but why  for happinessthe real happiness is fightingthe rest is nothing if you have finished a thing does it ever satisfy you you look forward to the next thing at once to wait is wretched  christian clasped her hands behind her neck sunlight flickered through the leaves on to the bosom of her dress  ah stay like that cried harz  she let her eyes rest on his face swinging her foot a little  you work because you must but thats not enough why do you feel you must i want to know whats behind when i was travelling with aunt constance the winter before last we often talkedive heard her discuss it with her friends she says we move in circles till we reach nirvana but last winter i found i couldnt talk to her it seemed as if she never really meant anything then i started readingkant and hegel  ah put in harz if they would teach me to draw better or to see a new colour in a flower or an expression in a face i would read them all  christian leaned forward it must be right to get as near truth as possible every step gained is something you believe in truth truth is the same as beautythat was what you saidyou try to paint the truth you always see the beauty but how can we know truth unless we know what is at the root of it  ithink murmured greta sotto voce you see one wayand he sees anotherbecauseyou are not one person  of course said christian impatiently but why  a sound of humming interrupted her  nicholas treffry was coming from the house holding the times in one hand and a huge meerschaum pipe in the other  aha he said to harz how goes the picture and he lowered himself into a chair  better today uncle said christian softly  mr treffry growled confounded humbugs doctors he said your father used to swear by them why his doctor killed himmade him drink such a lot of stuff  why then do you have a doctor uncle nic asked greta  mr treffry looked at her his eyes twinkled i dont know my dear if they get half a chance they wont let go of you  there had been a gentle breeze all day but now it had died away not a leaf quivered not a blade of grass was stirring from the house were heard faint sounds as of some one playing on a pipe a blackbird came hopping down the path  when you were a boy did you go after birds nests uncle nic greta whispered  i believe you greta the blackbird hopped into the shrubbery  you frightened him uncle nic papa says that at schloss konig where he lived when he was young he would always be after jackdaws nests  gammon greta your father never took a jackdaws nest his legs are much too round  are you fond of birds uncle nic  ask me another greta well i spose so  then why did you go birdnesting i think it is cruel  mr treffry coughed behind his paper there you have me greta he remarked  harz began to gather his brushes thank you he said thats all i can do today  can i look mr treffry inquired  certainly  uncle nic got up slowly and stood in front of the picture when its for sale he said at last ill buy it  harz bowed but for some reason he felt annoyed as if he had been asked to part with something personal  i thank you he said a gong sounded  youll stay and have a snack with us said mr treffry the doctors stopping gathering up his paper he moved off to the house with his hand on gretas shoulder the terrier running in front harz and christian were left alone he was scraping his palette and she was sitting with her elbows resting on her knees between them a gleam of sunlight dyed the path golden it was evening already the bushes and the flowers after the days heat were breathing out perfume the birds had started their evensong  are you tired of sitting for your portrait fraulein christian  christian shook her head  i shall get something into it that everybody does not seesomething behind the surface that will last  christian said slowly thats like a challenge you were right when you said fighting is happinessfor yourself but not for me im a coward i hate to hurt people i like them to like me if you had to do anything that would make them hate you you would do it all the same if it helped your work thats fineits what i cant do itsits everything do you like uncle nic  the young painter looked towards the house where under the veranda old nicholas treffry was still in sight a smile came on his lips  if i were the finest painter in the world he wouldnt think anything of me for it im afraid but if i could show him handfuls of big cheques for bad pictures i had painted he would respect me  she smiled and said i love him  then i shall like him harz answered simply  she put her hand out and her fingers met his we shall be late she said glowing and catching up her book im always late     vii  there was one other guest at dinner a wellgroomed person with pale fattish face dark eyes and hair thin on the temples whose clothes had a military cut he looked like a man fond of ease who had gone out of his groove and collided with life herr paul introduced him as count mario sarelli  two hanging lamps with crimson shades threw a rosy light over the table where in the centre stood a silver basket full of irises through the open windows the garden was all clusters of black foliage in the dying light moths fluttered round the lamps greta following them with her eyes gave quite audible sighs of pleasure when they escaped both girls wore white and harz who sat opposite christian kept looking at her and wondering why he had not painted her in that dress  mrs decie understood the art of diningthe dinner ordered by herr paul was admirable the servants silent as their shadows there was always a hum of conversation  sarelli who sat on her right hand seemed to partake of little except olives which he dipped into a glass of sherry he turned his black solemn eyes silently from face to face now and then asking the meaning of an english word after a discussion on modern rome it was debated whether or no a criminal could be told by the expression of his face  crime said mrs decie passing her hand across her browcrime is but the hallmark of strong individuality  miss naylor gushing rather pink stammered a great crime must show itselfa murder why of course  if that were so said dawney we should only have to look about usno more detectives  miss naylor rejoined with slight severity i cannot conceive that such a thing can pass the human face by leaving no impression  harz said abruptly there are worse things than murder  ah par exemple said sarelli  there was a slight stir all round the table  verry good cried out herr paul a vot sante cher  miss naylor shivered as if some one had put a penny down her back and mrs decie leaning towards harz smiled like one who has made a pet dog do a trick christian alone was motionless looking thoughtfully at harz  i saw a man tried for murder once he said a murder for revenge i watched the judge and i thought all the time id rather be that murderer than you ive never seen a meaner face you crawl through life youre not a criminal simply because you havent the courage  in the dubious silence following the painters speech mr treffry could distinctly be heard humming then sarelli said what do you say to anarchists who are not men but savage beasts whom i would tear to pieces  as to that harz answered defiantly it maybe wise to hang them but then there are so many other men that it would be wise to hang  how can we tell what they went through what their lives were murmured christian  miss naylor who had been rolling a pellet of bread concealed it hastily they arealways given a chance torepenti believe she said  for what they are about to receive drawled dawney  mrs decie signalled with her fan we are trying to express the inexpressibleshall we go into the garden  all rose harz stood by the window and in passing christian looked at him  he sat down again with a sudden sense of loss there was no white figure opposite now raising his eyes he met sarellis the italian was regarding him with a curious stare  herr paul began retailing apiece of scandal he had heard that afternoon  shocking affair he said i could never have believed it of her bis quite beside himself yesterday there was a row it seems  there has been one every day for months muttered dawney  but to leave without a word and go no one knows where bis viveur no doubt mais mon dieu que voulez vous she was always a poor pale thing why when my he flourished his cigar i was not alwayswhat i should have beenone lives in a world of flesh and bloodwe are not all angelsque diable but this is a very vulgar business she goes off leaves everythingwithout a word and bis very fond of her these things are not done the starched bosom of his shirt seemed swollen by indignation  mr treffry with a heavy hand on the table eyed him sideways dawney said slowly  bis a beast im sorry for the poor woman but what can she do alone  there is no doubt a man put in sarelli  herr paul muttered who knows  what is bgoing to do said dawney  ah said herr paul he is fond of her he is a chap of resolution he will get her back he told me well you know i shall follow her wherever she goes till she comes back he will do it he is a determined chap he will follow her wherever she goes  mr treffry drank his wine off at a gulp and sucked his moustache in sharply  she was a fool to marry him said dawney they havent a point in common she hates him like poison and shes the better of the two but it doesnt pay a woman to run off like that bhad better hurry up though what do you think sir he said to mr treffry  eh said mr treffry how should i know ask paul there hes one of your moral men or count sarelli  the latter said impassively if i cared for her i should very likely kill herif not he shrugged his shoulders  harz who was watching was reminded of his other words at dinner wild beasts whom i would tear to pieces he looked with interest at this quiet man who said these extremely ferocious things and thought i should like to paint that fellow  herr paul twirled his wineglass in his fingers there are family ties he said there is society there is decency a wife should be with her husband bwill do quite right he must go after her she will not perhaps come back at first he will follow her she will begin to think i am helplessi am ridiculous a woman is soon beaten they will return she is once more with her husbandsociety will forgive it will be all right  by jove paul growled mr treffry wonderful power of argument  a wife is a wife pursued herr paul a man has a right to her society  what do you say to that sir asked dawney  mr treffry tugged at his beard make a woman live with you if she dont want to i call it low  but my dear exclaimed herr paul how should you know you have not been married  no thank the lord mr treffry replied  but looking at the question broadly sir said dawney if a husband always lets his wife do as she likes how would the thing work out what becomes of the marriage tie  the marriage tie growled mr treffry is the biggest thing there is but by jove doctor im a dutchman if hunting women ever helped the marriage tie  i am not thinking of myself herr paul cried out i think of the community there are rights  a decent community never yet asked a man to tread on his selfrespect if i get my fingers skinned over my marriage which i undertake at my own risk whats the community to do with it dyou think im going to whine to it to put the plaster on as to rights itd be a deuced sight better for us all if there wasnt such a fuss about em leave that to women i dont give a tinkers damn for men who talk about their rights in such matters  sarelli rose but your honour he said there is your honour  mr treffry stared at him  honour if huntin womens your idea of honour wellit isnt mine  then youd forgive her sir whatever happened dawney said  forgiveness is another thing i leave that to your sanctimonious beggars but hunt a woman hang it sir im not a cad and bringing his hand down with a rattle he added this is a subject that dont bear talking of  sarelli fell back in his seat twirling his moustaches fiercely harz who had risen looked at christians empty place  if i were married he thought suddenly  herr paul with a somewhat vinous glare still muttered but your duty to the family  harz slipped through the window the moon was like a wonderful white lantern in the purple sky there was but a smoulder of stars beneath the softness of the air was the iciness of the snow it made him want to run and leap a sleepy beetle dropped on its back he turned it over and watched it scurry across the grass  someone was playing schumanns kinderscenen harz stood still to listen the notes came twining weaving round his thoughts the whole night seemed full of girlish voices of hopes and fancies soaring away to mountain heightsinvisible yet present between the stems of the acaciatrees he could see the flicker of white dresses where christian and greta were walking arm in arm he went towards them the blood flushed up in his face he felt almost surfeited by some sweet emotion then in sudden horror he stood still he was in love with nothing done with everything before him he was going to bow down to a face the flicker of the dresses was no longer visible he would not be fettered he would stamp it out he turned away but with each step something seemed to jab at his heart  round the corner of the house in the shadow of the wall dominique the luganese in embroidered slippers was smoking a long cherrywood pipe leaning against a treemephistopheles in evening clothes harz went up to him  lend me a pencil dominique  bien msieu  resting a card against the tree harz wrote to mrs decie forgive me i am obliged to go away in a few days i shall hope to return and finish the picture of your nieces  he sent dominique for his hat during the mans absence he was on the point of tearing up the card and going back into the house  when the luganese returned he thrust the card into his hand and walked out between the tall poplars waiting like ragged ghosts silver with moonlight     viii  harz walked away along the road a dog was howling the sound seemed too appropriate he put his fingers to his ears but the lugubrious noise passed those barriers and made its way into his heart was there nothing that would put an end to this emotion it was no better in the old house on the wall he spent the night tramping up and down  just before daybreak he slipped out with a knapsack taking the road towards meran  he had not quite passed through gries when he overtook a man walking in the middle of the road and leaving a trail of cigar smoke behind him  ah my friend the smoker said you walk early are you going my way  it was count sarelli the raw light had imparted a grey tinge to his pale face the growth of his beard showed black already beneath the skin his thumbs were hooked in the pockets of a closely buttoned coat he gesticulated with his fingers  you are making a journey he said nodding at the knapsack you are earlyi am late our friend has admirable kummeli have drunk too much you have not been to bed i think if there is no sleep in ones bed it is no good going to look for it you find that it is better to drink kummel pardon you are doing the right thing get away get away as fast as possible dont wait and let it catch you  harz stared at him amazed  pardon sarelli said again raising his hat that girlthe white girli saw you do well to get away he swayed a little as he walked that old fellowwhat is his nametrrreffrry what ideas of honour he mumbled honour is an abstraction if a man is not true to an abstraction he is a low type but wait a minute  he put his hand to his side as though in pain  the hedges were brightening with a faint pinky glow there was no sound on the long deserted road but that of their footsteps suddenly a bird commenced to chirp another answeredthe world seemed full of these little voices  sarelli stopped  that white girl he said speaking with rapidity yes you do well get away dont let it catch you i waited it caught mewhat happened everything horribleand nowkummel laughing a thick laugh he gave a twirl to his moustache and swaggered on  i was a fine fellownothing too big for mario sarelli the regiment looked to me then she camewith her eyes and her white dress always white like this one the little mole on her chin her hands for ever movingtheir touch as warm as sunbeams then no longer sarelli this and that the little house close to the ramparts two arms two eyes and nothing here he tapped his breast but flames that made ashes quicklyin her like this ash he flicked the white flake off his cigar its droll you agree hein some day i shall go back and kill her in the meantimekummel  he stopped at a house close to the road and stood still his teeth bared in a grin  but i bore you he said his cigar flung down sputtered forth its sparks on the road in front of harz i live heregoodmorning you are a man for workyour honour is your art i know and you are young the man who loves flesh better than his honour is a low typei am a low type i mario sarelli a low type i love flesh better than my honour  he remained swaying at the gate with the grin fixed on his face then staggered up the steps and banged the door but before harz had walked on he again appeared beckoning in the doorway obeying an impulse harz went in  we will make a night of it said sarelli wine brandy kummel i am virtuouskummel it must be for me  he sat down at a piano and began to touch the keys harz poured out some wine sarelli nodded  you begin with that allegropiupresto  winebrandykummel he quickened the time of the tune it is not too long a passage and thishe took his hands off the keyscomes after  harz smiled  some men do not kill themselves he said  sarelli who was bending and swaying to the music of a tarantella broke off and letting his eyes rest on the painter began playing schumanns kinderscenen harz leaped to his feet  stop that he cried  it pricks you said sarelli suavely what do you think of this he played again crouching over the piano and making the notes sound like the crying of a wounded animal  for me he said swinging round and rising  your health and so you dont believe in suicide but in murder the custom is the other way but you dont believe in customs customs are only for society he drank a glass of kummel you do not love society  harz looked at him intently he did not want to quarrel  i am not too fond of other peoples thoughts he said at last i prefer to think my own  and is society never right that poor society  society what is societya few men in good coats what has it done for me  sarelli bit the end off a cigar  ah he said now we are coming to it it is good to be an artist a fine bantam of an artist where other men have their discipline he has his what shall we sayhis mound of roses  the painter started to his feet  yes said sarelli with a hiccough you are a fine fellow  and you are drunk cried harz  a little drunknot much not enough to matter  harz broke into laughter it was crazy to stay there listening to this mad fellow what had brought him in he moved towards the door  ah said sarelli but it is no good going to bedlet us talk i have a lot to sayit is pleasant to talk to anarchists at times  full daylight was already coming through the chinks of the shutters  you are all anarchists you painters you writing fellows you live by playing ball with facts imagesnothing solidhein youre all for new things too to tickle your nerves no discipline true anarchists every one of you  harz poured out another glass of wine and drank it off the mans feverish excitement was catching  only fools he replied take things for granted as for discipline what do you aristocrats or bourgeois know of discipline have you ever been hungry have you ever had your soul down on its back  soul on its back that is good  a mans no use cried harz if hes always thinking of what others think he must stand on his own legs  he must not then consider other people  not from cowardice anyway  sarelli drank  what would you do he said striking his chest if you had a devilhere would you go to bed  a sort of pity seized on harz he wanted to say something that would be consoling but could find no words and suddenly he felt disgusted what link was there between him and this man between his love and this mans love  harz muttered sarelli harz means tar hein your family is not an old one  harz glared and said my father is a peasant  sarelli lifted the kummel bottle and emptied it into his glass with a steady hand  youre honestand we both have devils i forgot i brought you in to see a picture  he threw wide the shutters the windows were already open and a rush of air came in  ah he said sniffing smells of the earth nicht wahr herr artist you should knowit belongs to your father come heres my picture a correggio what do you think of it  it is a copy  you think  i know  then you have given me the lie signor and drawing out his handkerchief sarelli flicked it in the painters face  harz turned white  duelling is a good custom said sarelli i shall have the honour to teach you just this one unless you are afraid here are pistolsthis room is twenty feet across at least twenty feet is no bad distance  and pulling out a drawer he took two pistols from a case and put them on the table  the light is goodbut perhaps you are afraid  give me one shouted the infuriated painter and go to the devil for a fool  one moment sarelli murmured i will load them they are more useful loaded  harz leaned out of the window his head was in a whirl what on earth is happening he thought hes mador i am confound him im not going to be killed he turned and went towards the table sarellis head was sunk on his arms he was asleep harz methodically took up the pistols and put them back into the drawer a sound made him turn his head there stood a tall strong young woman in a loose gown caught together on her chest her grey eyes glanced from the painter to the bottles from the bottles to the pistolcase a simple reasoning which struck harz as comic  it is often like this she said in the country patois der herr must not be frightened  lifting the motionless sarelli as if he were a baby she laid him on a couch  ah she said sitting down and resting her elbow on the table he will not wake  harz bowed to her her patient figure in spite of its youth and strength seemed to him pathetic taking up his knapsack he went out  the smoke of cottages rose straight wisps of mist were wandering about the valley and the songs of birds dropping like blessings all over the grass the spiders had spun a sea of threads that bent and quivered to the pressure of the air like fairy tightropes  all that day he tramped  blacksmiths tall stout men with knotted muscles sleepy eyes and great fair beards came out of their forges to stretch and wipe their brows and stare at him  teams of white oxen waiting to be harnessed lashed their tails against their flanks moving their heads slowly from side to side in the heat old women at chalet doors blinked and knitted  the white houses with gaping caves of storage under the roofs the red church spire the clinking of hammers in the forges the slow stamping of oxenall spoke of sleepy toil without ideas or ambition harz knew it all too well like the earths odour it belonged to him as sarelli had said  towards sunset coming to a copse of larches he sat down to rest it was very still but for the tinkle of cowbells and from somewhere in the distance the sound of dropping logs  two barefooted little boys came from the wood marching earnestly along and looking at harz as if he were a monster once past him they began to run  at their age he thought i should have done the same a hundred memories rushed into his mind  he looked down at the village straggling belowwhite houses with russet tiles and crowns of smoke vineyards where the young leaves were beginning to unfold the redcapped spire a thread of bubbling stream an old stone cross he had been fourteen years struggling up from all this and now just as he had breathing space and the time to give himself wholly to his workthis weakness was upon him better a thousand times to give her up  in a house or two lights began to wink the scent of wood smoke reached him the distant chimes of bells the burring of a stream     ix  next day his one thought was to get back to work he arrived at the studio in the afternoon and laying in provisions barricaded the lower door for three days he did not go out on the fourth day he went to villa rubein  schloss runkelsteingrey blind strengthlessstill keeps the valley the windows which once like eyes watched men and horses creeping through the snow braved the splutter of guns and the gleam of torches are now holes for the birds to nest in tangled creepers have spread to the very summits of the walls in the keep instead of grim men in armour there is a wooden board recording the history of the castle and instructing visitors on the subject of refreshments only at night when the cold moon blanches everything the castle stands like the grim ghost of its old self high above the river  after a long mornings sitting the girls had started forth with harz and dawney to spend the afternoon at the ruin miss naylor kept at home by headache watched them depart with words of caution against sunstroke stinging nettles and strange dogs  since the painters return christian and he had hardly spoken to each other below the battlement on which they sat in a railed gallery with little tables dawney and greta were playing dominoes two soldiers drinking beer and at the top of a flight of stairs the custodians wife sewing at a garment christian said suddenly i thought we were friends  well fraulein christian arent we  you went away without a word friends dont do that  harz bit his lips  i dont think you care she went on with a sort of desperate haste whether you hurt people or not you have been here all this time without even going to see your father and mother  do you think they would want to see me  christian looked up  its all been so soft for you he said bitterly you dont understand  he turned his head away and then burst out im proud to come straight from the soili wouldnt have it otherwise but they are of the people everything is narrow with themthey only understand what they can see and touch  im sorry i spoke like that said christian softly youve never told me about yourself  there was something just a little cruel in the way the painter looked at her then seeming to feel compunction he said quickly i always hatedthe peasant lifei wanted to get away into the world i had a feeling in herei wantedi dont know what i wanted i did run away at last to a housepainter at meran the priest wrote me a letter from my fatherthey threw me off thats all  christians eyes were very bright her lips moved like the lips of a child listening to a story  go on she said  i stayed at meran two years till id learnt all i could there then a brother of my mothers helped me to get to vienna i was lucky enough to find work with a man who used to decorate churches we went about the country together once when he was ill i painted the roof of a church entirely by myself i lay on my back on the scaffold boards all day for a weeki was proud of that roof he paused  when did you begin painting pictures  a friend asked me why i didnt try for the academie that started me going to the night schools i worked every minutei had to get my living as well of course so i worked at night  then when the examination came i thought i could do nothingit was just as if i had never had a brush or pencil in my hand but the second day a professor in passing me said good quite good that gave me courage i was sure i had failed though but i was second out of sixty  christian nodded  to work in the schools after that i had to give up my business of course there was only one teacher who ever taught me anything the others all seemed fools this man would come and rub out what youd done with his sleeve i used to cry with ragebut i told him i could only learn from him and he was so astonished that he got me into his class  but how did you live without money asked christian  his face burned with a dark flush i dont know how i lived you must have been through these things to know you would never understand  but i want to understand please  what do you want me to tell you how i went twice a week to eat free dinners how i took charity how i was hungry there was a rich cousin of my mothersi used to go to him i didnt like it but if youre starving in the winter  christian put out her hand  i used to borrow apronsful of coals from other students who were as poorbut i never went to the rich students  the flush had died out of his face  that sort of thing makes you hate the world you work till you stagger youre cold and hungry you see rich people in their carriages wrapped in furs and all the time you want to do something great you pray for a chance any chance nothing comes to the poor it makes you hate the world  christians eyes filled with tears he went on  but i wasnt the only one in that condition we used to meet garin a russian with a brown beard and patches of cheek showing through and yellow teeth who always looked hungry paunitz who came from sympathy he had fat cheeks and little eyes and a big gold chainthe swine and little misek it was in his room we met with the paper peeling off the walls and two doors with cracks in them so that there was always a draught we used to sit on his bed and pull the dirty blankets over us for warmth and smoketobacco was the last thing we ever went without over the bed was a virgin and childmisek was a very devout catholic but one day when he had had no dinner and a dealer had kept his picture without paying him he took the image and threw it on the floor before our eyes it broke and he trampled on the bits lendorf was another a heavy fellow who was always puffing out his white cheeks and smiting himself and saying cursed society and schonborn an aristocrat who had quarrelled with his family he was the poorest of us all but only he and i would ever have dared to do anythingthey all knew that  christian listened with awe do you mean she said do you mean that you  you see youre afraid of me at once its impossible even for you to understand it only makes you afraid a hungry man living on charity sick with rage and shame is a wolf even to you  christian looked straight into his eyes  thats not true if i cant understand i can feel would you be the same now if it were to come again  yes it drives me mad even now to think of people fatted with prosperity sneering and holding up their hands at poor devils who have suffered ten times more than the most those soft animals could bear im older ive livedi know things cant be put right by violencenothing will put things right but that doesnt stop my feeling  did you do anything you must tell me all now  we talkedwe were always talking  no tell me everything  unconsciously she claimed and he seemed unconsciously to admit her right to this knowledge  theres not much to tell one day we began talking in low voicesgarin began it he had been in some affair in russia we took an oath after that we never raised our voices we had a plan it was all new to me and i hated the whole thingbut i was always hungry or sick from taking charity and i would have done anything they knew that they used to look at me and schonborn we knew that no one else had any courage he and i were great friends but we never talked of that we tried to keep our minds away from the thought of it if we had a good day and were not so hungry it seemed unnatural but when the day had not been goodthen it seemed natural enough i wasnt afraid but i used to wake up in the night i hated the oath we had taken i hated every one of those fellows the thing was not what i was made for it wasnt my work it wasnt my nature it was forced on mei hated it but sometimes i was like a madman  yes yes she murmured  all this time i was working at the academie and learning all i could one evening that we met paunitz was not there misek was telling us how the thing had been arranged schonborn and i looked at each otherit was warmperhaps we were not hungryit was springtime too and in the spring its different there is something  christian nodded  while we were talking there came a knock at the door lendorf put his eye to the keyhole and made a sign the police were there nobody said anything but misek crawled under the bed we all followed and the knocking grew louder and louder in the wall at the back of the bed was a little door into an empty cellar we crept through there was a trapdoor behind some cases where they used to roll barrels in we crawled through that into the back street we went different ways  he paused and christian gasped  i thought i would get my money but there was a policeman before my door they had us finely it was paunitz if i met him even now i should wring his neck i swore i wouldnt be caught but i had no idea where to go then i thought of a little italian barber who used to shave me when i had money for a shave i knew he would help he belonged to some italian society he often talked to me under his breath of course i went to him he was shaving himself before going to a ball i told him what had happened it was funny to see him put his back against the door he was very frightened understanding this sort of thing better than i didfor i was only twenty then he shaved my head and moustache and put me on a fair wig then he brought me macaroni and some meat to eat he gave me a big fair moustache and a cap and hid the moustache in the lining he brought me a cloak of his own and four gulden all the time he was extremely frightened and kept listening and saying eat  when i had done he just said go away i refuse to know anything more of you  i thanked him and went out i walked about all that night for i couldnt think of anything to do or anywhere to go in the morning i slept on a seat in one of the squares then i thought i would go to the gallerien and i spent the whole day looking at the pictures when the galleries were shut i was very tired so i went into a cafe and had some beer when i came out i sat on the same seat in the square i meant to wait till dark and then walk out of the city and take the train at some little station but while i was sitting there i went to sleep a policeman woke me he had my wig in his hand  why do you wear a wig he said  i answered because i am bald  no he said youre not bald youve been shaved i can feel the hair coming  he put his finger on my head i felt reckless and laughed  ah he said youll come with me and explain all this your nose and eyes are looked for  i went with him quietly to the policestation  harz seemed carried away by his story his quick dark face worked his steelgrey eyes stared as though he were again passing through all these longpast emotions  the hot sun struck down christian drew herself together sitting with her hands clasped round her knees     x  i didnt care by then what came of it i didnt even think what i was going to say he led me down a passage to a room with bars across the windows and long seats and maps on the walls we sat and waited he kept his eye on me all the time and i saw no hope presently the inspector came bring him in here he said i remember feeling i could kill him for ordering me about we went into the next room it had a large clock a writingtable and a window without bars looking on a courtyard long policemens coats and caps were hanging from some pegs the inspector told me to take off my cap i took it off wig and all he asked me who i was but i refused to answer just then there was a loud sound of voices in the room we had come from the inspector told the policeman to look after me and went to see what it was i could hear him talking he called out come here becker i stood very quiet and becker went towards the door i heard the inspector say go and find schwartz i will see after this fellow the policeman went and the inspector stood with his back to me in the halfopen door and began again to talk to the man in the other room once or twice he looked round at me but i stood quiet all the time they began to disagree and their voices got angry the inspector moved a little into the other room now i thought and slipped off my cloak i hooked off a policemans coat and cap and put them on my heart beat till i felt sick i went on tiptoe to the window there was no one outside but at the entrance a man was holding some horses i opened the window a little and held my breath i heard the inspector say i will report you for impertinence and slipped through the window the coat came down nearly to my heels and the cap over my eyes i walked up to the man with the horses and said goodevening one of the horses had begun to kick and he only grunted at me i got into a passing tram it was five minutes to the west bahnhof i got out there there was a train starting they were shouting einsteigen i ran the collector tried to stop me i shouted businessimportant he let me by i jumped into a carriage the train started  he paused and christian heaved a sigh  harz went on twisting a twig of ivy in his hands there was another man in the carriage reading a paper presently i said to him where do we stop first st polten then i knew it was the munich expressst polten amstetten linz and salzburgfour stops before the frontier the man put down his paper and looked at me he had a big fair moustache and rather shabby clothes his looking at me disturbed me for i thought every minute he would say youre no policeman and suddenly it came into my mind that if they looked for me in this train it would be as a policemanthey would know of course at the station that a policeman had run past at the last minute i wanted to get rid of the coat and cap but the man was there and i didnt like to move out of the carriage for other people to notice so i sat on we came to st polten at last the man in my carriage took his bag got out and left his paper on the seat we started again i breathed at last and as soon as i could took the cap and coat and threw them out into the darkness i thought i shall get across the frontier now i took my own cap out and found the moustache luigi gave me rubbed my clothes as clean as possible stuck on the moustache and with some little ends of chalk in my pocket made my eyebrows light then drew some lines in my face to make it older and pulled my cap well down above my wig i did it pretty welli was quite like the man who had got out i sat in his corner took up his newspaper and waited for amstetten it seemed a tremendous time before we got there from behind my paper i could see five or six policemen on the platform one quite close he opened the door looked at me and walked through the carriage into the corridor i took some tobacco and rolled up a cigarette but it shook harz lifted the ivy twig like this in a minute the conductor and two more policemen came he was here said the conductor with this gentleman one of them looked at me and asked have you seen a policeman travelling on this train yes i said where he got out at st polten the policeman asked the conductor did you see him get out there the conductor shook his head i said he got out as the train was moving ah said the policeman what was he like rather short and no moustache why did you notice anything unusual no i said only that he wore coloured trousers whats the matter one policeman said to the other thats our man send a telegram to st polten he has more than an hours start he asked me where i was going i told him linz ah he said youll have to give evidence your name and address please josef reinhardt 17 donau strasse he wrote it down the conductor said we are late can we start they shut the door i heard them say to the conductor search again at linz and report to the inspector there they hurried on to the platform and we started at first i thought i would get out as soon as the train had left the station then that i should be too far from the frontier better to go on to linz and take my chance there i sat still and tried not to think  after a long time we began to run more slowly i put my head out and could see in the distance a ring of lights hanging in the blackness i loosened the carriage door and waited for the train to run slower still i didnt mean to go into linz like a rat into a trap at last i could wait no longer i opened the door jumped and fell into some bushes i was not much hurt but bruised and the breath knocked out of me as soon as i could i crawled out it was very dark i felt heavy and sore and for some time went stumbling in and out amongst trees presently i came to a clear space on one side i could see the towns shape drawn in lighted lamps and on the other a dark mass which i think was forest in the distance too was a thin chain of lights i thought they must be the lights of a bridge just then the moon came out and i could see the river shining below it was cold and damp and i walked quickly at last i came out on a road past houses and barking dogs down to the river bank there i sat against a shed and went to sleep i woke very stiff it was darker than before the moon was gone i could just see the river i stumbled on to get through the town before dawn it was all black shapeshouses and sheds and the smell of the river the smell of rotting hay apples tar mud fish and here and there on a wharf a lantern i stumbled over casks and ropes and boxes i saw i should never get clearthe dawn had begun already on the other side some men came from a house behind me i bent and crept behind some barrels they passed along the wharf they seemed to drop into the river i heard one of them say passau before night i stood up and saw they had walked on board a steamer which was lying head upstream with some barges in tow there was a plank laid to the steamer and a lantern at the other end i could hear the fellows moving below deck getting up steam i ran across the plank and crept to the end of the steamer i meant to go with them to passau the rope which towed the barges was nearly taut and i knew if i could get on to the barges i should be safe i climbed down on this rope and crawled along i was desperate i knew theyd soon be coming up and it was getting light i thought i should fall into the water several times but i got to the barge at last it was laden with straw there was nobody on board i was hungry and thirstyi looked for something to eat there was nothing but the ashes of a fire and a mans coat i crept into the straw soon a boat brought men one for each barge and there were sounds of steam as soon as we began moving through the water i fell asleep when i woke we were creeping through a heavy mist i made a little hole in the straw and saw the bargeman he was sitting by a fire at the barges edge so that the sparks and smoke blew away over the water he ate and drank with both hands and funny enough he looked in the mist like a big bird flapping its wings there was a good smell of coffee and i sneezed how the fellow started but presently he took a pitchfork and prodded the straw then i stood up i couldnt help laughing he was so surpriseda huge dark man with a great black beard i pointed to the fire and said give me some brother he pulled me out of the straw i was so stiff i couldnt move i sat by the fire and ate black bread and turnips and drank coffee while he stood by watching me and muttering i couldnt understand him wellhe spoke a dialect from hungary he asked me how i got therewho i waswhere i was from i looked up in his face and he looked down at me sucking his pipe he was a big man he lived alone on the river and i was tired of telling lies so i told him the whole thing when i had done he just grunted i can see him now standing over me with the mist hanging in his beard and his great naked arms he drew me some water and i washed and showed him my wig and moustache and threw them overboard all that day we lay out on the barge in the mist with our feet to the fire smoking now and then he would spit into the ashes and mutter into his beard i shall never forget that day the steamer was like a monster with fiery nostrils and the other barges were dumb creatures with eyes where the fires were we couldnt see the bank but now and then a bluff and high trees or a castle showed in the mist if i had only had paint and canvas that day he sighed  it was early spring and the river was in flood they were going to regensburg to unload there take fresh cargo and back to linz as soon as the mist began to clear the bargeman hid me in the straw at passau was the frontier they lay there for the night but nothing happened and i slept in the straw the next day i lay out on the barge deck there was no mist but i was freethe sun shone gold on the straw and the green sacking the water seemed to dance and i laughedi laughed all the time and the barge man laughed with me a fine fellow he was at regensburg i helped them to unload for more than a week we worked they nicknamed me baldhead and when it was all over i gave the money i earned for the unloading to the big bargeman we kissed each other at parting i had still three of the gulden that luigi gave me and i went to a housepainter and got work with him for six months i stayed there to save money then i wrote to my mothers cousin in vienna and told him i was going to london he gave me an introduction to some friends there i went to hamburg and from there to london in a cargo steamer and ive never been back till now     xi  after a minutes silence christian said in a startled voice they could arrest you then  harz laughed  if they knew but its seven years ago  why did you come here when its so dangerous  i had been working too hard i wanted to see my countryafter seven years and when its forbidden but im ready to go back now he looked down at her frowning  had you a hard time in london too  harder at firsti couldnt speak the language in my profession its hard work to get recognised its hard work to make a living there are too many whose interest it is to keep you downi shant forget them  but every one is not like that  no there are fine fellows too i shant forget them either i can sell my pictures now im no longer weak and i promise you i shant forget if in the future i have power and i shall have poweri shant forget  a shower of fine gravel came rattling on the wall dawney was standing below them with an amused expression on his upturned face  are you going to stay there all night he asked greta and i have bored each other  were coming called christian hastily  on the way back neither spoke a word but when they reached the villa harz took her hand and said fraulein christian i cant do any more with your picture i shant touch it again after this  she made no answer but they looked at each other and both seemed to ask to entreat something more then her eyes fell he dropped her hand and saying goodnight ran after dawney  in the corridor dominique carrying a dish of fruit met the sisters he informed them that miss naylor had retired to bed that herr paul would not be home to dinner his master was dining in his room dinner would be served for mrs decie and the two young ladies in a quarter of an hour and the fish is good tonight little trouts try them signorina he moved on quickly softly like a cat the tails of his dresscoat flapping and the heels of his white socks gleaming  christian ran upstairs she flew about her room feeling that if she once stood still it would all crystallise in hard painful thought which motion alone kept away she washed changed her dress and shoes and ran down to her uncles room mr treffry had just finished dinner pushed the little table back and was sitting in his chair with his glasses on his nose reading the tines christian touched his forehead with her lips  glad to see you chris your stepfathers out to dinner and i cant stand your aunt when shes in one of her talking moodsbit of a humbug chris between ourselves eh isnt she his eyes twinkled  christian smiled there was a curious happy restlessness in her that would not let her keep still  picture finished mr treffry asked suddenly taking up the paper with a crackle dont go and fall in love with the painter chris  christian was still enough now  why not she thought what should you know about him isnt he good enough for me a gong sounded  theres your dinner mr treffry remarked  with sudden contrition she bent and kissed him  but when she had left the room mr treffry put down the times and stared at the door humming to himself and thoughtfully fingering his chin  christian could not eat she sat indifferent to the hoverings of dominique tormented by uneasy fear and longings she answered mrs decie at random greta kept stealing looks at her from under her lashes  decided characters are charming dont you think so christian mrs decie said thrusting her chin a little forward and modelling the words that is why i like mr harz so much such an immense advantage for a man to know his mind you have only to look at that young man to see that he knows what he wants and means to have it  christian pushed her plate away greta flushing said abruptly doctor edmund is not a decided character i think this afternoon he said shall i have some beeryes i shallno i shall not then he ordered the beer so when it came he gave it to the soldiers  mrs decie turned her enigmatic smile from one girl to the other  when dinner was over they went into her room greta stole at once to the piano where her long hair fell almost to the keys silently she sat there fingering the notes smiling to herself and looking at her aunt who was reading paters essays christian too had taken up a book but soon put it downof several pages she had not understood a word she went into the garden and wandered about the lawn clasping her hands behind her head the air was heavy very distant thunder trembled among the mountains flashes of summer lightning played over the trees and two great moths were hovering about a rosebush christian watched their soft uncertain rushes going to the little summerhouse she flung herself down on a seat and pressed her hands to her heart  there was a strange and sudden aching there was he going from her if so what would be left how little and how narrow seemed the outlook of her lifewith the world waiting for her the world of beauty effort selfsacrifice fidelity it was as though a flash of that summer lightning had fled by singeing her taking from her all powers of flight burning off her wings as off one of those pale hovering moths tears started up and trickled down her face blind she thought how could i have been so blind  some one came down the path  whos there she cried  harz stood in the doorway  why did you come out he said ah why did you come out he caught her hand christian tried to draw it from him and to turn her eyes away but she could not he flung himself down on his knees and cried i love you  in a rapture of soft terror christian bent her forehead down to his hand  what are you doing she heard him say is it possible that you love me and she felt his kisses on her hair  my sweet it will be so hard for you you are so little so little and so weak clasping his hand closer to her face she murmured i dont care  there was a long soft silence that seemed to last for ever suddenly she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him  whatever comes she whispered and gathering her dress escaped from him into the darkness     xii  christian woke next morning with a smile in her attitudes her voice her eyes there was a happy and sweet seriousness as if she were hugging some holy thought after breakfast she took a book and sat in the open window whence she could see the poplartrees guarding the entrance there was a breeze the roses close by kept nodding to her the cathedral bells were in full chime bees hummed above the lavender and in the sky soft clouds were floating like huge white birds  the sounds of miss naylors staccato dictation travelled across the room and gretas sighs as she took it down one eye on her paper one eye on scruff who lay with a black ear flapped across his paw and his tan eyebrows quivering he was in disgrace for dominique coming on him unawares had seen him say his prayers before a pudding and take the pudding for reward  christian put her book down gently and slipped through the window harz was coming in from the road i am all yours she whispered his fingers closed on hers and he went into the house  she slipped back took up her book and waited it seemed long before he came out but when he did he waved her back and hurried on she had a glimpse of his face white to the lips feeling faint and sick she flew to her stepfathers room  herr paul was standing in a corner with the utterly disturbed appearance of an easygoing man visited by the unexpected his fine shirtfront was crumpled as if his breast had heaved too suddenly under strong emotion his smoked eyeglasses dangled down his back his fingers were embedded in his beard he was fixing his eye on a spot in the floor as though he expected it to explode and blow them to fragments in another corner mrs decie with halfclosed eyes was running her fingertips across her brow  what have you said to him cried christian  herr paul regarded her with glassy eyes  mein gott he said your aunt and i  what have you said to him repeated christian  the impudence an anarchist a beggar  paul murmured mrs decie  the outlaw the fellow herr paul began to stride about the room  quivering from head to foot christian cried how dared you and ran from the room pushing aside miss naylor and greta who stood blanched and frightened in the doorway  herr paul stopped in his tramp and still with his eyes fixed on the floor growled  a fine thinghein whats coming will you please tell me an anarchista beggar  paul murmured mrs decie  paul paul and you he pointed to miss naylortwo women with eyeshein  there is nothing to be gained by violence mrs decie murmured passing her handkerchief across her lips miss naylor whose thin brown cheeks had flushed advanced towards him  i hope you do not she said i am sure there was nothing that i could have preventedi should be glad if that were understood and turning with some dignity the little lady went away closing the door behind her  you hear herr paul said violently sarcastic nothing she could have prevented enfin will you please tell me what i am to do  men of the worldwhose philosophy is a creature of circumstance and accepted thingsfind any deviation from the path of their convictions dangerous shocking and an intolerable bore herr paul had spent his life laughing at convictions the matter had but to touch him personally and the tap of laughter was turned off that any one to whom he was the lawful guardian should marry other than a wellgroomed man properly endowed with goods properly selected was beyond expression horrid from his point of view he had great excuse for horror and he was naturally unable to judge whether he had excuse for horror from other points of view his amazement had in it a spice of the pathetic he was like a child in the presence of a thing that he absolutely could not understand the interview had left him with a sense of insecurity which he felt to be particularly unfair  the door was again opened and greta flew in her cheeks flushed her hair floating behind her and tears streaming down her cheeks  papa she cried you have been cruel to chris the door is locked i can hear her cryingwhy have you been cruel without waiting to be answered she flew out again  herr paul seized his hair with both his hands good very good my own child please what next then  mrs decie rose from her chair languidly my head is very bad she said shading her eyes and speaking in low tones it is no use making a fussnothing can come of thishe has not a penny christian will have nothing till you die which will not be for a long time yet if you can but avoid an apoplectic fit  at these last words herr paul gave a start of real disgust hum he muttered it was as if the world were bent on being brutal to him mrs decie continued  if i know anything of this young man he will not come here again after the words you have spoken as for christianyou had better talk to nicholas i am going to lie down  herr paul nervously fingered the shirtcollar round his stout short neck  nicholas certainlya good idea quelle diable dafaire  french thought mrs decie we shall soon have peace poor christian im sorry after all these things are a matter of time and opportunity this consoled her a good deal  but for christian the hours were a long nightmare of grief and shame fear and anger would he forgive would he be true to her or would he go away without a word since yesterday it was as if she had stepped into another world and lost it again in place of that new feeling intoxicating as wine what was coming what bitter dreadful ending  a rude entrance this into the life of facts and primitive emotions  she let greta into her room after a time for the child had begun sobbing but she would not talk and sat hour after hour at the window with the air fanning her face and the pain in her eyes turned to the sky and trees after one or two attempts at consolation greta sank on the floor and remained there humbly gazing at her sister in a silence only broken when christian cleared her throat of tears and by the song of birds in the garden in the afternoon she slipped away and did not come back again  after his interview with mr treffry herr paul took a bath perfumed himself with precision and caused it to be clearly understood that under circumstances such as these a mans house was not suited for a pig to live in he shortly afterwards went out to the kurbaus and had not returned by dinnertime  christian came down for dinner there were crimson spots in her cheeks dark circles round her eyes she behaved however as though nothing had happened miss naylor affected by the kindness of her heart and the shock her system had sustained rolled a number of bread pills looking at each as it came with an air of surprise and concealing it with difficulty mr treffry was coughing and when he talked his voice seemed to rumble even more than usual greta was dumb trying to catch christians eye mrs decie alone seemed at ease after dinner mr treffry went off to his room leaning heavily on christians shoulder as he sank into his chair he said to her  pull yourself together my dear christian did not answer him  outside his room greta caught her by the sleeve  look she whispered thrusting a piece of paper into christians hand it is to me from dr edmund but you must read it  christian opened the note which ran as follows  my philosopher and friendi received your note and went to our friends studio he was not in but half an hour ago i stumbled on him in the platz he is not quite himself has had a touch of the sunnothing serious i took him to my hotel where he is in bed if he will stay there he will be all right in a day or two in any case he shall not elude my clutches for the present   my warm respects to mistress christianyours in friendship and philosophy  edmund dawney   christian read and reread this note then turned to greta  what did you say to dr dawney  greta took back the piece of paper and replied i said  dear dr edmundwe are anxious about herr harz we think he is perhaps not very well today we i and christian should like to know you can tell us please shall you greta  that is what i said  christian dropped her eyes what made you write  greta gazed at her mournfully i thoughto chris come into the garden i am so hot and it is so dull without you  christian bent her head forward and rubbed her cheek against gretas then without another word ran upstairs and locked herself into her room the child stood listening hearing the key turn in the lock she sank down on the bottom step and took scruff in her arms  half an hour later miss naylor carrying a candle found her there fast asleep with her head resting on the terriers back and tear stains on her cheeks  mrs decie presently came out also carrying a candle and went to her brothers room she stood before his chair with folded hands  nicholas what is to be done  mr treffry was pouring whisky into a glass  damn it con he answered how should i know  theres something in christian that makes interference dangerous i know very well that ive no influence with her at all  youre right there con mr treffry replied  mrs decies pale eyes fastened on his face forced him to look up  i wish you would leave off drinking whisky and attend to me paul is an element  paul mr treffry growled is an ass  paul pursued mrs decie is an element of danger in the situation any illtimed opposition of his might drive her to i dont know what christian is gentle she is sympathetic as they say but thwart her and she is as obstinate as  you or i leave her alone  i understand her character but i confess that i am at a loss what to do  do nothing he drank again  mrs decie took up the candle  men she said with a mysterious intonation shrugging her shoulders she walked out  mr treffry put down his glass  understand he thought no you dont and i dont who understands a young girl vapourings dreams moonshine i what does she see in this painter fellow i wonder he breathed heavily by heavens i wouldnt have had this happen for a hundred thousand pounds     xiii  for many hours after dawney had taken him to his hotel harz was prostrate with stunning pains in the head and neck he had been all day without food exposed to burning sun suffering violent emotion movement of any sort caused him such agony that he could only lie in stupor counting the spots dancing before his eyes dawney did everything for him and harz resented in a listless way the intent scrutiny of the doctors calm black eyes  towards the end of the second day he was able to get up dawney found him sitting on the bed in shirt and trousers  my son he said you had better tell me what the trouble isit will do your stubborn carcase good  i must go back to work said harz  work said dawney deliberately you couldnt if you tried  i must  my dear fellow you couldnt tell one colour from another  i must be doing something i cant sit here and think  dawney hooked his thumbs into his waistcoat you wont see the sun for three days yet if i can help it  harz got up  im going to my studio tomorrow he said i promise not to go out i must be where i can see my work if i cant paint i can draw i can feel my brushes move my things about i shall go mad if i do nothing  dawney took his arm and walked him up and down  ill let you go he said but give me a chance its as much to me to put you straight as it is to you to paint a decent picture now go to bed ill have a carriage for you tomorrow morning  harz sat down on the bed again and for a long time stayed without moving his eyes fixed on the floor the sight of him so desperate and miserable hurt the young doctor  can you get to bed by yourself he asked at last  harz nodded  then goodnight old chap and dawney left the room  he took his hat and turned towards the villa between the poplars he stopped to think the farther trees were fretworked black against the lingering gold of the sunset a huge moth attracted by the tip of his cigar came fluttering in his face the music of a concertina rose and fell like the sighing of some disillusioned spirit dawney stood for several minutes staring at the house  he was shown to mrs decies room she was holding a magazine before her eyes and received him with as much relief as philosophy permitted  you are the very person i wanted to see she said  he noticed that the magazine she held was uncut  you are a young man pursued mrs decie but as my doctor i have a right to your discretion  dawney smiled the features of his broad cleanshaven face looked ridiculously small on such occasions but his eyes retained their air of calculation  that is so he answered  it is about this unfortunate affair i understand that mr harz is with you i want you to use your influence to dissuade him from attempting to see my niece  influence said dawney you know harz  mrs decies voice hardened  everybody she said has his weak points this young man is open to approach from at least two quartershis pride is one his work an other i am seldom wrong in gauging character these are his vital spots and they are of the essence of this matter im sorry for him of coursebut at his age and living a mans life these things her smile was extra pale i wish you could give me something for my head its foolish to worry nerves of course but i cant help it you know my opinion dr dawney that young man will go far if he remains unfettered he will make a name you will be doing him a great service if you could show him the affair as it really isa drag on him and quite unworthy of his pride do help me you are just the man to do it  dawney threw up his head as if to shake off this impeachment the curve of his chin thus displayed was imposing in its fulness altogether he was imposing having an air of capability  she struck him indeed as really scared it was as if her mask of smile had become awry and failed to cover her emotion and he was puzzled thinking i wouldnt have believed she had it in her its not an easy business he said ill think it over  thank you murmured mrs decie you are most kind  passing the schoolroom he looked in through the open door christian was sitting there the sight of her face shocked him it was so white so resolutely dumb a book lay on her knees she was not reading but staring before her he thought suddenly poor thing if i dont say something to her i shall be a brute  miss devorell he said you can reckon on him  christian tried to speak but her lips trembled so that nothing came forth  goodnight said dawney and walked out  three days later harz was sitting in the window of his studio it was the first day he had found it possible to work and now tired out he stared through the dusk at the slowly lengthening shadows of the rafters a solitary mosquito hummed and two house sparrows who had built beneath the roof chirruped sleepily swallows darted by the window dipping their blue wings towards the quiet water a hush had stolen over everything he fell asleep  he woke with a dim impression of some near presence in the pale glimmer from innumerable stars the room was full of shadowy shapes he lit his lantern the flame darted forth bickered then slowly lit up the great room  whos there  a rustling seemed to answer he peered about went to the doorway and drew the curtain a womans cloaked figure shrank against the wall her face was buried in her hands her arms from which the cloak fell back were alone visible  christian  she ran past him and when he had put the lantern down was standing at the window she turned quickly to him take me away from here let me come with you  do you mean it  you said you wouldnt give me up  you know what you are doing  she made a motion of assent  but you dont grasp what this means things to bear that you know nothing ofhunger perhaps think even hunger and your people wont forgiveyoull lose everything  she shook her head  i must chooseits one thing or the other i cant give you up i should be afraid  but dear how can you come with me we cant be married here  i am giving my life to you  you are too good for me said harz the life youre going intomay be dark like that he pointed to the window  a sound of footsteps broke the hush they could see a figure on the path below it stopped seemed to consider vanished they heard the sounds of groping hands of a creaking door of uncertain feet on the stairs  harz seized her hand  quick he whispered behind this canvas  christian was trembling violently she drew her hood across her face the heavy breathing and ejaculations of the visitor were now plainly audible  hes there quick hide  she shook her head  with a thrill at his heart harz kissed her then walked towards the entrance the curtain was pulled aside     xiv  it was herr paul holding a cigar in one hand his hat in the other and breathing hard  pardon he said huskily your stairs are steep and dark mais en fin nous voila i have ventured to come for a talk his glance fell on the cloaked figure in the shadow  pardon a thousand pardons i had no idea i beg you to forgive this indiscretion i may take it you resign pretensions then you have a lady herei have nothing more to say i only beg a million pardons for intruding a thousand times forgive me goodnight  he bowed and turned to go christian stepped forward and let the hood fall from her head  its i  herr paul pirouetted  good god he stammered dropping cigar and hat good god  the lantern flared suddenly revealing his crimson shaking cheeks  you came here at night you the daughter of my wife his eyes wandered with a dull glare round the room  take care cried harz if you say a word against her  the two men stared at each others eyes and without warning the lantern flickered and went out christian drew the cloak round her again herr pauls voice broke the silence he had recovered his selfpossession  ah ah he said darkness tant mieux the right thing for what we have to say since we do not esteem each other it is well not to see too much  just so said harz  christian had come close to them her pale face and great shining eyes could just be seen through the gloom  herr paul waved his arm the gesture was impressive annihilating  this is a matter i believe between two men he said addressing harz let us come to the point i will do you the credit to suppose that you have a marriage in view you know perhaps that miss devorell has no money till i die  yes  and i am passably young you have money then  no  in that case you would propose to live on air  no to work it has been done before  it is calculated to increase hunger you are prepared to take miss devorell a young lady accustomed to luxury into places likethis he peered about him into places that smell of paint into the milieu of the people into the society of bohemianswho knows of anarchists perhaps  harz clenched his hands i will answer no more questions  in that event we reach the ultimatum said herr paul listen herr outlaw if you have not left the country by noon tomorrow you shall be introduced to the police  christian uttered a cry for a minute in the gloom the only sound heard was the short hard breathing of the two men  suddenly harz cried you coward i defy you  coward herr paul repeated that is indeed the last word look to yourself my friend  stooping and fumbling on the floor he picked up his hat christian had already vanished the sound of her hurrying footsteps was distinctly audible at the top of the dark stairs herr paul stood still a minute  look to yourself my dear friend he said in a thick voice groping for the wall planting his hat askew on his head he began slowly to descend the stairs     xv  nicholas treffry sat reading the paper in his room by the light of a lamp with a green shade on his sound foot the terrier scruff was asleep and snoring lightlythe dog habitually came down when greta was in bed and remained till mr treffry always the latest member of the household retired to rest  through the long window a little river of light shone out on the veranda tiles and flowing past cut the garden in two  there was the sound of hurried footsteps a rustling of draperies christian running through the window stood before him  mr treffry dropped his paper such a fury of passion and alarm shone in the girls eyes  chris what is it  hateful  chris  oh uncle hes insulted threatened and i love his little finger more than all the world  her passionate voice trembled her eyes were shining  mr treffrys profound discomfort found vent in the gruff words sit down  ill never speak to father again oh uncle i love him  quiet in the extremity of his disturbance mr treffry leaned forward in his chair rested his big hands on its arms and stared at her  chris here was a woman he did not know his lips moved under the heavy droop of his moustache the girls face had suddenly grown white she sank down on her knees and laid her cheek against his hand he felt it wet and a lump rose in his throat drawing his hand away he stared at it and wiped it with his sleeve  dont cry he said  she seized it again and clung to it that clutch seemed to fill him with sudden rage  whats the matter how the devil can i do anything if you dont tell me  she looked up at him the distress of the last days the passion and fear of the last hour the tide of that new life of the spirit and the flesh stirring within her flowed out in a stream of words  when she had finished there was so dead a silence that the fluttering of a moth round the lamp could be heard plainly  mr treffry raised himself crossed the room and touched the bell tell the groom he said to dominique to put the horses to and have em round at once bring my old boots we drive all night  his bent figure looked huge body and legs outlined by light head and shoulders towering into shadow he shall have a run for his money he said his eyes stared down sombrely at his niece its more than he deservesits more than you deserve chris sit down there and write to him tell him to put himself entirely in my hands he turned his back on her and went into his bedroom  christian rose and sat down at the writingtable a whisper startled her it came from dominique who was holding out a pair of boots  mmselle chris what is thisto run about all night but christian did not answer  mmselle chris are you ill then seeing her face he slipped away again  she finished her letter and went out to the carriage mr treffry was seated under the hood  shant want you he called out to the groom get up dominique  christian thrust her letter into his hand give him that she said clinging to his arm with sudden terror oh uncle do take care  chris if i do this for you they looked wistfully at one another then shaking his head mr treffry gathered up the reins  dont fret my dear dont fret whoa mare  the carriage with a jerk plunged forward into darkness curved with a crunch of wheels and vanished swinging between the black treepillars at the entrance  christian stood straining to catch the failing sound of the hoofs  down the passage came a flutter of white garments soft limbs were twined about her some ends of hair fell on her face  what is it chris where have you been where is uncle nic going tell me  christian tore herself away i dont know she cried i know nothing  greta stroked her face poor chris she murmured her bare feet gleamed her hair shone gold against her nightdress come to bed poor chris  christian laughed you little white moth feel how hot i am youll burn your wings     xvi  harz had lain down fully dressed he was no longer angry but felt that he would rather die than yield presently he heard footsteps coming up the stairs  msieu  it was the voice of dominique whose face illumined by a match wore an expression of ironical disgust  my master he said makes you his compliments he says there is no time to waste you are to please come and drive with him  your master is very kind tell him im in bed  ah msieu said dominique grimacing i must not go back with such an answer if you would not come i was to give you this  harz broke the seal and read christians letter  i will come he said  a clock was striking as they went out through the gate from within the dark cave of the phaeton hood mr treffry said gruffly come along sir  harz flung his knapsack in and followed  his companions figure swayed the whiplash slid softly along the flank of the off horse and as the carriage rattled forward mr treffry called out as if by afterthought hallo dominique dominques voice shaken and ironical answered from behind mvla msieu  in the long street of silent houses men sitting in the lighted cafes turned with glasses at their lips to stare after the carriage the narrow river of the sky spread suddenly to a vast limpid ocean tremulous with stars they had turned into the road for italy  mr treffry took a pull at his horses whoa mare dogged does it and the near horse throwing up her head whinnied a fleck of foam drifted into harzs face  the painter had come on impulse because christian had told him to not of his own free will he was angry with himself wounded in selfesteem for having allowed any one to render him this service the smooth swift movement through velvet blackness splashed on either hand with the flying lamplight the strong sweet air blowing in his faceair that had kissed the tops of mountains and stolen their spirit the snort and snuffle of the horses and crisp rattling of their hoofsall this soon roused in him another feeling he looked at mr treffrys profile with its tufted chin at the grey road adventuring in darkness at the purple mass of mountains piled above it all seemed utterly unreal  as if suddenly aware that he had a neighbour mr treffry turned his head we shall do better than this presently he said bit of a slope coming havent had em out for three days whoamare steady  why are you taking this trouble for me asked harz  im an old chap mr harz and an old chap may do a stupid thing once in a while  you are very good said harz but i want no favours  mr treffry stared at him  just so he said drily but you see theres my niece to be thought of look here were not at the frontier yet mr harz by forty miles its long odds we dont get thereso dont spoil sport he pointed to the left  harz caught the glint of steel they were already crossing the railway the sigh of the telegraph wires fluttered above them  hear em said mr treffry but if we get away up the mountains well do yet they had begun to rise the speed slackened mr treffry rummaged out a flask  not bad stuff mr harztry it you wont mothers milk fine night eh below them the valley was lit by webs of milky mist like the glimmer of dew on grass  these two men sitting side by sideunlike in face age stature thought and lifebegan to feel drawn towards each other as if in the rolling of the wheels the snorting of the horses the huge dark space the huge uncertainty they had found something they could enjoy in common the steam from the horses flanks and nostrils enveloped them with an odour as of glue  you smoke mr harz  harz took the proffered weed and lighted it from the glowing tip of mr treffrys cigar by light of which his head and hat looked like some giant mushroom suddenly the wheels jolted on a rubble of loose stones the carriage was swung sideways the scared horses straining asunder leaped forward and sped downwards in the darkness  past rocks trees dwellings past a lighted house that gleamed and vanished with a clink and clatter a flirt of dust and pebbles and the side lamps throwing out a frisky orange blink the carriage dashed down sinking and rising like a boat crossing billows the world seemed to rock and sway to dance up and be flung flat again only the stars stood still  mr treffry putting on the brake muttered apologetically a little out ohand  suddenly with a headlong dive the carriage swayed as if it would fly in pieces slithered along and with a jerk steadied itself harz lifted his voice in a shout of pure excitement mr treffry let out a short shaky howl and from behind there rose a wail but the hill was over and the startled horses were cantering with a free smooth motion mr treffry and harz looked at each other     xvii  mr treffry said with a sort of laugh near go eh you drive no thats a pity broken most of my bones at the gamenothing like it each felt a kind of admiration for the other that he had not felt before presently mr treffry began look here mr harz my niece is a slip of a thing with all a young girls notions what have you got to give her eh yourself thats surely not enough mind thissix months after marriage we all turn out much the samea selfish lot not to mention this anarchist affair  youre not of her blood nor of her way of life nor anythingits taking chancesand his hand came down on the young mans knee im fond of her you see  if you were in my place said harz would you give her up  mr treffry groaned lord knows  men have made themselves before now for those who dont believe in failure theres no such thing suppose she does suffer a little will it do her any harm fair weather love is no good  mr treffry sighed  brave words sir youll pardon me if im too old to understand em when theyre used about my niece  he pulled the horses up and peered into the darkness were going through this bit quietly if they lose track of us here so much the better dominique put out the lamps soho my beauties the horses paced forward at a walk the muffled beat of their hoofs in the dust hardly broke the hush mr treffry pointed to the left itll be another thirtyfive miles to the frontier  they passed the whitewashed houses and village church with its sentinel cypresstrees a frog was croaking in a runlet there was a faint spicy scent of lemons but nothing stirred  it was wood now on either side the high pines breathing their fragrance out into the darkness and like ghosts amongst them the silver stems of birchtrees  mr treffry said gruffly you wont give her up her happiness means a lot to me  to you said harz to him and i am nothing do you think i dont care for her happiness is it a crime for me to love her  almost mr harzconsidering  considering that ive no money always money  to this sneer mr treffry made no answer clucking to his horses  my niece was born and bred a lady he said at last i ask you plainly what position have you got to give her  if she marries me said harz she comes into my world you think that im a common  mr treffry shook his head answer my question young man  but the painter did not answer it and silence fell  a light breeze had sprung up the whispering in the trees the rolling of the wheels in this night progress the pinedrugged air sent harz to sleep when he woke it was to the same tune varied by mr treffrys uneasy snoring the reins were hanging loose and peering out he saw dominique shuffling along at the horses heads he joined him and one on each side they plodded up and up a haze had begun to bathe the trees the stars burnt dim the air was colder mr treffry woke coughing it was like some long nightmare this interminable experience of muffled sounds and shapes of perpetual motion conceived and carried out in darkness but suddenly the day broke heralded by the snuffle of the horses light began glimmering over a chaos of lines and shadows pale as motheropearl the stars faded and in a smouldering zigzag the dawn fled along the mountain tops flinging out little isles of cloud from a lake curled in a hollow like a patch of smoke came the cry of a waterbird a cuckoo started a soft mocking and close to the carriage a lark flew up beasts and men alike stood still drinking in the airsweet with snows and dew and vibrating faintly with the running of the water and the rustling of the leaves  the night had played sad tricks with mr nicholas treffry his hat was grey with dust his cheeks brownishpurple there were heavy pouches beneath his eyes which stared painfully  well call a halt he said and give the gees their grub poor things can you find some water mr harz theres a rubber bucket in behind  cant get about myself this morning make that lazy fellow of mine stir his stumps  harz saw that he had drawn off one of his boots and stretched the foot out on a cushion  youre not fit to go farther he said youre ill  ill replied mr treffry not a bit of it  harz looked at him then catching up the bucket made off in search of water when he came back the horses were feeding from an indiarubber trough slung to the pole they stretched their heads towards the bucket pushing aside each others noses  the flame in the east had died but the tops of the larches were bathed in a gentle radiance and the peaks ahead were like amber everywhere were threads of water threads of snow and little threads of dewy green glistening like gossamer  mr treffry called out give me your arm mr harz id like to shake the reefs out of me when one comes to stand over at the knees its no such easy matter eh he groaned as he put his foot down and gripped the young mans shoulder as in a vise presently he lowered himself on to a stone  all over now as chris would say when she was little nasty temper she had tookick and scream on the floor never lasted long though kiss her take her up show her the pictures amazing fond of pictures chris was he looked dubiously at harz then took a long pull at his flask what would the doctor say whisky at four in the morning well thank the lord doctors arent always with us sitting on the stone with one hand pressed against his side and the other tilting up the flask he was grey from head to foot  harz had dropped on to another stone he too was worn out by the excitement and fatigue coming so soon after his illness his head was whirling and the next thing he remembered was a tree walking at him turning round yellow from the roots up everything seemed yellow even his own feet somebody opposite to him was jumping up and down a grey bearwith a hatmr treffry he cried haalloo and the figure seemed to fall and disappear  when harz came to himself a hand was pouring liquor into his mouth and a wet cloth was muffled round his brows a noise of humming and hoofs seemed familiar mr treffry loomed up alongside smoking a cigar he was muttering a low trick paulbit of my mind then as if a curtain had been snatched aside the vision before harz cleared again the carriage was winding between uneven blackeaved houses past doorways from which goats and cows were coming out with bells on their necks blackeyed boys and here and there a drowsy man with a long cherrystemmed pipe between his teeth stood aside to stare  mr treffry seemed to have taken a new lease of strength like an angry old dog he stared from side to side my bone he seemed to say lets see whos going to touch it  the last house vanished glowing in the early sunshine and the carriage with its trail of dust became entombed once more in the gloom of tall trees along a road that cleft a wilderness of mossgrown rocks and dewy stems through which the sun had not yet driven paths  dominique came round to them bearing appearance of one who has seen better days and a pot of coffee brewed on a spirit lamp breakfasthe saidwas served  the ears of the horses were twitching with fatigue mr treffry said sadly if i can see this through you can get on my beauties  as soon as the sun struck through the trees mr treffrys strength ebbed again he seemed to suffer greatly but did not complain they had reached the pass at last and the unchecked sunlight was streaming down with a blinding glare  jump up mr treffry cried out well make a finish of it and he gave the reins a jerk the horses flung up their heads and the bleak pass with its circling crown of jagged peaks soon slipped away  between the houses on the very top they passed at a slow trot and soon began slanting down the other side mr treffry brought them to a halt where a mule track joined the road  thats all i can do for you youd better leave me here he said keep this track down to the rivergo southyoull be in italy in a couple of hours get rail at feltre money yes well he held out his hand harz gripped it  give her up eh  harz shook his head  no then its pull devil pull baker between us goodbye and good luck to you and mustering his strength for a last attempt at dignity mr treffry gathered up the reins  harz watched his figure huddled again beneath the hood the carriage moved slowly away     xviii  at villa rubein people went about avoiding each other as if detected in conspiracy miss naylor who for an inscrutable reason had put on her best frock a purple relieved at the chest with birdseye blue conveyed an impression of trying to count a chicken which ran about too fast when greta asked what she had lost she was heard to mutter mrneedlecase  christian with big circles round her eyes sat silent at her little table she had had no sleep herr paul coming into the room about noon gave her a furtive look and went out again after this he went to his bedroom took off all his clothes flung them passionately one by one into a footbath and got into bed  i might be a criminal he muttered to himself while the buttons of his garments rattled on the bath  am i her father have i authority do i know the world bssss i might be a frog  mrs decie having caused herself to be announced found him smoking a cigar and counting the flies on the ceiling  if you have really done this paul she said in a restrained voice you have done a very unkind thing and what is worse you have made us all ridiculous but perhaps you have not done it  i have done it cried herr paul staring dreadfully i have done it i tell you i have done it  very well you have done itand why pray what conceivable good was there in it i suppose you know that nicholas has driven him to the frontier nicholas is probably more dead than alive by this time you know his state of health  herr pauls fingers ploughed up his beard  nicholas is madand the girl is mad leave me alone i will not be made angry do you understand i will not be worriedi am not fit for it his prominent brown eyes stared round the room as if looking for a way of escape  if i may prophesy you will be worried a good deal said mrs decie coldly before you have finished with this affair  the anxious uncertain glance which herr paul gave her at these words roused an unwilling feeling of compunction in her  you are not made for the outraged father of the family she said you had better give up the attitude paul it does not suit you  herr paul groaned  i suppose it is not your fault she added  just then the door was opened and fritz with an air of saying the right thing announced  a gentleman of the police to see you sir  herr paul bounded  keep him out he cried  mrs decie covering her lips disappeared with a rustling of silk in her place stood a stiff man in blue  thus the morning dragged itself away without any one being able to settle to anything except herr paul who was settled in bed as was fitting in a house that had lost its soul meals were neglected even by the dog  about three oclock a telegram came for christian containing these words all right self returns tomorrow treffry after reading it she put on her hat and went out followed closely by greta who when she thought that she would not be sent away ran up from behind and pulled her by the sleeve  let me come chrisi shall not talk  the two girls walked on together when they had gone some distance christian said  im going to get his pictures and take charge of them  oh said greta timidly  if you are afraid said christian you had better go back home  i am not afraid chris said greta meekly  neither girl spoke again till they had taken the path along the wall over the tops of the vines the heat was dancing  the sunfairies are on the vines murmured greta to herself  at the old house they stopped and christian breathing quickly pushed the door it was immovable  look said greta they have screwed it she pointed out three screws with a rosytipped forefinger  christian stamped her foot  we mustnt stand here she said lets sit on that bench and think  yes murmured greta let us think dangling an end of hair she regarded christian with her wide blue eyes  i cant make any plan christian cried at last while you stare at me like that  i was thinking said greta humbly if they have screwed it up perhaps we shall screw it down again there is the big screwdriver of fritz  it would take a long time people are always passing  people do not pass in the evening murmured greta because the gate at our end is always shut  christian rose  we will come this evening just before the gate is shut  but chris how shall we get back again  i dont know i mean to have the pictures  it is not a high gate murmured greta  after dinner the girls went to their room greta bearing with her the big screwdriver of fritz at dusk they slipped downstairs and out  they arrived at the old house and stood listening in the shadow of the doorway the only sounds were those of distant barking dogs and of the bugles at the barracks  quick whispered christian and greta with all the strength of her small hands began to turn the screws it was some time before they yielded the third was very obstinate till christian took the screwdriver and passionately gave the screw a starting twist  it is like a pigthat one said greta rubbing her wrists mournfully  the opened door revealed the gloom of the dank rooms and twisting staircase then fell to behind them with a clatter  greta gave a little scream and caught her sisters dress  it is dark she gasped o chris it is dark  christian groped for the bottom stair and greta felt her arm shaking  suppose there is a man to keep guard o chris suppose there are bats  you are a baby christian answered in a trembling voice you had better go home  greta choked a little in the dark  i amnotgoing home but im afraid of bats o chris arent you afraid  yes said christian but im going to have the pictures  her cheeks were burning she was trembling all over having found the bottom step she began to mount with greta clinging to her skirts  the haze above inspired a little courage in the child who of all things hated darkness the blanket across the doorway of the loft had been taken down there was nothing to veil the empty room  nobody here you see said christian  noo whispered greta running to the window and clinging to the wall like one of the bats she dreaded  but they have been here cried christian angrily they have broken this she pointed to the fragments of a plaster cast that had been thrown down  out of the corner she began to pull the canvases set in rough wooden frames dragging them with all her strength  help me she cried it will be dark directly  they collected a heap of sketches and three large pictures piling them before the window and peering at them in the failing light  greta said ruefully  o chris they are heavy ones we shall never carry them and the gate is shut now  christian took a pointed knife from the table  i shall cut them out of the frames she said listen whats that  it was the sound of whistling which stopped beneath the window the girls clasping each others hands dropped on their knees  hallo cried a voice  greta crept to the window and placing her face level with the floor peered over  it is only dr edmund he doesnt know then she whispered i shall call him he is going away cried christian catching her sistersdont cried christian catching her sisters dress  he would help us greta said reproachfully and it would not be so dark if he were here  christians cheeks were burning  i dont choose she said and began handling the pictures feeling their edges with her knife  chris suppose anybody came  the door is screwed christian answered absently  o chris we screwed it unscrewed anybody who wishes shall come  christian leaning her chin in her hands gazed at her thoughtfully  it will take a long time to cut these pictures out carefully or perhaps i can get them out without cutting you must screw me up and go home in the morning you must come early when the gate is open unscrew me again and help carry the pictures  greta did not answer at once at last she shook her head violently  i am afraid she gasped  we cant both stay here all night said christian if any one comes to our room there will be nobody to answer we cant lift these pictures over the gate one of us must go back you can climb over the gatethere is nothing to be afraid of  greta pressed her hands together  do you want the pictures badly chris  christian nodded  very badly  yesyesyes  greta remained sitting where she was shivering violently as a little animal shivers when it scents danger at last she rose  i am going she said in a despairing voice at the doorway she turned  if miss naylor shall ask me where you are chris i shall be telling her a story  christian started  i forgot thato greta i am sorry i will go instead  greta took another stepa quick one  i shall die if i stay here alone she said i can tell her that you are in bed you must go to bed here chris so it shall be true after all  christian threw her arms about her  i am so sorry darling i wish i could go instead but if you have to tell a lie i would tell a straight one  would you said greta doubtfully  yes  i think said greta to herself beginning to descend the stairs i think i will tell it in my way she shuddered and went on groping in the darkness  christian listened for the sound of the screws it came slowly threatening her with danger and solitude  sinking on her knees she began to work at freeing the canvas of a picture her heart throbbed distressfully at the stir of windbreath or any distant note of clamour she stopped and held her breathing no sounds came near she toiled on trying only to think that she was at the very spot where last night his arms had been round her how long ago it seemed she was full of vague terror overmastered by the darkness dreadfully alone the new glow of resolution seemed suddenly to have died down in her heart and left her cold  she would never be fit to be his wife if at the first test her courage failed she set her teeth and suddenly she felt a kind of exultation as if she too were entering into life were knowing something within herself that she had never known before her fingers hurt and the pain even gave pleasure her cheeks were burning her breath came fast they could not stop her now this feverish task in darkness was her baptism into life she finished and rolling the pictures very carefully tied them with cord she had done something for him nobody could take that from her she had a part of him this night had made him hers they might do their worst she lay down on his mattress and soon fell asleep  she was awakened by scruffs tongue against her face greta was standing by her side  wake up chris the gate is open  in the cold early light the child seemed to glow with warmth and colour her eyes were dancing  i am not afraid now scruff and i sat up all night to catch the morningithink it was fun and o chris she ended with a rueful gleam in her eyes i told it  christian hugged her  comequick there is nobody about are those the pictures  each supporting an end the girls carried the bundle downstairs and set out with their corpselike burden along the wallpath between the river and the vines     xix  hidden by the shade of rosebushes greta lay stretched at length cheek on arm sleeping the sleep of the unrighteous through the flowers the sun flicked her parted lips with kisses and spilled the withered petals on her in a denser islet of shade scruff lay snapping at a fly his head lolled drowsily in the middle of a snap and snapped in the middle of a loll  at three oclock miss naylor too came out carrying a basket and pair of scissors lifting her skirts to avoid the lakes of water left by the garden hose she stopped in front of a rosebush and began to snip off the shrivelled flowers the little ladys silvered head and thin brown face sustained the shower of sunlight unprotected and had a gentle dignity in their freedom  presently as the scissors flittered in and out of the leaves she began talking to herself  if girls were more like what they used to be this would not have happened perhaps we dont understand its very easy to forget burying her nose and lips in a rose she sniffed poor dear girl its such a pity his father isa  a farmer said a sleepy voice behind the rosebush  miss naylor leaped greta how you startled me a farmerthat isanan agriculturalist  a farmer with vineyardshe told us and he is not ashamed why is it a pity miss naylor  miss naylors lips looked very thin  for many reasons of which you know nothing  that is what you always say pursued the sleepy voice and that is why when i am to be married there shall also be a pity  greta miss naylor cried it is not proper for a girl of your age to talk like that  why said greta because it is the truth  miss naylor made no reply to this but vexedly cut off a sound rose which she hastily picked up and regarded with contrition greta spoke again  chris said i have got the pictures i shall tell her but i shall tell you instead because it was i that told the story  miss naylor stared wrinkling her nose and holding the scissors wide apart  last night said greta slowly i and chris went to his studio and took his pictures and so because the gate was shut i came back to tell it and when you asked me where chris was i told it because she was in the studio all night and i and scruff sat up all night and in the morning we brought the pictures and hid them under our beds and that is whywearesosleepy  over the rosebush miss naylor peered down at her and though she was obliged to stand on tiptoe this did not altogether destroy her dignity  i am surprised at you greta i am surprised at christian more surprised at christian the world seems upside down  greta a sunbeam entangled in her hair regarded her with inscrutable innocent eyes  when you were a girl i think you would be sure to be in love she murmured drowsily  miss naylor flushing deeply snipped off a particularly healthy bud  and so because you are not married i think  the scissors hissed  greta nestled down again i think it is wicked to cut off all the good buds she said and shut her eyes  miss naylor continued to peer across the rosebush but her thin face close to the glistening leaves had become oddly soft pink and girlish at a deeper breath from greta the little lady put down her basket and began to pace the lawn followed dubiously by scruff it was thus that christian came on them  miss naylor slipped her arm into the girls and though she made no sound her lips kept opening and shutting like the beak of a bird contemplating a worm  christian spoke first  miss naylor i want to tell you please  oh my dear i know greta has been in the confessional before you she gave the girls arm a squeeze isnt it a lovely day did you ever see five fingers look so beautiful and she pointed to the great peaks of the funffingerspitze glittering in the sun like giant crystals  i like them better with clouds about them  well agreed miss naylor nervously they certainly are nicer with clouds about them they look almost hot and greasy dont they my dear she went on giving christians arm a dozen little squeezes we all of usthat is we all of us  christian turned her eyes away  my dear miss naylor tried again i am farthat is i mean to all of us at some time or anotherand then you seewellit is hard  christian kissed the gloved hand resting on her arm miss naylor bobbed her head a tear trickled off her nose  do let us wind your skein of woof she said with resounding gaiety  some halfhour later mrs decie called christian to her room  my dear she said come here a minute i have a message for you  christian went with an odd set look about her mouth  her aunt was sitting back to the light tapping a bowl of goldfish with the tip of a polished fingernail the room was very cool she held a letter out your uncle is not coming back tonight  christian took the letter it was curtly worded in a thin toppling hand  dear concant get back tonight sending dominique for things tell christian to come over with him for night if possibleyr aff brother nicls treffry  dominique has a carriage here said mrs decie you will have nice time to catch the train give my love to your uncle you must take barbi with you i insist on that she rose from her chair and held christians hand my dear you look very tiredvery almost ill i dont like to see you look like that come she thrust her pale lips forward and kissed the girls paler cheek  then as christian left the room she sank back in her chair with creases in her forehead and began languidly to cut a magazine poor christian she thought how hardly she does take it i am sorry for her but perhaps its just as well as things are turning out psychologically it is interesting  christian found her things packed and the two servants waiting in a few minutes they were driving to the station she made dominique take the seat opposite  well she asked him  dominiques eyebrows twitched he smiled deprecatingly  mmselle mr treffry told me to hold my tongue  but you can tell me dominique barbi cant understand  to you then mmselle said dominique as one who accepts his fate to you then who will doubtless forget all that i shall tell youmy master is not well he has terrible pain here he has a cough he is not well at all not well at all  a feeling of dismay seized on the girl  we were a caravan for all that night dominique resumed in the morning by noon we ceased to be a caravan signor harz took a mule path he will be in italycertainly in italy as for us we stayed at san martino and my master went to bed it was time i had much trouble with his clothes his legs were swollen in the afternoon came a signor of police on horseback red and hot i persuaded him that we were at paneveggio but as we were not he came back angrymon die as angry as a cat it was not good to meet himwhen he was with my master i was outside there was much noise i do not know what passed but at last the signor came out through the door and went away in a hurry dominiques features were fixed in a sardonic grin he rubbed the palm of one hand with the finger of the other mr treffry made me give him whisky afterwards and he had no money to pay the billthat i know because i paid it well mmselle today he would be dressed and very slowly we came as far as auer there he could do no more so went to bed he is not well at all  christian was overwhelmed by forebodings the rest of the journey was made in silence except when barbi a country girl filled with the delirium of railway travel sighed ach gnadige fraulein looking at christian with pleasant eyes  at once on arriving at the little hostel christian went to see her uncle his room was darkened and smelt of beeswax  ah chris he said glad to see you  in a blue flannel gown with a rug over his feet he was lying on a couch lengthened artificially by chairs the arm he reached out issued many inches from its sleeve and showed the corded veins of the wrist christian settling his pillows looked anxiously into his eyes  im not quite the thing chris said mr treffry somehow not quite the thing ill come back with you tomorrow  let me send for dr dawney uncle  nono plenty of him when i get home very good young fellow as doctors go but i cant stand his puddinsslops and puddins and all that trumpery medicine on the top send me dominique my dearill put myself to rights a bit he fingered his unshaven cheek and clutched the gown together on his chest got this from the landlord when you come back well have a little talk  he was asleep when she came into the room an hour later watching his uneasy breathing she wondered what it was that he was going to say  he looked ill and suddenly she realised that her thoughts were not of him when she was little he would take her on his back he had built cocked hats for her and paper boats had taught her to ride slid her between his knees given her things without number and taken his payment in kisses and now he was ill and she was not thinking of him he had been all that was most dear to her yet before her eyes would only come the vision of another  mr treffry woke suddenly not been asleep have i the beds here are infernal hard  uncle nic wont you give me news of him  mr treffry looked at her and christian could not bear that look  hes safe into italy they arent very keen after him its so long ago i squared em pretty easily now look here chris  christian came close he took her hand  id like to see you pull yourself together tisnt so much the position tisnt so much the money because after all theres always mine christian shook her head but he went on with shaky emphasis theres the difference of blood and thats a serious thing and theres this anarchthis political affair and theres the sort of life an thats a serious thing butwhat im coming to is this christheres the man  christian drew away her hand mr treffry went on  ah yes im an old chap and fond of you but i must speak out what i think hes got pluck hes strong hes in earnest but hes got a damned hot temper hes an egotist andhes not the man for you if you marry him as sure as i lie here youll be sorry for it youre not your fathers child for nothing nice fellow as ever lived but soft as butter if you take this chap itll be like mixing earth and ironstone and they dont blend he dropped his head back on the pillows and stretching out his hand repeated wistfully take my word for it my dear hes not the man for you  christian staring at the wall beyond said quietly i cant take any ones word for that  ah muttered mr treffry youre obstinate enough but obstinacy isnt strength  youll give up everything to him youll lick his shoes and youll never play anything but second fiddle in his life hell always be first with himself he and his work or whatever he calls painting pictures and some day youll find that out you wont like it and i dont like it for you chris and thats flat  he wiped his brow where the perspiration stood in beads  christian said you dont understand you dont believe in him you dont see if i do come after his workif i do give him everything and he cant give all backi dont care hell give what he can i dont want any more if youre afraid of the life for me uncle if you think itll be too hard  mr treffry bowed his head i do chris  well then i hate to be wrapped in cotton wool i want to breathe if i come to grief its my own affair nobody need mind  mr treffrys fingers sought his beard ah yes just so  christian sank on her knees  oh uncle im a selfish beast  mr treffry laid his hand against her cheek i think i could do with a nap he said  swallowing a lump in her throat she stole out of the room     xx  by a stroke of fate mr treffrys return to villa rubein befell at the psychological moment when herr paul in a suit of rather too bright blue was starting for vienna  as soon as he saw the carriage appear between the poplars he became as pensive as a boy caught in the act of stealing cherries pitching his hatbox to fritz he recovered himself however in time to whistle while mr treffry was being assisted into the house having forgotten his anger he was only anxious now to smooth out its after effects in the glances he cast at christian and his brotherinlaw there was a kind of shamed entreaty which seemed to say for goodness sake dont worry me about that business again nothings come of it you see  he came forward ah mon cher so you return i put off my departure then vienna must wait for methat poor vienna  but noticing the extreme feebleness of mr treffrys advance he exclaimed with genuine concern  what is it youre ill my god after disappearing for five minutes he came back with a whitish liquid in a glass  there he said good for the goutfor a coughfor everything  mr treffry sniffed drained the glass and sucked his moustache  ah he said no doubt but its uncommonly like gin paul then turning to christian he said shake hands you two  christian looked from one to the other and at last held out her hand to herr paul who brushed it with his moustache gazing after her as she left the room with a queer expression  my dear he began you support her in this execrable matter you forget my position you make me ridiculous i have been obliged to go to bed in my own house absolutely to go to bed because i was in danger of becoming funny  look here paul mr treffry said gruffly if any ones to bully chris its i  in that case returned herr paul sarcastically i will go to vienna  you may go to the devil said mr treffry and ill tell you whatin my opinion it was low to set the police on that young chap a low dirty trick  herr paul divided his beard carefully in two took his seat on the very edge of an armchair and placing his hands on his parted knees said  i have regretted it sincemais que diable he called me a cowardit is very hot weatherthere were drinks at the kurhausi am her guardianthe affair is a very beastly onethere were more drinksi was a little enfin he shrugged his shoulders adieu my dear i shall be some time in vienna i need rest he rose and went to the door then he turned and waved his cigar adieu be good get well i will buy you some cigars up there and going out he shut the door on any possibility of answer  mr treffry lay back amongst his cushions the clock ticked pigeons cooed on the veranda a door opened in the distance and for a moment a treble voice was heard mr treffrys head drooped forward across his face gloomy and rugged fell a thin line of sunlight  the clock suddenly stopped ticking and outside in mysterious accord the pigeons rose with a great fluttering of wings and flew off mr treffry made a startled heavy movement he tried to get on to his feet and reach the bell but could not and sat on the side of the couch with drops of sweat rolling off his forehead and his hands clawing his chest there was no sound at all throughout the house he looked about him and tried to call but again could not he tried once more to reach the bell and failing sat still with a thought that made him cold  im done for he muttered by george i believe im done for this time a voice behind him said  can we have a look at you sir  ah doctor bear a hand theres a good fellow  dawney propped him against the cushions and loosened his shirt receiving no answer to his questions he stepped alarmed towards the bell mr treffry stopped him with a sign  lets hear what you make of me he said  when dawney had examined him he asked  well  well answered dawney slowly theres trouble of course  mr treffry broke out with a husky whisper out with it doctor dont humbug me  dawney bent down and took his wrist  i dont know how youve got into this state sir he said with the brusqueness of emotion youre in a bad way its the old trouble and you know what that means as well as i all i can tell you is im going to have a big fight with it it shant be my fault theres my hand on that  mr treffry lay with his eyes fixed on the ceiling at last he said  i want to live  yesyes  i feel better now dont make a fuss about it itll be very awkward if i die just now patch me up for the sake of my niece  dawney nodded one minute there are a few things i want and he went out  a moment later greta stole in on tiptoe she bent over till her hair touched mr treffrys face  uncle nic she whispered he opened his eyes  hallo greta  i have come to bring you my love uncle nic and to say goodbye papa says that i and scruff and miss naylor are going to vienna with him we have had to pack in half an hour in five minutes we are going to vienna and it is my first visit there uncle nic  to vienna mr treffry repeated slowly dont have a guide greta theyre humbugs  no uncle nic said greta solemnly  draw the curtains old girl lets have a look at you why youre as smart as ninepence  yes said greta with a sigh touching the buttons of her cape because i am going to vienna but i am sorry to leave you uncle nic  are you greta  but you will

humbugs  no uncle nic there is the carriage to vienna uncle nic the dead gold of her hair gleamed in the doorway mr treffry raised himself upon his elbow  give us one more for luck  greta ran back  i love you very much she said and kissing him backed slowly then turning flew out like a bird  mr treffry fixed his eyes on the shut door     xxi  after many days of hot still weather the wind had come and whirled the dust along the parched roads the leaves were all astir like tiny wings round villa rubein the pigeons cooed uneasily all the other birds were silent late in the afternoon christian came out on the veranda reading a letter  dear chriswe are here now six days and it is a very large place with many churches in the first place then we have been to a great many but the nicest of them is not st stephans kirche it is another but i do not remember the name papa is out nearly all the night he says he is resting here so he is not able to come to the churches with us but i do not think he rests very much the day before yesterday we that is papa i and miss naylor went to an exhibition of pictures it was quite beautiful and interesting miss naylor says it is not right to say quite beautiful but i do not know what other word could mean quite except the word quite because it is not exceedingly and not extremely and o chris there was one picture painted by him it was about a ship without mastsmiss naylor says it is a barge but i do not know what a barge ison fire and floating down a river in a fog i think it is extremely beautiful miss naylor says it is very impressionistickwhat is that and papa said puh but he did not know it was painted by herr harz so i did not tell him  there has also been staying at our hotel that count sarelli who came one evening to dinner at our house but he is gone away now he sat all day in the winter garden reading and at night he went out with papa miss naylor says he is unhappy but i think he does not take enough exercise and o chris one day he said to me that is your sister mademoiselle that young lady in the white dress does she always wear white dresses and i said to him it is not always a white dress in the picture it is green because the picture is called spring but i did not tell him the colours of all your dresses because he looked so tired then he said to me she is very charming so i tell you this chris because i think you shall like to know scruff has a sore toe it is because he has eaten too much meat  it is not nice without you chris and miss naylor says i am improving my mind here but i do not think it shall improve very much because at night i like it always best when the shops are lighted and the carriages are driving past then i am wanting to dance the first night papa said he would take me to the theatre but yesterday he said it was not good for me perhaps tomorrow he shall think it good for me again  yesterday we have been in the prater and saw many people and some that papa knew and then came the most interesting part of all sitting under the trees in the rain for two hours because we could not get a carriage very exciting  there is one young lady here only she is not any longer very young who knew papa when he was a boy i like her very much she shall soon know me quite to the bottom and is very kind  the ill husband of cousin teresa who went with us to meran and lost her umbrella and dr edmund was so sorry about it has been very much worse so she is not here but in baden i wrote to her but have no news so i do not know whether he is still living or not at any rate he cant get well again so soon and i dont think he ever shall i think as the weather is very warm you and uncle nic are sitting much out of doors i am sending presents to you all in a wooden box and screwed very firm so you shall have to use again the big screwdriver of fritz for aunt constance photographs for uncle nic a green bird on a stand with a hole in the back of the bird to put his ashes in it is a good green and not expensif please tell him because he does not like expensif presents miss naylor says the bird has an inquiring eyeit is a parrat for you a little brooch of turquoise because i like them best for dr edmund a machine to weigh medicines in because he said he could not get a good one in botzen this is a very good one the shopman told me so and is the most expensif of all the presentsso that is all my money except two gulden if papa shall give me some more i shall buy for miss naylor a parasol because it is useful and the handle of hers is wobbley that is one of dr edmunds words and i like it  goodbye for this time greta sends you her kiss  p smiss naylor has read all this letter except about the parasol and there are several things she did not want me to put so i have copied it without the things but at the last i have kept that copy myself so that is why this is smudgy and several words are not spelt well but all the things are here  christian read smiling but to finish it was like dropping a talisman and her face clouded a sudden draught blew her hair about and from within mr treffrys cough mingled with the soughing of the wind the sky was fast blackening she went indoors took a pen and began to write  my friendwhy havent you written to me it is so long to wait uncle says you are in italyit is dreadful not to know for certain i feel you would have written if you could and i cant help thinking of all the things that may have happened i am unhappy uncle nic is ill he will not confess it that is his way but he is very ill though perhaps you will never see this i must write down all my thoughts sometimes i feel that i am brutal to be always thinking about you scheming how to be with you again when he is lying there so ill how good he has always been to me it is terrible that love should pull one apart so surely love should be beautiful and peaceful instead of filling me with bitter wicked thoughts i love youand i love him i feel as if i were torn in two why should it be so why should the beginning of one life mean the ending of another one love the destruction of another i dont understand the same spirit makes me love you and him the same sympathy the same trustyet it sometimes seems as if i were a criminal in loving you you know what he thinkshe is too honest not to have shown you he has talked to me he likes you in a way but you are a foreignerhe saysyour life is not my life he is not the man for you those were his words and now he doesnt talk to me but when i am in the room he looks at methats worsea thousand times when he talks it rouses me to fightwhen its his eyes only im a coward at once i feel i would do anything anything only not to hurt him why cant he see is it because hes old and we are young he may consent but he will never never see it will always hurt him  i want to tell you everything i have had worse thoughts than thesesometimes i have thought that i should never have the courage to face the struggle which you have to face then i feel quite broken it is like something giving way in me then i think of you and it is over but it has been there and i am ashamedi told you i was a coward its like the feeling one would have going out into a storm on a dark night away from a warm fireonly of the spirit not the bodywhich makes it worse i had to tell you this you mustnt think of it again i mean to fight it away and forget that it has ever been there but uncle nicwhat am i to do i hate myself because i am young and he is old and weaksometimes i seem even to hate him i have all sorts of thoughts and always at the end of them like a dark hole at the end of a passage the thought that i ought to give you up ought i tell me i want to know i want to do what is right i still want to do that though sometimes i think i am all made of evil  do you remember once when we were talking you said nature always has an answer for every question you cannot get an answer from laws conventions theories words only from nature what do you say to me now do you tell me it is nature to come to you in spite of everything and so that it must be right i think you would but can it be nature to do something which will hurt terribly one whom i love and who loves me if it isnature is cruel is that one of the lessons of life is that what aunt constance means when she says if life were not a paradox we could not get on at all i am beginning to see that everything has its dark side i never believed that before  uncle nic dreads the life for me he doesnt understand how should hehe has always had money how life can be tolerable without moneyit is horrible that the accident of money should make such difference in our lives i am sometimes afraid myself and i cant outface that fear in him he sees the shadow of his fear in mehis eyes seem to see everything that is in me now the eyes of old people are the saddest things in the world i am writing like a wretched coward but you will never see this letter i suppose and so it doesnt matter but if you do and i pray that you maywell if i am only worth taking at my best i am not worth taking at all i want you to know the worst of meyou and no one else  with uncle nic it is not as with my stepfather his opposition only makes me angry mad ready to do anything but with uncle nic i feel so bruisedso sore he said it is not so much the money because there is always mine i could never do a thing he cannot bear and take his money and you would never let me one knows very little of anything in the world till trouble comes you know how it is with flowers and trees in the early spring they look so quiet and selfcontained then all in a moment they changei think it must be like that with the heart i used to think i knew a great deal understood why and how things came about i thought selfpossession and reason so easy now i know nothing and nothing in the world matters but to see you and hide away from that look in uncle nics eyes three months ago i did not know you now i write like this whatever i look at i try to see as you would see i feel now you are away even more than when you were with me what your thoughts would be how you would feel about this or that some things you have said seem always in my mind like lights  a slanting drift of rain was striking the veranda tiles with a cold ceaseless hissing christian shut the window and went into her uncles room  he was lying with closed eyes growling at dominique who moved about noiselessly putting the room ready for the night when he had finished and with a compassionate bow had left the room mr treffry opened his eyes and said  this is beastly stuff of the doctors chris it puts my monkey up i cant help swearing after ive taken it its as beastly as a vulgar womans laugh and i dont know anything beastlier than that  i have a letter from greta uncle nic shall i read it  he nodded and christian read the letter leaving out the mention of harz and for some undefined reason the part about sarelli  ay said mr treffry with a feeble laugh greta and her money send her some more chris wish i were a youngster again thats a beast of a proverb about a dog and his day id like to go fishing again in the west country a fine time we had when we were youngsters you dont get such times these days twasnt often the fishingsmacks went out without us wed watch their lights from our bedroom window when they were swung aboard we were out and down to the quay before you could say knife they always waited for us but your uncle dan was the favourite he was the chap for luck when i get on my legs we might go down there you and i for a bit just to see what dyou say old girl  their eyes met  id like to look at the smack lights going to sea on a dark night pity youre such a duffer in a boatwe might go out with them do you a power of good youre not looking the thing my dear  his voice died wistfully and his glance sweeping her face rested on her hands which held and twisted gretas letter after a minute or two of silence he boomed out again with sudden energy  your auntll want to come and sit with me after dinner dont let her chris i cant stand it tell her im asleepthe doctorll be here directly ask him to make up some humbug for youits his business  he was seized by a violent fit of pain which seemed to stab his breath away and when it was over signed that he would be left alone christian went back to her letter in the other room and had written these words when the gong summoned her to dinner  im like a leaf in the wind i put out my hand to one thing and its seized and twisted and flung aside i want youi want you if i could see you i think i should know what to do     xxii  the rain drove with increasing fury the night was very black nicholas treffry slept heavily by the side of his bed the nightlamp cast on to the opposite wall a bright disc festooned by the hanging shadow of the ceiling christian was leaning over him for the moment he filled all her heart lying there so helpless fearful of waking him she slipped into the sittingroom outside the window stood a man with his face pressed to the pane her heart thumped she went up and unlatched the window it was harz with the rain dripping off him he let fall his hat and cape  you she said touching his sleeve you you  he was sodden with wet his face drawn and tired a dark growth of beard covered his cheeks and chin  where is your uncle he said i want to see him  she put her hand up to his lips but he caught it and covered it with kisses  hes asleepillspeak gently  i came to him first he muttered  christian lit the lamp and he looked at her hungrily without a word  its not possible to go on like this i came to tell your uncle so he is a man as for the other i want to have nothing to do with him i came back on foot across the mountains its not possible to go on like this christian  she handed him her letter he held it to the light clearing his brow of raindrops when he had read to the last word he gave it her back and whispered come  her lips moved but she did not speak  while this goes on i cant work i can do nothing i canti wont bargain with my work if its to be that we had better end it what are we waiting for sooner or later we must come to this im sorry that hes ill god knows but that changes nothing to wait is tying me hand and footits making me afraid fear kills it will kill you it kills work and i must work i cant waste timei wont i will sooner give you up he put his hands on her shoulders i love you i want you look in my eyes and see if you dare hold back  christian stood with the grip of his strong hands on her shoulders without a movement or sign her face was very white and suddenly he began to kiss that pale still face to kiss its eyes and lips to kiss it from its chin up to its hair and it stayed pale as a white flower beneath those kissesas a white flower whose stalk the fingers bend back a little  there was a sound of knocking on the wall mr treffry called feebly christian broke away from harz  tomorrow he whispered and picking up his hat and cloak went out again into the rain     xxiii  it was not till morning that christian fell into a troubled sleep she dreamed that a voice was calling her and she was filled with a helpless dumb dream terror  when she woke the light was streaming in it was sunday and the cathedral bells were chiming her first thought was of harz one step one moment of courage why had she not told her uncle if he had only asked but whywhy should she tell him when it was over and she was gone he would see that all was for the best  her eyes fell on gretas empty bed she sprang up and bending over kissed the pillow she will mind at first but shes so young nobody will really miss me except uncle nic she stood along while in the window without moving when she was dressed she called out to her maid  bring me some milk barbi im going to church  ach gnadiges fraulein will you no breakfast have  no thank you barbi  liebes fraulein what a beautiful morning after the rain it has become how cool it is for you goodfor the colour in your cheeks now they will bloom again and barbi stroked her own wellcoloured cheeks  dominique sunning himself outside with a cloth across his arm bowed as she passed and smiled affectionately  he is better this morning mmselle we marchwe are getting on good news will put the heart into you  christian thought how sweet every one is today  even the villa seemed to greet her with the sun aslant on it and the trees trembling and weeping golden tears at the cathedral she was early for the service but here and there were figures on their knees the faint sickly odour of longburnt incense clung in the air a priest moved silently at the far end she knelt and when at last she rose the service had begun with the sound of the intoning a sense of peace came to herthe peace of resolution for good or bad she felt that she had faced her fate  she went out with a look of quiet serenity and walked home along the dyke close to harzs studio she sat down nowit was her own all that had belonged to him that had ever had a part in him  an old beggar who had been watching her came gently from behind gracious lady he said peering at her eyes this is the lucky day for you i have lost my luck  christian opened her purse there was only one coin in it a gold piece the beggars eyes sparkled  she thought suddenly its no longer mine i must begin to be careful but she felt ashamed when she looked at the old man  i am sorry she said yesterday i would have given you this butbut now its already given  he seemed so old and poorwhat could she give him she unhooked a little silver brooch at her throat you will get something for that she said its better than nothing i am very sorry you are so old and poor  the beggar crossed himself gracious lady he muttered may you never want  christian hurried on the rustling of leaves soon carried the words away she did not feel inclined to go in and crossing the bridge began to climb the hill there was a gentle breeze drifting the clouds across the sun lizards darted out over the walls looked at her and whisked away  the sunshine dappling through the tops of trees gashed down on a torrent the earth smelt sweet the vineyards round the white farms glistened everything seemed to leap and dance with sap and life it was a moment of spring in midsummer christian walked on wondering at her own happiness  am i heartless she thought i am going to leave himi am going into life i shall have to fight now therell be no looking back  the path broke away and wound down to the level of the torrent on the other side it rose again and was lost among trees the woods were dank she hastened home  in her room she began to pack sorting and tearing up old letters only one thing matters she thought singleness of heart to see your way and keep to it with all your might  she looked up and saw barbi standing before her with towels in her hands and a scared face  are you going a journey gnadiges fraulein  i am going away to be married barbi said christian at last dont speak of it to any one please  barbi leant a little forward with the towels clasped to the blue cotton bosom of her dress  no no i will not speak but dear fraulein that is a big matter have you well thought  thought barbi have i not  but dear fraulein will you be rich  no i shall be as poor as you  ach dear god that is terrible katrina my sister she is married she tells me all her life she tells me it is very hard and but for the money in her stocking it would be harder dear fraulein think again and is he good sometimes they are not good  he is good said christian rising it is all settled and she kissed barbi on the cheek  you are crying liebes fraulein think yet again perhaps it is not quite all settled it is not possible that a maiden should not a way out leave  christian smiled i dont do things that way barbi  barbi hung the towels on the horse and crossed herself     xxiv  mr treffrys gaze was fixed on a tortoiseshell butterfly fluttering round the ceiling the insect seemed to fascinate him as things which move quickly always fascinate the helpless christian came softly in  couldnt stay in bed chris he called out with an air of guilt the heat was something awful the doctor piped off in a huff just because o this he motioned towards a jug of claretcup and a pipe on the table by his elbow i was only looking at em  christian sitting down beside him took up a fan  if i could get out of this heat he said and closed his eyes  i must tell him she thought i cant slink away  pour me out some of that stuff chris  she reached for the jug yes she must tell him her heart sank  mr treffry took a lengthy draught broken my promise dont matterwont hurt any one but me he took up the pipe and pressed tobacco into it ive been lying here with this pain going right through me and never a smoke dyou tell me anything the parsons say can do me half the good of this pipe he leaned back steeped in a luxury of satisfaction he went on pursuing a private train of thought things have changed a lot since my young days when i was a youngster a young fellow had to look out for peck and perchhe put the future in his pocket he did well or not according as he had stuff in him now hes not content with that it seemstrades on his own opinion of himself thinks he is what he says hes going to be  you are unjust said christian  mr treffry grunted ah well i like to know where i am if i lend money to a man i like to know whether hes going to pay it back i may not care whether he does or not but i like to know the same with other things i dont care what a man hasthough mind you chris its not a bad rule that measures men by the balance at their banks but when it comes to marriage theres a very simple rule whats not enough for one is not enough for two you cant talk black white or bread into your mouth i dont care to speak about myself as you know chris but i tell you thiswhen i came to london i wanted to marryi hadnt any money and i had to want when i had the moneybut thats neither here nor there he frowned fingering his pipe  i didnt ask her chris i didnt think it the square thing it seems thats out of fashion  christians cheeks were burning  i think a lot while i lie here mr treffry went on nothing much else to do what i ask myself is this what do you know about whats best for you what do you know of life take it or leave it lifes not all you think its give and get all the way a fair start is everything  christian thought will he never see  mr treffry went on  i get better every day but i cant last for ever its not pleasant to lie here and know that when im gone therell be no one to keep a hand on the check string  dont talk like that dear christian murmured  its no use blinking facts chris ive lived a long time in the world ive seen things pretty well as they are and now theres not much left for me to think about but you  but uncle if you loved him as i do you couldnt tell me to be afraid its cowardly and mean to be afraid you must have forgotten  mr treffry closed his eyes  yes he said im old  the fan had dropped into christians lap it rested on her white frock like a large crimson leaf her eyes were fixed on it  mr treffry looked at her have you heard from him he asked with sudden intuition  last night in that room when you thought i was talking to dominique  the pipe fell from his hand  what he stammered back  christian without looking up said  yes hes back he wants mei must go to him uncle  there was a long silence  you must go to him he repeated  she longed to fling herself down at his knees but he was so still that to move seemed impossible she remained silent with folded hands  mr treffry spoke  youll let me knowbeforeyougo goodnight  christian stole out into the passage a bead curtain rustled in the draught voices reached her  my honour is involved or i would give the case up  he is very trying poor nicholas he always had that peculiar quality of opposition it has brought him to grief a hundred times there is opposition in our blood my family all have it my eldest brother died of it with my poor sister who was as gentle as a lamb it took the form of doing the right thing in the wrong place it is a matter of temperament you see you must have patience  patience repeated dawneys voice is one thing patience where there is responsibility is another ive not had a wink of sleep these last two nights  there was a faint shrill swish of silk  is he so very ill  christian held her breath the answer came at last  has he made his will with this trouble in the side again i tell you plainly mrs decie theres little or no chance  christian put her hands up to her ears and ran out into the air what was she about to do thento leave him dying     xxv  on the following day harz was summoned to the villa mr treffry had just risen and was garbed in a dressingsuit old and worn which had a certain air of magnificence his seamed cheeks were newly shaved  i hope i see you well he said majestically  thinking of the drive and their last parting harz felt sorry and ashamed suddenly christian came into the room she stood for a moment looking at him then sat down  chris said mr treffry reproachfully she shook her head and did not move mournful and intent her eyes seemed full of secret knowledge  mr treffry spoke  ive no right to blame you mr harz and chris tells me you came to see me first which is what i would have expected of you but you shouldnt have come back  i came back sir because i found i was obliged i must speak out  i ask nothing better mr treffry replied  harz looked again at christian but she made no sign sitting with her chin resting on her hands  i have come for her he said i can make my livingenough for both of us but i cant wait  why  harz made no answer  mr treffry boomed out again why isnt she worth waiting for isnt she worth serving for  i cant expect you to understand me the painter said my art is my life to me do you suppose that if it wasnt i should ever have left my village or gone through all that ive gone through to get as far even as i am you tell me to wait if my thoughts and my will arent free how can i work i shant be worth my salt you tell me to go back to englandknowing she is here amongst you who hate me a thousand miles away i shall know that theres a death fight going on in her and outside her against meyou think that i can go on working under these conditions others may be able i am not thats the plain truth if i loved her less  there was a silence then mr treffry said  it isnt fair to come here and ask what youre asking you dont know whats in the future for you you dont know that you can keep a wife it isnt pleasant either to think you cant hold up your head in your own country  harz turned white  ah you bring that up again he broke out seven years ago i was a boy and starving if you had been in my place you would have done what i did my country is as much to me as your country is to you ive been an exile seven years i suppose i shall always be ive had punishment enough but if you think i am a rascal ill go and give myself up he turned on his heel  stop i beg your pardon i never meant to hurt you it isnt easy for me to eat my words mr treffry said wistfully let that count for something he held out his hand  harz came quickly back and took it christians gaze was never for a moment withdrawn she seemed trying to store up the sight of him within her the light darting through the halfclosed shutters gave her eyes a strange bright intensity and shone in the folds of her white dress like the sheen of birds wings  mr treffry glanced uneasily about him god knows i dont want anything but her happiness he said what is it to me if youd murdered your mother its her im thinking of  how can you tell what is happiness to her you have your own ideas of happinessnot hers not mine you cant dare to stop us sir  dare said mr treffry her father gave her over to me when she was a mite of a little thing ive known her all her life iveive loved herand you come here with your dare his hand dragged at his beard and shook as though palsied  a look of terror came into christians face  all right chris i dont ask for quarter and i dont give it  harz made a gesture of despair  ive acted squarely by you sir mr treffry went on i ask the same of you i ask you to wait and come like an honest man when you can say i see my wayheres this and that for her what makes this art you talk of different from any other call in life it doesnt alter facts or give you what other men have no right to expect it doesnt put grit into you or keep your hands clean or prove that two and two make five  harz answered bitterly  you know as much of art as i know of money if we live a thousand years we shall never understand each other i am doing what i feel is best for both of us  mr treffry took hold of the painters sleeve  i make you an offer he said your word not to see or write to her for a year then position or not money or no money if shell have you ill make it right for you  i could not take your money  a kind of despair seemed suddenly to seize on mr nicholas treffry he rose and stood towering over them  all my life he said but something seemed to click deep down in his throat and he sank back in his seat  go whispered christian go but mr treffry found his voice again its for the child to say well chris  christian did not speak  it was harz who broke the silence he pointed to mr treffry  you know i cant tell you to come withthat there why did you send for me and turning he went out  christian sank on her knees burying her face in her hands mr treffry pressed his handkerchief with a stealthy movement to his mouth it was dyed crimson with the price of his victory     xxvi  a telegram had summoned herr paul from vienna he had started forthwith leaving several unpaid accounts to a more joyful opportunity amongst them a chemists bill for a wonderful quack medicine of which he brought six bottles  he came from mr treffrys room with tears rolling down his cheeks saying  poor nicholas poor nicholas il na pas de chance  it was difficult to find any one to listen the women were scared and silent waiting for the orders that were now and then whispered through the door herr paul could not bear this silence and talked to his servant for half an hour till fritz also vanished to fetch something from the town then in despair herr paul went to his room  it was hard not to be allowed to helpit was hard to wait when the heart was suffering it was frightful he turned and looking furtively about him lighted a cigar yes it came to every oneat some time or other and what was it that death they talked of was it any worse than life that frightful jumble people made for themselves poor nicholas after all it was he that had the luck  his eyes filled with tears and drawing a penknife from his pocket he began to stab it into the stuffing of his chair scruff who sat watching the chink of light under the door turned his head blinked at him and began feebly tapping with a claw  it was intolerable this uncertaintyto be near and yet so far was not endurable  herr paul stepped across the room the dog following threw his blackmarked muzzle upwards with a gruff noise and went back to the door his master was holding in his hand a bottle of champagne  poor nicholas he had chosen it herr paul drained a glass  poor nicholas the prince of fellows and of what use was one they kept him away from nicholas  herr pauls eyes fell on the terrier ach my dear he said you and i we alone are kept away  he drained a second glass  what was it this life frothlike that he tossed off a third glass forget if one could not help it was better to forget  he put on his hat yes there was no room for him there he was not wanted  he finished the bottle and went out into the passage scruff ran and lay down at mr treffrys door herr paul looked at him ach he said tapping his chest ungrateful hound and opening the front door he went out on tiptoe  late that afternoon greta stole hatless through the lilac bushes she looked tired after her night journey and sat idly on a chair in the speckled shadow of a limetree  it is not like home she thought i am unhappy even the birds are silent but perhaps that is because it is so hot i have never been sad like thisfor it is not fancy that i am sad this time as it is sometimes it is in my heart like the sound the wind makes through a wood it feels quite empty in my heart if it is always like this to be unhappy then i am sorry for all the unhappy things in the world i am sorrier than i ever was before  a shadow fell on the grass she raised her eyes and saw dawney  dr edmund she whispered  dawney turned to her a heavy furrow showed between his brows his eyes always rather close together stared painfully  dr edmund greta whispered is it true  he took her hand and spread his own palm over it  perhaps he said perhaps not we must hope  greta looked up awed  they say he is dying  we have sent for the best man in vienna  greta shook her head  but you are clever dr edmund and you are afraid  he is brave said dawney we must all be brave you know you too  brave repeated greta what is it to be brave if it is not to cry and make a fussthat i can do but if it is not to be sad in here she touched her breast that i cannot do and it shall not be any good for me to try  to be brave is to hope dont give up hope dear  no said greta tracing the pattern of the sunlight on her skirt but i think that when we hope we are not brave because we are expecting something for ourselves chris says that hope is prayer and if it is prayer then all the time we are hoping we are asking for something and it is not brave to ask for things  a smile curved dawneys mouth  go on philosopher he said be brave in your own way it will be just as good as anybody elses  what are you going to do to be brave dr edmund  i fight if only we had five years off his life  greta watched him as he walked away  i shall never be brave she mourned i shall always be wanting to be happy and kneeling down she began to disentangle a fly imprisoned in a cobweb a plant of hemlock had sprung up in the long grass by her feet greta thought dismayed there are weeds  it seemed but another sign of the death of joy  but its very beautiful she thought the blossoms are like stars i am not going to pull it up i will leave it perhaps it will spread all through the garden and if it does i do not care for now things are not like they used to be and i do not think they ever shall be again     xxvii  the days went by those long hot days when the heat haze swims up about ten of the forenoon and as the sun sinks level with the mountains melts into golden ether which sets the world quivering with sparkles  at the lighting of the stars those sparkles die vanishing one by one off the hillsides evening comes flying down the valleys and life rests under her cool wings the night falls and the hundred little voices of the night arise  it was near grapegathering and in the heat the fight for nicholas treffrys life went on day in day out with gleams of hope and moments of despair doctors came but after the first he refused to see them  no he said to dawneythrowing away money if i pull through it wont be because of them  for days together he would allow no one but dawney dominique and the paid nurse in the room  i can stand it better he said to christian when i dont see any of you keep away old girl and let me get on with it  to have been able to help would have eased the tension of her nerves and the aching of her heart at his own request they had moved his bed into a corner so that he might face the wall there he would lie for hours together not speaking a word except to ask for drink  sometimes christian crept in unnoticed and sat watching with her arms tightly folded across her breast at night after greta was asleep she would toss from side to side muttering feverish prayers she spent hours at her little table in the schoolroom writing letters to harz that were never sent once she wrote these words i am the most wicked of all creaturesi have even wished that he may die a few minutes afterwards miss naylor found her with her head buried on her arms christian sprang up tears were streaming down her cheeks dont touch me she cried and rushed away later she stole into her uncles room and sank down on the floor beside the bed she sat there silently unnoticed all the evening when night came she could hardly be persuaded to leave the room  one day mr treffry expressed a wish to see herr paul it was a long while before the latter could summon courage to go in  theres a few dozen of the gordon sherry at my chambers in london paul mr treffry said id be glad to think you had em and my man dominique ive made him all right in my will but keep your eye on him hes a good sort for a foreigner and no chicken but sooner or later the womenll get hold of him thats all i had to say send chris to me  herr paul stood by the bedside speechless suddenly he blurted out  ah my dear courage we are all mortal you will get well all the morning he walked about quite inconsolable it was frightful to see him you know frightful an iron man could not have borne it  when christian came to him mr treffry raised himself and looked at her a long while  his wistful face was like an accusation but that very afternoon the news came from the sickroom that he was better having had no pain for several hours  every one went about with smiles lurking in their eyes and ready to break forth at a word in the kitchen barbi burst out crying and forgetting to toss the pan spoiled a kaiserschmarn she was making dominique was observed draining a glass of chianti and solemnly casting forth the last drops in libation an order was given for tea to be taken out under the acacias where it was always cool it was felt that something in the nature of high festival was being held even herr paul was present but christian did not come nobody spoke of illness to mention it might break the spell  miss naylor who had gone into the house came back saying  there is a strange man standing over there by the corner of the house  really asked mrs decie what does he want  miss naylor reddened i did not ask him idontknowwhether he is quite respectable his coat is buttoned very close and hedoesnt seemto have acollar  go and see what he wants dear child mrs decie said to greta  i dont knowi really do not know began miss naylor he has veryhighboots but greta was already on her way with hands clasped behind her and demure eyes taking in the strangers figure  please she said when she was close to him  the stranger took his cap off with a jerk  this house has no bells he said in a nasal voice it has a tendency to discourage one  yes said greta gravely there is a bell but it does not ring now because my uncle is so ill  i am very sorry to hear that i dont know the people here but i am very sorry to hear that  i would be glad to speak a few words to your sister if it is your sister that i want  and the strangers face grew very red  is it said greta that you are a friend of herr harz if you are a friend of his you will please come and have some tea and while you are having tea i will look for chris  perspiration bedewed the strangers forehead  tea excuse me i dont drink tea  there is also coffee greta said  the strangers progress towards the arbour was so slow that greta arrived considerably before him  it is a friend of herr harz she whispered he will drink coffee i am going to find chris  greta gasped miss naylor  mrs decie put up her hand  ah she said if it is so we must be very nice to him for christians sake  miss naylors face grew soft  ah yes she said of course  bah muttered herr paul that recommences  paul murmured mrs decie you lack the elements of wisdom  herr paul glared at the approaching stranger  mrs decie had risen and smilingly held out her hand  we are so glad to know you you are an artist too perhaps i take a great interest in art and especially in that school which mr harz represents  the stranger smiled  he is the genuine article maam he said he represents no school he is one of that kind whose corpses make schools  ah murmured mrs decie you are an american that is so nice do sit down my niece will soon be here  greta came running back  will you come please she said chris is ready  gulping down his coffee the stranger included them all in a single bow and followed her  ach said herr paul garcon tres chic celuila  christian was standing by her little table the stranger began  i am sending mr harzs things to england there are some pictures here he would be glad to have them  a flood of crimson swept over her face  i am sending them to london the stranger repeated perhaps you could give them to me today  they are ready my sister will show you  her eyes seemed to dart into his soul and try to drag something from it the words rushed from her lips  is there any message for me  the stranger regarded her curiously  no he stammered no i guess not he is well i wish he stopped her white face seemed to flash scorn despair and entreaty on him all at once and turning she left him standing there     xxviii  when christian went that evening to her uncles room he was sitting up in bed and at once began to talk chris he said i cant stand this dying by inches im going to try what a journeyll do for me i want to get back to the old country the doctors promised theres a shot in the locker yet i believe in that young chap hes stuck to me like a man itll be your birthday on tuesday old girl and youll be twenty seventeen years since your father died youve been a lot to me a parson came here today thats a bad sign thought it his duty very civil of him i wouldnt see him though if theres anything in what they tell you im not going to sneak in at this time o day theres one thing thats rather badly on my mind i took advantage of mr harz with this damned pitifulness of mine youve a right to look at me as ive seen you sometimes when you thought i was asleep if i hadnt been ill hed never have left you i dont blame you chrisnot i you love me i know that my dear but ones alone when it comes to the runin dont cry our minds arent sundayschool books youre finding it out thats all he sighed and turned away  the noise of sunblinds being raised vibrated through the house a feeling of terror seized on the girl he lay so still and yet the drawing of each breath was a fight if she could only suffer in his place she went close and bent over him  its air we want both you and i he muttered christian beckoned to the nurse and stole out through the window  a regiment was passing in the road she stood halfhidden amongst the lilac bushes watching the poplar leaves drooped lifeless and almost black above her head the dust raised by the soldiers feet hung in the air it seemed as if in all the world no freshness and no life were stirring the tramp of feet died away suddenly within arms length of her a man appeared his stick shouldered like a sword he raised his hat  goodevening you do not remember me sarelli pardon you looked like a ghost standing there how badly those fellows marched we hang you see on the skirts of our profession and criticise it is all we are fit for his black eyes restless and malevolent like a swans seemed to stab her face a fine evening too hot the storm is wanted you feel that it is weary waiting for the storm but after the storm my dear young lady comes peace he smiled gently this time and baring his head again was lost to view in the shadow of the trees  his figure had seemed to christian like the sudden vision of a threatening hidden force she thrust out her hands as though to keep it off  no use it was within her nothing could keep it away she went to mrs decies room where her aunt and miss naylor were conversing in low tones to hear their voices brought back the touch of this world of everyday which had no part or lot in the terrifying powers within her  dawney slept at the villa now in the dead of night he was awakened by a light flashed in his eyes christian was standing there her face pale and wild with terror her hair falling in dark masses on her shoulders  save him save him she cried quick the bleeding  he saw her muffle her face in her white sleeves and seizing the candle leaped out of bed and rushed away  the internal haemorrhage had come again and nicholas treffry wavered between life and death when it had ceased he sank into a sort of stupor about six oclock he came back to consciousness watching his eyes they could see a mental struggle taking place within him at last he singled christian out from the others by a sign  im beat chris he whispered let him know i want to see him  his voice grew a little stronger i thought that i could see it throughbut heres the end he lifted his hand ever so little and let it fall again when told a little later that a telegram had been sent to harz his eyes expressed satisfaction  herr paul came down in ignorance of the nights events he stopped in front of the barometer and tapped it remarking to miss naylor the glass has gone downstairs we shall have cool weatherit will still go well with him  when with her brown face twisted by pity and concern she told him that it was a question of hours herr paul turned first purple then pale and sitting down trembled violently i cannot believe it he exclaimed almost angrily yesterday he was so well i cannot believe it poor nicholas yesterday he spoke to me taking miss naylors hand he clutched it in his own ah he cried letting it go suddenly and striking at his forehead it is too terrible only yesterday he spoke to me of sherry is there nobody then who can do good  there is only god replied miss naylor softly  god said herr paul in a scared voice  wecanallpray to him miss naylor murmured little spots of colour came into her cheeks i am going to do it now  herr paul raised her hand and kissed it  are you he said good i too he passed through his study door closed it carefully behind him then for some unknown reason set his back against it ugh death it came to all some day it would come to him it might come tomorrow one must pray  the day dragged to its end in the sky clouds had mustered and crowding close on one another clung round the sun soft thick greywhite like the feathers on a pigeons breast towards evening faint tremblings were felt at intervals as from the shock of immensely distant earthquakes  nobody went to bed that night but in the morning the report was the same unconsciousa question of hours once only did he recover consciousness and then asked for harz a telegram had come from him he was on the way towards seven of the evening the longexpected storm broke in a sky like ink into the valleys and over the crests of mountains it seemed as though an unseen hand were spilling goblets of pale wine darting a swordblade zigzag over trees roofs spires peaks into the very firmament which answered every thrust with great bursts of groaning just beyond the veranda greta saw a glowworm shining as it might be a tiny bead of the fallen lightning soon the rain covered everything sometimes a jet of light brought the hilltops towering dark and hard over the house to disappear again behind the raindrops and shaken leaves each breath drawn by the storm was like the clash of a thousand cymbals and in his room mr treffry lay unconscious of its fury  greta had crept in unobserved and sat curled in a corner with scruff in her arms rocking slightly to and fro when christian passed she caught her skirt and whispered it is your birthday chris  mr treffry stirred  whats that thunderits cooler where am i chris  dawney signed for her to take his place  chris mr treffry said its near now she bent across him and her tears fell on his forehead  forgive she whispered love me  he raised his finger and touched her cheek  for an hour or more he did not speak though once or twice he moaned and faintly tightened his pressure on her fingers the storm had died away but very far off the thunder was still muttering  his eyes opened once more rested on her and passed beyond into that abyss dividing youth from age conviction from conviction life from death  at the foot of the bed dawney stood covering his face behind him dominique knelt with hands held upwards the sound of gretas breathing soft in sleep rose and fell in the stillness     xxix  one afternoon in march more than three years after mr treffrys death christian was sitting at the window of a studio in st johns wood the sky was covered with soft high clouds through which shone little gleams of blue now and then a bright shower fell sprinkling the trees where every twig was curling upwards as if waiting for the gift of its new leaves and it seemed to her that the boughs thickened and budded under her very eyes a great concourse of sparrows had gathered on those boughs and kept raising a shrill chatter over at the far side of the room harz was working at a picture  on christians face was the quiet smile of one who knows that she has only to turn her eyes to see what she wishes to see of one whose possessions are safe under her hand she looked at harz with that possessive smile but as into the brain of one turning in his bed grim fancies will suddenly leap up out of warm nothingness so there leaped into her mind the memory of that long ago dawn when he had found her kneeling by mr treffrys body she seemed to see again the dead face so gravely quiet and furrowless she seemed to see her lover and herself setting forth silently along the river wall where they had first met sitting down still silent beneath the poplartree where the little bodies of the chafers had lain strewn in the spring to see the trees changing from black to grey from grey to green and in the dark sky long white lines of cloud lighting to the south like birds and very far away rosy peaks watching the awakening of the earth and now once again after all that time she felt her spirit shrink away from his as it had shrunk in that hour when she had seemed hateful to herself she remembered the words she had spoken i have no heart left youve torn it in two between you love is all selfi wanted him to die she remembered too the raindrops on the vines like a million tiny lamps and the throstle that began singing then as dreams die out into warm nothingness recollection vanished and the smile came back to her lips  she took out a letter  o chris we are really coming i seem to be always telling it to myself and i have told scruff many times but he does not care because he is getting old miss naylor says we shall arrive for breakfast and that we shall be hungry but perhaps she will not be very hungry if it is rough papa said to me je serai inconsolable mais inconsolable but i think he will not be because he is going to vienna when we are come there will be nobody at villa rubein aunt constance has gone a fortnight ago to florence there is a young man at her hotel she says he will be one of the greatest playwriters in england and she sent me a play of his to read it was only a little about love i did not like it very much o chris i think i shall cry when i see you as i am quite grown up miss naylor is not to come back with me sometimes she is sad but she will be glad to see you chris she seems always sadder when it is spring today i walked along the wall the little green balls of wool are growing on the poplars already and i saw one chafer it will not be long before the cherry blossom comes and i felt so funny sad and happy together and once i thought that i had wings and could fly away up the valley to meranbut i had none so i sat on the bench where we sat the day we took the pictures and i thought and thought there was nothing came to me in my thoughts but all was sweet and a little noisy and rather sad it was like the buzzing of the chafer in my head and now i feel so tired and all my blood is running up and down me i do not mind because i know it is the spring  dominique came to see us the other day he is very well and is half the proprietor of the adler hotel at meran he is not at all different and he asked about you and about aloisdo you know chris to myself i call him herr harz but when i have seen him this time i shall call him alois in my heart also  i have a letter from dr edmund he is in london so perhaps you have seen him only he has a great many patients and some that he has hopes of killing soon especially one old lady because she is always wanting him to do things for her and he is never saying no so he does not like her he says that he is getting old when i have finished this letter i am going to write and tell him that perhaps he shall see me soon and then i think he will be very sad now that the spring is come there are more flowers to take to uncle nics grave and every day when i am gone barbi is to take them so that he shall not miss you chris because all the flowers i put there are for you  i am buying some toys without paint on for my niece  o chris this will be the first baby that i have known  i am only to stay three weeks with you but i think when i am once there i shall be staying longer i send a kiss for my niece and to herr harz my lovethat is the last time i shall call him herr harz and to you chris all the joy that is in my heartyour loving  greta   christian rose and turning very softly stood leaning her elbows on the back of a high seat looking at her husband  in her eyes there was a slow clear faintly smiling yet yearning look as though this strenuous figure bent on its task were seen for a moment as something apart and not all the world to her  tired asked harz putting his lips to her hand  no its onlywhat greta says about the spring it makes one want more than one has got  slipping her hand away she went back to the window harz stood looking after her then taking up his palette again began painting  in the world outside the high soft clouds flew by the trees seemed thickening and budding  and christian thought  can we never have quite enough  december 1890     to  my father     a man of devon     i  moor 20th july   it is quiet here sleepy rathera farm is never quiet the sea too is only a quarter of a mile away and when its windy the sound of it travels up the combe for distraction you must go four miles to brixham or five to kingswear and you wont find much then the farm lies in a sheltered spot scooped so to speak high up the combe sidebehind is a rise of fields and beyond a sweep of down you have the feeling of being able to see quite far which is misleading as you soon find out if you walk it is true devon countryhills hollows hedgebanks lanes dipping down into the earth or going up like the sides of houses coppices cornfields and little streams wherever theres a place for one but the downs along the cliff all gorse and ferns are wild the combe ends in a sandy cove with black rock on one side pinkish cliffs away to the headland on the other and a coastguard station just now with the harvest coming on everything looks its richest the apples ripening the trees almost too green its very hot still weather the country and the sea seem to sleep in the sun in front of the farm are halfadozen pines that look as if they had stepped out of another land but all round the back is orchard as lush and gnarled and orthodox as any one could wish the house a long white building with three levels of roof and splashes of brown all over it looks as if it might be growing down into the earth it was freshly thatched two years agoand thats all the newness there is about it they say the front door oak with iron knobs is three hundred years old at least you can touch the ceilings with your hand the windows certainly might be largera heavenly old place though with a flavour of apples smoke sweetbriar bacon honeysuckle and age all over it  the owner is a man called john ford about seventy and seventeen stone in weightvery big on long legs with a grey stubbly beard grey watery eyes short neck and purplish complexion he is asthmatic and has a very courteous autocratic manner his clothes are made of harris tweedexcept on sundays when he puts on blacka seal ring and a thick gold cable chain theres nothing mean or small about john ford i suspect him of a warm heart but he doesnt let you know much about him hes a northcountry man by birth and has been out in new zealand all his life this little devonshire farm is all he has now he had a large station in the north island and was much looked up to kept open house did everything as one would guess in a narrowminded largehanded way he came to grief suddenly i dont quite know how i believe his only son lost money on the turf and then unable to face his father shot himself if you had seen john ford you could imagine that his wife died too that year he paid up to the last penny and came home to live on this farm he told me the other night that he had only one relation in the world his granddaughter who lives here with him pasiance voiseyold spelling for patience but they pronounce it pashyenceis sitting out here with me at this moment on a sort of rustic loggia that opens into the orchard her sleeves are rolled up and shes stripping currants ready for black currant tea now and then she rests her elbows on the table eats a berry pouts her lips and begins again she has a round little face a long slender body cheeks like poppies a bushy mass of blackbrown hair and darkbrown almost black eyes her nose is snub her lips quick red rather full all her motions quick and soft she loves bright colours shes rather like a little cat sometimes she seems all sympathy then in a moment as hard as tortoiseshell shes all impulse yet she doesnt like to show her feelings i sometimes wonder whether she has any she plays the violin  its queer to see these two together queer and rather sad the old man has a fierce tenderness for her that strikes into the very roots of him i see him torn between it and his cold northcountry horror of his feelings his life with her is an unconscious torture to him shes a restless chafing thing demure enough one moment then flashing out into mocking speeches or hard little laughs yet shes fond of him in her fashion i saw her kiss him once when he was asleep she obeys him generallyin a way as if she couldnt breathe while she was doing it shes had a queer sort of educationhistory geography elementary mathematics and nothing else never been to school had a few lessons on the violin but has taught herself most of what she knows she is well up in the lore of birds flowers and insects has three cats who follow her about and is full of pranks the other day she called out to me ive something for you hold out your hand and shut your eyes it was a large black slug shes the child of the old fellows only daughter who was sent home for schooling at torquay and made a runaway match with one richard voisey a yeoman farmer whom she met in the huntingfield john ford was furioushis ancestors it appears used to lead ruffians on the cumberland side of the borderhe looked on squire rick voisey as a cut below him he was called squire as far as i can make out because he used to play cards every evening with a parson in the neighbourhood who went by the name of devil hawkins not that the voisey stock is to be despised they have had this farm since it was granted to one richard voysey by copy dated 8th september 13 henry viii mrs hopgood the wife of the bailiffa dear quaint serene old soul with cheeks like a rosy withered apple and an unbounded love of pasianceshowed me the very document  i kape it she said mr ford be tu proudbut other folks be proud tu tis a praaper old famly all the women is margery pasiance or mary all the mens richards an johns an rogers old as they appletrees  rick voisey was a rackety hunting fellow and dipped the old farm up to its thatched roof john ford took his revenge by buying up the mortgages foreclosing and commanding his daughter and voisey to go on living here rent free this they dutifully did until they were both killed in a dogcart accident eight years ago old fords financial smash came a year later and since then hes lived here with pasiance i fancy its the cross in her blood that makes her so restless and irresponsible if she had been all a native shed have been happy enough here or all a stranger like john ford himself but the two strains struggling for mastery seem to give her no rest youll think this a farfetched theory but i believe it to be the true one shell stand with lips pressed together her arms folded tight across her narrow chest staring as if she could see beyond the things round her then something catches her attention her eyes will grow laughing soft or scornful all in a minute shes eighteen perfectly fearless in a boat but you cant get her to mount a horsea sore subject with her grandfather who spends most of his day on a lean halfbred pony that carries him like a feather for all his weight  they put me up here as a favour to dan treffry theres an arrangement of l s d with mrs hopgood in the background they arent at all well off this is the largest farm about but it doesnt bring them in much to look at john ford it seems incredible he should be short of moneyhes too large  we have family prayers at eight then breakfastafter that freedom for writing or anything else till supper and evening prayers at midday one forages for oneself on sundays two miles to church twice or you get into john fords black books dan treffry himself is staying at kingswear he says hes made his pile it suits him down herelike a sleep after years of being too wideawake he had a rough time in new zealand until that mine made his fortune youd hardly remember him he reminds me of his uncle old nicholas treffry the same slow way of speaking with a hesitation and a trick of repeating your name with everything he says lefthanded too and the same slow twinkle in his eyes he has a dark short beard and redbrown cheeks is a little bald on the temples and a bit grey but hard as iron he rides over nearly every day attended by a black spaniel with a wonderful nose and a horror of petticoats he has told me lots of good stories of john ford in the early squatters times his feats with horses live to this day and he was through the maori wars as dan says a man after uncle nics own heart  they are very good friends and respect each other dan has a great admiration for the old man but the attraction is pasiance he talks very little when shes in the room but looks at her in a sidelong wistful sort of way pasiances conduct to him would be cruel in any one else but in her one takes it with a pinch of salt dan goes off but turns up again as quiet and dogged as you please  last night for instance we were sitting in the loggia after supper pasiance was fingering the strings of her violin and suddenly dan a bold thing for him asked her to play  what she said before men no thank you  why not  because i hate them  down came john fords hand on the wicker table you forget yourself go to bed  she gave dan a look and went we could hear her playing in her bedroom it sounded like a dance of spirits and just when one thought she had finished out it would break again like a burst of laughter presently john ford begged our pardons ceremoniously and stumped off indoors the violin ceased we heard his voice growling at her down he came again just as he was settled in his chair there was a soft swish and something dark came falling through the apple boughs the violin you should have seen his face dan would have picked the violin up but the old man stopped him later from my bedroom window i saw john ford come out and stand looking at the violin he raised his foot as if to stamp on it at last he picked it up wiped it carefully and took it in  my room is next to hers i kept hearing her laugh a noise too as if she were dragging things about the room then i fell asleep but woke with a start and went to the window for a breath of fresh air such a black breathless night nothing to be seen but the twisted blacker branches not the faintest stir of leaves no sound but muffled grunting from the cowhouse and now and then a faint sigh i had the queerest feeling of unrest and fear the last thing to expect on such a night there is something here thats disturbing a sort of suppressed struggle ive never in my life seen anything so irresponsible as this girl or so uncompromising as the old man i keep thinking of the way he wiped that violin its just as if a spark would set everything in a blaze theres a menace of tragedyorperhaps its only the heat and too much of mother hopgoods crame     ii  tuesday   ive made a new acquaintance i was lying in the orchard and presently not seeing me he came alonga man of middle height with a singularly good balance and no lumberrather old blue clothes a flannel shirt a dull red necktie brown shoes a cap with a leather peak pushed up on the forehead face long and narrow bronzed with a kind of pale burntin brownness a good forehead a brown moustache beard rather pointed blackening about the cheeks his chin not visible but from the beards growth must be big mouth i should judge sensuous nose straight and blunt eyes grey with an upward look not exactly frank because defiant two parallel furrows down each cheek one from the inner corner of the eye one from the nostril age perhaps thirtyfive about the face attitude movements something immensely vital adaptable daring and unprincipled  he stood in front of the loggia biting his fingers a kind of nineteenthcentury buccaneer and i wondered what he was doing in this galley they say you can tell a man of kent or a somersetshire man certainly you can tell a yorkshire man and this fellow could only have been a man of devon one of the two main types found in this county he whistled and out came pasiance in a geraniumcoloured dress looking like some tall poppyyou know the slight droop of a poppys head and the way the wind sways its stem she is a human poppy her fuzzy dark hair is like a poppys lustreless black heart she has a poppys tantalising attraction and repulsion something fatal or rather fateful she came walking up to my new friend then caught sight of me and stopped dead  that she said to me is zachary pearse this she said to him is our lodger she said it with a wonderful soft malice she wanted to scratch me and she scratched half an hour later i was in the yard when up came this fellow pearse  glad to know you he said looking thoughtfully at the pigs  youre a writer arent you  a sort of one i said  if by any chance he said suddenly youre looking for a job i could put something in your way walk down to the beach with me and ill tell you my boats at anchor smartest little craft in these parts  it was very hot and i had no desire whatever to go down to the beachi went all the same we had not gone far when john ford and dan treffry came into the lane our friend seemed a little disconcerted but soon recovered himself we met in the middle of the lane where there was hardly room to pass john ford who looked very haughty put on his pincenez and stared at pearse  goodday said pearse fine weather ive been up to ask pasiance to come for a sail wednesday we thought weather permitting this gentlemans coming perhaps youll come too mr treffry youve never seen my place ill give you lunch and show you my father hes worth a couple of hours sail any day it was said in such an odd way that one couldnt resent his impudence john ford was seized with a fit of wheezing and seemed on the eve of an explosion he glanced at me and checked himself  youre very good he said icily my granddaughter has other things to do you gentlemen will please yourselves and with a very slight bow he went stumping on to the house dan looked at me and i looked at him  youll come said pearse rather wistfully dan stammered thank you mr pearse im a better man on a horse than in a boat butthank you cornered in this way hes a shy softhearted being pearse smiled his thanks wednesday then at ten oclock you shant regret it  pertinacious beggar i heard dan mutter in his beard and found myself marching down the lane again by pearses side i asked him what he was good enough to mean by saying i was coming without having asked me he answered unabashed  you see im not friends with the old man but i knew hed not be impolite to you so i took the liberty  he has certainly a knack of turning ones anger to curiosity we were down in the combe now the tide was running out and the sand all little wet shining ridges about a quarter of a mile out lay a cutter with her tan sail half down swinging to the swell the sunlight was making the pink cliffs glow in the most wonderful way and shifting in bright patches over the sea like moving shoals of goldfish pearse perched himself on his dinghy and looked out under his hand he seemed lost in admiration  if we could only net some of those spangles he said an make gold of em no more work then  its a big job ive got on he said presently ill tell you about it on wednesday i want a journalist  but i dont write for the papers i said i do other sort of work my game is archaeology  it doesnt matter he said the more imagination the better itd be a thundering good thing for you  his assurance was amazing but it was past suppertime and hunger getting the better of my curiosity i bade him goodnight when i looked back he was still there on the edge of his boat gazing at the sea a queer sort of bird altogether but attractive somehow  nobody mentioned him that evening but once old ford after staring a long time at pasiance muttered a propos of nothing undutiful children she was softer than usual listening quietly to our talk and smiling when spoken to at bedtime she went up to her grandfather without waiting for the usual command come and kiss me child  dan did not stay to supper and he has not been here since this morning i asked mother hopgood who zachary pearse was shes a true devonian if theres anything she hates it is to be committed to a definite statement she ambled round her answer and at last told me that he was son of old capen jan pearse to black mill tes an old family to dartymouth an plymouth she went on in a communicative outburst they du say francis drake tuke five o they pearses with en to fight the spaniards at least thats what ive heard mr zachary zay but haapgood can tell yu poor hopgood the amount of information she saddles him with in the course of the day having given me thus to understand that she had run dry she at once went on  capen jan pearse made a dale of ventures hes old nowthey du say nigh an undred haapgood can tell yu  but the son mrs hopgood  her eyes twinkled with sudden shrewdness she hugged herself placidly  an what would yu take for dinner today theres duck or yu might like toad in the hole with an apple tart or then thereswell well see what we can du like and off she went without waiting for my answer  tomorrow is wednesday i shant be sorry to get another look at this fellow pearse     iii  friday 29th july   why do you ask me so many questions and egg me on to write about these people instead of minding my business if you really want to hear ill tell you of wednesdays doings  it was a splendid morning and dan turned up to my surprisethough i might have known that when he says a thing he does it john ford came out to shake hands with him then remembering why he had come breathed loudly said nothing and went in again nothing was to be seen of pasiance and we went down to the beach together  i dont like this fellow pearse george dan said to me on the way i was fool enough to say id go and so i must but whats he after not the man to do things without a reason mind you  i remarked that we should soon know  im not so surequeer beggar i never look at him without thinking of a pirate  the cutter lay in the cove as if she had never moved there too was zachary pearse seated on the edge of his dinghy  a fiveknot breeze he said ill run you down in a couple of hours he made no inquiry about pasiance but put us into his cockleshell and pulled for the cutter a lanternjawed fellow named prawle with a spiky prominent beard long cleanshaven upper lip and tanned complexiona regular hardweather birdreceived us  the cutter was beautifully clean built for a brixham trawler she still had her numberdh 113uneffaced we dived into a sort of cabin airy but dark fitted with two bunks and a small table on which stood some bottles of stout there were lockers too and pegs for clothes prawle who showed us round seemed very proud of a steam contrivance for hoisting sails it was some minutes before we came on deck again and there in the dinghy being pulled towards the cutter sat pasiance  if id known this stammered dan getting red i wouldnt have come she had outwitted us and there was nothing to be done  it was a very pleasant sail the breeze was light from the southeast the sun warm the air soft presently pasiance began singing  columbus is dead and laid in his grave oh heighho and laid in his grave over his head the appletrees wave oh heighho the appletrees wave  the apples are ripe and ready to fall oh heighho and ready to fall there came an old woman and gathered them all oh heighho and gathered them all  the apples are gathered and laid on the shelf oh heighho and laid on the shelf if you want any more you must sing for yourself oh heighho and sing for yourself  her small high voice came to us in trills and spurts as the wind let it like the singing of a skylark lost in the sky pearse went up to her and whispered something i caught a glimpse of her face like a startled wild creatures shrinking tossing her hair laughing all in the same breath she wouldnt sing again but crouched in the bows with her chin on her hands and the sun falling on one cheek round velvety red as a peach  we passed dartmouth and half an hour later put into a little wooded bay on a low reddish cliff was a house hedged round by pinetrees a bit of broken jetty ran out from the bottom of the cliff we hooked on to this and landed an ancient fishlike man came slouching down and took charge of the cutter pearse led us towards the house pasiance following mortally shy all of a sudden  the house had a dark overhanging thatch of the rush reeds that grow in the marshes hereabouts i remember nothing else remarkable it was neither old nor new neither beautiful nor exactly ugly neither clean nor entirely squalid it perched there with all its windows over the sea turning its back contemptuously on the land  seated in a kind of porch beside an immense telescope was a very old man in a panama hat with a rattan cane his purewhite beard and moustache and almost black eyebrows gave a very singular piercing look to his little restless darkgrey eyes all over his mahogany cheeks and neck was a network of fine wrinkles he sat quite upright in the full sun hardly blinking  dad said zachary this is pasiance voisey the old man turned his eyes on her and muttered how do you do maam then took no further notice and pasiance who seemed to resent this soon slipped away and went wandering about amongst the pines an old woman brought some plates and bottles and laid them casually on a table and we sat round the figure of old captain pearse without a word as if we were all under a spell  before lunch there was a little scene between zachary pearse and dan as to which of them should summon pasiance it ended in both going and coming back without her she did not want any lunch would stay where she was amongst the pines  for lunch we had chops woodpigeons mushrooms and mulberry preserve and drank wonderful madeira out of common wineglasses i asked the old man where he got it he gave me a queer look and answered with a little bow  stood me in tu shillin the bottle an the country got nothing out of it sir in the early thirties tu shillin the bottle theres no such wine nowadays and he added looking at zachary no such men  zachary smiled and said you did nothing so big dad as what im after now  the old mans eyes had a sort of disdain in them  youre going far then in the pied witch zack  i am said zachary  and where might yu be goin in that old trampin smut factory  morocco  heu said the old man theres nothing there i know that coast as i know the back o my hand he stretched out a hand covered with veins and hair  zachary began suddenly to pour out a flood of words  below mogadora fellow therefriend of minetwo years ago now concessionstradegunpowdercruisersfeudsmoney chiefsgatling gunssultanriflesrebelliongold he detailed a reckless sordid bold scheme which on the pivot of a trading venture was intended to spin a whole wheel of political convulsions  theyll never let you get there said old pearse  wont they returned zachary oh yes they will an when i leave therell be another dynasty and ill be a rich man  yull never leave answered the old man  zachary took out a sheet of paper covered with figures he had worked the whole thing out so muchequipment so muchtrade so muchconcessions so muchemergencies my last mag he ended a thousand short the ships ready and if im not there within a month my chance is as good as gone  this was the pith of his confidencesan appeal for money and we all looked as men will when that crops up  mad muttered the old man looking at the sea  no said zachary that one word was more eloquent than all the rest of his words put together this fellow is no visionary his scheme may be daring and unprincipled buthe knows very well what hes about  well said old pearse you shall have five undred of my money if its only to learn what yure made of wheel me in zachary wheeled him into the house but soon came back  the old mans cheque for five hundred pounds he said holding it up mr treffry give me another and you shall have a third of the profits  i expected dan to give a pointblank refusal but he only asked  would that clear you for starting  with that said zachary i can get to sea in a fortnight  good dan said slowly give me a written promise to sea in fourteen days and my fair share on the five hundred poundsno moreno less  again i thought pearse would have jumped at this but he leaned his chin on his hand and looked at dan and dan looked at him while they were staring at each other like this pasiance came up with a kitten  see she said isnt it a darling the kitten crawled and clawed its way up behind her neck i saw both mens eyes as they looked at pasiance and suddenly understood what they were at the kitten rubbed itself against pasiances cheek overbalanced and fell clawing down her dress she caught it up and walked away some one i dont know which of us sighed and pearse cried done  the bargain had been driven  goodbye mr pearse said dan i guess thats all im wanted for ill find my pony waiting in the village george youll see pasiance home  we heard the hoofs of his pony galloping down the road pearse suddenly excused himself and disappeared  this venture of his may sound romantic and absurd but its matteroffact enough hes after l s d shades of drake raleigh hawkins oxenham the worm of suspicion gnaws at the rose of romance what if those fellows too were only after l s d  i strolled into the pinewood the earth there was covered like a bees body with black and gold stripes there was the blue sea below and white sleepy clouds and bumblebees booming above the heather it was all softness a summers day in devon suddenly i came on pearse standing at the edge of the cliff with pasiance sitting in a little hollow below looking up at him i heard him say  pasiancepasiance the sound of his voice and the sight of her soft wondering face made me furious what business has she with love at her age what business have they with each other  he told me presently that she had started off for home and drove me to the ferry behind an old grey pony on the way he came back to his offer of the other day  come with me he said it doesnt do to neglect the press you can see the possibilities its one of the few countries left if i once get this business started you dont know where its going to stop youd have free passage everywhere and whatever you like in reason  i answered as rudely as i couldbut by no means as rudely as i wantedthat his scheme was mad as a matter of fact its much too sane for me for whatever the body of a scheme its soul is the fibre of the schemer  think of it he urged as if he could see into me you can make what you like of it press paragraphs of course but thats mechanical why even i could do it if i had time as for the rest youll be as freeas free as a man  there in five words of one syllable is the kernel of this fellow pearseas free as a man no rule no law not even the mysterious shackles that bind men to their own selfrespects as free as a man no ideals no principles no fixed star for his worship no coil he cant slide out of but the fellow has the tenacity of one of the old devon mastiffs too he wouldnt take no for an answer  think of it he said any day will doive got a fortnight look there she is i thought that he meant pasiance but it was an old steamer sluggish and black in the blazing sun of midstream with a yellowandwhite funnel and no sign of life on her decks  thats herthe pied witch do her twelve knots you wouldnt think it well goodevening youd better come a word to me at any time im going aboard now  as i was being ferried across i saw him lolling in the sternsheets of a little boat the sun crowning his straw hat with glory  i came on pasiance about a mile up the road sitting in the hedge we walked on together between the banksdevonshire banks as high as houses thick with ivy and ferns bramble and hazel boughs and honeysuckle  do you believe in a god she said suddenly  grandfathers god is simply awful when im playing the fiddle i can feel god but grandfathers is such a stuffy godyou know what i mean the sea the wind the trees colours toothey make one feel but i dont believe that life was meant to be good in isnt there anything better than being good when im good i simply feel wicked she reached up caught a flower from the hedge and slowly tore its petals  what would you do she muttered if you wanted a thing but were afraid of it but i suppose youre never afraid she added mocking me i admitted that i was sometimes afraid and often afraid of being afraid  thats nice im not afraid of illness nor of grandfather nor of his god buti want to be free if you want a thing badly youre afraid about it  i thought of zachary pearses words free as a man  why are you looking at me like that she said  i stammered what do you mean by freedom  do you know what i shall do tonight she answered get out of my window by the appletree and go to the woods and play  we were going down a steep lane along the side of a wood where theres always a smell of sappy leaves and the breath of the cows that come close to the hedge to get the shade  there was a cottage in the bottom and a small boy sat outside playing with a heap of dust  hallo johnny said pasiance hold your leg out and show this man your bad place the small boy undid a bandage round his bare and dirty little leg and proudly revealed a sore  isnt it nasty cried pasiance ruefully tying up the bandage again poor little feller johnny see what ive brought you she produced from her pocket a stick of chocolate the semblance of a soldier made of sealingwax and worsted and a crooked sixpence  it was a new glimpse of her all the way home she was telling me the story of little johnnys family when she came to his mothers death she burst out a beastly shame wasnt it and theyre so poor it might just as well have been somebody else i like poor people but i hate rich onesstuckup beasts  mrs hopgood was looking over the gate with her cap on one side and one of pasiances cats rubbing itself against her skirts at the sight of us she hugged herself  wheres grandfather asked pasiance the old lady shook her head  is it a row mrs hopgood wriggled and wriggled and out came  did you get yure tay my pretty no well thats a pity yull be falin lowlike  pasiance tossed her head snatched up the cat and ran indoors i remained staring at mrs hopgood  deardear she clucked poor lamb so to spake its and she blurted out suddenly chuckin full of wraath he is well there  my courage failed that evening i spent it at the coastguard station where they gave me bread and cheese and some awful cider i passed the kitchen as i came back a fire was still burning there and two figures misty in the darkness flitted about with stealthy laughter like spirits afraid of being detected in a carnalmeal they were pasiance and mrs hopgood and so charming was the smell of eggs and bacon and they had such an air of tender enjoyment of this dark revel that i stifled many pangs as i crept hungry up to bed  in the middle of the night i woke and heard what i thought was screaming then it sounded like wind in trees then like the distant shaking of a tambourine with the high singing of a human voice suddenly it stoppedtwo long notes came wailing out like sobsthen utter stillness and though i listened for an hour or more there was no other sound      iv  4th august   for three days after i wrote last nothing at all happened here i spent the mornings on the cliff reading and watching the sunsparks raining on the sea its grand up there with the gorse all round the gulls basking on the rocks the partridges calling in the corn and now and then a young hawk overhead the afternoons i spent out in the orchard the usual routine goes on at the farm all the timecowmilking breadbaking john ford riding in and out pasiance in her garden stripping lavender talking to the farm hands and the smell of clover and cows and hay the sound of hens and pigs and pigeons the soft drawl of voices the dull thud of the farm carts and day by day the apples getting redder then last monday pasiance was away from sunrise till sunsetnobody saw her gonobody knew where she had gone it was a wonderful strange day a sky of silvergrey and blue with a drift of windclouds all the trees sighing a little the sea heaving in a long low swell the animals restless the birds silent except the gulls with their old mans laughter and kittens mewing  a something wild was in the air it seemed to sweep across the downs and combe into the very house like a passionate tune that comes drifting to your ears when youre sleepy but who would have thought the absence of that girl for a few hours could have wrought such havoc we were like uneasy spirits mrs hopgoods apple cheeks seemed positively to wither before ones eyes i came across a dairymaid and farm hand discussing it stolidly with very downcast faces even hopgood a hardbitten fellow with immense shoulders forgot his imperturbability so far as to harness his horse and depart on what he assured me was just a wildguse chaace it was long before john ford gave signs of noticing that anything was wrong but late in the afternoon i found him sitting with his hands on his knees staring straight before him he rose heavily when he saw me and stalked out in the evening as i was starting for the coastguard station to ask for help to search the cliff pasiance appeared walking as if she could hardly drag one leg after the other her cheeks were crimson she was biting her lips to keep tears of sheer fatigue out of her eyes she passed me in the doorway without a word the anxiety he had gone through seemed to forbid the old man from speaking he just came forward took her face in his hands gave it a great kiss and walked away pasiance dropped on the floor in the dark passage and buried her face on her arms leave me alone was all she would say after a bit she dragged herself upstairs presently mrs hopgood came to me  not a word out of heran not a bite will she ate an i had a pie all readyscrumptious the good lord knows the truthshe asked for brandy have you any brandy sir haapgoode dont drink it an mister ford e dont allaow for anything but caowslip wine  i had whisky  the good soul seized the flask and went off hugging it she returned it to me half empty  lapped it like a kitten laps milk i misdaoubt its straong poor lamb it lusened er tongue praaperly ive adone it she says to me mumsive adone it an she laughed like a mad thing and then sir she cried an kissed me an pusshed me thru the door gude lard what is t shes adone  it rained all the next day and the day after about five oclock yesterday the rain ceased i started off to kingswear on hopgoods nag to see dan treffry every tree bramble and fern in the lanes was dripping water and every bird singing from the bottom of his heart i thought of pasiance all the time her absence that day was still a mystery one never ceased asking oneself what she had done there are people who never grow upthey have no right to do things actions have consequencesand children have no business with consequences  dan was out i had supper at the hotel and rode slowly home in the twilight stretches of the road where i could touch either bank of the lane with my whip i thought of nothing but pasiance and her grandfather there was something in the half light suited to wonder and uncertainty it had fallen dark before i rode into the strawyard two young bullocks snuffled at me a sleepy hen got up and ran off with a tremendous shrieking i stabled the horse and walked round to the back it was pitch black under the appletrees and the windows were all darkened i stood there a little everything smelled so delicious after the rain suddenly i had the uncomfortable feeling that i was being watched have you ever felt like that on a dark night i called out at last is any one there not a sound i walked to the gatenothing the trees still dripped with tiny soft hissing sounds but that was all i slipped round to the front went in barricaded the door and groped up to bed but i couldnt sleep i lay awake a long while dozed at last and woke with a jump a stealthy murmur of smothered voices was going on quite close somewhere it stopped a minute passed suddenly came the soft thud as of something falling i sprang out of bed and rushed to the window nothingbut in the distance something that sounded like footsteps an owl hooted then clear as crystal but quite low i heard pasiance singing in her room  the apples are ripe and ready to fall oh heighho and ready to fall  i ran to her door and knocked  what is it she cried  is anything the matter  matter  is anything the matter  hahahaha goodnight then quite low i heard her catch her breath hard sharply no other answer no other sound  i went to bed and lay awake for hours  this evening dan came during supper he handed pasiance a roll of music he had got it in torquay the shopman he said had told him that it was a corker  it was bachs chaconne you should have seen her eyes shine her fingers actually tremble while she turned over the pages seems odd to think of her worshipping at the shrine of bach as odd as to think of a wild colt running of its free will into the shafts but thats just it with her you can never tell heavenly she kept saying  john ford put down his knife and fork  heathenish stuff he muttered and suddenly thundered out pasiance  she looked up with a start threw the music from her and resumed her place  during evening prayers which follow every night immediately on food her face was a study of mutiny she went to bed early it was rather late when we broke upfor once old ford had been talking of his squatters life as we came out dan held up his hand a dog was barking its lass he said shell wake pasiance  the spaniel yelped furiously dan ran out to stop her he was soon back  somebodys been in the orchard and gone off down to the cove he ran on down the path i too ran horribly uneasy in front through the darkness came the spaniels bark the lights of the coastguard station faintly showed i was first on the beach the dog came to me at once her tail almost in her mouth from apology there was the sound of oars working in rowlocks nothing visible but the feathery edges of the waves dan said behind no use hes gone his voice sounded hoarse like that of a man choking with passion  george he stammered its that blackguard i wish id put a bullet in him suddenly a light burned up in the darkness on the sea seemed to swing gently and vanished without another word we went back up the hill john ford stood at the gate motionless indifferentnothing had dawned on him as yet i whispered to dan let it alone  no he said im going to show you he struck a match and slowly hunted the footsteps in the wet grass of the orchard lookhere  he stopped under pasiances window and swayed the match over the ground clear as daylight were the marks of some one who had jumped or fallen dan held the match over his head  and look there he said the bough of an appletree below the window was broken he blew the match out  i could see the whites of his eyes like an angry animals  drop it dan i said  he turned on his heel suddenly and stammered out youre right  but he had turned into john fords arms  the old man stood there like some great force darker than the darkness staring up at the window as though stupefied we had not a word to say he seemed unconscious of our presence he turned round and left us standing there  follow him said dan follow himby god its not safe  we followed bending and treading heavily he went upstairs he struck a blow on pasiances door let me in he said i drew dan into my bedroom the key was slowly turned her door was flung open and there she stood in her dressinggown a candle in her hand her face crimson and oh so young with its short crisp hair and round cheeks the old manlike a giant in front of herraised his hands and laid them on her shoulders  whats this youyouve had a man in your room  her eyes did not drop  yes she said dan gave a groan  who  zachary pearse she answered in a voice like a bell  he gave her one awful shake dropped his hands then raised them as though to strike her she looked him in the eyes his hands dropped and he too groaned as far as i could see her face never moved  im married to him she said d you hear married to him go out of my room she dropped the candle on the floor at his feet and slammed the door in his face the old man stood for a minute as though stunned then groped his way downstairs  dan i said is it true  ah he answered its true didnt you hear her  i was glad i couldnt see his face  that ends it he said at last theres the old man to think of  what will he do  go to the fellow this very night he seemed to have no doubt trust one man of action to know another  i muttered something about being an outsiderwondered if there was anything i could do to help  well he said slowly i dont know that im anything but an outsider now but ill go along with him if hell have me  he went downstairs a few minutes later they rode out from the strawyard i watched them past the line of hayricks into the blacker shadows of the pines then the tramp of hoofs began to fail in the darkness and at last died away  ive been sitting here in my bedroom writing to you ever since till my candles almost gone i keep thinking what the end of it is to be and reproaching myself for doing nothing and yet what could i have done im sorry for hersorrier than i can say the night is so quieti havent heard a sound is she asleep awake crying triumphant  its four oclock ive been asleep  theyre back dan is lying on my bed ill try and tell you his story as near as i can in his own words  we rode he said round the upper way keeping out of the lanes and got to kingswear by halfpast eleven the horseferry had stopped running and we had a job to find any one to put us over we hired the fellow to wait for us and took a carriage at the castle before we got to black mill it was nearly one pitchdark with the breeze from the southeast i made out he should have been in an hour or more the old man had never spoken to me once and before we got there i had begun to hope we shouldnt find the fellow after all we made the driver pull up in the road and walked round and round trying to find the door then some one cried who are you  john ford  what do you want it was old pearse  to see zachary pearse  the long window out of the porch where we sat the other day was open and in we went there was a door at the end of the room and a light coming through john ford went towards it i stayed out in the dark  whos that with you  mr treffry  let him come in i went in the old fellow was in bed quite still on his pillows a candle by his side to look at him youd think nothing of him but his eyes were alive it was queer being there with those two old men  dan paused seemed to listen then went on doggedly  sit down gentleman said old pearse what may you want to see my son for john ford begged his pardon he had something to say he said that wouldnt wait  they were very polite to one another muttered dan   will you leave your message with me said pearse  what i have to say to your son is private  im his father  im my girls grandfather and her only standby  ah muttered old pearse rick voiseys daughter  i mean to see your son  old pearse smiled queer smile hes got sort of sneering sweet  you can never tell where zack may be he said you think i want to shield him youre wrong zack can take care of himself  your sons here said john ford i know old pearse gave us a very queer look  you come into my house like thieves in the night he said and give me the lie do you  your son came to my childs room like a thief in the night its for that i want to see him and then said dan there was a long silence at last pearse said  i dont understand has he played the blackguard  john ford answered hes married her or before god id kill him  old pearse seemed to think this over never moving on his pillows you dont know zack he said im sorry for you and im sorry for rick voiseys daughter but you dont know zack  sorry groaned out john ford hes stolen my child and ill punish him  punish cried old pearse we dont take punishment not in my family  captain jan pearse as sure as i stand here you and your breed will get your punishment of god old pearse smiled  mr john ford thats as may be but sure as i lie here we wont take it of you you cant punish unless you make to feel and that you cant du  and that is truth  dan went on again  you wont tell me where your son is but old pearse never blinked  i wont he said and now you may get out i lie here an old man alone with no use to my legs night on night an the house open any rapscallion could get in d ye think im afraid of you  we were beat and walked out without a word but that old man ive thought of him a lotninetytwo and lying there whatever hes been and they tell you rum things of him whatever his son may be hes a man its not what he said nor that there was anything to be afraid of just then but somehow its the idea of the old chap lying there i dont ever wish to see a better plucked one  we sat silent after that out of doors the light began to stir among the leaves there were all kinds of rustling sounds as if the world were turning over in bed  suddenly dan said  hes cheated me i paid him to clear out and leave her alone d you think shes asleep hes made no appeal for sympathy hed take pity for an insult but he feels it badly  im tired as a cat he said at last and went to sleep on my bed  its broad daylight now i too am tired as a cat     v  saturday 6th august   i take up my tale where i left off yesterday dan and i started as soon as we could get mrs hopgood to give us coffee the old lady was more tentative more undecided more pouncing than i had ever seen her she was manifestly uneasy haapgoodwho dont slape dont he if snores are any criterionhad called out in the night hark to th arses oofs had we heard them and where might we be going then twas very earrly to start an no breakfast haapgood had said it was goin to shaowerr miss pasiance was not to er violin yet an mister ford e kept is room was itwould there be well an therrs an arvest bug tis some earrly for they wonderful how she pounces on all such creatures when i cant even see them she pressed it absently between finger and thumb and began manoeuvring round another way long before she had reached her point we had gulped down our coffee and departed but as we rode out she came at a run holding her skirts high with either hand raised her old eyes bright and anxious in their setting of fine wrinkles and said  tidden sorrow for her  a shrug of the shoulders was all the answer she got we rode by the lanes through sloping farmyards all mud and pigs and dirty straw and farmers with cleanshaven upper lips and whiskers under the chin past fields of corn where larks were singing up or down we didnt draw rein till we came to dans hotel  there was the river gleaming before us under a rainbow mist that hallowed every shape there seemed affinity between the earth and the sky ive never seen that particular soft unity out of devon and every ship however black or modern on those pale waters had the look of a dream ship the tall green woods the red earth the white houses were all melted into one opal haze it was raining but the sun was shining behind gulls swooped by usghosts of the old greedy wanderers of the sea  we had told our two boatmen to pull us out to the pied witch they started with great resolution then rested on their oars  the pied witch zurr asked one politely an which may her be  thats the west countryman all over never say you nay never lose an opportunity never own he doesnt know or cant do anythingindependence amiability and an eye to the main chance we mentioned pearses name  captn zachry pearse they exchanged a look halfamused halfadmiring  the zunflaower yu mane thats her zunflaower ahoy as we mounted the steamers black side i heard one say  pied witch a praaper name thata dandy name for her they laughed as they made fast  the mate of the sunflower or pied witch or whatever she was called met usa tall young fellow in his shirtsleeves tanned to the roots of his hair with sinewy tattooed arms and grey eyes charred round the rims from staring at weather  the skipper is on board he said were rather busy as you see get on with that you seacooks he bawled at two fellows who were doing nothing all over the ship men were hauling splicing and stowing cargo  todays friday were off on wednesday with any luck will you come this way he led us down the companion to a dark hole which he called the saloon names what are you mr treffry then were partners a schoolboys glee came on his face  look here he said i can show you something and he unlocked the door of a cabin there appeared to be nothing in it but a huge piece of tarpaulin which depended bulging from the topmost bunk he pulled it up the lower bunk had been removed and in its place was the ugly body of a dismounted gatling gun  got six of them he whispered with unholy mystery through which his native frankness gaped out worth their weight in gold out there just now the skipper says got a heap of rifles too and lots of ammunition hes given me a share this is better than the p and o and playing deck cricket with the passengers id made up my mind already to chuck that and go in for plantin sugar when i ran across the skipper wonderful chap the skipper ill go and tell him hes been out all night only came aboard at four bells having a nap now but he wont mind that for you  off he went i wondered what there was in zachary pearse to attract a youngster of this sort one of the customary twelve children of some country parson no doubtburning to shoot a few niggers and for ever frank and youthful  he came back with his hands full of bottles  whatll you drink the skipperll be here in a jiffy excuse my goin on deck were so busy  and in five minutes zachary pearse did come he made no attempt to shake hands for which i respected him his face looked worn and more defiant than usual  well gentlemen he said  weve come to ask what youre going to do said dan  i dont know answered pearse that thats any of your business  dans little eyes were like the eyes of an angry pig  youve got five hundred pounds of mine he said why do you think i gave it you  zachary bit his fingers  thats no concern of mine he said i sail on wednesday your moneys safe  do you know what i think of you said dan  no and youd better not tell me then with one of his peculiar changes he smiled as you like though  dans face grew very dark give me a plain answer he said what are you going to do about her  zachary looked up at him from under his brows  nothing  are you cur enough to deny that youve married her  zachary looked at him coolly not at all he said  what in gods name did you do it for  youve no monopoly in the post of husband mr treffry  to put a child in that position havent you the heart of a man what d ye come sneaking in at night for by gad dont you know youve done a beastly thing  zacharys face darkened he clenched his fists then he seemed to shut his anger into himself  you wanted me to leave her to you he sneered i gave her my promise that id take her out there and wed have gone off on wednesday quietly enough if you hadnt come and nosed the whole thing out with your infernal dog the fats in the fire theres no reason why i should take her now ill come back to her a rich man or not at all  and in the meantime i slipped in  he turned to me in an ingratiating way  i would have taken her to save the fussi really wouldits not my fault the things come out im on a risky job to have her with me might ruin the whole thing it would affect my nerve it isnt safe for her  and whats her position to be i said while youre away do you think shed have married you if shed known you were going to leave her like this you ought to give up this business  you stole her her lifes in your hands shes only a child  a quiver passed over his face it showed that he was suffering  give it up i urged  my last farthings in it he sighed the chance of a lifetime  he looked at me doubtfully appealingly as if for the first time in his life he had been given a glimpse of that dilemma of consequences which his nature never recognises i thought he was going to give in suddenly to my horror dan growled play the man  pearse turned his head i dont want your advice anyway he said ill not be dictated to  to your last day said dan you shall answer to me for the way you treat her  zachary smiled  do you see that fly he said weli care for you as little as this and he flicked the fly off his white trousers goodmorning  the noble mariners who manned our boat pulled lustily for the shore but we had hardly shoved off when a storm of rain burst over the ship and she seemed to vanish leaving a picture on my eyes of the mate waving his cap above the rail with his tanned young face bent down at us smiling keen and friendly   we reached the shore drenched angry with ourselves and with each other i started sulkily for home  as i rode past an orchard an apple loosened by the rainstorm came down with a thud  the apples were ripe and ready to fall oh heighho and ready to fall  i made up my mind to pack and go away but theres a strangeness a sort of haunting fascination in it all to you who dont know the people it may only seem a piece of rather sordid folly but it isnt the good the obvious the useful that puts a spell on us in life its the bizarre the dimly seen the mysterious for good or evil  the sun was out again when i rode up to the farm its yellow thatch shone through the trees as if sheltering a store of gladness and good news john ford himself opened the door to me  he began with an apology which made me feel more than ever an intruder then he said  i have not spoken to my granddaughteri waited to see dan treffry  he was stern and sadeyed like a man with a great weight of grief on his shoulders he looked as if he had not slept his dress was out of order he had not taken his clothes off i think he isnt a man whom you can pity i felt i had taken a liberty in knowing of the matter at all when i told him where we had been he said  it was good of you to take this trouble that you should have had to but since such things have come to pass he made a gesture full of horror he gave one the impression of a man whose pride was struggling against a mortal hurt presently he asked  you saw him you say he admitted this marriage did he give an explanation  i tried to make pearses point of view clear before this old man with his inflexible will and sense of duty i felt as if i held a brief for zachary and must try to do him justice  let me understand he said at last he stole her you say to make sure and deserts her within a fortnight  he says he meant to take her  do you believe that  before i could answer i saw pasiance standing at the window how long she had been there i dont know  is it true that he is going to leave me behind she cried out  i could only nod  did you hear him your own self  yes  she stamped her foot  but he promised he promised  john ford went towards her  dont touch me grandfather i hate every one let him do what he likes i dont care  john fords face turned quite grey  pasiance he said did you want to leave me so much  she looked straight at us and said sharply  whats the good of telling stories i cant help its hurting you  what did you think you would find away from here  she laughed  find i dont knownothing i wouldnt be stifled anyway now i suppose youll shut me up because im a weak girl not strong like men  silence said john ford i will make him take you  you shant she cried i wont let you hes free to do as he likes hes freei tell you all everybodyfree  she ran through the window and vanished  john ford made a movement as if the bottom had dropped out of his world i left him there  i went to the kitchen where hopgood was sitting at the table eating bread and cheese he got up on seeing me and very kindly brought me some cold bacon and a pint of ale  i thart i shude be seeing yu zurr he said between his bites therrs no thart to atin bout the ouse today the old wummans puzzivantin over miss pasiance young girls are skeery crittershe brushed his sleeve over his broad hard jaws and filled a pipe specially when its in the blood of em squire rick voisey werr a dandy an mistress voiseywell she werr a nice lady tu butrolling the stem of his pipe from corner to corner of his mouthshe werr a praaper vixen  hopgoods a good fellow and i believe as soft as he looks hard but hes not quite the sort with whom one chooses to talk over a matter like this i went upstairs and began to pack but after a bit dropped it for a book and somehow or other fell asleep  i woke and looked at my watch it was five oclock i had been asleep four hours a single sunbeam was slanting across from one of my windows to the other and there was the cool sound of milk dropping into pails then all at once a stir as of alarm and heavy footsteps  i opened my door hopgood and a coastguardsman were carrying pasiance slowly up the stairs she lay in their arms without moving her face whiter than her dress a scratch across the forehead and two or three drops there of dried blood her hands were clasped and she slowly crooked and stiffened out her fingers when they turned with her at the stair top she opened her lips and gasped all right dont put me down i can bear it they passed and with a halfsmile in her eyes she said something to me that i couldnt catch the door was shut and the excited whispering began again below i waited for the men to come out and caught hold of hopgood he wiped the sweat off his forehead  poor young thing he said she felldown the cliffstis her backcoastguard saw her twerr they fetched her in the lord elp her mebbe shes not broken up much an mister ford dont know im gwine for the doctor  there was an hour or more to wait before he came a young fellow almost a boy he looked very grave when he came out of her room  the old woman there fond of her nurse her well fond as a doggood dont knowcant tell for certain afraid its the spine must have another opinion what a plucky girl tell mr ford to have the best man he can get in torquaytheres c ill be round the first thing in the morning keep her dead quiet ive left a sleeping draught shell have fever tonight  john ford came in at last poor old man what it must have cost him not to go to her for fear of the excitement how many times in the next few hours didnt i hear him come to the bottom of the stairs his heavy wheezing and sighing and the forlorn tread of his feet going back about eleven just as i was going to bed mrs hopgood came to my door  will yu come sir she said shes asking for yu naowt i can zay but what she will see yu zeems crazy dont it a tear trickled down the old ladys cheek du ee come twill du err arm mebbe but i dunnoshell fret else  i slipped into the room lying back on her pillows she was breathing quickly with halfclosed eyes there was nothing to show that she had wanted me or even knew that i was there the wick of the candle set by the bedside had been snuffed too short and gave but a faint light both window and door stood open still there was no draught and the feeble little flame burned quite still casting a faint yellow stain on the ceiling like the refection from a buttercup held beneath a chin these ceilings are far too low across the wide squat window the apple branches fell in black stripes which never stirred it was too dark to see things clearly at the foot of the bed was a chest and there mrs hopgood had sat down moving her lips as if in speech mingled with the halfmusty smell of age there were other scents of mignonette apples and some sweetsmelling soap the floor had no carpet and there was not one single dark object except the violin hanging from a nail over the bed a little round clock ticked solemnly  why wont you give me that stuff mums pasiance said in a faint sharp voice i want to sleep  have you much pain i asked  of course i have its everywhere  she turned her face towards me  you thought i did it on purpose but youre wrong if i had id have done it better than this i wouldnt have this brutal pain she put her fingers over her eyes its horrible to complain only its so bad but i wont againpromise  she took the sleeping draught gratefully making a face like a child after a powder  how long do you think itll be before i can play again oh i forgotthere are other things to think about she held out her hand to me look at my ring marriedisnt it funny ha ha nobody will ever understandthats funny too poor gran you see there wasnt any reasononly me thats the only reason im telling you now mums is therebut she doesnt count why dont you count mums  the fever was fighting against the draught she had tossed the clothes back from her throat and now and then raised one thin arm a little as if it eased her her eyes had grown large and innocent like a childs the candle too had flared and was burning clearly  nobody is to tell himnobody at all promise if i hadnt slipped it would have been different what would have happened then you cant tell and i cantthats funny do you think i loved him nobody marries without love do they not quite without love i mean but you see i wanted to be free he said hed take me and now hes left me after all i wont be left i cant when i came to the cliffthat bit where the ivy grows right downthere was just the sea there underneath so i thought i would throw myself over and it would be all quiet and i climbed on a ledge it looked easier from there but it was so high i wanted to get back and then my foot slipped and now its all pain you cant think much when youre in pain  from her eyes i saw that she was dropping off  nobody can take you away fromyourself hes not to be toldnot eveni dontwant youto go away because but her eyes closed and she dropped off to sleep  they dont seem to know this morning whether she is better or worse     vi  tuesday 9th august   it seems more like three weeks than three days since i wrote the time passes slowly in a sickhouse the doctors were here this morning they give her forty hours not a word of complaint has passed her lips since she knew to see her you would hardly think her ill her cheeks have not had time to waste or lose their colour there is not much pain but a slow creeping numbness it was john fords wish that she should be told she just turned her head to the wall and sighed then to poor old mrs hopgood who was crying her heart out dont cry mums i dont care  when they had gone she asked for her violin she made them hold it for her and drew the bow across the strings but the notes that came out were so trembling and uncertain that she dropped the bow and broke into a passion of sobbing since then no complaint or moan of any kind  but to go back on sunday the day after i wrote as i was coming from a walk i met a little boy making mournful sounds on a tin whistle  coom ahn he said the miss wahnts t zee yu  i went to her room in the morning she had seemed better but now looked utterly exhausted she had a letter in her hand  its this she said i dont seem to understand it he wants me to do somethingbut i cant think and my eyes feel funny read it to me please  the letter was from zachary i read it to her in a low voice for mrs hopgood was in the room her eyes always fixed on pasiance above her knitting when id finished she made me read it again and yet again at first she seemed pleased almost excited then came a weary scornful look and before id finished the third time she was asleep it was a remarkable letter that seemed to bring the man right before ones eyes i slipped it under her fingers on the bedclothes and went out fancy took me to the cliff where she had fallen i found the point of rock where the cascade of ivy flows down the cliff the ledge on which she had climbed was a little to my righta mad place it showed plainly what wild emotions must have been driving her behind was a halfcut cornfield with a fringe of poppies and swarms of harvest insects creeping and flying in the uncut corn a landrail kept up a continual charring the sky was blue to the very horizon and the sea wonderful under that black wild cliff stained here and there with red over the dips and hollows of the fields great white clouds hung low down above the land there are no brassy eastcoast skies here but always sleepy softshaped clouds full of subtle stir and change passages of zacharys pearses letter kept rising to my lips after all hes the man that his native place and life and blood have made him it is useless to expect idealists where the air is soft and things good to look on the idealist grows where he must create beauty or comfort for himself useless to expect a man of law and order in one whose fathers have stared at the sea day and night for a thousand yearsthe sea full of its promises of unknown things never quite the same a slave to its own impulses man is an imitative animal  lifes hard enough he wrote without tying yourself down dont think too hardly of me shall i make you happier by taking you into danger if i succeed youll be a rich woman but i shall fail if youre with me to look at you makes me soft at sea a man dreams of all the good things on land hell dream of the heather and honeyyoure like that and hell dream of the appletrees and the grass of the orchardsyoure like that sometimes he only lies on his back and wishesand youre like that most of all like that  when i was reading those words i remember a strange soft halfscornful look came over pasiances face and once she said but thats all nonsense isnt it  then followed a long passage about what he would gain if he succeeded about all that he was risking the impossibility of failure if he kept his wits about him its only a matter of two months or so he went on stay where you are dear or go to my dad hell be glad to have you theres my mothers room theres no one to say no to your fiddle there you can play it by the sea and on dark nights youll have the stars dancing to you over the water as thick as bees ive looked at them often thinking of you  pasiance had whispered to me dont read that bit and afterwards i left it out then the sensuous side of him shows up when ive brought this off theres the whole world before us there are places i can take you to theres one i know not too warm and not too cold where you can sit all day in the shade and watch the creepers and the cocoapalms still as still nothing to do or care about all the fruits you can think of no noise but the parrots and the streams and a splash when a nigger dives into a waterhole pasiance well go there with an eightyton craft theres no sea we couldnt know the worlds a fine place for those who go out to take it theres lots of unknown stuff in it yet ill fill your lap my pretty so full of treasures that you shant know yourself a man wasnt meant to sit at home  throughout this letterfor all its real passionone could feel how the man was holding to his purposethe rather sordid purpose of this venture hes unconscious of it for he is in love with her but he must be furthering his own ends he is vitalhorribly vital i wonder less now that she should have yielded  what visions hasnt he dangled before her there was physical attraction tooi havent forgotten the look i saw on her face at black mill but when alls said and done she married him because shes pasiance voisey who does things and wants to get back and she lies there dying not he nor any other man will ever take her away its pitiful to think of him tingling with passion writing that letter to this doomed girl in that dark hole of a saloon ive wanted money he wrote ever since i was a little chap sitting in the fields among the cows i want it for you now and i mean to have it ive studied the thing two years i know what i know  the moment this is in the post i leave for london there are a hundred things to look after still i cant trust myself within reach of you again till the anchors weighed when i rechristened her the pied witch i thought of youyou witch to me  there followed a solemn entreaty to her to be on the path leading to the cove at seven oclock on wednesday evening that is tomorrow when he would come ashore and bid her goodbye it was signed your loving husband zachary pearse  i lay at the edge of that cornfield a long time it was very peaceful the church bells had begun to ring the long shadows came stealing out from the sheaves woodpigeons rose one by one and flapped off to roost the western sky was streaked with red and all the downs and combe bathed in the last sunlight perfect harvest weather but oppressively still the stillness of suspense  life at the farm goes on as usual we have morning and evening prayers john ford reads them fiercely as though he were on the eve of a revolt against his god morning and evening he visits her comes out wheezing heavily and goes to his own room i believe to pray since this morning i havent dared meet him he is a strong old manbut this will break him up     vii  kingswear saturday 13th august   its overi leave here tomorrow and go abroad  a quiet afternoonnot a breath up in the churchyard i was there quite half an hour before they came some red cows had strayed into the adjoining orchard and were rubbing their heads against the railing while i stood there an old woman came and drove them away afterwards she stooped and picked up the apples that had fallen before their time  the apples are ripe and ready to fall oh heighho and ready to fall there came an old woman and gathered them all oh heighho and gathered them all   they brought pasiance very simplyno hideous funeral trappings thank godthe farm hands carried her and there was no one there but john ford the hopgoods myself and that young doctor they read the service over her grave i can hear john fords amen now when it was over he walked away bareheaded in the sun without a word i went up there again this evening and wandered amongst the tombstones richard voisey john the son of richard and constance voisey margery voisey so many generations of them in that corner then richard voisey and agnes his wife and next to it that new mound on which a sparrow was strutting and the shadows of the appletrees already hovering  i will tell you the little left to tell  on wednesday afternoon she asked for me again  its only till seven she whispered hes certain to come then but if iwere to die firstthen tell himim sorry for him they keep saying dont talkdont talk isnt it stupid as if i should have any other chance therell be no more talking after tonight make everybody come pleasei want to see them all when youre dying youre freer than any other timenobody wants you to do things nobody cares what you say he promised me i should do what i liked if i married himi never believed that reallybut now i can do what i like and say all the things i want to she lay back silent she could not after all speak the inmost thoughts that are in each of us so sacred that they melt away at the approach of words  i shall remember her like thatwith the gleam of a smile in her halfclosed eyes her red lips partedsuch a quaint look of mockery pleasure regret on her little round upturned face the room white and fresh with flowers the breeze guttering the appleleaves against the window in the night they had unhooked the violin and taken it away she had not missed it when dan came i gave up my place to him he took her hand gently in his great paw without speaking  how small my hand looks there she said too small dan put it softly back on the bedclothes and wiped his forehead pasiance cried in a sharp whisper is it so hot in here i didnt know dan bent down put his lips to her fingers and left the room  the afternoon was long the longest ive ever spent sometimes she seemed to sleep sometimes whispered to herself about her mother her grandfather the garden or her catsall sorts of inconsequent trivial even ludicrous memories seemed to throng her mindnever once i think did she speak of zachary but now and then she asked the time each hour she grew visibly weaker john ford sat by her without moving his heavy breathing was often the only sound sometimes she rubbed her fingers on his hand without speaking it was a summary of their lives together once he prayed aloud for her in a hoarse voice then her pitiful impatient eyes signed to me  quick she whispered i want him its all socold  i went out and ran down the path towards the cove  leaning on a gate stood zachary an hour before his time dressed in the same old blue clothes and leatherpeaked cap as on the day when i saw him first he knew nothing of what had happened but at a quarter of the truth im sure he divined the whole though he would not admit it to himself he kept saying it cant be shell be well in a few daysa sprain d you think the seavoyage is she strong enough to be moved now at once  it was painful to see his face so twisted by the struggle between his instinct and his vitality the sweat poured down his forehead he turned round as we walked up the path and pointed out to sea there was his steamer i could get her on board in no time impossible what is it then spine good god the doctors sometimes theyll do wonders it was pitiful to see his efforts to blind himself to the reality  it cant be shes too young were walking very slow i told him she was dying  for a second i thought he was going to run away then he jerked up his head and rushed on towards the house at the foot of the staircase he gripped me by the shoulder  its not true he said shell get better now im here ill stay let everything go ill stay  nows the time i said to show you loved her pull yourself together man he shook all over  yes was all he answered we went into her room it seemed impossible she was going to die the colour was bright in her cheeks her lips trembling and pouted as if she had just been kissed her eyes gleaming her hair so dark and crisp her face so young  half an hour later i stole to the open door of her room she was still and white as the sheets of her bed john ford stood at the foot and bowed to the level of the pillows his head on his clenched fists sat zachary it was utterly quiet the guttering of the leaves had ceased when things have come to a crisis how little one feelsno fear no pity no sorrow rather the sense as when a play is over of anxiety to get away  suddenly zachary rose brushed past me without seeing and ran downstairs  some hours later i went out on the path leading to the cove it was pitchblack the riding light of the pied witch was still there looking no bigger than a firefly then from in front i heard sobbinga mans sobs no sound is quite so dreadful zachary pearse got up out of the bank not ten paces off  i had no heart to go after him and sat down in the hedge there was something subtly akin to her in the fresh darkness of the young night the soft bank the scent of honeysuckle the touch of the ferns and brambles death comes to all of us and when its over its over but this blind businessof those left behind  a little later the ship whistled twice her starboard light gleamed faintlyand that was all     viii  torquay 30th october   do you remember the letters i wrote you from moor farm nearly three years ago today i rode over there i stopped at brixham on the way for lunch and walked down to the quay there had been a showerbut the sun was out again shining on the sea the brownred sails and the rampart of slate roofs  a trawler was lying there which had evidently been in a collision the spikybearded thinlipped fellow in torn blue jersey and seaboots who was superintending the repairs said to me a little proudly  bane in collision zurr like to zee over her then suddenly screwing up his little blue eyes he added  why i remembers yu steered yu along o the young lady in this yer very craft  it was prawle zachary pearses henchman  yes he went on thats the cutter  and captain pearse  he leant his back against the quay and spat he was a praaper man i never zane none like en  did you do any good out there  prawle gave me a sharp glance  gude no twas arrm we done vrom ztart to finishhad trouble

puzzivantin fellers the worlds to small  with these words there flashed across me a vision of drake crushed into our modern life by the shrinkage of the world drake caught in the meshes of red tape electric wires and all the lofty appliances of our civilization does a type survive its age live on into times that have no room for it the blood is thereand sometimes theres a throwback all fancy eh  so i said you failed  prawle wriggled  i wudden goo for to zay that zurrtis an ugly word daam he added staring at his boots twas thru me tu we were along among the haythen and i mus nades goo for to

day but therrs not a one thatll show better zport than captn zachry pearse  i believe that he will be hard to kill the vision of him comes up with his perfect balance defiant eyes and sweetish smile the way the hair of his beard crisped a little and got blacker on the cheeks the sort of desperate feeling he gave that one would never get the better of him that he would never get the better of himself  i took leave of prawle and half a crown before i was off the quay i heard him saying to a lady bane in collision marm like to zee over her  after lunch i rode on to moor the old place looked much the same but the appletrees were stripped of fruit and their leaves beginning to go yellow and fall one of pasiances cats passed me in the orchard hunting a bird still with a ribbon round its neck john ford showed me all his latest improvements but never by word or sign alluded to the past he inquired after dan back in new zealand now without much interest his stubbly beard and hair have whitened he has grown very stout and i noticed that his legs are not well under control he often stops to lean on his stick he was very ill last winter and sometimes they say will go straight off to sleep in the middle of a sentence  i managed to get a few minutes with the hopgoods we talked of pasiance sitting in the kitchen under a row of plates with that clinging smell of woodsmoke bacon and age bringing up memories as nothing but scents can the dear old ladys hair drawn so nicely down her forehead on each side from the centre of her cap has a few thin silver lines and her face is a thought more wrinkled the tears still come into her eyes when she talks of her lamb  of zachary i heard nothing but she told me of old pearses death  therr they found en zo to spake deadin th sun but haapgood can tell yu and hopgood ever rolling his pipe muttered something and smiled his wooden smile  he came to see me off from the strawyard tis like death to the varrm zurr he said putting all the play of his vast shoulders into the buckling of my girths mister fordwell and not one of th old stock to take it when es garn ah it werr cruel my old womans never been hersel since tell ee what tisdont du t think to much  i went out of my way to pass the churchyard there were flowers quite fresh chrysanthemums and asters above them the white stone already stained          pasiance          wife of zachary pearse          the lord hath given and the lord hath taken away  the red cows were there too the sky full of great white clouds some birds whistling a little mournfully and in the air the scent of fallen leaves  may 1900     a knight  to my mother     a knight     i  at monte carlo in the spring of the year 189 i used to notice an old fellow in a grey suit and sunburnt straw hat with a black ribbon every morning at eleven oclock he would come down to the place followed by a brindled german boarhound walk once or twice round it and seat himself on a bench facing the casino there he would remain in the sun with his straw hat tilted forward his thin legs apart his brown hands crossed between them and the dogs nose resting on his knee after an hour or more he would get up and stooping a little from the waist walk slowly round the place and return up hill just before three he would come down again in the same clothes and go into the casino leaving the dog outside  one afternoon moved by curiosity i followed him he passed through the hall without looking at the gamblingrooms and went into the concert it became my habit after that to watch for him when he sat in the place i could see him from the window of my room the chief puzzle to me was the matter of his nationality  his lean short face had a skin so burnt that it looked like leather his jaw was long and prominent his chin pointed and he had hollows in his cheeks there were wrinkles across his forehead his eyes were brown and little white moustaches were brushed up from the corners of his lips the back of his head bulged out above the lines of his lean neck and high sharp shoulders his grey hair was cropped quite close in the marseilles buffet on the journey out i had met an englishman almost his counterpart in featuresbut somehow very different this old fellow had nothing of the others alert autocratic selfsufficiency he was quiet and undemonstrative without looking as it were insulated against shocks and foreign substances he was certainly no frenchman his eyes indeed were brown but hazelbrown and gentlenot the redbrown sensual eye of the frenchman an american but was ever an american so passive a german his moustache was certainly brushed up but in a modest almost pathetic way not in the least teutonic nothing seemed to fit him i gave him up and named him the cosmopolitan  leaving at the end of april i forgot him altogether in the same month however of the following year i was again at monte carlo and going one day to the concert found myself seated next this same old fellow the orchestra was playing meyerbeers prophete and my neighbour was asleep snoring softly he was dressed in the same grey suit with the same straw hat or one exactly like it on his knees and his hands crossed above it sleep had not disfigured himhis little white moustache was still brushed up his lips closed a very good and gentle expression hovered on his face a curved mark showed on his right temple the scar of a cut on the side of his neck and his left hand was covered by an old glove the little forger of which was empty he woke up when the march was over and brisked up his moustache  the next thing on the programme was a little thing by poise from le joli gilles played by mons corsanego on the violin happening to glance at my old neighbour i saw a tear caught in the hollow of his cheek and another just leaving the corner of his eye there was a faint smile on his lips then came an interval and while orchestra and audience were resting i asked him if he were fond of music he looked up without distrust bowed and answered in a thin gentle voice certainly i know nothing about it play no instrument could never sing a note but fond of it who would not be his english was correct enough but with an emphasis not quite american nor quite foreign i ventured to remark that he did not care for meyerbeer he smiled  ah he said i was asleep too bad of me he is a little noisyi know so little about music there is bach for instance would you believe it he gives me no pleasure a great misfortune to be no musician he shook his head  i murmured bach is too elevating for you perhaps  to me he answered any music i like is elevating people say some music has a bad effect on them i never found any music that gave me a bad thoughtnonoquite the opposite only sometimes as you see i go to sleep but what a lovely instrument the violin a faint flush came on his parched cheeks the human soul that has left the body a curious thing distant bugles at night have given me the same feeling the orchestra was now coming back and folding his hands my neighbour turned his eyes towards them when the concert was over we came out together waiting at the entrance was his dog  you have a beautiful dog  ah yes freda mia cara da su mano the dog squatted on her haunches and lifted her paw in the vague bored way of big dogs when requested to perform civilities she was a lovely creaturethe purest brindle without a speck of white and free from the unbalanced look of most dogs of her breed  basta basta he turned to me apologetically we have agreed to speak italian in that way i keep up the language astonishing the number of things that dog will understand i was about to take my leave when he asked if i would walk a little way with himif you are free that is we went up the street with freda on the far side of her master  do you never play here i asked him  play no it must be very interesting most exciting but as a matter of fact i cant afford it if one has very little one is too nervous  he had stopped in front of a small hairdressers shop i live here he said raising his hat again au revoirunless i can offer you a glass of tea its all ready come ive brought you out of your way give me the pleasure  i have never met a man so free from all selfconsciousness and yet so delicate and diffident the combination is a rare one we went up a steep staircase to a room on the second floor my companion threw the shutters open setting all the flies buzzing the top of a planetree was on a level with the window and all its little brown balls were dancing quite close in the wind as he had promised an urn was hissing on a table there was also a small brown teapot some sugar slices of lemon and glasses a bed washstand cupboard tin trunk two chairs and a small rug were all the furniture above the bed a sword in a leather sheath was suspended from two nails the photograph of a girl stood on the closed stove my host went to the cupboard and produced a bottle a glass and a second spoon when the cork was drawn the scent of rum escaped into the air he sniffed at it and dropped a teaspoonful into both glasses  this is a trick i learned from the russians after plevna they had my little finger so i deserved something in exchange he looked round his eyes his whole face seemed to twinkle i assure you it was worth itmakes all the difference try he poured off the tea  had you a sympathy with the turks  the weaker side he paused abruptly then added but it was not that over his face innumerable crowsfeet had suddenly appeared his eyes twitched he went on hurriedly i had to find something to do just thenit was necessary he stared into his glass and it was some time before i ventured to ask if he had seen much fighting  yes he replied gravely nearly twenty years altogether i was one of garibaldis mille in 60  surely you are not italian  he leaned forward with his hands on his knees i was in genoa at that time learning banking garibaldi was a wonderful man one could not help it he spoke quite simply you might say it was like seeing a little man stand up to a ring of great hulking fellows i went just as you would have gone if youd been there i was not long with themour war began i had to go back home he said this as if there had been but one war since the world began in 60 he mused till 65 just think of it the poor country why in my state south carolinai was through it allnobody could be spared therewe were one to three  i suppose you have a love of fighting  hm he said as if considering the idea for the first time sometimes i fought for a living and sometimesbecause i was obliged one must try to be a gentleman but wont you have some more  i refused more tea and took my leave carrying away with me a picture of the old fellow looking down from the top of the steep staircase one hand pressed to his back the other twisting up those little white moustaches and murmuring take care my dear sir theres a step there at the corner  to be a gentleman i repeated in the street causing an old french lady to drop her parasol so that for about two minutes we stood bowing and smiling to each other then separated full of the best feeling     ii  a week later i found myself again seated next him at a concert in the meantime i had seen him now and then but only in passing he seemed depressed the corners of his lips were tightened his tanned cheeks had a greyish tinge his eyes were restless and between two numbers of the programme he murmured tapping his fingers on his hat do you ever have bad days yes not pleasant are they  then something occurred from which all that i have to tell you followed there came into the concerthall the heroine of one of those romances crimes follies or irregularities call it what you will which had just attracted the worlds stare she passed us with her partner and sat down in a chair a few rows to our right she kept turning her head round and at every turn i caught the gleam of her uneasy eyes some one behind us said the brazen baggage  my companion turned full round and glared at whoever it was who had spoken the change in him was quite remarkable his lips were drawn back from his teeth he frowned the scar on his temple had reddened  ah he said to me the hue and cry contemptible how i hate it but you wouldnt understand he broke off and slowly regained his usual air of selfobliteration he even seemed ashamed and began trying to brush his moustaches higher than ever as if aware that his heat had robbed them of neatness  im not myself when i speak of such matters he said suddenly and began reading his programme holding it upside down a minute later however he said in a peculiar voice there are people to be found who object to vivisecting animals but the vivisection of a woman who minds that will you tell me its right that because of some tragedy like thisbelieve me it is always a tragedywe should hunt down a woman that her fellowwomen should make an outcast of her that we who are men should make a prey of her if i thought that again he broke off staring very hard in front of him it is we who make them what they are and even if that is not sowhy if i thought there was a woman in the world i could not take my hat off toiicouldnt sleep at night he got up from his seat put on his old straw hat with trembling fingers and without a glance back went out stumbling over the chairlegs  i sat there horribly disturbed the words one must try to be a gentleman haunting me when i came out he was standing by the entrance with one hand on his hip and the other on his dog in that attitude of waiting he was such a patient figure the sun glared down and showed the threadbare nature of his clothes and the thinness of his brown hands with their long forgers and nails yellow from tobacco seeing me he came up the steps again and raised his hat  i am glad to have caught you please forget all that i asked if he would do me the honour of dining at my hotel  dine he repeated with the sort of smile a child gives if you offer him a box of soldiers with the greatest pleasure i seldom dine out but i think i can muster up a coat yesyesand at what time shall i come at halfpast seven and your hotel is good i shall be there freda mia cara you will be alone this evening you do not smoke caporal i fear i find it fairly good though it has too much bite he walked off with freda puffing at his thin roll of caporal  once or twice he stopped as if bewildered or beset by some sudden doubt or memory and every time he stopped freda licked his hand they disappeared round the corner of the street and i went to my hotel to see about dinner on the way i met jules le ferrier and asked him to come too  my faith yes he said with the rosy pessimism characteristic of the french editor man must dine  at halfpast six we assembled my cosmopolitan was in an old frockcoat braided round the edges buttoned high and tight defining more than ever the sharp lines of his shoulders and the slight kink of his back he had brought with him too a darkpeaked cap of military shape which he had evidently selected as more fitting to the coat than a straw hat he smelled slightly of some herb  we sat down to dinner and did not rise for two hours he was a charming guest praised everything he atenot with commonplaces but in words that made you feel it had given him real pleasure at first whenever jules made one of his caustic remarks he looked quite pained but suddenly seemed to make up his mind that it was bark not bite and then at each of them he would turn to me and say aha thats goodisnt it with every glass of wine he became more gentle and more genial sitting very upright and tightly buttonedin while the little white wings of his moustache seemed about to leave him for a better world  in spite of the most leading questions however we could not get him to talk about himself for even jules most cynical of men had recognised that he was a hero of romance he would answer gently and precisely and then sit twisting his moustaches perfectly unconscious that we wanted more presently as the wine went a little to his head his thin high voice grew thinner his cheeks became flushed his eyes brighter at the end of dinner he said i hope i have not been noisy  we assured him that he had not been noisy enough youre laughing at me he answered surely ive been talking all the time  mon dieu said jules we have been looking for some fables of your wars but nothingnothing not enough to feed a frog  the old fellow looked troubled  to be sure he mused let me think there is that about colhoun at gettysburg and theres the story of garibaldi and the miller he plunged into a tale not at all about himself which would have been extremely dull but for the conviction in his eyes and the way he stopped and commented so you see he ended thats the sort of man garibaldi was i could tell you another tale of him catching an introspective look in juless eye however i proposed taking our cigars over to the cafe opposite  delightful the old fellow said we shall have a band and the fresh air and clear consciences for our cigars i cannot like this smoking in a room where there are ladies dining  he walked out in front of us smoking with an air of great enjoyment jules glowing above his candid shirt and waistcoat whispered to me mon cher georges how he is good then sighed and added darkly the poor man  we sat down at a little table close by the branches of a planetree rustled faintly their leaves hung lifeless speckled like the breasts of birds or black against the sky then caught by the breeze fluttered suddenly  the old fellow sat with head thrown back a smile on his face coming now and then out of his enchanted dreams to drink coffee answer our questions or hum the tune that the band was playing the ash of his cigar grew very long one of those bizarre figures in oriental garb who night after night offer their doubtful wares at a great price appeared in the white glare of a lamp looked with a furtive smile at his face and glided back discomfited by its unconsciousness it was a night for dreams a faint halfeastern scent in the air of black tobacco and spice few people as yet at the little tables the waiters leisurely the band soft what was he dreaming of that old fellow whose cigarash grew so long of youth of his battles of those things that must be done by those who try to be gentlemen perhaps only of his dinner anyway of something gilded in vague fashion as the light was gilding the branches of the planetree  jules pulled my sleeve he sleeps he had smilingly dropped off the cigarashthat feathery tower of his dreamshad broken and fallen on his sleeve he awoke and fell to dusting it  the little tables round us began to fill one of the bandsmen played a czardas on the czymbal two young frenchmen talking loudly sat down at the adjoining table they were discussing the lady who had been at the concert that afternoon  its a bet said one of them but theres the present man i take three weeks thats enough elle est declassee ce nest que le premier pas  my old friends cigar fell on the table monsieur he stammered you speak of a lady so in a public place  the young man stared at him who is this person he said to his companion  my guest took up juless glove that lay on the table before either of us could raise a finger he had swung it in the speakers face enough he said and dropping the glove walked away  we all jumped to our feet i left jules and hurried after him his face was grim his eyes those of a creature who has been struck on a raw place he made a movement of his fingers which said plainly leave me if you please  i went back to the cafe the two young men had disappeared so had jules but everything else was going on just as before the bandsman still twanging out his czardas the waiters serving drinks the orientals trying to sell their carpets i paid the bill sought out the manager and apologised he shrugged his shoulders smiled and said an eccentric your friend nicht wahr could he tell me where m le ferrier was he could not i left to look for jules could not find him and returned to my hotel disgusted i was sorry for my old guest but vexed with him too what business had he to carry his quixotism to such an unpleasant length i tried to read eleven oclock struck the casino disgorged a stream of people the place seemed fuller of life than ever then slowly it grew empty and quite dark the whim seized me to go out it was a still night very warm very black on one of the seats a man and woman sat embraced on another a girl was sobbing on a thirdstrange sighta priest dozed i became aware of some one at my side it was my old guest  if you are not too tired he said can you give me ten minutes  certainly will you come in  no no let us go down to the terrace i shant keep you long  he did not speak again till we reached a seat above the pigeonshooting grounds there in a darkness denser for the string of lights still burning in the town we sat down  i owe you an apology he said first in the afternoon then again this eveningyour guestyour friends glove i have behaved as no gentleman should he was leaning forward with his hands on the handle of a stick his voice sounded broken and disturbed  oh i muttered its nothing  you are very good he sighed but i feel that i must explain i consider i owe this to you but i must tell you i should not have the courage if it were not for another reason you see i have no friend he looked at me with an uncertain smile i bowed and a minute or two later he began     iii  you will excuse me if i go back rather far it was in 74 when i had been ill with cuban fever to keep me alive they had put me on board a ship at santiago and at the end of the voyage i found myself in london i had very little money i knew nobody i tell you sir there are times when its hard for a fighting man to get anything to do people would say to me afraid weve nothing for a man like you in our business i tried people of all sorts but it was truei had been fighting here and there since 60 i wasnt fit for anything he shook his head in the south before the war they had a saying i remember about a dog and a soldier having the same value but all this has nothing to do with what i have to tell you he sighed again and went on moistening his lips i was walking along the strand one day very disheartened when i heard my name called its a queer thing that in a strange street by the way he put in with dry ceremony you dont know my name i think it is bruneroger brune at first i did not recognise the person who called me he had just got off an omnibusa squareshouldered man with heavy moustaches and round spectacles but when he shook my hand i knew him at once he was a man called dalton who was taken prisoner at gettysburg one of you englishmen who came to fight with usa major in the regiment where i was captain we were comrades during two campaigns if i had been his brother he couldnt have seemed more pleased to see me he took me into a bar for the sake of old times the drink went to my head and by the time we reached trafalgar square i was quite unable to walk he made me sit down on a bench i was in factdrunk its disgraceful to be drunk but there was some excuse now i tell you sir all through his story he was always making use of that expression it seemed to infuse fresh spirit into him to help his memory in obscure places to give him the mastery of his emotions it was like the piece of paper a nervous man holds in his hand to help him through a speech there never was a man with a finer soul than my friend dalton he was not clever though he had read much and sometimes perhaps he was too fond of talking but he was a gentleman he listened to me as if i had been a child he was not ashamed of meand it takes a gentleman not to be ashamed of a drunken man in the streets of london god knows what things i said to him while we were sitting there he took me to his home and put me to bed himself for i was down again with fever he stopped turned slightly from me and put his hand up to his brow well then it was sir that i first saw her i am not a poet and i cannot tell you what she seemed to me i was delirious but i always knew when she was there i had dreams of sunshine and cornfields of dancing waves at sea young treesnever the same dreams never anything for long together and when i had my senses i was afraid to say so for fear she would go away shed be in the corner of the room with her hair hanging about her neck a bright gold colour she never worked and never read but sat and talked to herself in a whisper or looked at me for a long time together out of her blue eyes a little frown between them and her upper lip closed firm on her lower lip where she had an uneven tooth when her father came shed jump up and hang on to his neck until he groaned then run away but presently come stealing back on tiptoe i used to listen for her footsteps on the stairs then the knock the door flung back or opened quietlyyou never could tell which and her voice with a little lisp are you better today mr brune what funny things you say when youre delirious father says youve been in heaps of battles  he got up paced restlessly to and fro and sat down again i remember every word as if it were yesterday all the things she said and did ive had a long time to think them over you see well i must tell you the first morning that i was able to get up i missed her dalton came in her place and i asked him where she was my dear fellow he answered ive sent eilie away to her old nurses inn down on the river shes better there at this time of year we looked at each other and i saw that he had sent her away because he didnt trust me i was hurt by this illness spoils one he was right he was quite right for all he knew about me was that i could fight and had got drunk but i am very quicktempered i made up my mind at once to leave him but i was too weakhe had to put me to bed again the very next morning he came and proposed that i should go into partnership with him he kept a fencingschool and pistolgallery it seemed like the finger of god and perhaps it waswho knows he fell into a reverie and taking out his caporal rolled himself a cigarette having lighted it he went on suddenly there in the room above the school we used to sit in the evenings one on each side of the grate the room was on the second floor i remember with two windows and a view of nothing but the houses opposite the furniture was covered up with chintz the things on the bookshelf were never disturbed they were eilieshalfbroken cases with butterflies a dead frog in a bottle a horseshoe covered with tinfoil some shells too and a cardboard box with three speckled eggs in it and these words written on the lid misselthrush from lucys treesecond family only one blown he smoked fiercely with puffs that were like sharp sighs  dalton was wrapped up in her he was never tired of talking to me about her and i was never tired of hearing we had a number of pupils but in the evening when we sat there smokingour talk would sooner or latercome round to her her bedroom opened out of that sittingroom he took me in once and showed me a narrow little room the width of a passage fresh and white with a photograph of her mother above the bed and an empty basket for a dog or cat he broke off with a vexed air and resumed sternly as if trying to bind himself to the narration of his more important facts she was then fifteenher mother had been dead twelve yearsa beautiful face her mothers it had been her death that sent dalton to fight with us well sir one day in august very hot weather he proposed a run into the country and who should meet us on the platform when we arrived but eilie in a blue sunbonnet and frockflax blue her favourite colour i was angry with dalton for not telling me that we should see her my clothes were not quitemy hair wanted cutting it was black then sir he added tracing a pattern in the darkness with his stick she had a little donkeycart she drove and while we walked one on each side she kept looking at me from under her sunbonnet i must tell you that she never laughedher eyes danced her cheeks would go pink and her hair shake about on her neck but she never laughed her old nurse lucy a very broad good woman had married the proprietor of the inn in the village there i have never seen anything like that inn sweethriar up to the roof and the scenti am very susceptible to scents his head drooped and the cigarette fell from his hand a train passing beneath sent up a shower of sparks he started and went on we had our lunch in the parlouri remember that room very well for i spent the happiest days of my life afterwards in that inn we went into a meadow after lunch and my friend dalton fell asleep a wonderful thing happened then eilie whispered to me lets have a jolly time she took me for the most glorious walk the river was close by a lovely stream your river thames so calm and broad it is like the spirit of your people i was bewitched i forgot my friend i thought of nothing but how to keep her to myself it was such a day there are days that are the devils but that was truly one of gods she took me to a little pond under an elmtree and we dragged it we two an hour for a kind of tiny red worm to feed some creature that she had we found them in the mud and while she was bending over the curls got in her eyes if you could have seen her then i think sir you would have said she was like the first sight of spring we had tea afterwards all together in the long grass under some fruittrees if i had the knack of words there are things that i could say he bent as though in deference to those unspoken memories twilight came on while we were sitting there a wonderful thing is twilight in the country it became time for us to go there was an avenue of trees close bylike a church with a window at the end where golden light came through i walked up and down it with her will you come again she whispered and suddenly she lifted up her face to be kissed i kissed her as if she were a little child and when we said goodbye her eyes were looking at me across her fathers shoulder with surprise and sorrow in them why do you go away they seemed to say but i must tell you he went on hurriedly of a thing that happened before we had gone a hundred yards we were smoking our pipes and i thinking of herwhen out she sprang from the hedge and stood in front of us dalton cried out what are you here for again you mad girl she rushed up to him and hugged him but when she looked at me her face was quite differentcareless defiant as one might sayit hurt me i couldnt understand it and what one doesnt understand frightens one     iv  time went on there was no swordsman or pistolshot like me in london they said we had as many pupils as we likedit was the only part of my life when i have been able to save money i had no chance to spend it we gave lessons all day and in the evening were too tired to go out that year i had the misfortune to lose my dear mother i became a rich manyes sir at that time i must have had not less than six hundred a year  it was a long time before i saw eilie again she went abroad to dresden with her fathers sister to learn french and german it was in the autumn of 1875 when she came back to us she was seventeen thena beautiful young creature he paused as if to gather his forces for description and went on  tall as a young tree with eyes like the sky i would not say she was perfect but her imperfections were beautiful to me what is it makes you loveah sir that is very hidden and mysterious she had never lost the trick of closing her lips tightly when she remembered her uneven tooth you may say that was vanity but in a young girland which of us is not vain eh old men and maidens young men and children  as i said she came back to london to her little room and in the evenings was always ready with our tea you mustnt suppose she was housewifely there is something in me that never admired housewifelinessa fine quality no doubt still he sighed  no he resumed eilie was not like that for she was never quite the same two days together i told you her eyes were like the skythat was true of all of her in one thing however at that time she always seemed the samein love for her father for me i dont know what i should have expected but my presence seemed to have the effect of making her dumb i would catch her looking at me with a frown and then as if to make up to her own natureand a more loving nature never came into this world that i shall maintain to my dying dayshe would go to her father and kiss him when i talked with him she pretended not to notice but i could see her face grow cold and stubborn i am not quick and it was a long time before i understood that she was jealous she wanted him all to herself ive often wondered how she could be his daughter for he was the very soul of justice and a slow man tooand she was as quick as a bird for a long time after i saw her dislike of me i refused to believe itif one does not want to believe a thing there are always reasons why it should not seem true at least so it is with me and i suppose with all selfish men  i spent evening after evening there when if i had not thought only of myself i should have kept away but one day i could no longer be blind  it was a sunday in february i always had an invitation on sundays to dine with them in the middle of the day there was no one in the sittingroom but the door of eilies bedroom was open i heard her voice that man always that man it was enough for me i went down again without coming in and walked about all day  for three weeks i kept away to the school of course i came as usual but not upstairs i dont know what i told daltonit did not signify what you told him he always had a theory of his own and was persuaded of its trutha very singleminded man sir  but now i come to the most wonderful days of my life it was an early spring that year i had fallen away already from my resolution and used to slink upseldom its trueand spend the evening with them as before one afternoon i came up to the sittingroom the light was failingit was warm and the windows were open in the air was that feeling which comes to you once a year in the spring no matter where you may be in a crowded street or alone in a forest only oncea feeling likebut i cannot describe it  eilie was sitting there if you dont know sir i cant tell you what it means to be near the woman one loves she was leaning on the windowsill staring down into the street it was as though she might be looking out for some one i stood hardly breathing she turned her head and saw me her eyes were strange they seemed to ask me a question but i couldnt have spoken for the world i cant tell you what i felti dared not speak or think or hope i have been in nineteen battlesseveral times in positions of some danger when the lifting of a finger perhaps meant death but i have never felt what i was feeling at that moment i knew something was coming and i was paralysed with terror lest it should not come he drew a long breath  the servant came in with a light and broke the spell all that night i lay awake and thought of how she had looked at me with the colour coming slowly up in her cheeks  it was three days before i plucked up courage to go again and then i felt her eyes on me at onceshe was making a cats cradle with a bit of string but i could see them stealing up from her hands to my face and she went wandering about the room fingering at everything when her father called out whats the matter with you elie she stared at him like a child caught doing wrong i looked straight at her then she tried to look at me but she couldnt and a minute later she went out of the room god knows what sort of nonsense i talkedi was too happy  then began our love i cant tell you of that time often and often dalton said to me whats come to the child nothing i can do pleases her all the love she had given him was now for me but he was too simple and straight to see what was going on how many times havent i felt criminal towards him but when youre happy with the tide in your favour you become a coward at once     v  well sir he went on we were married on her eighteenth birthday it was a long time before dalton became aware of our love but one day he said to me with a very grave look  eilie has told me brune i forbid it shes too young and youretoo old i was then fortyfive my hair as black and thick as a rooks feathers and i was strong and active i answered him we shall be married within a month we parted in anger it was a may night and i walked out far into the country theres no remedy for anger or indeed for anything so fine as walking once i stoppedit was on a common without a house or light and the stars shining like jewels i was hot from walking i could feel the blood boiling in my veinsi said to myself old are you and i laughed like a fool it was the thought of losing heri wished to believe myself angry but really i was afraid fear and anger in me are very much the same a friend of mine a bit of a poet sir once called them the two black wings of self and so they are so they are the next morning i went to dalton again and somehow i made him yield im not a philosopher but it has often seemed to me that no benefit can come to us in this life without an equal loss somewhere but does that stop us no sir not often  we were married on the 30th of june 1876 in the parish church the only people present were dalton lucy and lucys husbanda big redfaced fellow with blue eyes and a golden beard parted in two it had been arranged that we should spend the honeymoon down at their inn on the river my wife dalton and i went to a restaurant for lunch she was dressed in grey the colour of a pigeons feathers he paused leaning forward over the crutch handle of his stick trying to conjure up no doubt that longago image of his young bride in her dress the colour of a pigeons feathers with her blue eyes and yellow hair the little frown between her brows the firmly shut red lips opening to speak the words for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health  at that time sir he went on suddenly i was a bit of a dandy i wore i remember a blue frockcoat with white trousers and a grey top hat even now i should always prefer to be well dressed  we had an excellent lunch and drank veuve clicquot a wine that you cannot get in these days dalton came with us to the railway station i cant bear partings and yet they must come  that evening we walked out in the cool under the aspentrees what should i remember in all my life if not that nightthe young bullocks snuffling in the gatewaysthe campion flowers all lighted up along the hedgesthe moon with a halobats too in and out among the stems and the shadows of the cottages as black and soft as that sea down there for a long time we stood on the riverbank beneath a limetree the scent of the lime flowers a man can only endure about half his joy about half his sorrow lucy and her husband he went on presently his name was frank tora man like an old viking who ate nothing but milk bread and fruitwere very good to us it was like paradise in that innthough the commissariat i am bound to say was limited the sweethriar grew round our bedroom windows when the breeze blew the leaves across the openingit was like a bath of perfume eilie grew as brown as a gipsy while we were there i dont think any man could have loved her more than i did but there were times when my heart stood still it didnt seem as if she understood how much i loved her one day i remember she coaxed me to take her camping we drifted downstream all the afternoon and in the evening pulled into the reeds under the willowboughs and lit a fire for her to cook bythough as a matter of fact our provisions were cooked alreadybut you know how it is all the romance was in having a real fire we wont pretend she kept saying while we were eating our supper a hare came to our clearinga big fellowhow surprised he looked the tall hare eilie called him after that we sat by the ashes and watched the shadows till at last she roamed away from me the time went very slowly i got up to look for her it was past sundown i called and called it was a long time before i found herand she was like a wild thing hot and flushed her pretty frock torn her hands and face scratched her hair down like some beautiful creature of the woods if one loves a little thing will scare one i didnt think she had noticed my fright but when we got back to the boat she threw her arms round my neck and said i wont ever leave you again  once in the night i wokea waterhen was crying and in the moonlight a kingfisher flew across the wonder on the riverthe wonder of the moon and trees the soft bright mist the stillness it was like another world peaceful enchanted far holier than ours it seemed like a vision of the thoughts that come to onehow seldom and go if one tries to grasp them magicpoetrysacred he was silent a minute then went on in a wistful voice i looked at her sleeping like a child with her hair loose and her lips apart and i thought god do so to me if ever i bring her pain how was i to understand her the mystery and innocence of her soul the river has had all my light and all my darkness the happiest days and the hours when ive despaired and i like to think of it for you know in time bitter memories fade only the good remain yet the good have their own pain a different kind of aching for we shall never get them back sir he said turning to me with a faint smile its no use crying over spilt milk in the neighbourhood of lucys inn the rose and maybushcan you imagine a prettier name i have been all over the world and nowhere found names so pretty as in the english country there too every blade of grass and flower has a kind of pride about it knows it will be cared for and all the roads trees and cottages seem to be certain that they will live for ever but i was going to tell you half a mile from the inn was a quiet old house which we used to call the conventthough i believe it was a farm we spent many afternoons there trespassing in the orchardeilie was fond of trespassing if there were a long way round across somebody elses property she would always take it we spent our last afternoon in that orchard lying in the long grass i was reading childe harold for the first timea wonderful a memorable poem i was at that passagethe bullfightyou remember       thrice sounds the clarion lo the signal falls        the din expands and expectation mute  when suddenly eilie said suppose i were to leave off loving you it was as if some one had struck me in the face i jumped up and tried to take her in my arms but she slipped away then she turned and began laughing softly i laughed too i dont know why     vi  we went back to london the next day we lived quite close to the school and about five days a week dalton came to dine with us he would have come every day if he had not been the sort of man who refuses to consult his own pleasure we had more pupils than ever in my leisure i taught my wife to fence i have never seen any one so lithe and quick or so beautiful as she looked in her fencing dress with embroidered shoes  i was completely happy when a man has obtained his desire he becomes careless and selfsatisfied i was watchful however for i knew that i was naturally a selfish man i studied to arrange my time and save my money to give her as much pleasure as i could what she loved best in the world just then was riding i bought a horse for her and in the evenings of the spring and summer we rode together but when it was too dark to go out late she would ride alone great distances sometimes spend the whole day in the saddle and come back so tired she could hardly walk upstairsi cant say that i liked that it made me nervous she was so headlongbut i didnt think it right to interfere with her i had a good deal of anxiety about money for though i worked hard and made more than ever there never seemed enough i was anxious to savei hoped of coursebut we had no child and this was a trouble to me she grew more beautiful than ever and i think was happy has it ever struck you that each one of us lives on the edge of a volcano there is i imagine no one who has not some affection or interest so strong that he counts the rest for nothing beside it no doubt a man may live his life through without discovering that but some of us i am not complaining what isis he pulled the cap lower over his eyes and clutched his hands firmly on the top of his stick he was like a man who rushes his horse at some hopeless fence unwilling to give himself time for fear of craning at the last moment in the spring of 78 a new pupil came to me a young man of twentyone who was destined for the army i took a fancy to him and did my best to turn him into a good swordsman but there was a kind of perverse recklessness in him for a few minutes one would make a great impression then he would grow utterly careless francis i would say if i were you i should be ashamed mr brune he would answer why should i be ashamed i didnt make myself god knows i wish to do him justice he had a heartone day he drove up in a cab and brought in his poor dog who had been run over and was dying for half an hour he shut himself up with its body we could hear him sobbing like a child he came out with his eyes all red and cried i know where to find the brute who drove over him and off he rushed he had beautiful italian eyes a slight figure not very tall dark hair a little dark moustache and his lips were always a trifle partedit was that and his walk and the way he drooped his eyelids which gave him a peculiar soft proud look i used to tell him that hed never make a soldier oh hed answer thatll be all right when the time comes he believed in a kind of luck that was to do everything for him when the time came one day he came in as i was giving eilie her lesson this was the first time they saw each other after that he came more often and sometimes stayed to dinner with us i wont deny sir that i was glad to welcome him i thought it good for eilie can there be anything more odious he burst out than such a selfcomplacent blindness there are people who say poor man he had such faith faith sir conceit i was a foolin this world one pays for folly  the summer came and one saturday in early june eilie i and francisi wont tell you his other namewent riding the night had been wet there was no dust and presently the sun came outa glorious day we rode a long way about seven oclock we started backslowly for it was still hot and there was all the cool of night before us it was nine oclock when we came to richmond park a grand place richmond park and in that halflight wonderful the deer moving so softly you might have thought they were spirits we were silent toogreat trees have that effect on me  who can say when changes come like a shift of the wind the old passes the new is on you i am telling you now of a change like that without a sign of warning eilie put her horse into a gallop what are you doing i shouted she looked back with a smile then he dashed past me too a hornet might have stung them both they galloped over fallen trees under low hanging branches up hill and down i had to watch that madness my horse was not so fast i rode like a demon but fell far behind i am not a man who takes things quietly when i came up with them at last i could not speak for rage they were riding side by side the reins on the horses necks looking in each others faces you should take care i said care she cried life is not all taking care my anger left me i dropped behind as grooms ride behind their mistresses jealousy no torture is so ceaseless or so black in those minutes a hundred things came up in mea hundred memories true untrue what do i know my soul was poisoned i tried to reason with myself it was absurd to think such things it was unmanly even if it were true one should try to be a gentleman but i found myself laughing yes sir laughing at that word he spoke faster as if pouring his heart out not to a live listener but to the night i could not sleep that night to lie near her with those thoughts in my brain was impossible i made an excuse and sat up with some papers the hardest thing in life is to see a thing coming and be able to do nothing to prevent it what could i do have you noticed how people may become utter strangers without a word it only needs a thought the very next day she said i want to go to lucys alone yes i had made up my mind by then that she must do just as she wished perhaps i acted wrongly i do not know what one ought to do in such a case but before she went i said to her eilie what is it i dont know she answered and i kissed herthat was all a month passed i wrote to her nearly every day and i had short letters from her telling me very little of herself dalton was a torture to me for i could not tell him he had a conviction that she was going to become a mother ah brune he said my poor wife was just like that life sir is a somewhat ironical affair hei find it hard to speak his namecame to the school two or three times a week i used to think i saw a change a purpose growing up through his recklessness there seemed a violence in him as if he chafed against my blade i had a kind of joy in feeling i had the mastery and could toss the iron out of his hand any minute like a straw i was ashamed and yet i gloried in it jealousy is a low thing sira low base thing when he asked me where my wife was i told him i was too proud to hide it soon after that he came no more to the school  one morning when i could bear it no longer i wrote and said i was coming down i would not force myself on her but i asked her to meet me in the orchard of the old house we called the convent i asked her to be there at four oclock it has always been my belief that a man must neither beg anything of a woman nor force anything from her women are generousthey will give you what they can i sealed my letter and posted it myself all the way down i kept on saying to myself she must comesurely she will come     vii  i was in high spirits but the next moment trembled like a man with ague i reached the orchard before my time she was not there you know what it is like to wait i stood still and listened i went to the point whence i could see farthest i said to myself a watched pot never boils if i dont look for her she will come i walked up and down with my eyes on the ground the sickness of it a hundred times i took out my watch perhaps it was fast perhaps hers was slowi cant tell you a thousandth part of my hopes and fears there was a spring of water in one corner i sat beside it and thought of the last time i had been thereand something seemed to burst in me it was five oclock before i lost all hope there comes a time when youre glad that hope is dead it means rest thats over you say now i can act but what was i to do i lay down with my face to the ground when ones in trouble its the only thing that helpssomething to press against and cling to that cant give way i lay there for two hours knowing all the time that i should play the coward at seven oclock i left the orchard and went towards the inn i had broken my word but i felt happy i should see herand sir nothingnothing seemed to matter beside that tor was in the garden snipping at his roses he came up and i could see that he couldnt look me in the face wheres my wife i said he answered lets get lucy i ran indoors lucy met me with two letters the firstmy ownunopened and the second this   i have left you you were good to me but nowit is no use  eilie   she told me that a boy had brought a letter for my wife the day before from a young gentleman in a boat when lucy delivered it she asked who is he miss eilie what will mr brune say my wife looked at her angrily but gave her no answerand all that day she never spoke in the evening she was gone leaving this note on the bed lucy cried as if her heart would break i took her by the shoulders and put her from the room i couldnt bear the noise i sat down and tried to think while i was sitting there tor came in with a letter it was written on the notepaper of an inn twelve miles up the river these were the words  eilie is mine i am ready to meet you where you like  he went on with a painful evenness of speech when i read those words i had only one thoughtto reach them i ran down to the river and chose out the lightest boat just as i was starting tor came running you dropped this letter sir he said two pair of arms are better than one he came into the boat i took the sculls and i pulled out into the stream i pulled like a madman and that great man with his bare arms crossed was like a huge tawny bull sitting there opposite me presently he took my place and i took the rudder lines i could see his chest covered with hair heaving up and down it gave me a sort of comfortit meant that we were getting nearer then it grew dark there was no moon i could barely see the bank theres something in the dark which drives one into oneself people tell you there comes a moment when your nature is decidedsaved or lost as they call itfor good or evil that is not true your self is always with you and cannot be altered but sir i believe that in a time of agony one finds out what are the things one can do and what are those one cannot you get to know yourself thats all and so it was with me every thought and memory and passion was so clear and strong i wanted to kill him i wanted to kill myself but herno we are taught that we possess our wives body and soul we are brought up in that faith we are commanded to believe itbut when i was face to face with it those words had no meaning that belief those commands they were without meaning to me they werevile oh yes i wanted to find comfort in them i wanted to hold on to thembut i couldnt you may force a body how can you force a soul no nocowardly but i wanted toi wanted to kill him and force her to come back to me and then suddenly i felt as if i were pressing right on the most secret nerve of my heart i seemed to see her face white and quivering as if id stamped my heel on it they say this world is ruled by force it may be truei know i have a weak spot in me i couldnt bear it at last i jumped to my feet and shouted out turn the boat round tor looked up at me as if i had gone mad and i had gone mad i seized the boathook and threatened him i called him fearful names sir he said i dont take such names from any one youll take them from me i shouted turn the boat round you idiot you hound you fish i have a terrible temper a perfect curse to me he seemed amazed even frightened he sat down again suddenly and pulled the boat round i fell on the seat and hid my face i believe the moon came up there must have been a mist too for i was cold as death in this life sir we cannot hide our facesbut by degrees the pain of wounds grows less some will have it that such blows are mortal it is not so time is merciful  in the early morning i went back to london i had fever on meand was delirious i dare say i should have killed myself if i had not been so used to weaponsthey and i were too old friends i supposei cant explain it was a long while before i was up and about dalton nursed me through it his great heavy moustache had grown quite white we never mentioned her what was the good there were things to settle of course the lawyerthis was unspeakably distasteful to me i told him it was to be as she wished but the fellow would come to me with histhere i dont want to be unkind i wished him to say it was my fault but he saidi remember his smile nowhe said that was impossible would be seen through talked of collusioni dont understand these things and whats more i cant bear them they aredirty  two years later when i had come back to london after the russoturkish war i received a letter from her i have it here he took an old yellow sheet of paper out of a leathern pockethook spread it in his fingers and sat staring at it for some minutes he did not speak  in the autumn of that same year she died in childbirth he had deserted her fortunately for him he was killed on the indian frontier that very year if she had lived she would have been thirtytwo next june not a great age i know i am what they call a crank doctors will tell you that you cant be cured of a bad illness and be the same man again if you are bent to force yourself straight must leave you weak in another place i must and will think well of womeneverything done and everything said against them is a stone on her dead body could you sit and listen to it as though driven by his own question he rose and paced up and down he came back to the seat at last  that sir is the reason of my behaviour this afternoon and again this evening you have been so kind i wantedwanted to tell you she had a little daughterlucy has her now my friend dalton is dead there would have been no difficulty about money but i am sorry to say that he was swindleddisgracefully it fell to me to administer his affairshe never knew it but he died penniless he had trusted some wretched fellowshad an idea they would make his fortune as i very soon found they had ruined him it was impossible to let lucysuch a dear womanbear that burden i have tried to make provision but you see he took hold of my sleeve i too have not been fortunate in fact its difficult to save a great deal out of l 190 a year but the capital is perfectly safeand i get l 47 10s a quarter paid on the nail i have often been tempted to reinvest at a greater rate of interest but ive never dared anyway there are no debtsive been obliged to make a rule not to buy what i couldnt pay for on the spot now i am really plaguing youbut i wanted to tell youin caseanything should happen to me he seemed to take a sudden scare stiffened twisted his moustache and muttering your great kindness shall never forget turned hurriedly away  he vanished his footsteps and the tap of his stick grew fainter and fainter they died out he was gone suddenly i got up and hastened after him i soon stoppedwhat was there to say     viii  the following day i was obliged to go to nice and did not return till midnight the porter told me that jules le ferrier had been to see me the next morning while i was still in bed the door was opened and jules appeared his face was very pale and the moment he stood still drops of perspiration began coursing down his cheeks  georges he said he is dead there there how stupid you look my man is packing i have half an hour before the train my evidence shall come from italy i have done my part the rest is for you why did you have that dinner the don quixote the idiot the poor man dont move have you a cigar listen when you followed him i followed the other two my infernal curiosity can you conceive a greater folly how fast they walked those two feeling their cheeks as if he had struck them both you know it was funny they soon saw me for their eyes were all round about their heads they had the mark of a glove on their cheeks the colour began to come back into juless face he gesticulated with his cigar and became more and more dramatic they waited for me tiens said one this gentleman was with him my friends name is m le baron de the man who struck him was an oddlooking person kindly inform me whether it is possible for my friend to meet him eh commented jules he was offensive was it for me to give our dignity away perfectly monsieur i answered in that case he said please give me his name and ad dress i could not remember his name and as for the address i never knew it i reflected that i said i am unable to do for special reasons aha he said reasons that will prevent our fighting him i suppose on the contrary i said i will convey your request to him i may mention that i have heard he is the best swordsman and pistolshot in europe goodnight i wished to give them something to dream of you understand patience my dear patience i was coming to you but i thought i would let them sleep on itthere was plenty of time but yesterday morning i came into the place and there he was on the bench with a big dog i declare to you he blushed like a young girl sir he said i was hoping to meet you last evening i made a great disturbance i took an unpardonable libertyand he put in my hand an envelope my friend what do you suppose it containeda pair of gloves senor don punctilioso hein he was the devil this friend of yours he fascinated me with his gentle eyes and his white moustachettes his humility his flamespoor man i told him i had been asked to take him a challenge if anything comes of it i said make use of me is that so he said i am most grateful for your kind offer let me seeit is so long since i fought a duel the sooner its over the better could you arrange tomorrow morning weapons yes let them choose you see my friend there was no hanging back here nous voila en train  jules took out his watch i have sixteen minutes it is lucky for you that you were away yesterday or you would be in my shoes now i fixed the place right hand of the road to roquebrune just by the railway cutting and the timefivethirty of the morning it was arranged that i should call for him disgusting hour i have not been up so early since i fought jacques tirbaut in 85 at five oclock i found him ready and drinking tea with rum in itsingular man he made me have some too brrr he was shaved and dressed in that old frockcoat his great dog jumped into the carriage but he bade her get out took her paws on his shoulders and whispered in her ear some italian words a charm hein and back she went the tail between the legs we drove slowly so as not to shake his arm he was more gay than i all the way he talked to me of you how kind you were how good you had been to him you do not speak of yourself i said have you no friends nothing to say sometimes an accident will happen oh he answered there is no danger but if by any chancewell there is a letter in my pocket and if you should kill him i said but i shall not he answered slyly do you think i am going to fire at him no no he is too young but i said ii am not going to stand that yes he replied i owe him a shot but there is no dangernot the least danger we had arrived already they were there ah bah you know the preliminaries the politenessthis duelling you know it is absurd after all we placed them at twenty paces it is not a bad place there are pinetrees round and rocks at that hour it was cool and grey as a church i handed him the pistol how can i describe him to you standing there smoothing the barrel with his fingers what a beautiful thing a good pistol he said only a fool or a madman throws away his life i said certainly he replied certainly but there is no danger and he regarded me raising his moustachette  there they stood then back to back with the mouths of their pistols to the sky un i cried deux tirez they turned i saw the smoke of his shot go straight up like a prayer his pistol dropped i ran to him he looked surprised put out his hand and fell into my arms he was dead those fools came running up what is it cried one i made him a bow as you see i said you have made a pretty shot my friend fired in the air messieurs you had better breakfast in italy we carried him to the carriage and covered him with a rug the others drove for the frontier i brought him to his room here is his letter jules stopped tears were running down his face he is dead i have closed his eyes look here you know we are all of us cadsit is the rule but thisthis perhaps was the exception and without another word he rushed away  outside the old fellows lodging a dismounted cocher was standing disconsolate in the sun how was i to know they were going to fight a duel he burst out on seeing me he had white hairi call you to witness he had white hair this is bad for me they will ravish my licence aha you will seethis is bad for me i gave him the slip and found my way upstairs the old fellow was alone lying on the bed his feet covered with a rug as if he might feel cold his eyes were closed but in this sleep of death he still had that air of faint surprise at full length watching the bed intently freda lay as she lay nightly when he was really asleep the shutters were half open the room still smelt slightly of rum i stood for a long time looking at the face the little white fans of moustache brushed upwards even in death the hollows in his cheeks the quiet of his figure he was like some old knight the dog broke the spell she sat up and resting her paws on the bed licked his face i went downstairsi couldnt bear to hear her howl this was his letter to me written in a pointed handwriting   my dear sirshould you read this i shall be gone i am ashamed to trouble youa man should surely manage so as not to give trouble and yet i believe you will not consider me importunate if then you will pick up the pieces of an old fellow i ask you to have my sword the letter enclosed in this and the photograph that stands on the stove buried with me my will and the acknowledgments of my property are between the leaves of the byron in my tin chest they should go to lucy toraddress thereon perhaps you will do me the honour to retain for yourself any of my books that may give you pleasure in the pilgrims progress you will find some excellent recipes for turkish coffee italian and spanish dishes and washing wounds the landladys daughter speaks italian and she would i know like to have freda the poor dog will miss me i have read of old indian warriors taking their horses and dogs with them to the happy huntinggrounds freda would comenoble animals are dogs she eats once a daya good large mealand requires much salt if you have animals of your own sir dont forgetall animals require salt i have no debts thank god the money in my pockets would bury me decentlynot that there is any danger and i am ashamed to weary you with detailsthe least a man can do is not to make a fussand yet he must be found readysir with profound gratitude your servant  roger brune   everything was as he had said the photograph on the stove was that of a young girl of nineteen or twenty dressed in an oldfashioned style with hair gathered backward in a knot the eyes gazed at you with a little frown the lips were tightly closed the expression of the face was eager quick wilful and above all young  the tin trunk was scented with dry fragments of some herb the history of which in that trunk man knoweth not there were a few clothes but very few all older than those he usually wore besides the byron and pilgrims progress were scotts quentin durward captain marryats midshipman easy a pocket testament and a long and frightfully stiff book on the art of fortifying towns much thumbed and bearing date 1863 by far the most interesting thing i found however was a diary kept down to the preceding christmas it was a pathetic document full of calculations of the price of meals resolutions to be careful over this or that doubts whether he must not give up smoking sentences of fear that freda had not enough to eat it appeared that he had tried to live on ninety pounds a year and send the other hundred pounds home to lucy for the child in this struggle he was always failing having to send less than the amountthe entries showed that this was a nightmare to him the last words written on christmas day were these what is the use of writing this since it records nothing but failure  the landladys daughter and myself were at the funeral the same afternoon i went into the concertroom where i had spoken to him first when i came out freda was lying at the entrance looking into the faces of every one that passed and sniffing idly at their heels close by the landladys daughter hovered a biscuit in her hand and a puzzled sorry look on her face  september 1900     to  my brother hubert galsworthy     salvation of a forsyte     i  swithin forsyte lay in bed the corners of his mouth under his white moustache drooped towards his double chin he panted  my doctor says im in a bad way james  his twinbrother placed his hand behind his ear i cant hear you they tell me i ought to take a cure theres always a cure wanted for something emily had a cure  swithin replied you mumble so i hear my man adolph i trained him you ought to have an eartrumpet youre

hundred you ought to take care of yourself i shall speak to blank about you you ought to have himeverybody says hes the first man goodbye  swithin forsyte continued to stare at the ceiling he thought a poor thing james a selfish beggar must be worth a couple of hundred thousand he wheezed meditating on life  he was ill and lonely for many years he had been lonely and for two years ill but as he had smoked his first cigar so he would live his lifestoutly to its predestined end every day he was driven to the club sitting forward on the spring cushions of a single brougham his hands on his knees swaying a little strangely solemn he ascended the steps into that marble hallthe folds of his chin wedged into the aperture of his collarwalking squarely with a stick later he would dine eating majestically and savouring his food behind a bottle of champagne set in an icepailhis waistcoat defended by a napkin his eyes rolling a little or glued in a stare on the waiter never did he suffer his head or back to droop for it was not distinguished so to do  because he was old and deaf he spoke to no one and no one spoke to him the club gossip an irishman said to each newcomer old forsyte look at um must ha had something in his life to sour um but swithin had had nothing in his life to sour him  for many days now he had lain in bed in a room exuding silver crimson and electric light smelling of opopanax and of cigars the curtains were drawn the firelight gleamed on a table by his bed were a jug of barleywater and the times he made an attempt to read failed and fell again to thinking his face with its square chin looked like a block of pale leather bedded in the pillow it was lonely a woman in the room would have made all the difference why had he never married he breathed hard staring froglike at the ceiling a memory had come into his mind it was a long time agoforty odd yearsbut it seemed like yesterday  it happened when he was thirtyeight for the first and only time in his life travelling on the continent with his twinbrother james and a man named traquair on the way from germany to venice he had found himself at the hotel goldene alp at salzburg it was late august and weather for the gods sunshine on the walls and the shadows of the vineleaves and at night the moonlight and again on the walls the shadows of the vineleaves averse to the suggestions of other people swithin had refused to visit the citadel he had spent the day alone in the window of his bedroom smoking a succession of cigars and disparaging the appearance of the passersby after dinner he was driven by boredom into the streets his chest puffed out like a pigeons and with something of a pigeons cold and inquiring eye he strutted annoyed at the frequency of uniforms which seemed to him both needless and offensive his spleen rose at this crowd of foreigners who spoke an unintelligible language wore hair on their faces and smoked bad tobacco a queer lot he thought the sound of music from a cafe attracted him he walked in vaguely moved by a wish for the distinction of adventure without the trouble which adventure usually brought with it spurred too perhaps by an afterdinner demon the cafe was the bierhalle of the fifties with a door at either end and lighted by a large wooden lantern on a small dais three musicians were fiddling solitary men or groups sat at some dozen tables and the waiters hurried about replenishing glasses the air was thick with smoke swithin sat down wine he said sternly the astonished waiter brought him wine swithin pointed to a beer glass on the table here he said with the same ferocity the waiter poured out the wine ah thought swithin they can understand if they like a group of officers close by were laughing swithin stared at them uneasily a hollow cough sounded almost in his ear to his left a man sat reading with his elbows on the corners of a journal and his gaunt shoulders raised almost to his eyes he had a thin long nose broadening suddenly at the nostrils a blackbrown beard spread in a savage fan over his chest what was visible of the face was the colour of old parchment a strange wild haughtylooking creature swithin observed his clothes with some displeasurethey were the clothes of a journalist or strolling actor and yet he was impressed this was singular how could he be impressed by a fellow in such clothes the man reached out a hand covered with black hairs and took up a tumbler that contained a darkcoloured fluid brandy thought swithin the crash of a falling chair startled himhis neighbour had risen he was of immense height and very thin his great beard seemed to splash away from his mouth he was glaring at the group of officers and speaking swithin made out two words hunde deutsche hunde hounds dutch hounds he thought rather strong one of the officers had jumped up and now drew his sword the tall man swung his chair up and brought it down with a thud everybody round started up and closed on him the tall man cried out to me magyars  swithin grinned the tall man fighting such odds excited his unwilling admiration he had a momentary impulse to go to his assistance only get a broken nose he thought and looked for a safe corner but at that moment a thrown lemon struck him on the jaw he jumped out of his chair and rushed at the officers the hungarian swinging his chair threw him a look of gratitudeswithin glowed with momentary admiration of himself a sword blade grazed hisarm he felt a sudden dislike of the hungarian this is too much he thought and catching up a chair flung it at the wooden lantern there was a crashfaces and swords vanished he struck a match and by the light of it bolted for the door a second later he was in the street     ii  a voice said in english god bless you brother  swithin looked round and saw the tall hungarian holding out his hand he took it thinking what a fool ive been there was something in the hungarians gesture which said you are worthy of me  it was annoying but rather impressive the man seemed even taller than before there was a cut on his cheek the blood from which was trickling down his beard you english he said i saw you stone haynaui saw you cheer kossuth the free blood of your people cries out to us he looked at swithin you are a big man you have a big souland strong how you flung them down ha swithin had an impulse to take to his heels my name said the hungarian is boleskey you are my friend his english was good  bulshkaiee burlshkaiee thought swithin what a devil of a name mine he said sulkily is forsyte  the hungarian repeated it  youve had a nasty jab on the cheek said swithin the sight of the matted beard was making him feel sick the hungarian put his fingers to his cheek brought them away wet stared at them then with an indifferent air gathered a wisp of his beard and crammed it against the cut  ugh said swithin here take my handkerchief  the hungarian bowed thank you he said i couldnt think of it thank you a thousand times  take it growled swithin it seemed to him suddenly of the first importance he thrust the handkerchief into the hungarians hand and felt a pain in his arm there he thought ive strained a muscle  the hungarian kept muttering regardless of passersby swine how you threw them over two or three cracked heads anywaythe cowardly swine  look here said swithin suddenly which is my way to the goldene alp  the hungarian replied but you are coming with me for a glass of wine  swithin looked at the ground not if i know it he thought  ah said the hungarian with dignity you do not wish for my friendship  touchy beggar thought swithin of course he stammered if you put it in that way  the hungarian bowed murmuring forgive me  they had not gone a dozen steps before a youth with a beardless face and hollow cheeks accosted them for the love of christ gentlemen he said help me  are you a german asked boleskey  yes said the youth  then you may rot  master look here tearing open his coat the youth displayed his skin and a leather belt drawn tight round it again swithin felt that desire to take to his heels he was filled with horrid forebodingsa sense of perpending intimacy with things such as no gentleman had dealings with  the hungarian crossed himself brother he said to the youth come you in  swithin looked at them askance and followed by a dim light they groped their way up some stairs into a large room into which the moon was shining through a window bulging over the street a lamp burned low there was a smell of spirits and tobacco with a faint peculiar scent as of rose leaves in one corner stood a czymbal in another a great pile of newspapers on the wall hung some oldfashioned pistols and a rosary of yellow beads everything was tidily arranged but dusty near an open fireplace was a table with the remains of a meal the ceiling floor and walls were all of dark wood in spite of the strange disharmony the room had a sort of refinement the hungarian took a bottle out of a cupboard and filling some glasses handed one to swithin swithin put it gingerly to his nose you never know your luck come he thought tilting it slowly into his mouth it was thick too sweet but of a fine flavour  brothers said the hungarian refilling your healths  the youth tossed off his wine and swithin this time did the same he pitied this poor devil of a youth now come round tomorrow he said ill give you a shirt or two when the youth was gone however he remembered with relief that he had not given his address  better so he reflected a humbug no doubt  what was that you said to him he asked of the hungarian  i said answered boleskey you have eaten and drunk and now you are my enemy  quite right said swithin quite right a beggar is every mans enemy  you do not understand the hungarian replied politely while he was a beggari too have had to beg swithin thought good god this is awful but now that he is no longer hungry what is he but a german no austrian dog soils my floors  his nostrils as it seemed to swithin had distended in an unpleasant fashion and a wholly unnecessary raucousness invaded his voice i am an exileall of my blood are exiles those godless dogs swithin hurriedly assented  as he spoke a face peeped in at the door  rozsi said the hungarian a young girl came in she was rather short with a deliciously round figure and a thick plait of hair she smiled and showed her even teeth her little bright wideset grey eyes glanced from one man to the other her face was round too high in the cheekbones the colour of wild roses with brows that had a twistup at the corners with a gesture of alarm she put her hand to her cheek and called margit an older girl appeared taller with fine shoulders large eyes a pretty mouth and what swithin described to himself afterwards as a pudding nose both girls with little cooing sounds began attending to their fathers face  swithin turned his back to them his arm pained him  this is what comes of interfering he thought sulkily i might have had my neck broken suddenly a soft palm was placed in his two eyes halffascinated halfshy looked at him then a voice called rozsi the door was slammed he was alone again with the hungarian harassed by a sense of soft disturbance  your daughters name is rosy he said we have it in englandfrom rose a flower  rozsi rozgi the hungarian replied your english is a hard tongue harder than french german or czechish harder than russian or roumaniani know no more  what said swithin six languages privately he thought he knows how to lie anyway  if you lived in a country like mine muttered the hungarian with all mens hands against you a free peopledyingbut not dead  swithin could not imagine what he was talking of this mans face with its linen bandage gloomy eyes and great black wisps of beard his fierce mutterings and hollow cough were all most unpleasant he seemed to be suffering from some kind of mental dogbite his emotion indeed appeared so indecent so uncontrolled and open that its obvious sincerity produced a sort of awe in swithin it was like being forced to look into a furnace boleskey stopped roaming up and down you think its over he said i tell you in the breast of each one of us magyars there is a hell what is sweeter than life what is more sacred than each breath we draw ah my country these words were uttered so slowly with such intense mournfulness that swithins jaw relaxed he converted the movement to a yawn  tell me said boleskey what would you do if the french conquered you  swithin smiled then suddenly as though something had hurt him he grunted the froggies let em try  drink said boleskeythere is nothing like it he filled swithins glass i will tell you my story  swithin rose hurriedly its late he said this is good stuff though have you much of it  it is the last bottle  what said swithin and you gave it to a beggar  my name is boleskeystefan the hungarian said raising his head of the komorn boleskeys the simplicity of this phraseas who shall say what need of further descriptionmade an impression on swithin he stopped to listen boleskeys story went on and on there were many abuses boomed his deep voice much wrong donemuch cowardice i could see clouds gatheringrolling over our plains the austrian wished to strangle the breath of our mouthsto take from us the shadow of our libertythe shadowall we had two years agothe year of 48 when every man and boy answered the great voicebrother a dogs lifeto use a pen when all of your blood are fighting but it was decreed for me my son was killed my brothers takenand myself was thrown out like a dogi had written out my heart i had written out all the blood that was in my body he seemed to tower a gaunt shadow of a man with gloomy flickering eyes staring at the wall  swithin rose and stammered much obligedvery interesting boleskey made no effort to detain him but continued staring at the wall goodnight said swithin and stamped heavily downstairs     iii  when at last swithin reached the goldene alp he found his brother and friend standing uneasily at the door traquair a prematurely driedup man with whiskers and a scotch accent remarked yere airly man swithin growled something unintelligible and swung up to bed he discovered a slight cut on his arm he was in a savage temperthe elements had conspired to show him things he did not want to see yet now and then a memory of rozsi of her soft palm in his a sense of having been stroked and flattered came over him during breakfast next morning his brother and traquair announced their intention of moving on james forsyte indeed remarked that it was no place for a collector since all the old shops were in the hands of jews or very grasping personshe had discovered this at once swithin pushed his cup aside you may do what you like he said im staying here  james forsyte replied tumbling over his own words why what do you want to stay here for theres nothing for you to do heretheres nothing to see here unless you go up the citadel an you wont do that  swithin growled who says so having gratified his perversity he felt in a better temper he had slung his arm in a silk sash and accounted for it by saying he had slipped later he went out and walked on to the bridge in the brilliant sunshine spires were glistening against the pearly background of the hills the town had a clean joyous air swithin glanced at the citadel and thought looks a strong place shouldnt wonder if it were impregnable and this for some occult reason gave him pleasure it occurred to him suddenly to go and look for the hungarians house  about noon after a hunt of two hours he was gazing about him blankly pale with heat but more obstinate than ever when a voice above him called mister he looked up and saw rozsi she was leaning her round chin on her round hand gazing down at him with her deepset clever eyes when swithin removed his hat she clapped her hands again he had the sense of being admired caressed with a careless air that sat grotesquely on his tall square person he walked up to the door both girls stood in the passage swithin felt a confused desire to speak in some foreign tongue maamselles he began erbong jourer your fatherpare comment  we also speak english said the elder girl will you come in please  swithin swallowed a misgiving and entered the room had a worn appearance by daylight as if it had always been the nest of tragic or vivid lives he sat down and his eyes said i am a stranger but dont try to get the better of me pleasethat is impossible the girls looked at him in silence rozsi wore a rather short skirt of black stuff a white shirt and across her shoulders an embroidered yoke her sister was dressed in dark green with a coral necklace both girls had their hair in plaits after a minute rozsi touched the sleeve of his hurt arm  its nothing muttered swithin  father fought with a chair but you had no chair she said in a wondering voice  he doubled the fist of his sound arm and struck a blow at space to his amazement she began to laugh nettled at this he put his hand beneath the heavy table and lifted it rozsi clapped her hands ah i now i seehow strong you are she made him a curtsey and whisked round to the window he found the quick intelligence of her eyes confusing sometimes they seemed to look beyond him at something invisiblethis too confused him from margit he learned that they had been two years in england where their father had made his living by teaching languages they had now been a year in salzburg  we wait suddenly said rozsi and margit with a solemn face repeated we wait  swithins eyes swelled a little with his desire to see what they were waiting for how queer they were with their eyes that gazed beyond him he looked at their figures she would pay for dressing he thought and he tried to imagine rozsi in a skirt with proper flounces a thin waist and hair drawn back over her ears she would pay for dressing with that supple figure fluffy hair and little hands and instantly his own hands face and clothes disturbed him he got up examined the pistols on the wall and felt resentment at the faded dusty room smells like a pothouse he thought he sat down again close to rozsi  do you love to dance she asked to dance is to live first you hear the musichow your feet itch it is wonderful you begin slow quickquicker you flyyou know nothingyour feet are in the air it is wonderful  a slow flush had mounted into swithins face  ah continued rozsi her eyes fixed on him when i am dancingout there i see the plainsyour feet go onetwothreequick quick quick quickeryou fly  she stretched herself a shiver seemed to pass all down her margit dance and to swithins consternation the two girlstheir hands on each others shouldersbegan shuffling their feet and swaying to and fro their heads were thrown back their eyes halfclosed suddenly the step quickened they swung to one side then to the other and began whirling round in front of him the sudden fragrance of rose leaves enveloped him round they flew again while they were still dancing boleskey came into the room he caught swithin by both hands  brother welcome ah your arm is hurt i do not forget his yellow face and deepset eyes expressed a dignified gratitude let me introduce to you my friend baron kasteliz  swithin bowed to a man with a small forehead who had appeared softly and stood with his gloved hands touching his waist swithin conceived a sudden aversion for this catlike man about boleskey there was that which made contempt impossiblethe sense of comradeship begotten in the fight the mans height something lofty and savage in his face and an obscure instinct that it would not pay to show distaste but this kasteliz with his neat jaw low brow and velvety volcanic look excited his proper english animosity your friends are mine murmured kasteliz he spoke with suavity and hissed his ss a long vibrating twang quavered through the room swithin turned and saw rozsi sitting at the czymbal the notes rang under the little hammers in her hands incessant metallic rising and falling with that strange melody kasteliz had fixed his glowing eyes on her boleskey nodding his head was staring at the floor margit with a pale face stood like a statue  what can they see in it thought swithin its not a tune he took up his hat rozsi saw him and stopped her lips had parted with a faintly dismayed expression his sense of personal injury diminished he even felt a little sorry for her she jumped up from her seat and twirled round with a pout an inspiration seized on swithin come and dine with me he said to boleskey tomorrowthe goldene alpbring your friend he felt the eyes of the whole room on himthe hungarians fine eyes margits wide glance the narrow hot gaze of kasteliz and lastlyrozsis a glow of satisfaction ran down his spine when he emerged into the street he thought gloomily now ive done it and not for some paces did he look round then with a forced smile turned and removed his hat to the faces at the window  notwithstanding this moment of gloom however he was in an exalted state all day and at dinner kept looking at his brother and traquair enigmatically what do they know of life he thought they might be here a year and get no farther he made jokes and pinned the menu to the waiters coattails i like this place he said i shall spend three weeks here james whose lips were on the point of taking in a plum looked at him uneasily     iv  on the day of the dinner swithin suffered a good deal he reflected gloomily on boleskeys clothes he had fixed an early hourthere would be fewer people to see them when the time approached he attired himself with a certain neat splendour and though his arm was still sore left off the sling  nearly three hours afterwards he left the goldene alp between his guests it was sunset and along the riverbank the houses stood out unsoftened by the dusk the streets were full of people hurrying home swithin had a hazy vision of empty bottles of the ground before his feet and the accessibility of all the world dim recollections of the good things he had said of his brother and traquair seated in the background eating ordinary meals with inquiring acid visages caused perpetual smiles to break out on his face and he steered himself stubbornly to prove that he was a better man than either of his guests he knew vaguely that he was going somewhere with an object rozsis face kept dancing before him like a promise once or twice he gave kasteliz a glassy stare towards boleskey on the other hand he felt quite warm and recalled with admiration the way he had set his glass down empty time after time i like to see him take his liquor he thought the fellows a gentleman after all boleskey strode on savagely inattentive to everything and kasteliz had become more like a cat than ever it was nearly dark when they reached a narrow street close to the cathedral they stopped at a door held open by an old woman the change from the fresh air to a heated corridor the noise of the door closed behind him the old womans anxious glances sobered swithin  i tell her said boleskey that i reply for you as for my son  swithin was angry what business had this man to reply for him  they passed into a large room crowded with men all women swithin noticed that they all looked fit him he stared at them in turnthey seemed of all classes some in black coats or silk dresses others in the clothes of workpeople one man a cobbler still wore his leather apron as if he had rushed there straight from his work laying his hand on swithins arm boleskey evidently began explaining who he was hands were extended people beyond reach bowed to him swithin acknowledged the greetings with a stiff motion of his head then seeing other people dropping into seats he too sat down some one whispered his namemargit and rozsi were just behind him  welcome said margit but swithin was looking at rozsi her face was so alive and quivering whats the excitement all about he thought how pretty she looks she blushed drew in her hands with a quick tense movement and gazed again beyond him into the room what is it thought swithin he had a longing to lean back and kiss her lips he tried angrily to see what she was seeing in those faces turned all one way  boleskey rose to speak no one moved not a sound could be heard but the tone of his deep voice on and on he went fierce and solemn and with the rise of his voice all those facesfair or swarthyseemed to be glowing with one and the same feeling swithin felt the white heat in those facesit was not decent in that whole speech he only understood the one wordmagyar which came again and again he almost dozed off at last the twang of a czymbal woke him what he thought more of that infernal music margit leaning over him whispered listen racoczy it is forbidden swithin saw that rozsi was no longer in her seat it was she who was striking those forbidden notes he looked roundeverywhere the same unmoving faces the same entrancement and fierce stillness the music sounded muffled as if it too were bursting its heart in silence swithin felt within him a touch of panic was this a den of tigers the way these people listened the ferocity of their stillness was frightful he gripped his chair and broke into a perspiration was there no chance to get away when it stops he thought therell be a rush but there was only a greater silence it flashed across him that any hostile person coming in then would be torn to pieces a woman sobbed the whole thing was beyond words unpleasant he rose and edged his way furtively towards the doorway there was a cry of police the whole crowd came pressing after him swithin would soon have been out but a little behind he caught sight of rozsi swept off her feet her frightened eyes angered him she doesnt deserve it he thought sulkily letting all this loose and forced his way back to her she clung to him and a fever went stealing through his veins he butted forward at the crowd holding her tight when they were outside he let her go  i was afraid she said  afraid muttered swithin i should think so no longer touching her he felt his grievance revive  but you are so strong she murmured  this is no place for you growled swithin im going to see you home  oh cried rozsi but papa andmargit  thats their lookout and he hurried her away  she slid her hand under his arm the soft curves of her form brushed him gently each touch only augmented his illhumour he burned with a perverse rage as if all the passions in him were simmering and ready to boil over it was as if a poison were trying to work its way out of him through the layers of his stolid flesh he maintained a dogged silence rozsi too said nothing but when they reached the door she drew her hand away  you are angry she said  angry muttered swithin no how dyou make that out he had a torturing desire to kiss her  yes you are angry she repeated i wait here for papa and margit  swithin also waited wedged against the wall once or twice for his sight was sharp he saw her steal a look at him a beseeching look and hardened his heart with a kind of pleasure after five minutes boleskey margit and kasteliz appeared seeing rozsi they broke into exclamations of relief and kasteliz with a glance at swithin put his lips to her hand rozsis look said wouldnt you like to do that swithin turned short on his heel and walked away     v  all night he hardly slept suffering from fever for the first time in his life once he jumped out of bed lighted a candle and going to the glass scrutinised himself long and anxiously after this he fell asleep but had frightful dreams his first thought when he woke was my livers out of order and thrusting his head into cold water he dressed hastily and went out he soon left the house behind dew covered everything blackbirds whistled in the bushes the air was fresh and sweet he had not been up so early since he was a boy why was he walking through a damp wood at this hour of the morning something intolerable and unfamiliar must have sent him out no fellow in his senses would do such a thing he came to a dead stop and began unsteadily to walk back regaining the hotel he went to bed again and dreamed that in some wild country he was living in a room full of insects where a housemaidrozsiholding a broom looked at him with mournful eyes there seemed an unexplained need for immediate departure he begged her to forward his things and shake them out carefully before she put them into the trunk he understood that the charge for sending would be twentytwo shillings thought it a great deal and had the horrors of indecision no he muttered pack and take them myself the housemaid turned suddenly into a lean creature and he awoke with a sore feeling in his heart  his eye fell on his wet boots the whole thing was scaring and jumping up he began to throw his clothes into his trunks it was twelve oclock before he went down and found his brother and traquair still at the table arranging an itinerary he surprised them by saying that he too was coming and without further explanation set to work to eat james had heard that there were saltmines in the neighbourhoodhis proposal was to start and halt an hour or so on the road for their inspection he said everybodyll ask you if youve seen the saltmines i shouldnt like to say i hadnt seen the saltmines whats the good theyd say of your going there if you havent seen the saltmines he wondered too if they need fee the second waiteran idle chap  a discussion followed but swithin ate on glumly conscious that his mind was set on larger affairs suddenly on the far side of the street rozsi and her sister passed with little baskets on their arms he started up and at that moment rozsi looked roundher face was the incarnation of enticement the chin tilted the lower lip thrust a little forward her round neck curving back over her shoulder swithin muttered make your own arrangementsleave me out and hurried from the room leaving james beside himself with interest and alarm  when he reached the street however the girls had disappeared he hailed a carriage drive he called to the man with a flourish of his stick and as soon as the wheels had begun to clatter on the stones he leaned back looking sharply to right and left he soon had to give up thought of finding them but made the coachman turn round and round again all day he drove about far into the country and kept urging the driver to use greater speed he was in a strange state of hurry and elation finally he dined at a little country inn and this gave the measure of his disturbancethe dinner was atrocious  returning late in the evening he found a note written by traquair are you in your senses man it asked we have no more time to waste idling about here if you want to rejoin us come on to daniellis hotel venice swithin chuckled when he read it and feeling frightfully tired went to bed and slept like a log     vi  three weeks later he was still in salzburg no longer at the goldene alp but in rooms over a shop near the boleskeys he had spent a small fortune in the purchase of flowers margit would croon over them but rozsi with a sober many tanks as if they were her right would look long at herself in the glass and pin one into her hair swithin ceased to wonder he ceased to wonder at anything they did one evening he found boleskey deep in conversation with a pale dishevelledlooking person  our friend mr forsytecount d said boleskey  swithin experienced a faint unavoidable emotion but looking at the counts trousers he thought doesnt look much like one and with an ironic bow to the silent girls he turned and took his hat but when he had reached the bottom of the dark stairs he heard footsteps rozsi came running down looked out at the door and put her hands up to her breast as if disappointed suddenly with a quick glance round she saw him swithin caught her arm she slipped away and her face seemed to bubble with defiance or laughter she ran up three steps stopped looked at him across her shoulder and fled on up the stairs swithin went out bewildered and annoyed  what was she going to say to me he kept thinking during these three weeks he had asked himself all sorts of questions whether he were being made a fool of whether she were in love with him what he was doing there and sometimes at night with all his candles burning as if he wanted light the breeze blowing on him through the window his cigar halfsmoked in his hand he sat an hour or more staring at the wall enough of this he thought every morning twice he packed fullyonce he ordered his travelling carriage but countermanded it the following day what definitely he hoped intended resolved he could not have said he was always thinking of rozsi he could not read the riddle in her faceshe held him in a vice notwithstanding that everything about her threatened the very fetishes of his existence and boleskey whenever he looked at him he thought if he were only clean and mechanically fingered his own welltied cravatte to talk with the fellow too was like being forced to look at things which had no place in the light of day freedom equality selfsacrifice  why cant he settle down at some business he thought instead of all this talk boleskeys sudden diffidences selfdepreciation fits of despair irritated him morbid beggar he would mutter thank god i havent a thin skin and proud too extraordinary an impecunious fellow like that one evening moreover boleskey had returned home drunk swithin had hustled him away into his bedroom helped him to undress and stayed until he was asleep too much of a good thing he thought before his own daughters too it was after this that he ordered his travelling carriage the other occasion on which he packed was one evening when not only boleskey but rozsi herself had picked chicken bones with her fingers  often in the mornings he would go to the mirabell garden to smoke his cigar there in stolid contemplation of the statuesrows of halfheroic men carrying off halfdistressful femaleshe would spend an hour pleasantly his hat tilted to keep the sun off his nose the day after rozsi had fled from him on the stairs he came there as usual it was a morning of blue sky and sunlight glowing on the old prim garden on its yewtrees and seriocomic statues and walls covered with apricots and plums when swithin approached his usual seat who should be sitting there but rozsigoodmorning he stammered you knew this was my seat then  rozsi looked at the ground yes she answered  swithin felt bewildered do you know he said you treat me very funnily  to his surprise rozsi put her little soft hand down and touched his then without a word sprang up and rushed away it took him a minute to recover there were people present he did not like to run but overtook her on the bridge and slipped her hand beneath his arm  you shouldnt have done that he said you shouldnt have run away from me you know  rozsi laughed swithin withdrew his arm a desire to shake her seized him he walked some way before he said will you have the goodness to tell me what you came to that seat for  rozsi flashed a look at him tomorrow is the fete she answered  swithin muttered is that all  if you do not take us we cannot go  suppose i refuse he said sullenly there are plenty of others  rozsi bent her head scurrying along no she murmured if you do not goi do not wish  swithin drew her hand back within his arm how round and soft it was he tried to see her face when she was nearly home he said goodbye not wishing for some dark reason to be seen with her he watched till she had disappeared then slowly retraced his steps to the mirabell garden when he came to where she had been sitting he slowly lighted his cigar and for a long time after it was smoked out remained there in the silent presence of the statues     vii  a crowd of people wandered round the booths and swithin found himself obliged to give the girls his arms like a little cockney clerk he thought his indignation passed unnoticed they talked they laughed each sight and sound in all the hurlyburly seemed to go straight into their hearts he eyed them ironicallytheir eager voices and little coos of sympathy seemed to him vulgar in the thick of the crowd he slipped his arm out of margits but just as he thought that he was free the unwelcome hand slid up again he tried again but again margit reappeared serene and full of pleasant humour and his failure this time appeared to him in a comic light but when rozsi leaned across him the glow of her round cheek her curving lip the inscrutable grey gleam of her eyes sent a thrill of longing through him he was obliged to stand by while they parleyed with a gipsy whose matted locks and skinny hands inspired him with a not unwarranted disgust folly he muttered as rozsi held out her palm the old woman mumbled and shot a malignant look at him rozsi drew back her hand and crossed herself folly swithin thought again and seizing the girls arms he hurried them away  what did the old hag say he asked  rozsi shook her head  you dont mean that you believe  her eyes were full of tears the gipsies are wise she murmured  come what did she tell you  this time rozsi looked hurriedly round and slipped away into the crowd after a hunt they found her and swithin who was scared growled you shouldnt do such thingsits not respectable  on higher ground in the centre of a clear space a military band was playing for the privilege of entering this charmed circle swithin paid three kronen choosing naturally the best seats he ordered wine too watching rozsi out of the corner of his eye as he poured it out the protecting tenderness of yesterday was all lost in this medley it was every man for himself after all the colour had deepened again in her cheeks she laughed pouting her lips suddenly she put her glass aside thank you very much she said it is enough  margit whose pretty mouth was all smiles cried lieber gott is it not goodlife it was not a question swithin could undertake to answer the band began to play a waltz now they will dance lieber gott and are the lights not wonderful lamps were flickering beneath the trees like a swarm of fireflies there was a hum as from a gigantic beehive passersby lifted their faces then vanished into the crowd rozsi stood gazing at them spellbound as if their very going and coming were a delight  the space was soon full of whirling couples rozsis head began to beat time o margit she whispered  swithins face had assumed a solemn uneasy expression a man raising his hat offered his arm to margit she glanced back across her shoulder to reassure swithin it is a friend she said  swithin looked at rozsiher eyes were bright her lips tremulous he slipped his hand along the table and touched her fingers then she flashed a look at himappeal reproach tenderness all were expressed in it was she expecting him to dance did she want to mix with the riftraff there wish him to make an exhibition of himself in this hurlyburly a voice said goodevening before them stood kasteliz in a dark coat tightly buttoned at the waist  you are not dancing rozsi kozsanony miss rozsi let me then have the pleasure he held out his arm swithin stared in front of him in the very act of going she gave him a look that said as plain as words will you not but for answer he turned his eyes away and when he looked again she was gone he paid the score and made his way into the crowd but as he went she danced by close to him all flushed and panting she hung back as if to stop him and he caught the glistening of tears then he lost sight of her again to be deserted the first minute he was alone with her and for that jackanapes with the small head and the volcanic glances it was too much and suddenly it occurred to him that she was alone with kastelizalone at night and far from home well he thought what do i care and shouldered his way on through the crowd it served him right for mixing with such people here he left the fair but the further he went the more he nursed his rage the more heinous seemed her offence the sharper grew his jealousy a beggarly baron was his thought  a figure came alongsideit was boleskey one look showed swithin his condition drunk again this was the last straw  unfortunately boleskey had recognised him he seemed violently excited wherewhere are my daughters he began  swithin brushed past but boleskey caught his arm listenbrother he said news of my country after tomorrow  keep it to yourself growled swithin wrenching his arm free he went straight to his lodgings and lying on the hard sofa of his unlighted sittingroom gave himself up to bitter thoughts but in spite of all his anger rozsis supplymoving figure with its pouting lips and roguish appealing eyes still haunted him     viii  next morning there was not a carriage to be had and swithin was compelled to put off his departure till the morrow the day was grey and misty he wandered about with the strained inquiring look of a lost dog in his eyes  late in the afternoon he went back to his lodgings in a corner of the sittingroom stood rozsi the thrill of triumph the sense of appeasement the emotion that seized on him crept through to his lips in a faint smile rozsi made no sound her face was hidden by her hands and this silence of hers weighed on swithin she was forcing him to break it what was behind her hands his own face was visible why didnt she speak why was she here alone that was not right surely  suddenly rozsi dropped her hands her flushed face was quiveringit seemed as though a word a sign even might bring a burst of tears  he walked over to the window i must give her time he thought then seized by unreasoning terror at this silence spun round and caught her by the arms rozsi held back from him swayed forward and buried her face on his breast  half an hour later swithin was pacing up and down his room the scent of rose leaves had not yet died away a glove lay on the floor he picked it up and for a long time stood weighing it in his hand all sorts of confused thoughts and feelings haunted him it was the purest and least selfish moment of his life this moment after she had yielded but that pure gratitude at her fiery simple abnegation did not last it was followed by a petty sense of triumph and by uneasiness he was still weighing the little glove in his hand when he had another visitor it was kasteliz  what can i do for you swithin asked ironically  the hungarian seemed suffering from excitement why had swithin left his charges the night before what excuse had he to make what sort of conduct did he call this  swithin very like a bulldog at that moment answered what business was it of his  the business of a gentleman what right had the englishman to pursue a young girl  pursue said swithin youve been spying then  spyingikastelizmaurus johannan insult  insult sneered swithin dyou mean to tell me you werent in the street just now  kasteliz answered with a hiss if you do not leave the city i will make you with my sworddo you understand  and if you do not leave my room i will throw you out of the window  for some minutes kasteliz spoke in pure hungarian while swithin waited with a forced smile and a fixed look in his eye he did not understand hungarian  if you are still in the city tomorrow evening said kasteliz at last in english i will spit you in the street  swithin turned to the window and watched his visitors retiring back with a queer mixture of amusement stubbornness and anxiety well he thought i suppose hell run me through the thought was unpleasant and it kept recurring but it only served to harden his determination his head was busy with plans for seeing rozsi his blood on fire with the kisses she had given him     ix  swithin was long in deciding to go forth next day he had made up his mind not to go to rozsi till five oclock mustnt make myself too cheap he thought it was a little past that hour when he at last sallied out and with a beating heart walked towards boleskeys he looked up at the window more than half expecting to see rozsi there but she was not and he noticed with faint surprise that the window was not open the plants too outside looked singularly arid he knocked no one came he beat a fierce tattoo at last the door was opened by a man with a reddish beard and one of those sardonic faces only to be seen on shoemakers of teutonic origin  what do you want making all this noise he asked in german  swithin pointed up the stairs the man grinned and shook his head  i want to go up said swithin  the cobbler shrugged his shoulders and swithin rushed upstairs the rooms were empty the furniture remained but all signs of life were gone one of his own bouquets faded stood in a glass the ashes of a fire were barely cold little scraps of paper strewed the hearth already the room smelt musty he went into the bedrooms and with a feeling of stupefaction stood staring at the girls beds side by side against the wall a bit of ribbon caught his eye he picked it up and put it in his pocketit was a piece of evidence that she had once existed by the mirror some pins were dropped about a little powder had been spilled he looked at his own disquiet face and thought ive been cheated  the shoemakers voice aroused him tausend teufel eilen sie nur zeit is geld kann nich langer warten slowly he descended  where have they gone asked swithin painfully a pound for every english word you speak a pound and he made an o with his fingers  the corners of the shoemakers lips curled geld mf eilen sie nur  but in swithin a sullen anger had begun to burn if you dont tell me he said itll be the worse for you  sind ein komischer kerl remarked the shoemaker hier ist meine frau  a batteredlooking woman came hurrying down the passage calling out in german dont let him go  with a snarling sound the shoemaker turned his back and shambled off  the woman furtively thrust a letter into swithins hand and furtively waited  the letter was from rozsi  forgive meit ranthat i leave you and do not say goodbye today our father had the call from our dear fathertown so long awaited in two hours we are ready i pray to the virgin to keep you ever safe and that you do not quite forget meyour unforgetting good friend rozsi  when swithin read it his first sensation was that of a man sinking in a bog then his obstinacy stiffened i wont be done he thought taking out a sovereign he tried to make the woman comprehend that she could earn it by telling him where they had gone he got her finally to write the words out in his pocketbook gave her the sovereign and hurried to the goldene alp where there was a waiter who spoke english the translation given him was this  at three oclock they start in a carriage on the road to linzthey have bad horsesthe herr also rides a white horse  swithin at once hailed a carriage and started at full gallop on the road to linz outside the mirabell garden he caught sight of kasteliz and grinned at him ive sold him anyway he thought for all their talk theyre no good these foreigners  his spirits rose but soon fell again what chance had he of catching them they had three hours start still the roads were heavy from the rain of the last two nightsthey had luggage and bad horses his own were good his driver bribedhe might overtake them by ten oclock but did he want to what a fool he had been not to bring his luggage he would then have had a respectable position what a brute he would look without a change of shirt or anything to shave with he saw himself with horror all bristly and in soiled linen people would think him mad ive given myself away flashed across him what the devil can i say to them and he stared sullenly at the drivers back he read rozsis letter again it had a scent of her and in the growing darkness jolted by the swinging of the carriage he suffered tortures from his prudence tortures from his passion  it grew colder and dark he turned the collar of his coat up to his ears he had visions of piccadilly this wildgoose chase appeared suddenly a dangerous unfathomable business lights fellowship security never again he brooded why wont they let me alone but it was not clear whether by they he meant the conventions the boleskeys his passions or those haunting memories of rozsi if he had only had a bag with him what was he going to say what was he going to get by this he received no answer to these questions the darkness itself was less obscure than his sensations from time to time he took out his watch at each village the driver made inquiries it was past ten when he stopped the carriage with a jerk the stars were bright as steel and by the side of the road a reedy lake showed in the moonlight swithin shivered a man on a horse had halted in the centre of the road drive on called swithin with a stolid face it turned out to be boleskey who on a gaunt white horse looked like some winged creature he stood where he could bar the progress of the carriage holding out a pistol  theatrical beggar thought swithin with a nervous smile he made no sign of recognition slowly boleskey brought his lean horse up to the carriage when he saw who was within he showed astonishment and joy  you he cried slapping his hand on his attenuated thigh and leaning over till his beard touched swithin you have come you followed us  it seems so swithin grunted out  you throw in your lot with us is it possible youyou are a knighterrant then  good god said swithin boleskey flogging his dejected steed cantered forward in the moonlight he came back bringing an old cloak which he insisted on wrapping round swithins shoulders he handed him too a capacious flask  how cold you look he said wonderful wonderful you english his grateful eyes never left swithin for a moment they had come up to the heels of the other carriage now but swithin hunched in the cloak did not try to see what was in front of him to the bottom of his soul he resented the hungarians gratitude he remarked at last with wasted irony  youre in a hurry it seems  if we had wings boleskey answered we would use them  wings muttered swithin thickly legs are good enough for me     x  arrived at the inn where they were to pass the night swithin waited hoping to get into the house without a scene but when at last he alighted the girls were in the doorway and margit greeted him with an admiring murmur in which however he seemed to detect irony rozsi pale and tremulous with a halfscared look gave him her hand and quickly withdrawing it shrank behind her sister when they had gone up to their room swithin sought boleskey his spirits had risen remarkably tell the landlord to get us supper he said well crack a bottle to our luck he hurried on the landlords preparations the window of the room faced a wood so near that he could almost touch the trees the scent from the pines blew in on him he turned away from that scented darkness and began to draw the corks of winebottles the sound seemed to conjure up boleskey he came in splashed all over smelling slightly of stables soon after margit appeared fresh and serene but rozsi did not come  where is your sister swithin said rozsi it seemed was tired it will do her good to eat said swithin and boleskey murmuring she must drink to our country went out to summon her margit followed him while swithin cut up a chicken they came back without her she had a megrim of the spirit  swithins face fell look here he said ill go and try dont wait for me  yes answered boleskey sinking mournfully into a chair try brother tryby all means try  swithin walked down the corridor with an odd sweet sinking sensation in his chest and tapped on rozsis door in a minute she peeped forth with her hair loose and wondering eyes  rozsi he stammered what makes you afraid of me now  she stared at him but did not answer  why wont you come  still she did not speak but suddenly stretched out to him her bare arm swithin pressed his face to it with a shiver she whispered above him i will come and gently shut the door  swithin stealthily retraced his steps and paused a minute outside the sittingroom to regain his selfcontrol  the sight of boleskey with a bottle in his hand steadied him  she is coming he said and very soon she did come her thick hair roughly twisted in a plait  swithin sat between the girls but did not talk for he was really hungry boleskey too was silent plunged in gloom rozsi was dumb margit alone chattered  you will come to our fathertown we shall have things to show you rozsi what things we will show him rozsi with a little appealing movement of her hands repeated what things we will show you she seemed suddenly to find her voice and with glowing cheeks mouths full and eyes bright as squirrels they chattered reminiscences of the dear fathertown of dear friends of the dear home  a poor place swithin could not help thinking this enthusiasm seemed to him common but he was careful to assume a look of interest feeding on the glances flashed at him from rozsis restless eyes  as the wine waned boleskey grew more and more gloomy but now and then a sort of gleaming flicker passed over his face he rose to his feet at last  let us not forget he said that we go perhaps to ruin to death in the face of all this we go because our country needsin this there is no credit neither to me nor to you my daughters but for this noble englishman what shall we say give thanks to god for a great heart he comesnot for country not for fame not for money but to help the weak and the oppressed let us drink then to him let us drink again and again to heroic forsyte in the midst of the dead silence swithin caught the look of suppliant mockery in rozsis eyes he glanced at the hungarian was he laughing at him but boleskey after drinking up his wine had sunk again into his seat and there suddenly to the surprise of all he began to snore margit rose and bending over him like a mother murmured he is tiredit is the ride she raised him in her strong arms and leaning on her shoulder boleskey staggered from the room swithin and rozsi were left alone he slid his hand towards her hand that lay so close on the rough tablecloth it seemed to await his touch something gave way in him and words came welling up for the moment he forgot himself forgot everything but that he was near her her head dropped on his shoulder he breathed the perfume of her hair goodnight she whispered and the whisper was like a kiss yet before he could stop her she was gone her footsteps died away in the passage but swithin sat gazing intently at a single bright drop of spilt wine quivering on the tables edge in that moment she in her helplessness and emotion was all in all to himhis life nothing all the real thingshis conventions convictions training and himselfall seemed remote behind a mist of passion and strange chivalry carefully with a bit of bread he soaked up the bright drop and suddenly he thought this is tremendous for a long time he stood there in the window close to the dark pinetrees     xi  in the early morning he awoke full of the discomfort of this strange place and the medley of his dreams lying with his nose peeping over the quilt he was visited by a horrible suspicion when he could bear it no longer he started up in bed what if it were all a plot to get him to marry her the thought was treacherous and inspired in him a faint disgust still she might be ignorant of it but was she so innocent what innocent girl would have come to his room like that what innocent girl her father who pretended to be caring only for his country it was not probable that any man was such a fool it was all part of the gamea scheming rascal kasteliz toohis threats they intended him to marry her and the horrid idea was strengthened by his reverence for marriage it was the proper the respectable condition he was genuinely afraid of this other sort of liaisonit was somehow too primitive and yet the thought of that marriage made his blood run cold considering that she had already yielded it would be all the more monstrous with the cold fatal clearness of the morning light he now for the first time saw his position in its full bearings and like a fish pulled out of water he gasped at what was disclosed sullen resentment against this attempt to force him settled deep into his soul  he seated himself on the bed holding his head in his hands solemnly thinking out what such marriage meant in the first place it meant ridicule in the next place ridicule in the last place ridicule she would eat chicken bones with her fingersthose fingers his lips still burned to kiss she would dance wildly with other men she would talk of her dear fathertown and all the time her eyes would look beyond him some where or other into some dd place he knew nothing of he sprang up and paced the room and for a moment thought he would go mad  they meant him to marry her even sheshe meant him to marry her her tantalising inscrutability her sudden little tendernesses her quick laughter her swift burning kisses even the movements of her hands her tearsall were evidence against her not one of these things that nature made her do counted on her side but how they fanned his longing his desire and distress he went to the glass and tried to part his hair with his fingers but being rather fine it fell into lank streaks there was no comfort to be got from it he drew his muddy boots on suddenly he thought if i could see her alone i could arrive at some arrangement then with a sense of stupefaction he made the discovery that no arrangement could possibly be made that would not be dangerous even desperate he seized his hat and like a rabbit that has been fired at bolted from the room he plodded along amongst the damp woods with his head down and resentment and dismay in his heart but as the sun rose and the air grew sweet with pine scent he slowly regained a sort of equability after all she had already yielded it was not as if and the tramp of his own footsteps lulled him into feeling that it would all come right  look at the thing practically he thought the faster he walked the firmer became his conviction that he could still see it through he took out his watchit was past sevenhe began to hasten back in the yard of the inn his driver was harnessing the horses swithin went up to him  who told you to put them in he asked  the driver answered der herr  swithin turned away in ten minutes he thought i shall be in that carriage again with this going on in my head driving away from england from all im used todriving towhat could he face it could he face all that he had been through that morning face it day after day night after night looking up he saw rozsi at her open window gazing down at him never had she looked sweeter more roguish an inexplicable terror seized on him he ran across the yard and jumped into his carriage to salzburg he cried drive on and rattling out of the yard without a look behind he flung a sovereign at the hostler flying back along the road faster even than he had come with pale face and eyes blank and staring like a pugdogs swithin spoke no single word nor till he had reached the door of his lodgings did he suffer the driver to draw rein     xii  towards evening five days later swithin yellow and travelworn was ferried in a gondola to daniellis hotel his brother who was on the steps looked at him with an apprehensive curiosity  why its you he mumbled so youve got here safe  safe growled swithin  james replied i thought you wouldnt leave your friends then with a jerk of suspicion you havent brought your friends  what friends growled swithin  james changed the subject you dont look the thing he said  really muttered swithin whats that to you  he appeared at dinner that night but fell asleep over his coffee neither traquair nor james asked him any further question nor did they allude to salzburg and during the four days which concluded the stay in venice swithin went about with his head up but his eyes halfclosed like a dazed man only after they had taken ship at genoa did he show signs of any healthy interest in life when finding that a man on board was perpetually strumming he locked the piano up and pitched the key into the sea  that winter in london he behaved much as usual but fits of moroseness would seize on him during which he was not pleasant to approach  one evening when he was walking with a friend in piccadilly a girl coming from a sidestreet accosted him in german swithin after staring at her in silence for some seconds handed her a fivepound note to the great amazement of his friend nor could he himself have explained the meaning of this freak of generosity  of rozsi he never heard again  this then was the substance of what he remembered as he lay ill in bed stretching out his hand he pressed the bell his valet appeared crossing the room like a cat a swede who had been with swithin many years a little man with a dried face and fierce moustache morbidly sharp nerves and a queer devotion to his master  swithin made a feeble gesture adolf he said im very bad  yes sir  why do you stand there like a cow asked swithin cant you see im very bad  yes sir the valets face twitched as though it masked the dance of obscure emotions  i shall feel better after dinner what time is it  five oclock  i thought it was more the afternoons are very long  yes sir swithin sighed as though he had expected the consolation of denial  very likely i shall have a nap bring up hot water at halfpast six and shave me before dinner  the valet moved towards the door swithin raised himself  what did mr james say to you  he said you ought to have another doctor two doctors he said better than one he said also he would look in again on his way home  swithin grunted umph what else did he say  he said you didnt take care of yourself  swithin glared  has anybody else been to see me  the valet turned away his eyes mrs thomas forsyte came last monday fortnight  how long have i been ill  five weeks on saturday  do you think im very bad  adolfs face was covered suddenly with crowsfeet you have no business to ask me question like that i am not paid sir to answer question like that  swithin said faintly youre a peppery fool open a bottle of champagne  adolf took a bottle of champagnefrom a cupboard and held nippers to it he fixed his eyes on swithin the doctor said  open the bottle  it is not  open the bottleor i give you warning  adolf removed the cork he wiped a glass elaborately filled it and bore it scrupulously to the bedside suddenly twirling his moustaches he wrung his hands and burst out it is poison  swithin grinned faintly you foreign fool he said get out  the valet vanished  he forgot himself thought swithin slowly he raised the glass slowly put it back and sank gasping on his pillows almost at once he fell asleep  he dreamed that he was at his club sitting after dinner in the crowded smokingroom with its bright walls and trefoils of light it was there that he sat every evening patient solemn lonely and sometimes fell asleep his square pale old face nodding to one side he dreamed that he was gazing at the picture over the fireplace of an old statesman with a high collar supremely finished face and sceptical eyebrowsthe picture smooth and reticent as sealingwax of one who seemed for ever exhaling the narrow wisdom of final judgments all round him his fellow members were chattering only he himself the old sick member was silent if fellows only knew what it was like to sit by yourself and feel ill all the time what they were saying he had heard a hundred times they were talking of investments of cigars horses actresses machinery what was that a foreign patent for cleaning boilers there was no such thing boilers couldnt be cleaned any fool knew that if an englishman couldnt clean a boiler no foreigner could clean one he appealed to the old statesmans eyes but for once those eyes seemed hesitating blurred wanting in finality they vanished in their place were rozsis little deepset eyes with their wide and faroff look and as he gazed they seemed to grow bright as steel and to speak to him slowly the whole face grew to be there floating on the dark background of the picture it was pink aloof unfathomable enticing with its fluffy hair and quick lips just as he had last seen it are you looking for something she seemed to say i could show you  i have everything safe enough answered swithin and in his sleep he groaned  he felt the touch of fingers on his forehead im dreaming he thought in his dream  she had vanished and far away from behind the picture came a sound of footsteps  aloud in his sleep swithin muttered ive missed it  again he heard the rustling of those light footsteps and close in his ear a sound like a sob he awoke the sob was his own great drops of perspiration stood on his forehead what is it he thought what have i lost slowly his mind travelled over his investments he could not think of any single one that was unsafe what was it then that he had lost struggling on his pillows he clutched the wineglass his lips touched the wine this isnt the heidseck he thought angrily and before the reality of that displeasure all the dim vision passed away but as he bent to drink something snapped and with a sigh swithin forsyte died above the bubbles  when james forsyte came in again on his way home the valet trembling took his hat and stick  hows your master  my master is dead sir  dead he cant be i left him safe an hour ago  on the bed swithins body was doubled like a sack his hand still grasped the glass  james forsyte paused swithin he said and with his hand to his ear he waited for an answer but none came and slowly in the glass a last bubble rose and burst  december 1900     to  my sister mabel edith reynolds     the silence     i  in a car of the naples express a mining expert was diving into a bag for papers the strong sunlight showed the fine wrinkles on his brown face and the shabbiness of his short rough beard a newspaper cutting slipped from his fingers he picked it up thinking how the dickens did that get in here it was from a colonial print of three years back and he sat staring as if in that forlorn slip of yellow paper he had encountered some ghost from his past  these were the words he read we hope that the setback to civilisation the check to commerce and development in this promising centre of our colony may be but temporary and that capital may again come to the rescue where one man was successful others should surely not fail we are convinced that it only needs and the last words for what can be sadder than to see the forest spreading its lengthening shadows like symbols of defeat over the untenanted dwellings of men and where was once the merry chatter of human voices to pass by in the silence  on an afternoon thirteen years before he had been in the city of london at one of those emporiums where mining experts perch before fresh flights like seagulls on some favourite rock a clerk said to him mr scorrier they are asking for you downstairsmr hemmings of the new colliery company  scorrier took up the speaking tube is that you mr scorrier i hope you are very well sir i amhemmingsi amcoming up  in two minutes he appeared christopher hemmings secretary of the new colliery company known in the citybehind his backas downbythestarn hemmings he grasped scorriers handthe gesture was deferential yet distinguished too handsome too capable too important his figure the cut of his irongrey beard and his intrusively fine eyes conveyed a continual courteous invitation to inspect their infallibilities he stood like a city atlas with his legs apart his coattails gathered in his hands a whole globe of financial matters deftly balanced on his nose look at me he seemed to say its heavy but how easily i carry it not the man to let it down sir  i hope i see you well mr scorrier he began i have come round about our mine there is a question of a fresh field being opened upbetween ourselves not before its wanted i find it difficult to get my board to take a comprehensive view in short the question is are you prepared to go out for us and report on it the fees will be all right his left eye closed things have been veryerdicky we are going to change our superintendent i have got little pippinyou know little pippin  scorrier murmured with a feeling of vague resentment oh yes hes not a mining man  hemmings replied we think that he will do do you thought scorrier thats good of you  he had not altogether shaken off a worship he had felt for pippinking pippin he was always called when they had been boys at the camborne grammarschool king pippin the boy with the bright colour very bright hair bright subtle elusive eyes broad shoulders little stoop in the neck and a way of moving it quickly like a bird the boy who was always at the top of everything and held his head as if looking for something further to be the top of he remembered how one day king pippin had said to him in his soft way young scorrie ill do your sums for you and in answer to his dubious is that all right had replied of coursei dont want you to get behind that beast blake hes not a cornishman the beast blake was an irishman not yet twelve he remembered too an occasion when king pippin with two other boys fought six louts and got a licking and how pippin sat for half an hour afterwards all bloody his head in his hands rocking to and fro and weeping tears of mortification and how the next day he had sneaked off by himself and attacking the same gang got frightfully mauled a second time  thinking of these things he answered curtly when shall i start  downbythestarn hemmings replied with a sort of fearful sprightliness theres a good fellow i will send instructions so glad to see you well conferring on scorrier a lookfine to the verge of vulgarityhe withdrew scorrier remained seated heavy with insignificance and vague oppression as if he had drunk a tumbler of sweet port  a week later in company with pippin he was on board a liner  the king pippin of his schooldays was now a man of fortyfour he awakened in scorrier the uncertain wonder with which men look backward at their uncomplicated teens and staggering up and down the decks in the long atlantic roll he would steal glances at his companion as if he expected to find out from them something about himself pippin had still king pippins bright fine hair and dazzling streaks in his short beard he had still a bright colour and suave voice and what there were of wrinkles suggested only subtleties of humour and ironic sympathy from the first and apparently without negotiation he had his seat at the captains table to which on the second day scorrier too found himself translated and had to sit as he expressed it ruefully among the bigwigs  during the voyage only one incident impressed itself on scorriers memory and that for a disconcerting reason in the forecastle were the usual complement of emigrants one evening leaning across the rail to watch them he felt a touch on his arm and looking round saw pippins face and beard quivering in the lamplight poor people he said the idea flashed on scorrier that he was like some fine wire soundrecording instrument  suppose he were to snap he thought impelled to justify this fancy he blurted out youre a nervous chap the way you look at those poor devils  pippin hustled him along the deck come come you took me off my guard he murmured with a sly gentle smile thats not fair  he found it a continual source of wonder that pippin at his age should cut himself adrift from the associations and security of london life to begin a new career in a new country with dubious prospect of success i always heard he was doing well all round he thought thinks hell better himself perhaps hes a true cornishman  the morning of arrival at the mines was grey and cheerless a cloud of smoke beaten down by drizzle clung above the forest the wooden houses straggled dismally in the unkempt semblance of a street against a background of endless silent woods an air of blank discouragement brooded over everything cranes jutted idly over empty trucks the long jetty oozed black slime miners with listless faces stood in the rain dogs fought under their very legs on the way to the hotel they met no one busy or serene except a chinee who was polishing a dishcover  the late superintendent a cowed man regaled them at lunch with his forebodings his attitude toward the situation was like the food which was greasy and uninspiring alone together once more the two newcomers eyed each other sadly  oh dear sighed pippin we must change all this scorrier it will never do to go back beaten i shall not go back beaten you will have to carry me on my shield and slyly too heavy eh poor fellow then for a long time he was silent moving his lips as if adding up the cost suddenly he sighed and grasping scorriers arm said dull arent i what will you do put me in your report new superintendentsad dull dognot a word to throw at a cat and as if the new task were too much for him he sank back in thought the last words he said to scorrier that night were very silent here its hard to believe ones here for life but i feel i am mustnt be a coward though and brushing his forehead as though to clear from it a cobweb of faint thoughts he hurried off  scorrier stayed on the veranda smoking the rain had ceased a few stars were burning dimly even above the squalor of the township the scent of the forests the interminable forests brooded there sprang into his mind the memory of a picture from one of his childrens fairy booksthe picture of a little bearded man on tiptoe with poised head and a great sword slashing at the castle of a giant it reminded him of pippin and suddenly even to scorrierwhose existence was one long encounter with strange placesthe unseen presence of those woods their heavy healthy scent the little sounds like squeaks from tiny toys issuing out of the gloomy silence seemed intolerable to be shunned from the mere instinct of selfpreservation he thought of the evening he had spent in the bosom of downbythestarn hemmings family receiving his last instructionsthe security of that suburban villa its discouraging gentility the superior acidity of the miss hemmings the noble names of large contractors of company promoters of a peer dragged with the lightness of guncarriages across the conversation the autocracy of hemmings rasped up here and there by some domestic contradiction it was all so nice and safeas if the whole thing had been fastened to an anchor sunk beneath the pink cabbages of the drawingroom carpet hemmings seeing him off the premises had said with secrecy little pippin will have a good thing we shall make his salary l hell be a great manquite a king haha  scorrier shook the ashes from his pipe salary he thought straining his ears i wouldnt take the place for five thousand pounds a year and yet its a fine country and with ironic violence he repeated a dashed fine country  ten days later having finished his report on the new mine he stood on the jetty waiting to go abroad the steamer for home  god bless you said pippin tell them they neednt be afraid and sometimes when youre at home think of me eh  scorrier scrambling on board had a confused memory of tears in his eyes and a convulsive handshake     ii  it was eight years before the wheels of life carried scorrier back to that disenchanted spot and this time not on the business of the new colliery company he went for another company with a mine some thirty miles away before starting however he visited hemmings the secretary was surrounded by pigeonholes and finer than ever scorrier blinked in the full radiance of his courtesy a little man with eyebrows full of questions and a grizzled beard was seated in an armchair by the fire  you know mr booker said hemmingsone of my directors this is mr scorrier sirwho went out for us  these sentences were murmured in a way suggestive of their uncommon value the director uncrossed his legs and bowed scorrier also bowed and hemmings leaning back slowly developed the full resources of his waistcoat  so you are going out again scorrier for the other side i tell mr scorrier sir that he is going out for the enemy dont find them a mine as good as you found us theres a good man  the little director asked explosively see our last dividend twenty per cent eh what  hemmings moved a finger as if reproving his director i will not disguise from you he murmured that there is friction between us andthe enemy you know our position too welljust a little too well eh a nods as good as a wink  his diplomatic eyes flattered scorrier who passed a hand over his browand said of course  pippin doesnt hit it off with them between ourselves hes a leetle too big for his boots you know what it is when a man in his position gets a sudden rise  scorrier caught himself searching on the floor for a sight of hemmings boots he raised his eyes guiltily the secretary continued we dont hear from him quite as often as we should like in fact  to his own surprise scorrier murmured its a silent place  the secretary smiled very good mr scorrier says sir its a silent place haha i call that very good but suddenly a secret irritation seemed to bubble in him he burst forth almost violently hes no business to let it affect him now has he i put it to you mr scorrier i put it to you sir  but scorrier made no reply and soon after took his leave he had been asked to convey a friendly hint to pippin that more frequent letters would be welcomed standing in the shadow of the royal exchange waiting to thread his way across he thought so you must have noise must youyouve got some here and to spare  on his arrival in the new world he wired to pippin asking if he might stay with him on the way up country and received the answer be sure and come  a week later he arrived there was now a railway and found pippin waiting for him in a phaeton scorrier would not have known the place again there was a glitter over everything as if some one had touched it with a wand the tracks had given place to roads running firm straight and black between the trees under brilliant sunshine the wooden houses were all painted out in the gleaming harbour amongst the green of islands lay three steamers each with a fleet of busy boats and here and there a tiny yacht floated like a seabird on the water pippin drove his longtailed horses furiously his eyes brimmed with subtle kindness as if according scorrier a continual welcome during the two days of his stay scorrier never lost that sense of glamour he had every opportunity for observing the grip pippin had over everything the wooden doors and walls of his bungalow kept out no sounds he listened to interviews between his host and all kinds and conditions of men the voices of the visitors would rise at firstangry discontented matteroffact with nasal twang or guttural drawl then would come the soft patter of the superintendents feet crossing and recrossing the room then a pause the sound of hard breathing and quick questionsthe visitors voice again again the patter and pippins ingratiating but decisive murmurs presently out would come the visitor with an expression on his face which scorrier soon began to know by heart a kind of pleased puzzled helpless look which seemed to say ive been done i knowill give it to myself when im round the corner  pippin was full of wistful questions about home he wanted to talk of music pictures plays of how london looked what new streets there were and above all whether scorrier had been lately in the west country he talked of getting leave next winter asked whether scorrier thought they would put up with him at home then with the agitation which had alarmed scorrier before he added ah but im not fit for home now one gets spoiled its big and silent here what should i go back to i dont seem to realise  scorrier thought of hemmings tis a bit cramped there certainly he muttered  pippin went on as if divining his thoughts i suppose our friend hemmings would call me foolish hes above the little weaknesses of imagination eh yes its silent here sometimes in the evening i would give my head for somebody to talk tohemmings would never give his head for anything i think but all the same i couldnt face them at home spoiled and slyly he murmured what would the board say if they could hear that  scorrier blurted out to tell you the truth they complain a little of not hearing from you  pippin put out a hand as if to push something away let them try the life here he broke out its like sitting on a live volcanowhat with our friends the enemy over there the men the american competition i keep it going scorrier but at what a costat what a cost  but surelyletters  pippin only answered i tryi try  scorrier felt with remorse and wonder that he had spoken the truth the following day he left for his inspection and while in the camp of the enemy much was the talk he heard of pippin  why said his host the superintendent a little man with a face somewhat like an owls dyou know the name theyve given him down in the capitalthe kinggood eh hes made them sit up all along this coast i like him well enoughgoodhearted man shocking nervous but my people down there cant stand him at any price sir he runs this colony youd think butter wouldnt melt in that mouth of his but he always gets his way thats what riles em so that and the success hes making of his mine it puzzles me youd think hed only be too glad of a quiet life a man with his nerves but no hes never happy unless hes fighting something where hes got a chance to score a victory i wont say he likes it but by jove it seems hes got to do it now thats funny ill tell you one thing though shouldnt be a bit surprised if he broke down some day and ill tell you another he added darkly hes sailing very near the wind with those large contracts that he makes i wouldnt care to take his risks just let them have a strike or something that shuts them down for a spelland mark my words siritll be all up with them but he concluded confidentially i wish i had his hold on the men its a great thing in this country not like home where you can go round a corner and get another gang you have to make the best you can out of the lot you have you wont get another man for love or money without you ship him a few hundred miles and with a frown he waved his arm over the forests to indicate the barrenness of the land     iii  scorrier finished his inspection and went on a shooting trip into the forest his host met him on his return just look at this he said holding out a telegram awful isnt it his face expressed a profound commiseration almost ludicrously mixed with the ashamed contentment that men experience at the misfortunes of an enemy  the telegram dated the day before ran thus frightful explosion new colliery this morning great loss of life feared  scorrier had the bewildered thought pippin will want me now  he took leave of his host who called after him youd better wait for a steamer its a beastly drive  scorrier shook his head all night jolting along a rough track cut through the forest he thought of pippin the other miseries of this calamity at present left him cold he barely thought of the smothered men but pippins struggle his lonely struggle with this hydraheaded monster touched him very nearly he fell asleep and dreamed of watching pippin slowly strangled by a snake the agonised kindly ironic face peeping out between two gleaming coils was so horribly real that he awoke it was the moment before dawn pitchblack branches barred the sky with every jolt of the wheels the gleams from the lamps danced fantastic and intrusive round ferns and treestems into the cold heart of the forest for an hour or more scorrier tried to feign sleep and hide from the stillness and overmastering gloom of these great woods then softly a whisper of noises stole forth a stir of light and the whole slow radiance of the morning glory but it brought no warmth and scorrier wrapped himself closer in his cloak feeling as though old age had touched him  close on noon he reached the township glamour seemed still to hover over it he drove on to the mine the windingengine was turning the pulley at the top of the headgear whizzing round nothing looked unusual some mistake he thought he drove to the mine buildings alighted and climbed to the shaft head instead of the usual rumbling of the trolleys the rattle of coal discharged over the screens there was silence close by pippin himself was standing smirched with dirt the cage coming swift and silent from below shot open its doors with a sharp rattle scorrier bent forward to look there lay a dead man with a smile on his face  how many he whispered  pippin answered eightyfour brought upfortyseven still below and entered the mans name in a pocketbook  an older man was taken out next he too was smilingthere had been vouchsafed to him it seemed a taste of more than earthly joy the sight of those strange smiles affected scorrier more than all the anguish or despair he had seen scored on the faces of other dead men he asked an old miner how long pippin had been at work  thirty hours yesterday he wer below we had to nigh carry mun up at last hes for goin down again but the chaps wont lower mun the old man gave a sigh im waiting for my boy to come up i am  scorrier waited toothere was fascination about those dead smiling faces the rescuing of these men who would never again breathe went on and on scorrier grew sleepy in the sun the old miner woke him saying rummy stuff this here chokedamp see they all dies drunk the very next to be brought up was the chief engineer scorrier had known him quite well one of those scotsmen who are born at the age of forty and remain so all their lives his facethe only one that wore no smileseemed grieving that duty had deprived it of that last luxury with wide eyes and drawn lips he had died protesting  late in the afternoon the old miner touched scorriers arm and said there he istheres my boy and he departed slowly wheeling the body on a trolley  as the sun set the gang below came up no further search was possible till the fumes had cleared scorrier heard one man say theres some well never get theyve had sure burial  another answered him tis a gude enough bag for me they passed him the whites of their eyes gleaming out of faces black as ink  pippin drove him home at a furious pace not uttering a single word as they turned into the main street a young woman starting out before the horses obliged pippin to pull up the glance he bent on scorrier was ludicrously prescient of suffering the woman asked for her husband several times they were stopped thus by women asking for their husbands or sons this is what i have to go through pippin whispered  when they had eaten he said to scorrier it was kind of you to come and stand by me they take me for a god poor creature that i am but shall i ever get the men down again their nerves shaken i wish i were one of those poor lads to die with a smile like that  scorrier felt the futility of his presence on pippin alone must be the heat and burden would he stand under it or would the whole thing come crashing to the ground he urged him again and again to rest but pippin only gave him one of his queer smiles you dont know how strong i am he said     iv  he himself slept heavily and waking at dawn went down pippin was still at his desk his pen had dropped he was asleep the ink was wet scorriers eye caught the opening words  gentlemensince this happened i have not slept  he stole away again with a sense of indignation that no one could be dragged in to share that fight the london boardroom rose before his mind he imagined the portentous gravity of hemmings his face and voice and manner conveying the impression that he alone could save the situation the six directors all men of commonsense and certainly humane seated behind large turretshaped inkpots the concern and irritation in their voices asking how it could have happened their comments an awful thing i suppose pippin is doing the best he can wire him on no account to leave the mine idle poor devils a fund of course what ought we to give he had a strong conviction that nothing of all this would disturb the commonsense with which they would go home and eat their mutton a good thing too the less it was taken to heart the better but scorrier felt angry the fight was so unfair a fellow all nerveswith not a soul to help him well it was his own lookout he had chosen to centre it all in himself to make himself its very soul if he gave way now the ship must go down by a thin thread scorriers heroworship still held man against nature he thought i back the man the struggle in which he was so powerless to give aid became intensely personal to him as if he had engaged his own good faith therein  the next day they went down again to the pithead and scorrier himself descended the fumes had almost cleared but there were some places which would never be reached at the end of the day all but four bodies had been recovered in the day o judgment a miner said they fourll come out of here those unclaimed bodies haunted scorrier he came on sentences of writing where men waiting to be suffocated had written down their feelings in one place the hour the word sleepy and a signature in another a fdone for when he came up at last pippin was still waiting pocketbook in hand they again departed at a furious pace  two days later scorrier visiting the shaft found its neighbourhood desertednot a living thing of any sort was there except one chinaman poking his stick into the rubbish pippin was away down the coast engaging an engineer and on his return scorrier had not the heart to tell him of the desertion he was spared the effort for pippin said dont be afraidyouve got bad news the men have gone on strike  scorrier sighed lock stock and barrel  i thought sosee what i have here he put before scorrier a telegram  at all costs keep workingfatal to stopmanage this somehowhemmings  breathing quickly he added as if i didnt know manage this somehowa little hard  whats to be done asked scorrier  you see i am commanded pippin answered bitterly and theyre quite right we must keep workingour contracts now im downnot a soul will spare me  the miners meeting was held the following day on the outskirts of the town pippin had cleared the place to make a public recreationgrounda sort of feather in the companys cap it was now to be the spot whereon should be decided the question of the companys life or death  the sky to the west was crossed by a single line of cloud like a bar of beaten gold tree shadows crept towards the groups of men the evening savour that strong fragrance of the forest sweetened the air the miners stood all round amongst the burnt treestumps cowed and sullen they looked incapable of movement or expression it was this dumb paralysis that frightened scorrier he watched pippin speaking from his phaeton the butt of all those sullen restless eyes would he last out would the wires hold it was like the finish of a race he caught a baffled look on pippins face as if he despaired of piercing that terrible paralysis the mens eyes had begun to wander hes lost his hold thought scorrier its all up  a miner close beside him muttered look out  pippin was leaning forward his voice had risen the words fell like a whiplash on the faces of the crowd you shant throw me over do you think ill give up all ive done for you ill make you the first power in the colony are you turning tail at the first shot youre a set of cowards my lads  each man round scorrier was listening with a different motion of the handsone rubbed them one clenched them another moved his closed fist as if stabbing some one in the back a grislybearded beetlebrowed twinklingeyed old cornishman muttered ahm not troublin about that it seemed almost as if pippins object was to get the men to kill him they had gathered closer crouching for a rush suddenly pippins voice dropped to a whisper im disgraced men are you going back on me  the old miner next scorrier called out suddenly anny thats cornishmen here to stand by the superintendent a group drew together and with murmurs and gesticulation the meeting broke up  in the evening a deputation came to visit pippin and all night long their voices and the superintendents footsteps could be heard in the morning pippin went early to the mine before supper the deputation came again and again scorrier had to listen hour after hour to the sound of voices and footsteps till he fell asleep just before dawn he was awakened by a light pippin stood at his bedside the men go down tomorrow he said what did i tell you carry me home on my shield eh  in a week the mine was in full work     v  two years later scorrier heard once more of pippin a note from hemmings reached him asking if he could make it convenient to attend their board meeting the following thursday he arrived rather before the appointed time the secretary received him and in answer to inquiry said thank you we are doing wellbetween ourselves we are doing very well  and pippin  the secretary frowned ah pippin we asked you to come on his account pippin is giving us a lot of trouble we have not had a single line from him for just two years he spoke with such a sense of personal grievance that scorrier felt quite sorry for him not a single line said hemmings since that explosionyou were there at the time i remember it makes it very awkward i call it personal to me  but how scorrier began  we gettelegrams he writes to no one not even to his family and why just tell me why we hear of him hes a great nob out there nothings done in the colony without his finger being in the pie he turned out the last government because they wouldnt grant us an extension for our railwayshows he cant be a fool besides look at our balancesheet  it turned out that the question on which scorriers opinion was desired was whether hemmings should be sent out to see what was the matter with the superintendent during the discussion which ensued he was an unwilling listener to strictures on pippins silence the explosion he muttered at last a very trying time  mr booker pounced on him a very trying time so it wasto all of us but what excuse is thatnow mr scorrier what excuse is that  scorrier was obliged to admit that it was none  business is businesseh what  scorrier gazing round that neat boardroom nodded a deaf director who had not spoken for some months said with sudden fierceness its disgraceful he was obviously letting off the fume of longunuttered disapprovals one perfectly neat benevolent old fellow however who had kept his hat on and had a single vicethat of coming to the boardroom with a brown paper parcel tied up with stringmurmured we must make all allowances and started an anecdote about his youth he was gently called to order by his secretary scorrier was asked for his opinion he looked at hemmings my importance is concerned was written all over the secretarys face moved by an impulse of loyalty to pippin scorrier answered as if it were all settled well let me know when you are starting hemmingsi should like the trip myself  as he was going out the chairman old jolyon forsyte with a grave twinkling look at hemmings took him aside glad to hear you say that about going too mr scorrier we must be carefulpippins such a good fellow and so sensitive and our friend therea bit heavy in the hand um  scorrier did in fact go out with hemmings the secretary was seasick and his prostration dignified but noisy remained a memory for ever it was sonorous and finethe prostration of superiority and the way in which he spoke of it taking casual acquaintances into the caves of his experience was truly interesting  pippin came down to the capital to escort them provided for their comforts as if they had been royalty and had a special train to take them to the mines  he was a little stouter brighter of colour greyer of beard more nervous perhaps in voice and breathing his manner to hemmings was full of flattering courtesy but his sly ironical glances played on the secretarys armour like a fountain on a hippopotamus to scorrier however he could not show enough affection  the first evening when hemmings had gone to his room he jumped up like a boy out of school so im going to get a wigging he said i suppose i deserve it but if you knewif you only knew out here theyve nicknamed me the kingthey say i rule the colony its myself that i cant rule and with a sudden burst of passion such as scorrier had never seen in him why did they send this man here what can he know about the things that ive been through in a moment he calmed down again there this is very stupid worrying you like this and with a long kind look into scorriers face he hustled him off to bed  pippin did not break out again though fire seemed to smoulder behind the bars of his courteous irony intuition of danger had evidently smitten hemmings for he made no allusion to the object of his visit there were moments when scorriers commonsense sided with hemmingsthese were moments when the secretary was not present  after all he told himself its a little thing to askone letter a month i never heard of such a case it was wonderful indeed how they stood it it showed how much they valued pippin what was the matter with him what was the nature of his trouble one glimpse scorrier had when even hemmings as he phrased it received quite a turn it was during a drive back from the most outlying of the companys trial mines eight miles through the forest the track led through a belt of trees blackened by a forest fire pippin was driving the secretary seated beside him wore an expression of faint alarm such as pippins driving was warranted to evoke from almost any face the sky had darkened strangely but pale streaks of light coming from one knew not where filtered through the trees no breath was stirring the wheels and horses hoofs made no sound on the deep fern mould all around the burnt treetrunks leafless and jagged rose like withered giants the passages between them were black the sky black and black the silence no one spoke and literally the only sound was pippins breathing what was it that was so terrifying scorrier had a feeling of entombment that nobody could help him the feeling of being face to face with nature a sensation as if all the comfort and security of words and rules had dropped away from him andnothing happened they reached home and dined  during dinner he had again that old remembrance of a little man chopping at a castle with his sword it came at a moment when pippin had raised his hand with the carvingknife grasped in it to answer some remark of hemmings about the future of the company the optimism in his uplifted chin the strenuous energy in his whispering voice gave scorrier a more vivid glimpse of pippins nature than he had perhaps ever had before this new country where nothing but himself could help a manthat was the castle no wonder pippin was impatient of control no wonder he was out of hand no wonder he was silentchopping away at that and suddenly he thought yes and all the time one knows nature must beat him in the end  that very evening hemmings delivered himself of his reproof he had sat unusually silent scorrier indeed had thought him a little drunk so portentous was his gravity suddenly however he rose it was hard on a man he said in his position with a board he spoke as of a family of small children to be kept so short of information he was actually compelled to use his imagination to answer the shareholders questions this was painful and humiliating he had never heard of any secretary having to use his imagination he went furtherit was insulting he had grown grey in the service of the company mr scorrier would bear him out when he said he had a position to maintainhis name in the city was a high one and by george he was going to keep it a high one he would allow nobody to drag it in the dustthat ought clearly to be understood his directors felt they were being treated like children however that might be it was absurd to suppose that he hemmings could be treated like a child the secretary paused his eyes seemed to bully the room  if there were no london office murmured pippin the shareholders would get the same dividends  hemmings gasped come he said this is monstrous  what help did i get from london when i first came here what help have i ever had  hemmings swayed recovered and with a forced smile replied that if this were true he had been standing on his head for years he did not believe the attitude possible for such a length of time personally he would have thought that he too had had a little something to say to the companys position but no matter his irony was crushing it was possible that mr pippin hoped to reverse the existing laws of the universe with regard to limited companies he would merely say that he must not begin with a company of which he hemmings happened to be secretary mr scorrier had hinted at excuses for his part with the best intentions in the world he had great difficulty in seeing them he would go furtherhe did not see them the explosion pippin shrank so visibly that hemmings seemed troubled by a suspicion that he had gone too far  we know he said that it was trying for you  trying burst out pippin  no one can say hemmings resumed soothingly that we have not dealt liberally pippin made a motion of the head we think we have a good superintendent i go further an excellent superintendent what i say is lets be pleasant i am not making an unreasonable request he ended on a fitting note of jocularity and as if by consent all three withdrew each to his own room without another word  in the course of the next day pippin said to scorrier it seems i have been very wicked i must try to do better and with a touch of bitter humour they are kind enough to think me a good superintendent you see after that i must try hard  scorrier broke in no man could have done so much for them and carried away by an impulse to put things absolutely straight went on but after all a letter now and thenwhat does it amount to  pippin besieged him with a subtle glance you too he saidi must indeed have been a wicked man and turned away  scorrier felt as if he had been guilty of brutality sorry for pippin angry with himself angry with pippin sorry for himself he earnestly desired to see the back of hemmings the secretary gratified the wish a few days later departing by steamer with ponderous expressions of regard and the assurance of his goodwill  pippin gave vent to no outburst of relief maintaining a courteous silence making only one allusion to his late guest in answer to a remark of scorrier  ah dont tempt me mustnt speak behind his back     vi  a month passed and scorrier stillremained pippins guest as each mailday approached he experienced a queer suppressed excitement on one of these occasions pippin had withdrawn to his room and when scorrier went to fetch him to dinner he found him with his head leaning on his hands amid a perfect fitter of torn paper he looked up at scorrier  i cant do it he said i feel such a hypocrite i cant put myself into leadingstrings again why should i ask these people when ive settled everything already if it were a vital matter they wouldnt want to heartheyd simply wire manage this somehow  scorrier said nothing but thought privately this is a mad business what was a letter why make a fuss about a letter the approach of mailday seemed like a nightmare to the superintendent he became feverishly nervous like a man under a spell and when the mail had gone behaved like a respited criminal and this had been going on two years ever since that explosion why it was monomania  one day a month after hemmings departure pippin rose early from dinner his face was flushed he had been drinking wine i wont be beaten this time he said as he passed scorrier the latter could hear him writing in the next room and looked in presently to say that he was going for a walk pippin gave him a kindly nod  it was a cool still evening innumerable stars swarmed in clusters over the forests forming bright hieroglyphics in the middle heavens showering over the dark harbour into the sea scorrier walked slowly a weight seemed lifted from his mind so entangled had he become in that uncanny silence at last pippin had broken through the spell to get that letter sent would be the laying of a phantom the rehabilitation of commonsense now that this silence was in the throes of being broken he felt curiously tender towards pippin without the heroworship of old days but with a queer protective feeling after all he was different from other men in spite of his feverish tenacious energy in spite of his ironic humour there was something of the woman in him and as for this silence this horror of controlall geniuses had bees in their bonnets and pippin was a genius in his way  he looked back at the town brilliantly lighted it had a thriving airdifficult to believe of the place he remembered ten years back the sounds of drinking gambling laughter and dancing floated to his ears quite a city he thought  with this queer elation on him he walked slowly back along the street forgetting that he was simply an oldish mining expert with a look of shabbiness such as clings to men who are always travelling as if their nap were for ever being rubbed off and he thought of pippin creator of this glory  he had passed the boundaries of the town and had entered the forest a feeling of discouragement instantly beset him the scents and silence after the festive cries and odours of the town were undefinably oppressive notwithstanding he walked a long time saying to himself that he would give the letter every chance at last when he thought that pippin must have finished he went back to the house  pippin had finished his forehead rested on the table his arms hung at his sides he was stonedead his face wore a smile and by his side lay an empty laudanum bottle  the letter closely beautifully written lay before him it was a fine document clear masterly detailed nothing slurred nothing concealed nothing omitted a complete review of the companys position it ended with the words your humble servant richard pippin  scorrier took possession of it he dimly understood that with those last words a wire had snapped the borderline had been overpassed the point reached where that sense of proportion which alone makes life possible is lost he was certain that at the moment of his death pippin could have discussed bimetallism or any intellectual problem except the one problem of his own heart that for some mysterious reason had been too much for him his death had been the work of a moment of supreme revolta single instant of madness on a single subject he found on the blottingpaper scrawled across the impress of the signature cant stand it the completion of that letter had been to him a struggle ungraspable by scorrier slavery defeat a violation of nature the death of justice it were better not to think of it pippin could have toldbut he would never speak again nature at whom unaided he had dealt so many blows had taken her revenge  in the night scorrier stole down and with an ashamed face cut off a lock of the fine grey hair his daughter might like it he thought  he waited till pippin was buried then with the letter in his pocket started for england  he arrived at liverpool on a thursday morning and travelling to town drove straight to the office of the company the board were sitting pippins successor was already being interviewed he passed out as scorrier came in a middleaged man with a large red beard and a foxy compromising face he also was a cornishman scorrier wished him luck with a very heavy heart  as an unsentimental man who had a proper horror of emotion whose living depended on his good sense to look back on that interview with the board was painful it had excited in him a rage of which he was now heartily ashamed old jolyon forsyte the chairman was not there for once guessing perhaps that the boards view of this death would be too small for him and little mr booker sat in his place every one had risen shaken hands with scorrier and expressed themselves indebted for his coming scorrier placed pippins letter on the table and gravely the secretary read out to his board the last words of their superintendent when he had finished a director said thats not the letter of a madman another answered mad as a hatter nobody but a madman would have thrown up such a post scorrier suddenly withdrew he heard hemmings calling after him arent you well mr scorrier arent you well sir  he shouted back quite sane i thank you  the naples express rolled round the outskirts of the town vesuvius shone in the sun uncrowned by smoke but even as scorrier looked a white puff went soaring up it was the footnote to his memories  february 1901 february 1901
