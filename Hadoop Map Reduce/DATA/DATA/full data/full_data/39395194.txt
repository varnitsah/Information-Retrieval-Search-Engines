39395194	the wellbeloved  a sketch of a temperament  by thomas hardy     preface  the peninsula carved by time out of a single stone whereon most of the following scenes are laid has been for centuries immemorial the home of a curious and wellnigh distinct people cherishing strange beliefs and singular customs now for the most part obsolescent fancies like certain softwooded plants which cannot bear the silent inland frosts but thrive by the sea in the roughest of weather seem to grow up naturally here in particular amongst those natives who have no active concern in the labours of the isle hence it is a spot apt to generate a type of personage like the character imperfectly sketched in these pagesa native of nativeswhom some may choose to call a fantast if they honour him with their consideration so far but whom others may see only as one that gave objective continuity and a name to a delicate dream which in a vaguer form is more or less common to all men and is by no means new to platonic philosophers  to those who know the rocky coign of england here depictedoverlooking the great channel highway with all its suggestiveness and standing out so far into midsea that touches of the gulf stream soften the air till februaryit is matter of surprise that the place has not been more frequently chosen as the retreat of artists and poets in search of inspirationfor at least a month or two in the year the tempestuous rather than the fine seasons by preference to be sure one nook therein is the retreat at their countrys expense of other geniuses from a distance but their presence is hardly discoverable yet perhaps it is as well that the artistic visitors do not come or no more would be heard of little freehold houses being bought and sold there for a couple of hundred poundsbuilt of solid stone and dating from the sixteenth century and earlier with mullions copings and corbels complete these transactions by the way are carried out and covenanted or were till lately in the parish church in the face of the congregation such being the ancient custom of the isle  as for the story itself it may be worth while to remark that differing from all or most others of the series in that the interest aimed at is of an ideal or subjective nature and frankly imaginative verisimilitude in the sequence of events has been subordinated to the said aim  the first publication of this tale in an independent form was in 1897 but it had appeared in the periodical press in 1892 under the title of the pursuit of the wellbeloved a few chapters of that experimental issue were rewritten for the present and final form of the narrative  t h august 1912    contents       part first   a young man of twenty       i      a supposititious presentment of her      ii

lines wish to see      i seek no further it is she                                  r crashaw     1 i a supposititious presentment of her  a person who differed from the local wayfarers was climbing the steep road which leads through the seaskirted townlet definable as the street of wells and forms a pass into that gibraltar of wessex the singular peninsula once an island and still called such that stretches out like the head of a bird into the english channel it is connected with the mainland by a long thin neck of pebbles cast up by rages of the se and unparalleled in its kind in europe  the pedestrian was what he looked likea young man from london and the cities of the continent nobody could see at present that his urbanism sat upon him only as a garment he was just recollecting with something of selfreproach that a whole three years and eight months had flown since he paid his last visit to his father at this lonely rock of his birthplace the intervening time having been spent amid many contrasting societies peoples manners and scenes  what had seemed usual in the isle when he lived there always looked quaint and odd after his later impressions more than ever the spot seemed what it was said once to have been the ancient vindilia island and the home of the slingers the towering rock the houses above houses one mans doorstep rising behind his neighbours chimney the gardens hung up by one edge to the sky the vegetables growing on apparently almost vertical planes the unity of the whole island as a solid and single block of limestone four miles long were no longer familiar and commonplace ideas all now stood dazzlingly unique and white against the tinted sea and the sun flashed on infinitely stratified walls of oolite                  the melancholy ruins       of cancelled cycles  with a distinctiveness that called the eyes to it as strongly as any spectacle he had beheld afar  after a laborious clamber he reached the top and walked along the plateau towards the eastern village the time being about two oclock in the middle of the summer season the road was glaring and dusty and drawing near to his fathers house he sat down in the sun  he stretched out his hand upon the rock beside him it felt warm that was the islands personal temperature when in its afternoon sleep as now he listened and heard sounds whirrwhirr sawsawsaw those were the islands snoresthe noises of the quarrymen and stonesawyers  opposite to the spot on which he sat was a roomy cottage or homestead like the island it was all of stone not only in walls but in windowframes roof chimneys fence stile pigsty and stable almost door  he remembered who had used to live thereand probably lived there nowthe caro family the roanmare caros as they were called to distinguish them from other branches of the same pedigree there being but halfadozen christian and surnames in the whole island he crossed the road and looked in at the open doorway yes there they were still  mrs caro who had seen him from the window met him in the entry and an oldfashioned greeting took place between them a moment after a door leading from the back rooms was thrown open and a young girl about seventeen or eighteen came bounding in  why tis dear joce she burst out joyfully and running up to the young man she kissed him  the demonstration was sweet enough from the owner of such an affectionate pair of bright hazel eyes and brown tresses of hair but it was so sudden so unexpected by a man fresh from towns that he winced for a moment quite involuntarily and there was some constraint in the manner in which he returned her kiss and said my pretty little avice how do you do after so long  for a few seconds her impulsive innocence hardly noticed his start of surprise but mrs caro the girls mother had observed it instantly with a pained flush she turned to her daughter  avicemy dear avice whywhat are you doing dont you know that youve grown up to be a woman since jocelynmr pierstonwas last down here of course you mustnt do now as you used to do three or four years ago  the awkwardness which had arisen was hardly removed by pierstons assurance that he quite expected her to keep up the practice of her childhood followed by several minutes of conversation on general subjects he was vexed from his soul that his unaware movement should so have betrayed him at his leaving he repeated that if avice regarded him otherwise than as she used to do he would never forgive her but though they parted good friends her regret at the incident was visible in her face jocelyn passed out into the road and onward to his fathers house hard by the mother and daughter were left alone  i was quite amazed at ee my child exclaimed the elder a young man from london and foreign cities used now to the strictest company manners and ladies who almost think it vulgar to smile broad how could ye do it avice  ii didnt think about how i was altered said the consciencestricken girl i used to kiss him and he used to kiss me before he went away  but that was years ago my dear  o yes and for the moment i forgot he seemed just the same to me as he used to be  well it cant be helped now you must be careful in the future hes got lots of young women ill warrant and has few thoughts left for you hes what they call a sculptor and he means to be a great genius in that line some day they do say  well ive done it and it cant be mended moaned the girl  meanwhile jocelyn pierston the sculptor of budding fame had gone onward to the house of his father an inartistic man of trade and commerce merely from whom nevertheless jocelyn condescended to accept a yearly allowance pending the famous days to come but the elder having received no warning of his sons intended visit was not at home to receive him jocelyn looked round the familiar premises glanced across the common at the great yards within which eternal saws were going to and fro upon eternal blocks of stonethe very same saws and the very same blocks that he had seen there when last in the island so it seemed to himand then passed through the dwelling into the back garden  like all the gardens in the isle it was surrounded by a wall of dryjointed spawls and at its further extremity it ran out into a corner which adjoined the garden of the caros he had no sooner reached this spot than he became aware of a murmuring and sobbing on the other side of the wall the voice he recognized in a moment as avices and she seemed to be confiding her trouble to some young friend of her own sex  oh what shall i do what shall i do she was saying bitterly so bold as it wasso shameless how could i think of such a thing he will never forgive menever never like me again hell think me a forward hussy and yetand yet i quite forgot how much i had grown but that hell never believe the accents were those of one who had for the first time become conscious of her womanhood as an unwonted possession which shamed and frightened her  did he seem angry at it inquired the friend  o nonot angry worse cold and haughty o hes such a fashionable person nownot at all an island man but theres no use in talking of it i wish i was dead  pierston retreated as quickly as he could he grieved at the incident which had brought such pain to this innocent soul and yet it was beginning to be a source of vague pleasure to him he returned to the house and when his father had come back and welcomed him and they had shared a meal together jocelyn again went out full of an earnest desire to soothe his young neighbours sorrow in a way she little expected though to tell the truth his affection for her was rather that of a friend than of a lover and he felt by no means sure that the migratory elusive idealization he called his love who ever since his boyhood had flitted from human shell to human shell an indefinite number of times was going to take up her abode in the body of avice caro     1 ii the incarnation is assumed to be true  it was difficult to meet her again even though on this lump of rock the difficulty lay as a rule rather in avoidance than in meeting but avice had been transformed into a very different kind of young woman by the selfconsciousness engendered of her impulsive greeting and notwithstanding their near neighbourhood he could not encounter her try as he would no sooner did he appear an inch beyond his fathers door than she was to earth like a fox she bolted upstairs to her room  anxious to soothe her after his unintentional slight he could not stand these evasions long the manners of the isle were primitive and straightforward even among the welltodo and noting her disappearance one day he followed her into the house and onward to the foot of the stairs  avice he called  yes mr pierston  why do you run upstairs like that  ohonly because i wanted to come up for something  well if youve got it cant you come down again  no i cant very well  come dear avice thats what you are you know  there was no response  well if you wont you wont he continued i dont want to bother you and pierston went away  he was stopping to look at the oldfashioned flowers under the garden walls when he heard a voice behind him  mr pierstoni wasnt angry with you when you were gone i thoughtyou might mistake me and i felt i could do no less than come and assure you of my friendship still  turning he saw the blushing avice immediately behind him  you are a good dear girl said he and seizing her hand set upon her cheek the kind of kiss that should have been the response to hers on the day of his coming  darling avice forgive me for the slight that day say you do come now and then ill say to you what i have never said to any other woman living or dead will you have me as your husband  ahmother says i am only one of many  you are not dear you knew me when i was young and others didnt  somehow or other her objections were got over and though she did not give an immediate assent she agreed to meet him later in the afternoon when she walked with him to the southern point of the island called the beal or by strangers the bill pausing over the treacherous cavern known as cave hole into which the sea roared and splashed now as it had done when they visited it together as children to steady herself while looking in he offered her his arm and she took it for the first time as a woman for the hundredth time as his companion  they rambled on to the lighthouse where they would have lingered longer if avice had not suddenly remembered an engagement to recite poetry from a platform that very evening at the street of wells the village commanding the entrance to the islandthe village that has now advanced to be a town  recite said he whod have thought anybody or anything could recite down here except the reciter we hear away therethe never speechless sea  o but we are quite intellectual now in the winter particularly but jocelyndont come to the recitation will you it would spoil my performance if you were there and i want to be as good as the rest  i wont if you really wish me not to but i shall meet you at the door and bring you home  yes she said looking up into his face avice was perfectly happy now she could never have believed on that mortifying day of his coming that she would be so happy with him when they reached the east side of the isle they parted that she might be soon enough to take her place on the platform pierston went home and after dark when it was about the hour for accompanying her back he went along the middle road northward to the street of wells  he was full of misgiving he had known avice caro so well of old that his feeling for her now was rather comradeship than love and what he had said to her in a moment of impulse that morning rather appalled him in its consequences not that any of the more sophisticated and accomplished women who had attracted him successively would be likely to rise inconveniently between them for he had quite disabused his mind of the assumption that the idol of his fancy was an integral part of the personality in which it had sojourned for a long or a short while                                              to his wellbeloved he had always been faithful but she had had many embodiments each individuality known as lucy jane flora evangeline or whatnot had been merely a transient condition of her he did not recognize this as an excuse or as a defence but as a fact simply essentially she was perhaps of no tangible substance a spirit a dream a frenzy a conception an aroma an epitomized sex a light of the eye a parting of the lips god only knew what she really was pierston did not she was indescribable  never much considering that she was a subjective phenomenon vivified by the weird influences of his descent and birthplace the discovery of her ghostliness of her independence of physical laws and failings had occasionally given him a sense of fear he never knew where she next would be whither she would lead him having herself instant access to all ranks and classes to every abode of men sometimes at night he dreamt that she was the wileweaving daughter of high zeus in person bent on tormenting him for his sins against her beauty in his artthe implacable aphrodite herself indeed he knew that he loved the masquerading creature wherever he found her whether with blue eyes black eyes or brown whether presenting herself as tall fragile or plump she was never in two places at once but hitherto she had never been in one place long  by making this clear to his mind some time before today he had escaped a good deal of ugly selfreproach it was simply that she who always attracted him and led him whither she would as by a silken thread had not remained the occupant of the same fleshly tabernacle in her career so far whether she would ultimately settle down to one he could not say  had he felt that she was becoming manifest in avice he would have tried to believe that this was the terminal spot of her migrations and have been content to abide by his words but did he see the wellbeloved in avice at all the question was somewhat disturbing  he had reached the brow of the hill and descended towards the village where in the long straight roman street he soon found the lighted hall the performance was not yet over and by going round to the side of the building and standing on a mound he could see the interior as far down as the platform level avices turn or second turn came on almost immediately her pretty embarrassment on facing the audience rather won him away from his doubts she was in truth what is called a nice girl attractive certainly but above all things niceone of the class with whom the risks of matrimony approximate most nearly to zero her intelligent eyes her broad forehead her thoughtful carriage ensured one thing that of all the girls he had known he had never met one with more charming and solid qualities than avice caros this was not a mere conjecturehe had known her long and thoroughly her every mood and temper  a heavy wagon passing without drowned her small soft voice for him but the audience were pleased and she blushed at their applause he now took his station at the door and when the people had done pouring out he found her within awaiting him  they climbed homeward slowly by the old road pierston dragging himself up the steep by the wayside handrail and pulling avice after him upon his arm at the top they turned and stood still to the left of them the sky was streaked like a fan with the lighthouse rays and under their front at periods of a quarter of a minute there arose a deep hollow stroke like the single beat of a drum the intervals being filled with a longdrawn rattling as of bones between huge canine jaws it came from the vast concave of deadmans bay rising and falling against the pebble dyke  the evening and night winds here were to pierstons mind charged with a something that did not burden them elsewhere they brought it up from that sinister bay to the west whose movement she and he were hearing now it was a presencean imaginary shape or essence from the human multitude lying below those who had gone down in vessels of war east indiamen barges brigs and ships of the armadaselect people common and debased whose interests and hopes had been as wide asunder as the poles but who had rolled each other to oneness on that restless seabed there could almost be felt the brush of their huge composite ghost as it ran a shapeless figure over the isle shrieking for some good god who would disunite it again  the twain wandered a long way that night amid these influencesso far as to the old hope churchyard which lay in a ravine formed by a landslip ages ago the church had slipped down with the rest of the cliff and had long been a ruin it seemed to say that in this last local stronghold of the pagan divinities where pagan customs lingered yet christianity had established itself precariously at best in that solemn spot pierston kissed her  the kiss was by no means on avices initiative this time her former demonstrativeness seemed to have increased her present reserve                                              that day was the beginning of a pleasant month passed mainly in each others society he found that she could not only recite poetry at intellectual gatherings but play the piano fairly and sing to her own accompaniment  he observed that every aim of those who had brought her up had been to get her away mentally as far as possible from her natural and individual life as an inhabitant of a peculiar island to make her an exact copy of tens of thousands of other people in whose circumstances there was nothing special distinctive or picturesque to teach her to forget all the experiences of her ancestors to drown the local ballads by songs purchased at the budmouth fashionable musicsellers and the local vocabulary by a governesstongue of no country at all she lived in a house that would have been the fortune of an artist and learnt to draw london suburban villas from printed copies  avice had seen all this before he pointed it out but with a girls tractability had acquiesced by constitution she was local to the bone but she could not escape the tendency of the age  the time for jocelyns departure drew near and she looked forward to it sadly but serenely their engagement being now a settled thing pierston thought of the native custom on such occasions which had prevailed in his and her family for centuries both being of the old stock of the isle the influx of kimberlins or foreigners as strangers from the mainland of wessex were called had led in a large measure to its discontinuance but underneath the veneer of avices education many an oldfashioned idea lay slumbering and he wondered if in her natural melancholy at his leaving she regretted the changing manners which made unpopular the formal ratification of a betrothal according to the precedent of their sires and grandsires     1 iii the appointment  well said he here we are arrived at the fagend of my holiday what a pleasant surprise my old home which i have not thought worth coming to see for three or four years had in store for me  you must go tomorrow she asked uneasily  yes  something seemed to overweigh them something more than the natural sadness of a parting which was not to be long and he decided that instead of leaving in the daytime as he had intended he would defer his departure till night and go by the mailtrain from budmouth this would give him time to look into his fathers quarries and enable her if she chose to walk with him along the beach as far as to henry the eighths castle above the sands where they could linger and watch the moon rise over the sea she said she thought she could come  so after spending the next day with his father in the quarries jocelyn prepared to leave and at the time appointed set out from the stone house of his birth in this stone isle to walk to budmouthregis by the path along the beach avice having some time earlier gone down to see some friends in the street of wells which was halfway towards the spot of their tryst the descent soon brought him to the pebble bank and leaving behind him the last houses of the isle and the ruins of the village destroyed by the november gale of 1824 he struck out along the narrow thread of land when he had walked a hundred yards he stopped turned aside to the pebble ridge which walled out the sea and sat down to wait for her  between him and the lights of the ships riding at anchor in the roadstead two men passed slowly in the direction he intended to pursue one of them recognized jocelyn and bade him goodnight adding wish you joy sir of your choice and hope the wedden will be soon  thank you seaborn wellwe shall see what christmas will do towards bringing it about  my wife opened upon it this mornen please god ill up and see that there wedden says she knowing em both from their crawling days  the men moved on and when they were out of pierstons hearing the one who had not spoken said to his friend who was that young kimberlin he dont seem one o we  oh he is though every inch o en hes mr jocelyn pierston the stwonemerchants only son up at east quarriers hes to be married to a stylish young body her mother a widow woman carries on the same business as well as she can but their trade is not a twentieth part of pierstons hes worth thousands and thousands they say though a do live on in the same wold way up in the same wold house this son is doen great things in london as a imagecarver and i can mind when as a boy a first took to carving soldiers out o bits o stwone from the softbed of his fathers quarries and then a made a set o stwonen chessmen and so a got on hes quite the gent in london they tell me and the wonder is that a cared to come back here and pick up little avice caronice maid as she is notwithstanding hullo theres to be a change in the weather soon  meanwhile the subject of their remarks waited at the appointed place till seven oclock the hour named between himself and his affianced had struck almost at the moment he saw a figure coming forward from the last lamp at the bottom of the hill but the figure speedily resolved itself into that of a boy who advancing to jocelyn inquired if he were mr pierston and handed him a note     1 iv a lonely pedestrian  when the boy had gone jocelyn retraced his steps to the last lamp and read in avices hand  my dearesti shall be sorry if i grieve you at all in what i am going to say about our arrangement to meet tonight in the sandsfoot ruin but i have fancied that my seeing you again and again lately is inclining your father to insist and you as his heir to feel that we ought to carry out island custom in our courtingyour people being such old inhabitants in an unbroken line truth to say mother supposes that your father for natural reasons may have hinted to you that we ought now the thing is contrary to my feelings it is nearly left off and i do not think it good even where there is property as in your case to justify it in a measure i would rather trust in providence  on the whole therefore it is best that i should not comeif only for appearancesand meet you at a time and place suggesting the custom to others than ourselves at least if known  i am sure that this decision will not disturb you much that you will understand my modern feelings and think no worse of me for them and dear if it were to be done and we were unfortunate in it we might both have enough old family feeling to think like our forefathers and possibly your father that we could not marry honourably and hence we might be made unhappy  however you will come again shortly will you not dear jocelynand then the time will soon draw on when no more goodbyes will be requiredalways and ever yours  avice  jocelyn having read the letter was surprised at the naivete it showed and at avice and her mothers antiquated simplicity in supposing that to be still a grave and operating principle which was a bygone barbarism to himself and other absentees from the island his father as a moneymaker might have practical wishes on the matter of descendants which lent plausibility to the conjecture of avice and her mother but to jocelyn he had never expressed himself in favour of the ancient ways oldfashioned as he was  amused therefore at her regard of herself as modern jocelyn was disappointed and a little vexed that such an unforeseen reason should have deprived him of her company how the old ideas survived under the new education  the reader is asked to remember that the date though recent in the history of the isle of slingers was more than forty years ago                                              finding that the evening seemed louring yet indisposed to go back and hire a vehicle he went on quickly alone in such an exposed spot the night wind was gusty and the sea behind the pebble barrier kicked and flounced in complex rhythms which could be translated equally well as shocks of battle or shouts of thanksgiving  presently on the pale road before him he discerned a figure the figure of a woman he remembered that a woman passed him while he was reading avices letter by the last lamp and now he was overtaking her  he did hope for a moment that it might be avice with a changed mind but it was not she nor anybody like her it was a taller squarer form than that of his betrothed and although the season was only autumn she was wrapped in furs or in thick and heavy clothing of some kind  he soon advanced abreast of her and could get glimpses of her profile against the roadstead lights it was dignified arresting that of a very juno nothing more classical had he ever seen she walked at a swinging pace yet with such ease and power that there was but little difference in their rate of speed for several minutes and during this time he regarded and conjectured however he was about to pass her by when she suddenly turned and addressed him  mr pierston i think of east quarriers  he assented and could just discern what a handsome commanding imperious face it wasquite of a piece with the proud tones of her voice she was a new type altogether in his experience and her accent was not so local as avices  can you tell me the time please  he looked at his watch by the aid of a light and in telling her that it was a quarter past seven observed by the momentary gleam of his match that her eyes looked a little red and chafed as if with weeping  mr pierston will you forgive what will appear very strange to you i dare say that is may i ask you to lend me some money for a day or two i have been so foolish as to leave my purse on the dressingtable  it did appear strange and yet there were features in the young ladys personality which assured him in a moment that she was not an impostor he yielded to her request and put his hand in his pocket here it remained for a moment how much did she mean by the words some money the junonian quality of her form and manner made him throw himself by an impulse into harmony with her and he responded regally he scented a romance he handed her five pounds  his munificence caused her no apparent surprise it is quite enough thank you she remarked quietly as he announced the sum lest she should be unable to see it for herself  while overtaking and conversing with her he had not observed that the rising wind which had proceeded from puffing to growling and from growling to screeching with the accustomed suddenness of its changes here had at length brought what it promised by these vagariesrain the drops which had at first hit their left cheeks like the pellets of a popgun soon assumed the character of a raking fusillade from the bank adjoining one shot of which was sufficiently smart to go through jocelyns sleeve the tall girl turned and seemed to be somewhat concerned at an onset which she had plainly not foreseen before her starting  we must take shelter said jocelyn  but where said she  to windward was the long monotonous bank too obtusely piled to afford a screen over which they could hear the canine crunching of pebbles by the sea without on their right stretched the inner bay or roadstead the distant ridinglights of the ships now dim and glimmering behind them a faint spark here and there in the lower sky showed where the island rose before there was nothing definite and could be nothing till they reached a precarious wood bridge a mile further on henry the eighths castle being a little further still  but just within the summit of the bank whither it had apparently been hauled to be out of the way of the waves was one of the local boats called lerrets bottom upwards as soon as they saw it the pair ran up the pebbly slope towards it by a simultaneous impulse they then perceived that it had lain there a long time and were comforted to find it capable of affording more protection than anybody would have expected from a distant view it formed a shelter or store for the fishermen the bottom of the lerret being tarred as a roof by creeping under the bows which overhung the bank on props to leeward they made their way within where upon some thwarts oars and other fragmentary woodwork lay a mass of dry nettinga whole sein upon this they scrambled and sat down through inability to stand upright     1 v a charge  the rain fell upon the keel of the old lerret like corn thrown in handfuls by some colossal sower and darkness set in to its full shade  they crouched so close to each other that he could feel her furs against him neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said with attempted unconcern this is unfortunate  he admitted that it was and found after a few further remarks had passed that she certainly had been weeping there being a suppressed gasp of passionateness in her utterance now and then  it is more unfortunate for you perhaps than for me he said and i am very sorry that it should be so  she replied nothing to this and he added that it was rather a desolate place for a woman alone and afoot he hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time  at first she seemed not at all disposed to show any candour on her own affairs and he was left to conjecture as to her history and name and how she could possibly have known him but as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation he observed i think we shall have to go back  never said she and the firmness with which she closed her lips was audible in the word  why not he inquired  there are good reasons  i cannot understand how you should know me while i have no knowledge of you  oh but you know meabout me at least  indeed i dont how should i you are a kimberlin  i am not i am a real islanderor was rather havent you heard of the bestbed stone company  i should think so they tried to ruin my father by getting away his tradeor at least the founder of the company didold bencomb  hes my father  indeed i am sorry i should have spoken so disrespectfully of him for i never knew him personally after making over his large business to the company he retired i believe to london  yes our house or rather his not mine is at south kensington we have lived there for years but we have been tenants of sylvania castle on the island here this season we took it for a month or two of the owner who is away  then i have been staying quite near you miss bencomb my fathers is a comparatively humble residence hard by  but he could afford a much bigger one if he chose  you have heard so i dont know he doesnt tell me much of his affairs  my father she burst out suddenly is always scolding me for my extravagance and he has been doing it today more than ever he said i go shopping in town to simply a diabolical extent and exceed my allowance  was that this evening  yes and then it reached such a storm of passion between us that i pretended to retire to my room for the rest of the evening but i slipped out and i am never going back home again  what will you do  i shall go first to my aunt in london and if she wont have me ill work for a living i have left my father for ever what i should have done if i had not met you i cannot telli must have walked all the way to london i suppose now i shall take the train as soon as i reach the mainland  if you ever do in this hurricane  i must sit here till it stops  and there on the nets they sat pierston knew of old bencomb as his fathers bitterest enemy who had made a great fortune by swallowing up the small stonemerchants but had found jocelyns sire a trifle too big to digestthe latter being in fact the chief rival of the bestbed company to that day jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the montagues to this daughter of the capulets  as they talked there was a mutual instinct to drop their voices and on this account the roar of the storm necessitated their drawing quite close together something tender came into their tones as quarterhour after quarterhour went on and they forgot the lapse of time it was quite late when she started up alarmed at her position  rain or no rain i can stay no longer she said  do come back said he taking her hand ill return with you my train has gone  no i shall go on and get a lodging in budmouth town if ever i reach it  it is so late that there will be no house open except a little place near the station where you wont care to stay however if you are determined i will show you the way i cannot leave you it would be too awkward for you to go there alone  she persisted and they started through the twanging and spinning storm the sea rolled and rose so high on their left and was so near them on their right that it seemed as if they were traversing its bottom like the children of israel nothing but the frail bank of pebbles divided them from the raging gulf without and at every bang of the tide against it the ground shook the shingle clashed the spray rose vertically and was blown over their heads quantities of seawater trickled through the pebble wall and ran in rivulets across their path to join the sea within the island was an island still  they had not realized the force of the elements till now pedestrians had often been blown into the sea hereabout and drowned owing to a sudden breach in the bank which however had something of a supernatural power in being able to close up and join itself together again after such disruption like satans form when cut in two by the sword of michael                  the ethereal substance closed      not long divisible   her clothing offered more resistance to the wind than his and she was consequently in the greater danger it was impossible to refuse his proffered aid first he gave his arm but the wind tore them apart as easily as coupled cherries he steadied her bodily by encircling her waist with his arm and she made no objection                                              somewhere about this timeit might have been sooner it might have been laterhe became conscious of a sensation which in its incipient and unrecognized form had lurked within him from some unnoticed moment when he was sitting close to his new friend under the lerret though a young man he was too old a hand not to know what this was and felt alarmedeven dismayed it meant a possible migration of the wellbeloved the thing had not however taken place and he went on thinking how soft and warm the lady was in her fur covering as he held her so tightly the only dry spots in the clothing of either being her left side and his right where they excluded the rain by their mutual pressure  as soon as they had crossed the ferrybridge there was a little more shelter but he did not relinquish his hold till she requested him they passed the ruined castle and having left the island far behind them trod mile after mile till they drew near to the outskirts of the neighbouring wateringplace into it they plodded without pause crossing the harbour bridge about midnight wet to the skin  he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination the houses facing the bay now sheltered them completely and they reached the vicinity of the new railway terminus which the station was at this date without difficulty as he had said there was only one house open hereabout a little temperance inn where the people stayed up for the arrival of the morning mail and passengers from the channel boats their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage  he could see now that though she was such a fine figure quite as tall as himself she was but in the bloom of young womanhood her face was certainly striking though rather by its imperiousness than its beauty and the beating of the wind and rain and spray had inflamed her cheeks to peony hues  she persisted in the determination to go on to london by an early morning train and he therefore offered advice on lesser matters only in that case he said you must go up to your room and send down your things that they may be dried by the fire immediately or they will not be ready i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something to eat  she assented to his proposal without however showing any marks of gratitude and when she had gone pierston despatched her the light supper promised by the sleepy girl who was night porter at this establishment he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time  at first he was in doubt what to do but soon decided to stay where he was till the morrow by the aid of some temporary wraps and some slippers from the cupboard he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maidservant came downstairs with a damp armful of womans raiment  pierston withdrew from the fire the maidservant knelt down before the blaze and held up with extended arms one of the habiliments of the juno upstairs from which a cloud of steam began to rise as she knelt the girl nodded forward recovered herself and nodded again  you are sleepy my girl said pierston  yes sir i have been up a long time when nobody comes i lie down on the couch in the other room  then ill relieve you of that go and lie down in the other room just as if we were not here ill dry the clothing and put the articles here in a heap which you can take up to the young lady in the morning  the night porter thanked him and left the room and he soon heard her snoring from the adjoining apartment then jocelyn opened proceedings overhauling the robes and extending them one by one as the steam went up he fell into a reverie he again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk the wellbeloved was moving househad gone over to the wearer of this attire  in the course of ten minutes he adored her  and how about little avice caro he did not think of her as before  he was not sure that he had ever seen the real beloved in that friend of his youth solicitous as he was for her welfare but loving her or not he perceived that the spirit emanation idealism which called itself his love was flitting stealthily from some remoter figure to the near one in the chamber overhead  avice had not kept her engagement to meet him in the lonely ruin fearing her own imaginings but he in fact more than she had been educated out of the island innocence that had upheld old manners and this was the strange consequence of avices misapprehension     1 vi on the brink  miss bencomb was leaving the hotel for the railway which was quite near at hand and had only recently been opened as if on purpose for this event at jocelyns suggestion she wrote a message to inform her father that she had gone to her aunts with a view to allaying anxiety and deterring pursuit they walked together to the platform and bade each other goodbye each obtained a ticket independently and jocelyn got his luggage from the cloakroom  on the platform they encountered each other again and there was a light in their glances at each other which said as by a flashtelegraph we are bound for the same town why not enter the same compartment  they did  she took a corner seat with her back to the engine he sat opposite the guard looked in thought they were lovers and did not show other travellers into that compartment they talked on strictly ordinary matters what she thought he did not know but at every stopping station he dreaded intrusion before they were halfway to london the event he had just begun to realize was a patent fact the beloved was again embodied she filled every fibre and curve of this womans form  drawing near the great london station was like drawing near doomsday how should he leave her in the turmoil of a crowded city street she seemed quite unprepared for the rattle of the scene he asked her where her aunt lived  bayswater said miss bencomb  he called a cab and proposed that she should share it till they arrived at her aunts whose residence lay not much out of the way to his own try as he would he could not ascertain if she understood his feelings but she assented to his offer and entered the vehicle  we are old friends he said as they drove onward  indeed we are she answered without smiling  but hereditarily we are mortal enemies dear juliet  yeswhat did you say  i said juliet  she laughed in a halfproud way and murmured your father is my fathers enemy and my father is mine yes it is so and then their eyes caught each others glance my queenly darling he burst out instead of going to your aunts will you come and marry me  a flush covered her over which seemed akin to a flush of rage it was not exactly that but she was excited she did not answer and he feared he had mortally offended her dignity perhaps she had only made use of him as a convenient aid to her intentions however he went on your father would not be able to reclaim you then after all this is not so precipitate as it seems you know all about me my history my prospects i know all about you our families have been neighbours on that isle for hundreds of years though you are now such a london product  will you ever be a royal academician she asked musingly her excitement having calmed down  i hope to bei will be if you will be my wife  his companion looked at him long  think what a short way out of your difficulty this would be he continued no bother about aunts no fetching home by an angry father  it seemed to decide her she yielded to his embrace  how long will it take to marry miss bencomb asked byandby with obvious selfrepression  we could do it tomorrow i could get to doctors commons by noon today and the licence would be ready by tomorrow morning  i wont go to my aunts i will be an independent woman i have been reprimanded as if i were a child of six ill be your wife if it is as easy as you say  they stopped the cab while they held a consultation pierston had rooms and a studio in the neighbourhood of campden hill but it would be hardly desirable to take her thither till they were married they decided to go to an hotel  changing their direction therefore they went back to the strand and soon ensconced themselves in one of the venerable old taverns of covent garden a precinct which in those days was frequented by westcountry people jocelyn then left her and proceeded on his errand eastward  it was about three oclock when having arranged all preliminaries necessitated by this sudden change of front he began strolling slowly back he felt bewildered and to walk was a relief gazing occasionally into this shop window and that he called a hansom as by an inspiration and directed the driver to mellstock gardens arrived here he rang the bell of a studio and in a minute or two it was answered by a young man in shirtsleeves about his own age with a great smeared palette on his left thumb  o you pierston i thought you were in the country come in im awfully glad of this i am here in town finishing off a painting for an american who wants to take it back with him  pierston followed his friend into the paintingroom where a pretty young woman was sitting sewing at a signal from the painter she disappeared without speaking  i can see from your face you have something to say so well have it all to ourselves you are in some trouble whatll you drink  oh it doesnt matter what so that it is alcohol in some shape or form now somers you must just listen to me for i have something to tell  pierston had sat down in an armchair and somers had resumed his painting when a servant had brought in brandy to soothe pierstons nerves and soda to take off the injurious effects of the brandy and milk to take off the depleting effects of the soda jocelyn began his narrative addressing it rather to somerss gothic chimneypiece and somerss gothic clock and somerss gothic rugs than to somers himself who stood at his picture a little behind his friend  before i tell you what has happened to me pierston said i want to let you know the manner of man i am  lordi know already  no you dont it is a sort of thing one doesnt like to talk of i lie awake at night thinking about it  no said somers with more sympathy seeing that his friend was really troubled  i am under a curious curse or influence i am posed puzzled and perplexed by the legerdemain of a creaturea deity rather by aphrodite as a poet would put it as i should put it myself in marble  but i forgetthis is not to be a deprecatory wail but a defencea sort of apologia pro vita mea  thats better fire away     1 vii her earlier incarnations  you somers are not i know one of those who continue to indulge in the worldwide fond superstition that the beloved one of any man always or even usually cares to remain in one corporeal nook or shell for any great length of time however much he may wish her to do so if i am wrong and you do still hold to that ancient errorwell my story will seem rather queer  suppose you say the beloved of some men not of any man  all rightill say one man this man only if you are so particular we are a strange visionary race down where i come from and perhaps that accounts for it the beloved of this one man then has had many incarnationstoo many to describe in detail each shape or embodiment has been a temporary residence only which she has entered lived in awhile and made her exit from leaving the substance so far as i have been concerned a corpse worse luck now there is no spiritualistic nonsense in thisit is simple fact put in the plain form that the conventional public are afraid of so much for the principle  good go on  well the first embodiment of her occurred so nearly as i can recollect when i was about the age of nine her vehicle was a little blueeyed girl of eight or so one of a family of eleven with flaxen hair about her shoulders which attempted to curl but ignominiously failed hanging like chimneycrooks only this defect used rather to trouble me and was i believe one of the main reasons of my beloveds departure from that tenement i cannot remember with any exactness when the departure occurred i know it was after i had kissed my little friend in a gardenseat on a hot noontide under a blue gingham umbrella which we had opened over us as we sat that passers through east quarriers might not observe our marks of affection forgetting that our screen must attract more attention than our persons  when the whole dream came to an end through her father leaving the island i thought my wellbeloved had gone for ever being then in the unpractised condition of adam at sight of the first sunset but she had not laura had gone for ever but not my beloved  for some months after i had done crying for the flaxenhaired edition of her my love did not reappear then she came suddenly unexpectedly in a situation i should never have predicted i was standing on the kerbstone of the pavement in budmouthregis outside the preparatory school looking across towards the sea when a middleaged gentleman on horseback and beside him a young lady also mounted passed down the street the girl turned her head andpossibly because i was gaping at her in awkward admiration or smiling myselfsmiled at me having ridden a few paces she looked round again and smiled  it was enough more than enough to set me on fire i understood in a moment the information conveyed to me by my emotionthe wellbeloved had reappeared this second form in which it had pleased her to take up her abode was quite a grown young womans darker in complexion than the first her hair also worn in a knot was of an ordinary brown and so i think were her eyes but the niceties of her features were not to be gathered so cursorily however there sat my coveted one reembodied and bidding my schoolmates a hasty farewell as soon as i could do so without suspicion i hurried along the esplanade in the direction she and her father had ridden but they had put their horses to a canter and i could not see which way they had gone in the greatest misery i turned down a side street but was soon elevated to a state of excitement by seeing the same pair galloping towards me flushing up to my hair i stopped and heroically faced her as she passed she smiled again but alas upon my loves cheek there was no blush of passion for me  pierston paused and drank from his glass as he lived for a brief moment in the scene he had conjured up somers reserved his comments and jocelyn continued  that afternoon i idled about the streets looking for her in vain when i next saw one of the boys who had been with me at her first passing i stealthily reminded him of the incident and asked if he knew the riders  o yes he said that was colonel targe and his daughter elsie  how old do you think she is said i a sense of disparity in our ages disturbing my mind  onineteen i think they say shes going to be married the day after tomorrow to captain popp of the 501st and they are ordered off to india at once  the grief which i experienced at this intelligence was such that at dusk i went away to the edge of the harbour intending to put an end to myself there and then but i had been told that crabs had been found clinging to the dead faces of persons who had fallen in thereabout leisurely eating them and the idea of such an unpleasant contingency deterred me i should state that the marriage of my beloved concerned me little it was her departure that broke my heart i never saw her again  though i had already learnt that the absence of the corporeal matter did not involve the absence of the informing spirit i could scarce bring myself to believe that in this case it was possible for her to return to my view without the form she had last inhabited  but she did  it was not however till after a good space of time during which i passed through that bearish age in boys their early teens when girls are their especial contempt i was about seventeen and was sitting one evening over a cup of tea in a confectioners at the very same wateringplace when opposite me a lady took her seat with a little girl we looked at each other awhile the child made advances till i said shes a good little thing  the lady assented and made a further remark  she has the soft fine eyes of her mother said i  do you think her eyes are good asks the lady as if she had not heard what she had heard mostthe last three words of my opinion  yesfor copies said i regarding her  after this we got on very well she informed me that her husband had gone out in a yacht and i said it was a pity he didnt take her with him for the airing she gradually disclosed herself in the character of a deserted young wife and later on i met her in the street without the child she was going to the landingstage to meet her husband so she told me but she did not know the way  i offered to show her and did so i will not go into particulars but i afterwards saw her several times and soon discovered that the beloved as to whose whereabouts i had been at fault so long lurked here though why she had chosen this tantalizing situation of an inaccessible matrons form when so many others offered it was beyond me to discover the whole affair ended innocently enough when the lady left the town with her husband and child she seemed to regard our acquaintance as a flirtation yet it was anything but a flirtation for me                                              why should i tell the rest of the tantalizing tale after this the wellbeloved put herself in evidence with greater and greater frequency and it would be impossible for me to give you details of her various incarnations she came nine times in the course of the two or three ensuing years four times she masqueraded as a brunette twice as a palehaired creature and two or three times under a complexion neither light nor dark sometimes she was a tall fine girl but more often i think she preferred to slip into the skin of a lithe airy being of no great stature i grew so accustomed to these exits and entrances that i resigned myself to them quite passively talked to her kissed her corresponded with her ached for her in each of her several guises so it went on until a month ago and then for the first time i was puzzled she either had or she had not entered the person of avice caro a young girl i had known from infancy upon the whole i have decided that after all she did not enter the form of avice caro because i retain so great a respect for her still  pierston here gave in brief the history of his revived comradeship with avice the verge of the engagement to which they had reached and its unexpected rupture by him merely through his meeting with a woman into whom the wellbeloved unmistakably moved under his very eyesby name miss marcia bencomb he described their spontaneous decision to marry offhand and then he put it to somers whether he ought to marry or nother or anybody elsein such circumstances  certainly not said somers though if anybody little avice but not even her you are like other men only rather worse essentially all men are fickle like you but not with such perceptiveness  surely fickle is not the word fickleness means getting weary of a thing while the thing remains the same but i have always been faithful to the elusive creature whom i have never been able to get a firm hold of unless i have done so now and let me tell you that her flitting from each to each individual has been anything but a pleasure for mecertainly not a wanton game of my instigation to see the creature who has hitherto been perfect divine lose under your very gaze the divinity which has informed her grow commonplace turn from flame to ashes from a radiant vitality to a relic is anything but a pleasure for any man and has been nothing less than a racking spectacle to my sight each mournful emptied shape stands ever after like the nest of some beautiful bird from which the inhabitant has departed and left it to fill with snow i have been absolutely miserable when i have looked in a face for her i used to see there and could see her there no more  you ought not to marry repeated somers  perhaps i oughtnt to though poor marcia will be compromised im afraid if i dont was i not right in saying i am accursed in this thing fortunately nobody but myself has suffered on account of it till now knowing what to expect i have seldom ventured on a close acquaintance with any woman in fear of prematurely driving away the dear one in her who however has in time gone off just the same  pierston soon after took his leave a friends advice on such a subject weighs little he quickly returned to miss bencomb  she was different now anxiety had visibly brought her down a notch or two undone a few degrees of that haughty curl which her lip could occasionally assume how long you have been away she said with a show of impatience  never mind darling it is all arranged said he we shall be able to marry in a few days  not tomorrow  we cant tomorrow we have not been here quite long enough  but how did the people at doctors commons know that  welli forgot that residence real or assumed was necessary and unfortunately admitted that we had only just arrived  o how stupid but it cant be helped now i think dear i should have known better however     1 viii too like the lightning  they lived on at the hotel some days longer eyed curiously by the chambermaids and burst in upon every now and then by the waiters as if accidentally when they were walking together mostly in back streets for fear of being recognized marcia was often silent and her imperious face looked gloomy  dummy he said playfully on one of these occasions  i am vexed that by your admissions at doctors commons you prevented them giving you the licence at once it is not nice my living on with you like this  but we are going to marry dear  yes she murmured and fell into reverie again what a sudden resolve it was of ours she continued i wish i could get my father and mothers consent to our marriage as we cant complete it for another day or two a letter might be sent to them and their answer received i have a mind to write  pierston expressed his doubts of the wisdom of this course which seemed to make her desire it the more and the result was a tiff between them since we are obliged to delay it i wont marry without their consent she cried at last passionately  very well then dear write he said  when they were again indoors she sat down to a note but after a while threw aside her pen despairingly no i cannot do it she said i cant bend my pride to such a job will you write for me jocelyn  i i dont see why i should be the one particularly as i think it premature  but you have not quarrelled with my father as i have done  well no but there is a longstanding antagonism which would make it odd in me to be the writer wait till we are married and then i will write not till then  then i suppose i must you dont know my father he might forgive me marrying into any other family without his knowledge but he thinks yours such a mean one and so resents the trade rivalry that he would never pardon till the day of his death my becoming a pierston secretly i didnt see it at first  this remark caused an unpleasant jar on the mind of pierston despite his independent artistic position in london he was staunch to the simple old parent who had stubbornly held out for so many years against bencombs encroaching trade and whose money had educated and maintained jocelyn as an artstudent in the best schools so he begged her to say no more about his mean family and she silently resumed her letter giving an address at a postoffice that their quarters might not be discovered at least just yet  no reply came by return of post but rather ominously some letters for marcia that had arrived at her fathers since her departure were sent on in silence to the address given she opened them one by one till on reading the last she exclaimed good gracious and burst into laughter  what is it asked pierston  marcia began to read the letter aloud it came from a faithful lover of hers a youthful jersey gentleman who stated that he was soon going to start for england to claim his darling according to her plighted word  she was half risible half concerned what shall i do she said  do my dear girl it seems to me that there is only one thing to do and that a very obvious thing tell him as soon as possible that you are just on the point of marriage  marcia thereupon wrote out a reply to that effect jocelyn helping her to shape the phrases as gently as possible  i repeat her letter concluded that i had quite forgotten i am deeply sorry but that is the truth i have told my intended husband everything and he is looking over my shoulder as i write  said jocelyn when he saw this set down you might leave out the last few words they are rather an extra stab for the poor boy  stab it is not that dear why does he want to come bothering me jocelyn you ought to be very proud that i have put you in my letter at all you said yesterday that i was conceited in declaring i might have married that scienceman i told you of but now you see there was yet another available  he gloomily well i dont care to hear about that to my mind this sort of thing is decidedly unpleasant though you treat it so lightly  well she pouted i have only done half what you have done  whats that  i have only proved false through forgetfulness but you have while remembering  o yes of course you can use avice caro as a retort but dont vex me about her and make me do such an unexpected thing as regret the falseness  she shut her mouth tight and her face flushed  the next morning there did come an answer to the letter asking her parents consent to her union with him but to marcias amazement her father took a line quite other than the one she had expected him to take whether she had compromised herself or whether she had not seemed a question for the future rather than the present with him a native islander born when old island marriage views prevailed in families he was fixed in his disapproval of her marriage with a hated pierston he did not consent he would not say more till he could see her if she had any sense at all she would if still unmarried return to the home from which she had evidently been enticed he would then see what he could do for her in the desperate circumstances she had made for herself otherwise he would do nothing  pierston could not help being sarcastic at her fathers evidently low estimate of him and his belongings and marcia took umbrage at his sarcasms  i am the one deserving of satire if anybody she said i begin to feel i was a foolish girl to run away from a father for such a trumpery reason as a little scolding because i had exceeded my allowance  i advised you to go back marcie  in a sort of way not in the right tone you spoke most contemptuously of my fathers honesty as a merchant  i couldnt speak otherwise of him than i did im afraid knowing what  what have you to say against him  nothingto you marcie beyond what is matter of common notoriety everybody knows that at one time he made it the business of his life to ruin my father and the way he alludes to me in that letter shows that his enmity still continues  that miser ruined by an openhanded man like my father said she it is like your peoples misrepresentations to say that  marcias eyes flashed and her face burnt with an angry heat the enhanced beauty which this warmth might have brought being killed by the rectilinear sternness of countenance that came therewith  marciathis temper is too exasperating i could give you every step of the proceeding in detailanybody couldthe getting the quarries one by one and everything my father only holding his own by the most desperate courage there is no blinking facts our parents relations are an ugly fact in the circumstances of us two people who want to marry and we are just beginning to perceive it and how we are going to get over it i cannot tell  she said steadily i dont think we shall get over it at all  we may notwe may notaltogether pierston murmured as he gazed at the fine picture of scorn presented by his junos classical face and dark eyes  unless you beg my pardon for having behaved so  pierston could not quite bring himself to see that he had behaved badly to his too imperious lady and declined to ask forgiveness for what he had not done  she thereupon left the room later in the day she reentered and broke a silence by saying bitterly i showed temper just now as you told me but things have causes and it is perhaps a mistake that you should have deserted avice for me instead of wedding rosaline romeo must needs go eloping with juliet it was a fortunate thing for the affections of those two veronese lovers that they died when they did in a short time the enmity of their families would have proved a fruitful source of dissension juliet would have gone back to her people he to his the subject would have split them as much as it splits us  pierston laughed a little but marcia was painfully serious as he found at teatime when she said that since his refusal to beg her pardon she had been thinking over the matter and had resolved to go to her aunts after allat any rate till her father could be induced to agree to their union pierston was as chilled by this resolve of hers as he was surprised at her independence in circumstances which usually make women the reverse but he put no obstacles in her way and with a kiss strangely cold after their recent ardour the romeo of the freestone montagues went out of the hotel to avoid even the appearance of coercing his juliet of the rival house when he returned she was gone                                              a correspondence began between these toohastily pledged ones and it was carried on in terms of serious reasoning upon their awkward situation on account of the family feud they saw their recent love as what it was                 too rash too unadvised too sudden       too like the lightning  they saw it with an eye whose calmness coldness and it must be added wisdom did not promise well for their reunion  their debates were clinched by a final letter from marcia sent from no other place than her recently left home in the isle she informed him that her father had appeared suddenly at her aunts and had induced her to go home with him she had told her father all the circumstances of their elopement and what mere accidents had caused it he had persuaded her on what she had almost been convinced of by their disagreement that all thought of their marriage should be at least postponed for the present any awkwardness and even scandal being better than that they should immediately unite themselves for life on the strength of a two or three days resultless passion and be the wretched victims of a situation they could never change  pierston saw plainly enough that he owed it to her father being a born islander with all the ancient island notions of matrimony lying underneath his acquired conventions that the stonemerchant did not immediately insist upon the usual remedy for a daughters precipitancy in such cases but preferred to await issues  but the young man still thought that marcia herself when her temper had quite cooled and she was more conscious of her real position would return to him in spite of the family hostility there was no social reason against such a step in birth the pair were about on one plane and though marcias family had gained a start in the accumulation of wealth and in the beginnings of social distinction which lent colour to the feeling that the advantages of the match would be mainly on one side pierston was a sculptor who might rise to fame so that potentially their marriage could not be considered inauspicious for a woman who beyond being the probable heiress to a considerable fortune had no exceptional opportunities  thus though disillusioned he felt bound in honour to remain on call at his london address as long as there was the slightest chance of marcias reappearance or of the arrival of some message requesting him to join her that they might after all go to the altar together yet in the night he seemed to hear sardonic voices and laughter in the wind at this development of his little romance and during the slow and colourless days he had to sit and behold the mournful departure of his wellbeloved from the form he had lately cherished till she had almost vanished away the exact moment of her complete withdrawal pierston knew not but not many lines of her were longer discernible in marcias remembered contours nor many sounds of her in marcias recalled accents their acquaintance though so fervid had been too brief for such lingering  there came a time when he learnt through a trustworthy channel two pieces of news affecting himself one was the marriage of avice caro with her cousin the other that the bencombs had started on a tour round the world which was to include a visit to a relation of mr bencombs who was a banker in san francisco since retiring from his former large business the stone merchant had not known what to do with his leisure and finding that travel benefited his health he had decided to indulge himself thus although he was not so informed pierston concluded that marcia had discovered that nothing was likely to happen as a consequence of their elopement and that she had accompanied her parents he was more than ever struck with what this signifiedher fathers obstinate antagonism to her union with one of his blood and name     1 ix familiar phenomena in the distance  by degrees pierston began to trace again the customary lines of his existence and his profession occupied him much as of old the next year or two only once brought him tidings through some residents at his former home of the movements of the bencombs the extended voyage of marcias parents had given them quite a zest for other scenes and countries and it was said that her father a man still in vigorous health except at brief intervals was utilizing the outlook which his cosmopolitanism afforded him by investing capital in foreign undertakings what he had supposed turned out to be true marcia was with them no necessity for joining him had arisen and thus the separation of himself and his nearly married wife by common consent was likely to be a permanent one  it seemed as if he would scarce ever again discover the carnate dwellingplace of the haunting minion of his imagination having gone so near to matrimony with marcia as to apply for a licence he had felt for a long while morally bound to her by the incipient contract and would not intentionally look about him in search of the vanished ideality thus during the first year of miss bencombs absence when absolutely bound to keep faith with the elusive ones late incarnation if she should return to claim him this man of the odd fancy would sometimes tremble at the thought of what would become of his solemn intention if the phantom were suddenly to disclose herself in an unexpected quarter and seduce him before he was aware once or twice he imagined that he saw her in the distanceat the end of a street on the far sands of a shore in a window in a meadow at the opposite side of a railway station but he determinedly turned on his heel and walked the other way  during the many uneventful seasons that followed marcias stroke of independence for which he was not without a secret admiration at times jocelyn threw into plastic creations that everbubbling spring of emotion which without some conduit into space will surge upwards and ruin all but the greatest men it was probably owing to this certainly not on account of any care or anxiety for such a result that he was successful in his art successful by a seemingly sudden spurt which carried him at one bound over the hindrances of years  he prospered without effort he was ara  but recognitions of this sort social distinctions which he had once coveted so keenly seemed to have no utility for him now by the accident of being a bachelor he was floating in society without any soulanchorage or shrine that he could call his own and for want of a domestic centre round which honours might crystallize they dispersed impalpably without accumulating and adding weight to his material wellbeing  he would have gone on working with his chisel with just as much zest if his creations had been doomed to meet no mortal eye but his own this indifference to the popular reception of his dreamfigures lent him a curious artistic aplomb that carried him through the gusts of opinion without suffering them to disturb his inherent bias  the study of beauty was his only joy for years onward in the streets he would observe a face or a fraction of a face which seemed to express to a hairsbreadth in mutable flesh what he was at that moment wishing to express in durable shape he would dodge and follow the owner like a detective in omnibus in cab in steamboat through crowds into shops churches theatres publichouses and slumsmostly when at close quarters to be disappointed for his pains  in these professional beautychases he sometimes cast his eye across the thames to the wharves on the south side and to that particular one whereat his fathers tons of freestone were daily landed from the ketches of the south coast he could occasionally discern the white blocks lying there vast cubes so persistently nibbled by his parent from his island rock in the english channel that it seemed as if in time it would be nibbled all away  one thing it passed him to understand on what field of observation the poets and philosophers based their assumption that the passion of love was intensest in youth and burnt lower as maturity advanced it was possibly because of his utter domestic loneliness that during the productive interval which followed the first years of marcias departure when he was drifting along from fiveandtwenty to eightandthirty pierston occasionally loved with an ardourthough it is true also with a selfcontrolunknown to him when he was green in judgment                                              his whimsical islebred fancy had grown to be such an emotion that the wellbelovednow again visiblewas always existing somewhere near him for months he would find her on the stage of a theatre then she would flit away leaving the poor empty carcase that had lodged her to mumm on as best it could without hera sorry lay figure to his eyes heaped with imperfections and sullied with commonplace she would reappear it might be in an at first unnoticed lady met at some fashionable evening party exhibition bazaar or dinner to flit from her in turn after a few months and stand as a graceful shopgirl at some large drapery warehouse into which he had strayed on an unaccustomed errand then she would forsake this figure and redisclose herself in the guise of some popular authoress pianoplayer or fiddleress at whose shrine he would worship for perhaps a twelvemonth once she was a dancinggirl at the royal moorish palace of varieties though during her whole continuance at that establishment he never once exchanged a word with her nor did she first or last ever dream of his existence he knew that a tenminutes conversation in the wings with the substance would send the elusive haunter scurrying fearfully away into some other even less accessible maskfigure  she was a blonde a brunette tall petite svelte straightfeatured full curvilinear only one quality remained unalterable her instability of tenure in bornes phrase nothing was permanent in her but change  it is odd he said to himself that this experience of mine or idiosyncrasy or whatever it is which would be sheer waste of time for other men creates sober business for me for all these dreams he translated into plaster and found that by them he was hitting a public taste he had never deliberately aimed at and mostly despised he was in short in danger of drifting away from a solid artistic reputation to a popularity which might possibly be as brief as it would be brilliant and exciting  you will be caught some day my friend somers would occasionally observe to him i dont mean to say entangled in anything discreditable for i admit that you are in practice as ideal as in theory i mean the process will be reversed some woman whose wellbeloved flits about as yours does now will catch your eye and youll stick to her like a limpet while she follows her phantom and leaves you to ache as you will  you may be right but i think you are wrong said pierston as flesh she dies daily like the apostles corporeal self because when i grapple with the reality shes no longer in it so that i cannot stick to one incarnation if i would  wait till you are older said somers     part second  a young man of forty        since love will needs that i shall love       of very force i must agree       and since no chance may it remove       in wealth and in adversity       i shall alway myself apply       to serve and suffer patiently                                  sir t wyatt     2 i the old phantom becomes distinct  in the course of these long years pierstons artistic emotions were abruptly suspended by the news of his fathers sudden death at sandbourne whither the stonemerchant had gone for a change of air by the advice of his physician  mr pierston senior it must be admitted had been something miserly in his home life as marcia had so rashly reminded his son but he had never stinted jocelyn he had been rather a hard taskmaster though as a paymaster trustworthy a readymoney man just and ungenerous to every ones surprise the capital he had accumulated in the stone trade was of large amount for a business so unostentatiously carried onmuch larger than jocelyn had ever regarded as possible while the son had been modelling and chipping his ephemeral fancies into perennial shapes the father had been persistently chiselling for half a century at the crude original matter of those shapes the stern isolated rock in the channel and by the aid of his cranes and pulleys his trolleys and his boats had sent off his spoil to all parts of great britain when jocelyn had wound up everything and disposed of the business as recommended by his fathers will he found himself enabled to add about eighty thousand pounds to the twelve thousand which he already possessed from professional and other sources  after arranging for the sale of some freehold properties in the island other than quarriesfor he did not intend to reside therehe returned to town he often wondered what had become of marcia he had promised never to trouble her nor for a whole twenty years had he done so though he had often sighed for her as a friend of sterling common sense in practical difficulties  her parents were he believed dead and she he knew had never gone back to the isle possibly she had formed some new tie abroad and had made it next to impossible to discover her by her old name  a reposeful time ensued almost his first entry into society after his fathers death occurred one evening when for want of knowing what better to do he responded to an invitation sent by one of the few ladies of rank whom he numbered among his friends and set out in a cab for the square wherein she lived during three or four months of the year  the hansom turned the corner and he obtained a raking view of the houses along the north side of which hers was one with the familiar linkman at the door there were chinese lanterns too on the balcony he perceived in a moment that the customary small and early reception had resolved itself on this occasion into something very like great and late he remembered that there had just been a political crisis which accounted for the enlargement of the countess of channelcliffes assembly for hers was one of the neutral or nonpolitical houses at which party politics are more freely agitated than at the professedly party gatherings  there was such a string of carriages that pierston did not wait to take his turn at the door but unobtrusively alighted some yards off and walked forward he had to pause a moment behind the wall of spectators which barred his way and as he paused some ladies in white cloaks crossed from their carriages to the door on the carpet laid for the purpose he had not seen their faces nothing of them but vague forms and yet he was suddenly seized with a presentiment its gist was that he might be going to reencounter the wellbeloved that night after her recent long hiding she meant to reappear and intoxicate him that liquid sparkle of her eye that lingual music that turn of the head how well he knew it all despite the many superficial changes and how instantly he would recognize it under whatever complexion contour accent height or carriage that it might choose to masquerade  pierstons other conjecture that the night was to be a lively political one received confirmation as soon as he reached the hall where a simmer of excitement was perceptible as surplus or overflow from above down the staircasea feature which he had always noticed to be present when any climax or sensation had been reached in the world of party and faction  and where have you been keeping yourself so long young man said his hostess archly when he had shaken hands with her pierston was always regarded as a young man though he was now about forty o yes of course i remember she added looking serious in a moment at thought of his loss the countess was a woman with a goodnatured manner verging on that oftclaimed feminine quality humour and was quickly sympathetic  she then began to tell him of a scandal in the political side to which she nominally belonged one that had come out of the present crisis and that as for herself she had sworn to abjure politics for ever on account of it so that he was to regard her forthwith as a more neutral householder than ever by this time some more people had surged upstairs and pierston prepared to move on  you are looking for somebodyi can see that said she  yesa lady said pierston  tell me her name and ill try to think if shes here  i cannot i dont know it he said  indeed what is she like  i cannot describe her not even her complexion or dress  lady channelcliffe looked a pout as if she thought he were teasing her and he moved on in the current the fact was that for a moment pierston fancied he had made the sensational discovery that the one he was in search of lurked in the person of the very hostess he had conversed with who was charming always and particularly charming tonight he was just feeling an incipient consternation at the possibility of such a jades trick in his beloved who had once before chosen to embody herself as a married woman though happily at that time with no serious results however he felt that he had been mistaken and that the fancy had been solely owing to the highly charged electric condition in which he had arrived by reason of his recent isolation  the whole set of rooms formed one great utterance of the opinions of the hour the gods of party were present with their embattled seraphim but the brilliancy of manner and form in the handling of public questions was only less conspicuous than the paucity of original ideas no principles of wise government had place in any mind a blunt and jolly personalism as to the ins and outs animating all but jocelyns interest did not run in this stream he was like a stone in a purling brook waiting for some peculiar floating object to be brought towards him and to stick upon his mental surface  thus looking for the next new version of the fair figure he did not consider at the moment though he had done so at other times that this presentiment of meeting her was of all presentiments just the sort of one to work out its own fulfilment  he looked for her in the knot of persons gathered round a past prime minister who was standing in the middle of the largest room discoursing in the genial almost jovial manner natural to him at these times the two or three ladies forming his audience had been joined by another in black and white and it was on her that pierstons attention was directed as well as the great statesmans whose first sheer gaze at her expressing who are you almost audibly changed into an interested listening look as the few words she spoke were utteredfor the minister differed from many of his standing in being extremely careful not to interrupt a timid speaker giving way in an instant if anybody else began with him nobody knew better than himself that all may learn and his manner was that of an unconceited man who could catch an idea readily even if he could not undertake to create one  the lady told her little storywhatever it was jocelyn could not hear itthe statesman laughed haughhaughhaugh  the lady blushed jocelyn wrought up to a high tension by the aforesaid presentiment that his shelleyan oneshapeofmanynames was about to reappear paid little heed to the others watching for a full view of the lady who had won his attention  that lady remained for the present partially screened by her neighbours a diversion was caused by lady channelcliffe bringing up somebody to present to the exminister the ladies got mixed and jocelyn lost sight of the one whom he was beginning to suspect as the stealthily returned absentee  he looked for her in a kindly young lady of the house his hostesss relation who appeared to more advantage that night than she had ever done beforein a skyblue dress which had nothing between it and the fair skin of her neck lending her an unusually soft and sylphlike aspect she saw him and they converged her look of what do you think of me now was suggested he knew by the thought that the last time they met she had appeared under the disadvantage of mourning clothes on a wet day in a countryhouse where everybody was cross  i have some new photographs and i want you to tell me whether they are good she said mind you are to tell me truly and no favour  she produced the pictures from an adjoining drawer and they sat down together upon an ottoman for the purpose of examination the portraits taken by the last fashionable photographer were very good and he told her so but as he spoke and compared them his mind was fixed on something else than the mere judgment he wondered whether the elusive one were indeed in the frame of this girl  he looked up at her to his surprise her mind too was on other things bent than on the pictures her eyes were glancing away to distant people she was apparently considering the effect she was producing upon them by this cosy teteatete with pierston and upon one in particular a man of thirty of military appearance whom pierston did not know quite convinced now that no phantom belonging to him was contained in the outlines of the present young lady he could coolly survey her as he responded they were both doing the same thingeach was pretending to be deeply interested in what the other was talking about the attention of the two alike flitting away to other corners of the room even when the very point of their discourse was pending  no he had not seen her yet he was not going to see her apparently tonight she was scared away by the twanging political atmosphere but he still moved on searchingly hardly heeding certain spectral imps other than aphroditean who always haunted these places and jeeringly pointed out that under the white hair of this or that ribanded old man with a forehead grown wrinkled over treaties which had swayed the fortunes of europe with a voice which had numbered sovereigns among its respectful listeners might be a heart that would go inside a nutshell that beneath this or that white rope of pearl and pink bosom might lie the halflung which had by hook or by crook to sustain its possessor aboveground till the weddingday  at that moment he encountered his amiable host and almost simultaneously caught sight of the lady who had at first attracted him and then had disappeared their eyes met far off as they were from each other pierston laughed inwardly it was only in ticklish excitement as to whether this was to prove a true trouvaille and with no instinct to mirth for when under the eyes of his jillothewisp he was more inclined to palpitate like a sheep in a fair  however for the minute he had to converse with his host lord channelcliffe and almost the first thing that friend said to him was who is that pretty woman in the black dress with the white fluff about it and the pearl necklace  i dont know said jocelyn with incipient jealousy i was just going to ask the same thing  o we shall find out presently i suppose i daresay my wife knows they had parted when a hand came upon his shoulder lord channelcliffe had turned back for an instant i find she is the granddaughter of my fathers old friend the last lord hengistbury her name is mrsmrs pineavon she lost her husband two or three years ago very shortly after their marriage  lord channelcliffe became absorbed into some adjoining dignitary of the church and pierston was left to pursue his quest alone a young friend of histhe lady mabella buttermead who appeared in a cloud of muslin and was going on to a ballhad been brought against him by the tide a warmhearted emotional girl was lady mabella who laughed at the humorousness of being alive she asked him whither he was bent and he told her  o yes i know her very well said lady mabella eagerly she told me one day that she particularly wished to meet you poor thingso sadshe lost her husband well it was a long time ago now certainly women ought not to marry and lay themselves open to such catastrophes ought they mr pierston i never shall i am determined never to run such a risk now do you think i shall  marry o no never said pierston drily  thats very satisfying but mabella was scarcely comfortable under his answer even though jestingly returned and she added but sometimes i think i may just for the fun of it now well steer across to her and catch her and ill introduce you but we shall never get to her at this rate  never unless we adopt the ugly rush like the citizens who follow the lord mayors show  they talked and inched towards the desired one who as she discoursed with a neighbour seemed to be of those       female forms whose gestures beam with mind  seen by the poet in his vision of the golden city of islam  their progress was continually checked pierston was as he had sometimes seemed to be in a dream unable to advance towards the object of pursuit unless he could have gathered up his feet into the air after ten minutes given to a preoccupied regard of shoulderblades back hair glittering headgear necknapes moles hairpins pearlpowder pimples minerals cut into facets of manycoloured rays necklaceclasps fans stays the seven styles of elbow and arm the thirteen varieties of ear and by using the toes of his dressboots as coulters with which he ploughed his way and that of lady mabella in the direction they were aiming at he drew near to mrs pineavon who was drinking a cup of tea in the back drawingroom  my dear nichola we thought we should never get to you because it is worse tonight owing to these dreadful politics but weve done it and she proceeded to tell her friend of pierstons existence hard by  it seemed that the widow really did wish to know him and that lady mabella buttermead had not indulged in one of the too frequent inventions in that kind when the youngest of the trio had made the pair acquainted with each other she left them to talk to a younger man than the sculptor  mrs pineavons black velvets and silks with their white accompaniments finely set off the exceeding fairness of her neck and shoulders which though unwhitened artificially were without a speck or blemish of the least degree the gentle thoughtful creature she had looked from a distance she now proved herself to be she held also sound rather than current opinions on the plastic arts and was the first intellectual woman he had seen there that night except one or two as aforesaid  they soon became well acquainted and at a pause in their conversation noticed the fresh excitement caused by the arrival of some late comers with more news the latter had been brought by a rippling brighteyed lady in black who made the men listen to her whether they would or no  i am glad i am an outsider said jocelyns acquaintance now seated on a sofa beside which he was standing i wouldnt be like my cousin over there for the world she thinks her husband will be turned out at the next election and shes quite wild  yes it is mostly the women who are the gamesters the men only the cards the pity is that politics are looked on as being a game for politicians just as cricket is a game for cricketers not as the serious duties of political trustees  how few of us ever think or feel that the nation of every country dwells in the cottage as somebody says  yes though i wonder to hear you quote that  oi am of no party though my relations are there can be only one best course at all times and the wisdom of the nation should be directed to finding it instead of zigzagging in two courses according to the will of the party which happens to have the upper hand  having started thus they found no difficulty in agreeing on many points when pierston went downstairs from that assembly at a quarter to one and passed under the steaming nostrils of an ambassadors horses to a hansom which waited for him against the railing of the square he had an impression that the beloved had reemerged from the shadows without any hint or initiative from himto whom indeed such reemergence was an unquestionably awkward thing  in this he was aware however that though it might be now as heretofore the loved who danced before him it was the goddess behind her who pulled the string of that jumping jill he had lately been trying his artist hand again on the deas form in every conceivable phase and mood he had become a onepart mana presenter of her only but his efforts had resulted in failures in her implacable vanity she might be punishing him anew for presenting her so deplorably     2 ii she draws close and satisfies  he could not forget mrs pineavons eyes though he remembered nothing of her other facial details they were round inquiring luminous how that chestnut hair of hers had shone it required no tiara to set it off like that of the dowager he had seen there who had put ten thousand pounds upon her head to make herself look worse than she would have appeared with the ninepenny muslin cap of a servant woman  now the question was ought he to see her again he had his doubts but unfortunately for discretion just when he was coming out of the rooms he had encountered an old lady of seventy his friend mrs brightwaltonthe honourable mrs brightwaltonand she had hastily asked him to dinner for the day after the morrow stating in the honest way he knew so well that she had heard he was out of town or she would have asked him two or three weeks ago now of all social things that pierston liked it was to be asked to dinner offhand as a stopgap in place of some bishop earl or undersecretary who couldnt come and when the invitation was supplemented by the tidings that the lady who had so impressed him was to be one of the guests he had promised instantly  at the dinner he took down mrs pineavon upon his arm and talked to nobody else during the meal afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawingroom for forms sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each others company when shortly after eleven he came away he felt almost certain that within those luminous grey eyes the one of his eternal fidelity had verily taken lodgingsand for a long lease but this was not all at parting he had almost involuntarily given her hand a pressure of a peculiar and indescribable kind a little response from her like a mere pulsation of the same sort told him that the impression she had made upon him was reciprocated she was in a word willing to go on  but was he able  there had not been much harm in the flirtation thus far but did she know his history the curse upon his naturethat he was the wandering jew of the loveworld how restlessly ideal his fancies were how the artist in him had consumed the wooer how he was in constant dread lest he should wrong some woman twice as good as himself by seeming to mean what he fain would mean but could not how useless he was likely to be for practical steps towards householding though he was all the while pining for domestic life he was now over forty she was probably thirty and he dared not make unmeaning love with the careless selfishness of a younger man it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded  he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation  she lived not far from the long fashionable hamptonshire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least but somehow the very bellpull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come  as the house spoke so spoke the occupant much to the astonishment of the sculptor the doors he passed through seemed as if they had not been opened for a month and entering the large drawingroom he beheld in an armchair in the far distance a lady whom he journeyed across the carpet to reach and ultimately did reach to be sure it was mrs nichola pineavon but frosted over indescribably raising her eyes in a slightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading she leant back in the chair as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which had nothing to do with him and replied to his greeting with a few commonplace words  the unfortunate jocelyn though recuperative to a degree was at first terribly upset by this reception he had distinctly begun to love nichola and he felt sick and almost resentful but happily his affection was incipient as yet and a sudden sense of the ridiculous in his own position carried him to the verge of risibility during the scene she signified a chair and began the critical study of some rings she wore  they talked over the days news and then an organ began to grind outside the tune was a rollicking air he had heard at some musichall and by way of a diversion he asked her if she knew the composition  no i dont she replied  now ill tell you all about it said he gravely it is based on a sound old melody called the jilts hornpipe just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty  indeed  if you are in the habit of going much to the musichalls or the burlesque theatres  yes  you would find this is often done with excellent effect  she thawed a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenishblue satin up to the height of a persons headan arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded though still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows  yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year  dont you feel lonely in it sometimes  o never  however before he rose she grew friendly to some degree and when he left just after the arrival of three opportune young ladies she seemed regretful she asked him to come again and he thought he would tell the truth no i shall not care to come again he answered in a tone inaudible to the young ladies  she followed him to the door what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise  it is rather uncivil goodbye said pierston  as a punishment she did not ring the bell but left him to find his way out as he could now what the devil this means i cannot tell he said to himself reflecting stockstill for a moment on the stairs and yet the meaning was staring him in the face  meanwhile one of the three young ladies had said what interesting man was that with his lovely head of hair i saw him at lady channelcliffes the other night  jocelyn pierston  o nichola that is too bad to let him go in that shabby way when i would have given anything to know him i have wanted to know him ever since i found out how much his experiences had dictated his statuary and i discovered them by seeing in a jersey paper of the marriage of a person supposed to be his wife who ran off with him many years ago dont you know and then wouldnt marry him in obedience to some novel social principles she had invented for herself  o didnt he marry her said mrs pineavon with a start why i heard only yesterday that he did though they have lived apart ever since  quite a mistake said the young lady how i wish i could run after him  but jocelyn was receding from the pretty widows house with long strides he went out very little during the next few days but about a week later he kept an engagement to dine with lady iris speedwell whom he never neglected because she was the brightest hostess in london  by some accident he arrived rather early lady iris had left the drawingroom for a moment to see that all was right in the diningroom and when he was shown in there stood alone in the lamplight nichola pineavon she had been the first arrival he had not in the least expected to meet her there further than that in a general sense at lady iriss you expected to meet everybody  she had just come out of the cloakroom and was so tender and even apologetic that he had not the heart to be other than friendly as the other guests dropped in the pair retreated into a shady corner and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking  he had not been appointed to take her across to the diningroom but at the table found her exactly opposite she looked very charming between the candles and then suddenly it dawned upon him that her previous manner must have originated in some false report about marcia of whose existence he had not heard for years anyhow he was not disposed to resent an inexplicability in womankind having found that it usually arose independently of fact reason probability or his own deserts  so he dined on catching her eyes and the few pretty words she made opportunity to project across the table to him now and then he was courteously responsive only but mrs pineavon herself distinctly made advances he readmired her while at the same time her conduct in her own house had been enough to check his confidenceenough even to make him doubt if the wellbeloved really resided within those contours or had ever been more than the most transitory passenger through that interesting and accomplished soul  he was pondering this question yet growing decidedly moved by the playful pathos of her attitude when by chance searching his pocket for his handkerchief something crackled and he felt there an unopened letter which had arrived at the moment he was leaving his house and he had slipped into his coat to read in the cab as he drove along pierston drew it sufficiently forth to observe by the postmark that it came from his natal isle having hardly a correspondent in that part of the world now he began to conjecture on the possible sender  the lady on his right whom he had brought in was a leading actress of the townindeed of the united kingdom and america for that mattera creature in airy clothing translucent like a balsam or seaanemone without shadows and in movement as responsive as some highly lubricated manywired machine which if one presses a particular spring flies open and reveals its works the spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved at this particular moment she was engaged with the man on her own right a representative of family who talked positively and hollowly as if shouting down a vista of five hundred years from the feudal past the lady on jocelyns left wife of a lord justice of appeal was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side so that for the time he was left to himself he took advantage of the opportunity drew out his letter and read it as it lay upon his napkin nobody observing him so far as he was aware  it came from the wife of one of his fathers former workmen and was concerning her son whom she begged jocelyn to recommend as candidate for some post in town that she wished him to fill but the end of the letter was what arrested him  you will be sorry to hear sir that dear little avice caro as we used to call her in her maiden days is dead she married her cousin if you do mind and went away from here for a goodfew years but was left a widow and came back a twelvemonth ago since when she faltered and faltered and now she is gone     2 iii she becomes an inaccessible ghost  by imperceptible and slow degrees the scene at the dinnertable receded into the background behind the vivid presentment of avice caro and the old old scenes on isle vindilia which were inseparable from her personality the dining room was real no more dissolving under the bold stony promontory and the incoming west sea the handsome marchioness in geraniumred and diamonds who was visible to him on his hosts right hand opposite became one of the glowing vermilion sunsets that he had watched so many times over deadmans bay with the form of avice in the foreground between his eyes and the judge who sat next to nichola with a chin so raw that he must have shaved every quarter of an hour during the day intruded the face of avice as she had glanced at him in their last parting the crannied features of the evergreen society lady who if she had been a few years older would have been as oldfashioned as her daughter shaped themselves to the dusty quarries of his and avices parents down which he had clambered with avice hundreds of times the ivy trailing about the tablecloth the lights in the tall candlesticks and the bunches of flowers were transmuted into the ivies of the cliffbuilt castle the tufts of seaweed and the lighthouses on the isle the salt airs of the ocean killed the smell of the viands and instead of the clatter of voices came the monologue of the tide off the beal  more than all nichola pineavon lost the blooming radiance which she had latterly acquired she became a woman of his acquaintance with no distinctive traits she seemed to grow material a superficies of flesh and bone merely a person of lines and surfaces she was a language in living cipher no more  when the ladies had withdrawn it was just the same the soul of avicethe only woman he had never loved of those who had loved himsurrounded him like a firmament art drew near to him in the person of one of the most distinguished of portrait painters but there was only one painter for jocelynhis own memory all that was eminent in european surgery addressed him in the person of that harmless and unassuming fogey whose hands had been inside the bodies of hundreds of living men but the lilywhite corpse of an obscure countrygirl chilled the interest of discourse with such a king of operators  reaching the drawingroom he talked to his hostess though she had entertained threeandtwenty guests at her table that night she had known not only what every one of them was saying and doing throughout the repast but what every one was thinking so being an old friend she said quietly what has been troubling you something has i know i have been travelling over your face and have seen it there  nothing could less express the meaning his recent news had for him than a statement of its facts he told of the opening of the letter and the discovery of the death of an old acquaintance  the only woman whom i never rightly valued i may almost say he added and therefore the only one i shall ever regret  whether she considered it a sufficient explanation or not the woman of experiences accepted it as such she was the single lady of his circle whom nothing erratic in his doings could surprise and he often gave her stray ends of his confidence thus with perfect safety  he did not go near mrs pineavon again he could not and on leaving the house walked abstractedly along the streets till he found himself at his own door in his room he sat down and placing his hands behind his head thought his thoughts anew  at one side of the room stood an escritoire and from a lower drawer therein he took out a small box tightly nailed down he forced the cover with the poker the box contained a variety of odds and ends which pierston had thrown into it from time to time in past years for future sortingan intention that he had never carried out from the melancholy mass of papers faded photographs seals diaries withered flowers and such like jocelyn drew a little portrait one taken on glass in the primitive days of photography and framed with tinsel in the commonest way  it was avice caro as she had appeared during the summer month or two which he had spent with her on the island twenty years before this time her young lips pursed up her hands meekly folded the effect of the glass was to lend to the picture much of the softness characteristic of the original he remembered when it was takenduring one afternoon they had spent together at a neighbouring wateringplace when he had suggested her sitting to a touting artist on the sands there being nothing else for them to do a long contemplation of the likeness completed in his emotions what the letter had begun he loved the woman dead and inaccessible as he had never loved her in life he had thought of her but at distant intervals during the twenty years since that parting occurred and only as somebody he could have wedded yet now the times of youthful friendship with her in which he had learnt every note of her innocent nature flamed up into a yearning and passionate attachment embittered by regret beyond words  that kiss which had offended his dignity which she had so childishly given him before her consciousness of womanhood had been awakened what he would have offered to have a quarter of it now  pierston was almost angry with himself for his feelings of this night so unreasonably motivelessly strong were they towards the lost young playmate how senseless of me he said as he lay in his lonely bed she had been another mans wife almost the whole time since he was estranged from her and now she was a corpse yet the absurdity did not make his grief the less and the consciousness of the intrinsic almost radiant purity of this newsprung affection for a flown spirit forbade him to check it the flesh was absent altogether it was love rarefied and refined to its highest attar he had felt nothing like it before  the next afternoon he went down to the club not his large club where the men hardly spoke to each other but the homely one where they told stories of an afternoon and were not ashamed to confess among themselves to personal weaknesses and follies knowing well that such secrets would go no further but he could not tell this so volatile and intangible was the story that to convey it in words would have been as hard as to cage a perfume  they observed his altered manner and said he was in love pierston admitted that he was and there it ended when he reached home he looked out of his bedroom window and began to consider in what direction from where he stood that darling little figure lay it was straight across there under the young pale moon the symbol signified well the divinity of the silver bow was not more excellently pure than she the lost had been under that moon was the island of ancient slingers and on the island a house framed from mullions to chimneytop like the isle itself of stone inside the window the moonlight irradiating her windingsheet lay avice reached only by the faint noises inherent in the isle the tinktink of the chisels in the quarries the surging of the tides in the bay and the muffled grumbling of the currents in the neverpacified race  he began to divine the truth avice the departed one though she had come short of inspiring a passion had yet possessed a groundquality absent from her rivals without which it seemed that a fixed and fullrounded constancy to a woman could not flourish in him like his own her family had been islanders for centuriesfrom norman anglian roman balearicbritish times hence in her nature as in his was some mysterious ingredient sucked from the isle otherwise a racial instinct necessary to the absolute unison of a pair thus though he might never love a woman of the island race for lack in her of the desired refinement he could not love long a kimberlina woman other than of the island race for her lack of this groundwork of character  such was pierstons view of things another fancy of his an artists superstition merely may be mentioned the caros like some other local families suggested a roman lineage more or less grafted on the stock of the slingers their features recalled those of the italian peasantry to any one as familiar as he was with them and there were evidences that the roman colonists had been populous and longabiding in and near this corner of britain tradition urged that a temple to venus once stood at the top of the roman road leading up into the isle and possibly one to the lovegoddess of the slingers antedated this what so natural as that the true star of his soul would be found nowhere but in one of the old island breed  after dinner his old friend somers came in to smoke and when they had talked a little while somers alluded casually to some place at which they would meet on the morrow  i shant be there said pierston  but you promised  yes but i shall be at the islandlooking at a dead womans grave as he spoke his eyes turned and remained fixed on a table near somers followed the direction of his glance to a photograph on a stand  is that she he asked  yes  rather a bygone affair then  pierston acknowledged it shes the only sweetheart i ever slighted alfred he said because shes the only one i ought to have cared for thats just the fool i have always been  but if shes dead and buried you can go to her grave at any time as well as now to keep up the sentiment  i dont know that shes buried  but tomorrowthe academy night of all days why go then  i dont care about the academy  pierstonyou are our only inspired sculptor you are our praxiteles or rather our lysippus you are almost the only man of this generation who has been able to mould and chisel forms living enough to draw the idle public away from the popular paintings into the usually deserted lectureroom and people who have seen your last pieces of stuff say there has been nothing like them since sixteen hundred andsince the sculptors of the great race lived and diedwhenever that was well then for the sake of others you ought not to rush off to that godforgotten searock just when you are wanted in town all for a woman you last saw a hundred years ago  noit was only nineteen and three quarters replied his friend with abstracted literalness he went the next morning  since the days of his youth a railway had been constructed along the pebble bank so that except when the rails were washed away by the tides which was rather often the peninsula was quickly accessible at two oclock in the afternoon he was rattled along by this new means of locomotion under the familiar monotonous line of brancoloured stones and he soon emerged from the station which stood as a strange exotic among the black lerrets the ruins of the washedaway village and the white cubes of oolite just come to view after burial through unreckonable geologic years  in entering upon the pebble beach the train had passed close to the ruins of henry the eighths or sandsfoot castle whither avice was to have accompanied him on the night of his departure had she appeared the primitive betrothal with its natural result would probably have taken place and as no islander had ever been known to break that compact she would have become his wife  ascending the steep incline to where the quarrymen were chipping just as they had formerly done and within sound of the great stone saws he looked southward towards the beal  the level line of the sea horizon rose above the surface of the isle a ruffled patch in middistance as usual marking the race whence many a lycidas had gone       visiting the bottom of the monstrous world  but had not been blest with a poet as a friend against the stretch of water where a school of mackerel twinkled in the afternoon light was defined in addition to the distant lighthouse a church with its tower standing about a quarter of a mile off near the edge of the cliff the churchyard gravestones could be seen in profile against the same vast spread of watery babble and unrest  among the graves moved the form of a man clothed in a white sheet which the wind blew and flapped coldly every now and then near him moved six men bearing a long box and two or three persons in black followed the coffin with its twelve legs crawled across the isle while around and beneath it the flashing lights from the sea and the school of mackerel were reflected a fishingboat far out in the channel being momentarily discernible under the coffin also  the procession wandered round to a particular corner and halted and paused there a long while in the wind the sea behind them the surplice of the priest still blowing jocelyn stood with his hat off he was present though he was a quarter of a mile off and he seemed to hear the words that were being said though nothing but the wind was audible  he instinctively knew that it was none other than avice whom he was seeing interred his avice as he now began presumptuously to call her presently the little group withdrew from before the seashine and disappeared  he felt himself unable to go further in that direction and turning aside went aimlessly across the open land visiting the various spots that he had formerly visited with her but as if tethered to the churchyard by a cord he was still conscious of being at the end of a radius whose pivot was the grave of avice caro and as the dusk thickened he closed upon his centre and entered the churchyard gate  not a soul was now within the precincts the grave newly shaped was easily discoverable behind the church and when the same young moon arose which he had observed the previous evening from his window in london he could see the yet fresh footmarks of the mourners and bearers the breeze had fallen to a calm with the setting of the sun the lighthouse had opened its glaring eye and disinclined to leave a spot sublimed both by early association and present regret he moved back to the churchwall warm from the afternoon sun and sat down upon a windowsill facing the grave     2 iv she threatens to resume corporeal substance  the lispings of the sea beneath the cliffs were all the sounds that reached him for the quarries were silent now how long he sat here lonely and thinking he did not know neither did he know though he felt drowsy whether inexpectant sadnessthat gentle soporificlulled him into a short sleep so that he lost count of time and consciousness of incident but during some minute or minutes he seemed to see avice caro herself bending over and then withdrawing from her grave in the light of the moon  she seemed not a year older not a digit less slender not a line more angular than when he had parted from her twenty years earlier in the lane hard by a renascent reasoning on the impossibility of such a phenomenon as this being more than a dreamfancy roused him with a start from his heaviness  i must have been asleep he said  yet she had seemed so real pierston however dismissed the strange impression arguing that even if the information sent him of avices death should be falsea thing incrediblethat sweet friend of his youth despite the transfiguring effects of moonlight would not now look the same as she had appeared nineteen or twenty years ago were what he saw substantial flesh it must have been some other person than avice caro  having satisfied his sentiment by coming to the graveside there was nothing more for him to do in the island and he decided to return to london that night but some time remaining still on his hands jocelyn by a natural instinct turned his feet in the direction of east quarriers the village of his birth and of hers passing the marketsquare he pursued the arm of road to sylvania castle a private mansion of comparatively modern date in whose grounds stood the single plantation of trees of which the isle could boast the cottages extended close to the walls of the enclosure and one of the last of these dwellings had been avices in which as it was her freehold she possibly had died  to reach it he passed the gates of sylvania and observed above the lawn wall a board announcing that the house was to be let furnished a few steps further revealed the cottage which with its quaint and massive stone features of two or three centuries antiquity was capable even now of longer resistance to the rasp of time than ordinary new erections his attention was drawn to the window still unblinded though a lamp lit the room he stepped back against the wall opposite and gazed in  at a table covered with a white cloth a young woman stood putting teathings away into a cornercupboard she was in all respects the avice he had lost the girl he had seen in the churchyard and had fancied to be the illusion of a dream and though there was this time no doubt about her reality the isolation of her position in the silent house lent her a curiously startling aspect divining the explanation he waited for footsteps and in a few moments a quarryman passed him on his journey home pierston inquired of the man concerning the spectacle  o yes sir thats poor mrs caros only daughter and it must be lonely for her there tonight poor maid yes goodnow shes the very daps of her motherthats what everybody says  but how does she come to be so lonely  one of her brothers went to sea and was drowned and tother is in america  they were quarryowners at one time  the quarryman pitched his nitch and explained to the seeming stranger that there had been three families thereabouts in the stone trade who had got much involved with each other in the last generation they were the bencombs the pierstons and the caros the bencombs strained their utmost to outlift the other two and partially succeeded they grew enormously rich sold out and disappeared altogether from the island which had been their making the pierstons kept a dogged middle course throve without show or noise and also retired in their turn the caros were pulled completely down in the competition with the other two and when widow caros daughter married her cousin jim caro he tried to regain for the family its original place in the threecornered struggle he took contracts at less than he could profit by speculated more and more till at last the crash came he was sold up went away and later on came back to live in this little cottage which was his wifes by inheritance there he remained till his death and now his widow was gone hardships had helped on her end  the quarryman proceeded on his way and pierston deeply remorseful knocked at the door of the minute freehold the girl herself opened it lamp in hand  avice he said tenderly avice caro even now unable to get over the strange feeling that he was twenty years younger addressing avice the forsaken  ann sir said she  ah your name is not the same as your mothers  my second name is and my surname poor mother married her cousin  as everybody does here well ann or otherwise you are avice to me and you have lost her now  i have sir  she spoke in the very same sweet voice that he had listened to a score of years before and bent eyes of the same familiar hazel inquiringly upon him  i knew your mother at one time he said and learning of her death and burial i took the liberty of calling upon you you will forgive a stranger doing that  yes she said dispassionately and glancing round the room this was mothers own house and now it is mine i am sorry not to be in mourning on the night of her funeral but i have just been to put some flowers on her grave and i took it off afore going that the damp mid not spoil the crape you see she was bad a long time and i have to be careful and do washing and ironing for a living she hurt her side with wringing up the large sheets she had to wash for the castle folks here  i hope you wont hurt yourself doing it my dear  o no that i shant theres charl woollat and sammy scribben and ted gibsey and lots o young chaps theyll wring anything for me if they happen to come along but i can hardly trust em sam scribben tother day twisted a linen tablecloth into two pieces for all the world as if it had been a pipelight they never know when to stop in their wringing  the voice truly was his avices but avice the second was clearly more matteroffact unreflecting less cultivated than her mother had been this avice would never recite poetry from any platform local or other with enthusiastic appreciation of its fire there was a disappointment in his recognition of this yet she touched him as few had done he could not bear to go away how old are you he asked  going in nineteen  it was about the age of her double avice the first when he and she had strolled together over the cliffs during the engagement but he was now forty if a day she before him was an uneducated laundress and he was a sculptor and a royal academician with a fortune and a reputation yet why was it an unpleasant sensation to him just then to recollect that he was two score  he could find no further excuse for remaining and having still halfanhour to spare he went round by the road to the other or west side of the lastcentury sylvania castle and came to the furthest house out there on the cliff it was his early home used in the summer as a lodginghouse for visitors it now stood empty and silent the evening wind swaying the euonymus and tamarisk boughs in the frontthe only evergreen shrubs that could weather the whipping salt gales which sped past the walls opposite the house far out at sea the familiar lightship winked from the sandbank and all at once there came to him a wild wishthat instead of having an artists reputation he could be living here an illiterate and unknown man wooing and in a fair way of winning the pretty laundress in the cottage hard by     2 v the resumption takes place  having returned to london he mechanically resumed his customary life but he was not really living there the phantom of avice now grown to be warm flesh and blood held his mind afar he thought of nothing but the isle and avice the second dwelling thereininhaling its salt breath stroked by its singing rains and by the haunted atmosphere of roman venus about and around the site of her perished temple there the very defects in the country girl became charms as viewed from town  nothing now pleased him so much as to spend that portion of the afternoon which he devoted to outdoor exercise in haunting the purlieus of the wharves along the thames where the stone of his native rock was unshipped from the coastingcraft that had brought it thither he would pass inside the great gates of these landingplaces on the right or left bank contemplate the white cubes and oblongs imbibe their associations call up the genius loci whence they came and almost forget that he was in london  one afternoon he was walking away from the mudsplashed entrance to one of the wharves when his attention was drawn to a female form on the opposite side of the way going towards the spot he had just left she was somewhat small slight and graceful her attire alone would have been enough to attract him being simple and countrified to picturesqueness but he was more than attracted by her strong resemblance to avice caro the youngerann avice as she had said she was called  before she had receded a hundred yards he felt certain that it was avice indeed and his unifying mood of the afternoon was now so intense that the lost and the found avice seemed essentially the same person their external likeness to each otherprobably owing to the cousinship between the elder and her husbandwent far to nourish the fantasy he hastily turned and rediscovered the girl among the pedestrians she kept on her way to the wharf where looking inquiringly around her for a few seconds with the manner of one unaccustomed to the locality she opened the gate and disappeared  pierston also went up to the gate and entered she had crossed to the landingplace beyond which a lumpy craft lay moored drawing nearer he discovered her to be engaged in conversation with the skipper and an elderly womanboth come straight from the oolitic isle as was apparent in a moment from their accent pierston felt no hesitation in making himself known as a native the ruptured engagement between avices mother and himself twenty years before having been known to few or none now living  the present embodiment of avice recognized him and with the artless candour of her race and years explained the situation though that was rather his duty as an intruder than hers  this is capn kibbs sir a distant relation of fathers she said and this is mrs kibbs weve come up from the island wien just for a trip and are going to sail back wien wednesday  o i see and where are you staying  hereon board  what you live on board entirely  yes  lord sir broke in mrs kibbs i should be afeard o my life to tine my eyes among these here kimberlins at nighttime and even by day if so be i venture into the streets i nowhen forget how many turnings to the right and to the left tis to get back to jobs vesseldo i job  the skipper nodded confirmation  you are safer ashore than afloat said pierston especially in the channel with these winds and those heavy blocks of stone  well said capn kibbs after privately clearing something from his mouth as to the winds there idden much danger in them at this time o year tis the oceanbound steamers that make the risk to craft like ours if you happen to be in their course under you gocut clane in two pieces and they never lyingto to haul in your carcases and nobody to tell the tale  pierston turned to avice wanting to say much to her yet not knowing what to say he lamely remarked at last you go back the same way avice  yes sir  well take care of yourself afloat  o yes  i hopei may see you again soonand talk to you  i hope so sir  he could not get further and after a while pierston left them and went away thinking of avice more than ever  the next day he mentally timed them down the river allowing for the pause to take in ballast and on the wednesday pictured the sail down the open sea that night he thought of the little craft under the bows of the huge steamvessels powerless to make itself seen or heard and avice now growing inexpressibly dear sleeping in her little berth at the mercy of a thousand chance catastrophes  honest perception had told him that this avice fairer than her mother in face and form was her inferior in soul and understanding yet the fervour which the first could never kindle in him was almost to his alarm burning up now he began to have misgivings as to some queer trick that his migratory beloved was about to play him or rather the capricious divinity behind that ideal lady  a gigantic satire upon the mutations of his nymph during the past twenty years seemed looming in the distance a forsaking of the accomplished and wellconnected mrs pineavon for the little laundress under the traction of some mystic magnet which had nothing to do with reasonsurely that was the form of the satire  but it was recklessly pleasant to leave the suspicion unrecognized as yet and follow the lead  in thinking how best to do this pierston recollected that as was customary when the summertime approached sylvania castle had been advertised for letting furnished a solitary dreamer like himself whose wants all lay in an artistic and ideal direction did not require such gaunt accommodation as the aforesaid residence offered but the spot was all and the expenses of a few months of tenancy therein he could well afford a letter to the agent was dispatched that night and in a few days jocelyn found himself the temporary possessor of a place which he had never seen the inside of since his childhood and had then deemed the abode of unpleasant ghosts     2 vi the past shines in the present  it was the evening of pierstons arrival at sylvania castle a dignified manorhouse in a nook by the cliffs with modern castellations and battlements and he had walked through the rooms about the lawn and into the surrounding plantation of elms which on this island of treeless rock lent a unique character to the enclosure in name nature and accessories the property within the girdling wall formed a complete antithesis to everything in its precincts to find other trees between pebblebank and beal it was necessary to recede a little in timeto dig down to a loose stratum of the underlying stonebeds where a forest of conifers lay as petrifactions their heads all in one direction as blown down by a gale in the secondary geologic epoch  dusk had closed in and he now proceeded with what was after all the real business of his sojourn the two servants who had been left to take care of the house were in their own quarters and he went out unobserved crossing a hollow overhung by the budding boughs he approached an empty gardenhouse of elizabethan design which stood on the outer wall of the grounds and commanded by a window the fronts of the nearest cottages among them was the home of the resuscitated avice  he had chosen this moment for his outlook through knowing that the villagers were in no hurry to pull down their blinds at nightfall and as he had divined the inside of the young womans livingroom was visible to him as formerly illuminated by the rays of its own lamp  a subdued thumping came every now and then from the apartment she was ironing linen on a flannel tablecloth a row of such apparel hanging on a clotheshorse by the fire her face had been pale when he encountered her but now it was warm and pink with her exertions and the heat of the stove yet it was in perfect and passionless repose which imparted a minerva cast to the profile when she glanced up her lineaments seemed to have all the soul and heart that had characterized her mothers and had been with her a true index of the spirit within could it be possible that in this case the manifestation was fictitious he had met with many such examples of hereditary persistence without the qualities signified by the traits he unconsciously hoped that it was at least not entirely so here  the room was less furnished than when he had last beheld it the bofet or double cornercupboard where the china was formerly kept had disappeared its place being taken by a plain board the tall old clock with its ancient oak carcase arched brow and humorous mouth was also not to be seen a cheap whitedialled specimen doing its work what these displacements might betoken saddened his humanity less than it cheered his primitive instinct in pointing out how her necessities might bring them together  having fixed his residence near her for some lengthy time he felt in no hurry to obtrude his presence just now and went indoors that this girls frame was doomed to be a real embodiment of that olden seductive onethat protean dreamcreature who had never seen fit to irradiate the mothers image till it became a mere memory after dissolutionhe doubted less every moment  there was an uneasiness in recognizing such there was something abnormal in his present proclivity a certain sanity had after all accompanied his former idealizing passions the beloved had seldom informed a personality which while enrapturing his soul simultaneously shocked his intellect a change perhaps had come  it was a fine morning on the morrow walking in the grounds towards the gate he saw avice entering his hired castle with a broad oval wickerbasket covered with a white cloth which burden she bore round to the back door of course she washed for his own household he had not thought of that in the morning sunlight she appeared rather as a sylph than as a washerwoman and he could not but think that the slightness of her figure was as ill adapted to this occupation as her mothers had been  but after all it was not the washerwoman that he saw now in front of her on the surface of her was shining out that more real more interpenetrating being whom he knew so well the occupation of the subserving minion the blemishes of the temporary creature who formed the background were of the same account in the presentation of the indispensable one as the supporting posts and framework in a pyrotechnic display  she left the house and went homeward by a path of which he was not aware having probably changed her course because she had seen him standing there it meant nothing for she had hardly become acquainted with him yet that she should have avoided him was a new experience he had no opportunity for a further study of her by distant observation and hit upon a pretext for bringing her face to face with him he found fault with his linen and directed that the laundress should be sent for  she is rather young poor little thing said the housemaid apologetically but since her mothers death she has enough to do to keep above water and we make shift with her but ill tell her sir  i will see her myself send her in when she comes said pierston  one morning accordingly when he was answering a spiteful criticism of a late work of his he was told that she waited his pleasure in the hall he went out  about the washing said the sculptor stiffly i am a very particular person and i wish no preparation of lime to be used  i didnt know folks used it replied the maiden in a scared and reserved tone without looking at him  thats all right and then the mangling smashes the buttons  i havent got a mangle sir she murmured  ah thats satisfactory and i object to so much borax in the starch  i dont put any avice returned in the same close way never heard the name ot afore  o i see  all this time pierston was thinking of the girlor as the scientific might say nature was working her plans for the next generation under the cloak of a dialogue on linen he could not read her individual character owing to the confusing effect of her likeness to a woman whom he had valued too late he could not help seeing in her all that he knew of another and veiling in her all that did not harmonize with his sense of metempsychosis  the girl seemed to think of nothing but the business in hand she had answered to the point and was hardly aware of his sex or of his shape  i knew your mother avice he said you remember my telling you so  yes  welli have taken this house for two or three months and you will be very useful to me you still live just outside the wall  yes sir said the selfcontained girl  demurely and dispassionately she turned to leavethis pretty creature with features so still there was something strange in seeing move off thus that form which he knew passing well she who was once so throbbingly alive to his presence that not many yards from this spot she had flung her arms round him and given him a kiss which despised in its freshness had revived in him latterly as the dearest kiss of all his life and now this daps of her mother as they called her in the dialect here this perfect copy why did she turn away  your mother was a refined and wellinformed woman i think i remember  she was sir everybody said so  i hope you resemble her  she archly shook her head and drew warily away  o one thing more avice i have not brought much linen so you must come to the house every day  very good sir  you wont forget that  o no  then he let her go he was a town man and she an artless islander yet he had opened himself out like a seaanemone without disturbing the epiderm of her nature it was monstrous that a maiden who had assumed the personality of her of his tenderest memory should be so impervious perhaps it was he who was wanting avice might be passion masking as indifference because he was so many years older in outward show  this brought him to the root of it in his heart he was not a day older than when he had wooed the mother at the daughters present age his record moved on with the years his sentiments stood still  when he beheld those of his fellows who were defined as buffers and fogeysimperturbable matteroffact slightly ridiculous beings past masters in the art of populating homes schools and colleges and present adepts in the science of giving away brideshow he envied them assuming them to feel as they appeared to feel with their commerce and their politics their glasses and their pipes they had got past the distracting currents of passionateness and were in the calm waters of middleaged philosophy but he their contemporary was tossed like a cork hither and thither upon the crest of every fancy precisely as he had been tossed when he was half his present age with the burden now of double pain to himself in his growing vision of all as vanity  avice had gone and he saw her no more that day since he could not again call upon her she was as inaccessible as if she had entered the military citadel on the hilltop beyond them  in the evening he went out and paced down the lane to the red kings castle overhanging the cliff beside whose age the castle he occupied was but a thing of yesterday below the castle precipice lay enormous blocks which had fallen from it and several of them were carved over with names and initials he knew the spot and the old trick well and by searching in the faint moonrays he found a pair of names which as a boy he himself had cut they were avice and jocelynavice caros and his own the letters were now nearly worn away by the weather and the brine but close by in quite fresh letters stood ann avice coupled with the name isaac they could not have been there more than two or three years and the ann avice was probably avice the second who was isaac some boy admirer of her childtime doubtless  he retraced his steps and passed the caros house towards his own the revivified avice animated the dwelling and the light within the room fell upon the window she was just inside that blind                                              whenever she unexpectedly came to the castle he started and lost placidity it was not at her presence as such but at the new condition which seemed to have something sinister in it on the other hand the most abrupt encounter with him moved her to no emotion as it had moved her prototype in the old days she was indifferent to almost unconscious of his propinquity he was no more than a statue to her she was a growing fire to him  a sudden sapphic terror of love would ever and anon come upon the sculptor when his matured reflecting powers would insist upon informing him of the fearful lapse from reasonableness that lay in this infatuation it threw him into a sweat what if now at last he were doomed to do penance for his past emotional wanderings in a material sense by being chained in fatal fidelity to an object that his intellect despised one night he dreamt that he saw dimly masking behind that young countenance the weaver of wiles herself with all her subtle face laughing aloud  however the wellbeloved was alive again had been lost and was found he was amazed at the change of front in himself she had worn the guise of strange women she had been a woman of every class from the dignified daughter of some ecclesiastic or peer to a nubian almeh with her handkerchief undulating to the beats of the tomtom but all these embodiments had been endowed with a certain smartness either of the flesh or spirit some with wit a few with talent and even genius but the new impersonation had apparently nothing beyond sex and prettiness she knew not how to sport a fan or handkerchief hardly how to pull on a glove  but her limited life was innocent and that went far poor little avice her mothers image there it all lay after all her parentage was as good as his own it was misfortune that had sent her down to this odd as it seemed to him her limitations were largely what he loved her for her rejuvenating power over him had ineffable charm he felt as he had felt when standing beside her predecessor but alas he was twenty years further on towards the shade     2 vii the new becomes established  a few mornings later he was looking through an upper back window over a screened part of the garden the door beneath him opened and a figure appeared tripping forth she went round out of sight to where the gardener was at work and presently returned with a bunch of green stuff fluttering in each hand it was avice her dark hair now braided up snugly under a cap she sailed on with a rapt and unconscious face her thoughts a thousand removes from him  how she had suddenly come to be an inmate of his own house he could not understand till he recalled the fact that he had given the castle servants a whole holiday to attend a review of the yeomanry in the wateringplace over the bay on their stating that they could provide a temporary substitute to stay in the house they had evidently called in avice to his great pleasure he discovered their opinion of his requirements to be such a mean one that they had called in no one else  the spirit as she seemed to him brought his lunch into the room where he was writing and he beheld her uncover it she went to the window to adjust a blind which had slipped and he had a good view of her profile it was not unlike that of one of the three goddesses in rubenss judgment of paris and in contour was nigh perfection but it was in her full face that the vision of her mother was most apparent  did you cook all this avice he asked arousing himself  she turned and halfsmiled merely murmuring yes sir  well he knew the arrangement of those white teeth in the junction of two of the upper ones there was a slight irregularity no stranger would have noticed it nor would he but that he knew of the same mark in her mothers mouth and looked for it here till avice the second had revealed it this moment by her smile he had never beheld that mark since the parting from avice the first when she had smiled under his kiss as the copy had done now  next morning when dressing he heard her through the ricketty floor of the building engaged in conversation with the other servants having by this time regularly installed herself as the exponent of the longpursuedas one who by no initiative of his own had been chosen by some superior power as the vehicle of her next debut she attracted him by the cadences of her voice she would suddenly drop it to a rich whisper of roguishness when the slight rural monotony of its narrative speech disappeared and soul and heartor what seemed soul and heartresounded the charm lay in the intervals using that word in its musical sense she would say a few syllables in one note and end her sentence in a soft modulation upwards then downwards then into her own note again the curve of sound was as artistic as any line of beauty ever struck by his pencilas satisfying as the curves of her who was the worlds desire  the subject of her discourse he cared nothing aboutit was no more his interest than his concern he took special pains that in catching her voice he might not comprehend her words to the tones he had a right none to the articulations by degrees he could not exist long without this sound  on sunday evening he found that she went to church he followed behind her over the open road keeping his eye on the little hat with its bunch of cocks feathers as on a star when she had passed in pierston observed her position and took a seat behind her  engaged in the study of her ear and the nape of her white neck he suddenly became aware of the presence of a lady still further ahead in the aisle whose attire though of black materials in the quietest form was of a cut which rather suggested london than this ultima thule for the minute he forgot in his curiosity that avice intervened the lady turned her head somewhat and though she was veiled with unusual thickness for the season he seemed to recognize nichola pineavon in the form  why should mrs pineavon be there pierston asked himself if it should indeed be she  the end of the service saw his attention again concentrated on avice to such a degree that at the critical moment of moving out he forgot the mysterious lady in front of her and found that she had left the church by the sidedoor supposing it to have been mrs pineavon she would probably be discovered staying at one of the hotels at the wateringplace over the bay and to have come along the pebblebank to the island as so many did for an evening drive for the present however the explanation was not forthcoming and he did not seek it  when he emerged from the church the great placid eye of the lighthouse at the beal point was open and he moved thitherward a few steps to escape nichola or her double and the rest of the congregation turning at length he hastened homeward along the now deserted trackway intending to overtake the revitalized avice but he could see nothing of her and concluded that she had walked too fast for him arrived at his own gate he paused a moment and perceived that avices little freehold was still in darkness she had not come  he retraced his steps but could not find her the only persons on the road being a man and his wife as he knew them to be though he could not see them from the words of the man  if you had not aready married me youd cut my acquaintance thats a pretty thing for a wife to say  the remark struck his ear unpleasantly and byandby he went back again avices cottage was now lighted she must have come round by the other road satisfied that she was safely domiciled for the night he opened the gate of sylvania castle and retired to his room also                                              eastward from the grounds the cliffs were rugged and the view of the opposite coast picturesque in the extreme a little door from the lawn gave him immediate access to the rocks and shore on this side without the door was a dipwell of pure water which possibly had supplied the inmates of the adjoining and now ruinous red kings castle at the time of its erection on a sunny morning he was meditating here when he discerned a figure on the shore below spreading white linen upon the pebbly strand  jocelyn descended avice as he had supposed had now returned to her own occupation her shapely pink arms though slight were plump enough to show dimples at the elbows and were set off by her purple cotton print which the shorebreeze licked and tantalized he stood near without speaking the wind dragged a shirtsleeve from the popple or pebble which held it down pierston stooped and put a heavier one in its place  thank you she said quietly she turned up her hazel eyes and seemed gratified to perceive that her assistant was pierston she had plainly been so wrapped in her own thoughtsgloomy thoughts by their signsthat she had not considered him till then  the young girl continued to converse with him in friendly frankness showing neither ardour nor shyness as for loveit was evidently further from her mind than even death and dissolution  when one of the sheets became intractable jocelyn said do you hold it down and ill put the popples  she acquiesced and in placing a pebble his hand touched hers  it was a young hand rather long and thin a little damp and coddled from her slopping in setting down the last stone he laid it by a pure accident rather heavily on her fingers  i am very very sorry jocelyn exclaimed o i have bruised the skin avice he seized her fingers to examine the damage done  no sir you havent she cried luminously allowing him to retain her hand without the least objection whythats where i scratched it this morning with a pin you didnt hurt me a bit with the popplestone  although her gown was purple there was a little black crape bow upon each arm he knew what it meant and it saddened him do you ever visit your mothers grave he asked  yes sir sometimes i am going there tonight to water the daisies  she had now finished here and they parted that evening when the sky was red he emerged by the gardendoor and passed her house the blinds were not down and he could see her sewing within while he paused she sprang up as if she had forgotten the hour and tossed on her hat jocelyn strode ahead and round the corner and was halfway up the straggling street before he discerned her little figure behind him  he hastened past the lads and young women with clinking buckets who were drawing water from the fountains by the wayside and took the direction of the church with the disappearance of the sun the lighthouse had again set up its flame against the sky the dark church rising in the foreground here he allowed her to overtake him  you loved your mother much said jocelyn  i did sir of course i did said the girl who tripped so lightly that it seemed he might have carried her on his hand  pierston wished to say so did i but did not like to disclose events which she apparently never guessed avice fell into thought and continued  mother had a very sad life for some time when she was about as old as i i should not like mine to be as hers her young man proved false to her because she wouldnt agree to meet him one night and it grieved mother almost all her life i wouldnt ha fretted about him if id been she she would never name his name but i know he was a wicked cruel man and i hate to think of him  after this he could not go into the churchyard with her and walked onward alone to the south of the isle he was wretched for hours yet he would not have stood where he did stand in the ranks of an imaginative profession if he had not been at the mercy of every haunting of the fancy that can beset man it was in his weaknesses as a citizen and a nationalunit that his strength lay as an artist and he felt it childish to complain of susceptibilities not only innate but cultivated  but he was paying dearly enough for his liliths he saw a terrible vengeance ahead what had he done to be tormented like this the beloved after flitting from nichola pineavon to the phantom of a dead woman whom he never adored in her lifetime had taken up her abode in the living representative of the dead with a permanence of hold which the absolute indifference of that little browneyed representative only seemed to intensify  did he really wish to proceed to marriage with this chit of a girl he did the wish had come at last it was true that as he studied her he saw defects in addition to her social insufficiencies judgment hoodwinked as it was told him that she was colder in nature commoner in character than that well read bright little woman avice the first but twenty years make a difference in ideals and the added demands of middleage in physical form are more than balanced by its concessions as to the spiritual content he looked at himself in the glass and felt glad at those inner deficiencies in avice which formerly would have impelled him to reject her  there was a strange difference in his regard of his present folly and of his love in his youthful time now he could be mad with method knowing it to be madness then he was compelled to make believe his madness wisdom in those days any flash of reason upon his loved ones imperfections was blurred over hastily and with fear such penetrative vision now did not cool him he knew he was the creature of a tendency and passively acquiesced  to use a practical eye it appeared that as he had once thought this caro familythough it might not for centuries or ever furbish up an individual nature which would exactly ideally supplement his own imperfect one and round with it the perfect wholewas yet the only family he had ever met or was likely to meet which possessed the materials for her making it was as if the caros had found the clay but not the potter while other families whose daughters might attract him had found the potter but not the clay     2 viii his own soul confronts him  from his roomy castle and its grounds and the cliffs hard by he could command every move and aspect of her who was the rejuvenated spirit of the past to himin the effulgence of whom all sordid details were disregarded  among other things he observed that she was often anxious when it rained if after a wet day a golden streak appeared in the sky over deadmans bay under a lid of cloud her manner was joyous and her tread light  this puzzled him and he found that if he endeavoured to encounter her at these times she shunned himstealthily and subtly but unmistakably one evening when she had left her cottage and tripped off in the direction of the underhill townlet he set out by the same route resolved to await her return along the high roadway which stretched between that place and east quarriers  he reached the top of the old road where it makes a sudden descent to the townlet but she did not appear turning back he sauntered along till he had nearly reached his own house again then he retraced his steps and in the dim night he walked backwards and forwards on the bare and lofty convex of the isle the stars above and around him the lighthouse on duty at the distant point the lightship winking from the sandbank the combing of the pebble beach by the tide beneath the church away southwestward where the island fathers lay  he walked the wild summit till his legs ached and his heart achedtill he seemed to hear on the upper wind the stones of the slingers whizzing past and the voices of the invaders who annihilated them and married their wives and daughters and produced avice as the ultimate flower of the combined stocks still she did not come it was more than foolish to wait yet he could not help waiting at length he discerned a dot of a figure which he knew to be hers rather by its motion than by its shape  how incomparably the immaterial dream dwarfed the grandest of substantial things when here between those three sublimitiesthe sky the rock and the oceanthe minute personality of this washergirl filled his consciousness to its extremest boundary and the stupendous inanimate scene shrank to a corner therein  but all at once the approaching figure had disappeared he looked about she had certainly vanished at one side of the road was a low wall but she could not have gone behind that without considerable trouble and singular conduct he looked behind him she had reappeared further on the road  jocelyn pierston hurried after and discerning his movement avice stood still when he came up she was slily shaking with restrained laughter  well what does this mean my dear girl he asked  her inner mirth escaping in spite of her she turned askance and said when you was following me to street o wells two hours ago i looked round and saw you and huddied behind a stone you passed and brushed my frock without seeing me and when on my way backalong i saw you waiting hereabout again i slipped over the wall and ran past you if i had not stopped and looked round at ee you would never have catched me  what did you do that for you elf  that you shouldnt find me  thats not exactly a reason give another dear avice he said as he turned and walked beside her homeward  she hesitated come he urged again  twas because i thought you wanted to be my young man she answered  what a wild thought of yours supposing i did wouldnt you have me  not now and not for long even if it had been sooner than now  why  if i tell you you wont laugh at me or let anybody else know  never  then i will tell you she said quite seriously tis because i get tired o my lovers as soon as i get to know them well what i see in one young man for a while soon leaves him and goes into another yonder and i follow and then what i admire fades out of him and springs up somewhere else and so i follow on and never fix to one i have loved fifteen aready yes fifteen i am almost ashamed to say she repeated laughing i cant help it sir i assure you of course it is really to me the same one all through ony i cant catch him she added anxiously you wont tell anybody o this in me will you sir because if it were known i am afraid no man would like me  pierston was surprised into stillness here was this obscure and almost illiterate girl engaged in the pursuit of the impossible ideal just as he had been himself doing for the last twenty years she was doing it quite involuntarily by sheer necessity of her organization puzzled all the while at her own instinct he suddenly thought of its bearing upon himself and said with a sinking heart  am ione of them  she pondered critically  you was for a week when i first saw you  only a week  about that  what made the being of your fancy forsake my form and go elsewhere  wellthough you seemed handsome and gentlemanly at first  yes  i found you too old soon after  you are a candid young person  but you asked me sir she expostulated  i did and having been answered i wont intrude upon you longer so cut along home as fast as you can it is getting late  when she had passed out of earshot he also followed homewards this seeking of the wellbeloved was then of the nature of a knife which could cut two ways to be the seeker was one thing to be one of the corpses from which the ideal inhabitant had departed was another and this was what he had become now in the mockery of new days  the startling parallel in the idiosyncracies of avice and himselfevinced by the elusiveness of the beloved with her as with himmeant probably that there had been some remote ancestor common to both families from whom the trait had latently descended and recrudesced but the result was none the less disconcerting  drawing near his own gate he smelt tobacco and could discern two figures in the side lane leading past avices door they did not however enter her house but strolled onward to the narrow pass conducting to redking castle and the sea he was in momentary heaviness at the thought that they might be avice with a worthless lover but a faintly argumentative tone from the man informed him that they were the same married couple going homeward whom he had encountered on a previous occasion  the next day he gave the servants a halfholiday to get the pretty avice into the castle again for a few hours the better to observe her while she was pulling down the blinds at sunset a whistle of peculiar quality came from some point on the cliffs outside the lawn he observed that her colour rose slightly though she bustled about as if she had noticed nothing  pierston suddenly suspected that she had not only fifteen past admirers but a current one still he might be mistaken stimulated now by ancient memories and present tenderness to use every effort to make her his wife despite her conventional unfitness he strung himself up to sift this mystery if he could only win herand how could a country girl refuse such an opportunityhe could pack her off to school for two or three years marry her enlarge her mind by a little travel and take his chance of the rest as to her want of ardour for himso sadly in contrast with her sainted mothers affectiona man twenty years older than his bride could expect no better and he would be well content to put up with it in the pleasure of possessing one in whom seemed to linger as an aroma all the charm of his youth and his early home     2 ix juxtapositions  it was a sad and leaden afternoon and pierston paced up the long steep pass or street of the wells on either side of the road young girls stood with pitchers at the fountains which bubbled there and behind the houses forming the propylaea of the rock rose the massive forehead of the islecrested at this part with its enormous ramparts as with a mural crown  as you approach the upper end of the street all progress seems about to be checked by the almost vertical face of the escarpment into it your track apparently runs pointblank a confronting mass which if it were to slip down would overwhelm the whole town but in a moment you find that the road the old roman highway into the peninsula turns at a sharp angle when it reaches the base of the scarp and ascends in the stiffest of inclines to the right to the left there is also another ascending road modern almost as steep as the first and perfectly straight this is the road to the forts  pierston arrived at the forking of the ways and paused for breath before turning to the right his proper and picturesque course he looked up the uninteresting left road to the fortifications it was new long white regular tapering to a vanishing point like a lesson in perspective about a quarter of the way up a girl was resting beside a basket of white linen and by the shape of her hat and the nature of her burden he recognized her  she did not see him and abandoning the righthand course he slowly ascended the incline she had taken he observed that her attention was absorbed by something aloft he followed the direction of her gaze above them towered the greengrey mountain of grassy stone here levelled at the top by military art the skyline was broken every now and then by a little peglike objecta sentrybox and near one of these a small red spot kept creeping backwards and forwards monotonously against the heavy sky  then he divined that she had a soldierlover  she turned her head saw him and took up her clothesbasket to continue the ascent the steepness was such that to climb it unencumbered was a breathless business the linen made her task a cruelty to her youll never get to the forts with that weight he said give it to me  but she would not and he stood still watching her as she panted up the way for the moment an irradiated being the epitome of a whole sex by the beams of his own infatuation        robed in such exceeding glory       that he beheld her not  beheld her not as she really was as she was even to himself sometimes but to the soldier what was she smaller and smaller she waned up the rigid mathematical road still gazing at the soldier aloft as pierston gazed at her he could just discern sentinels springing up at the different coigns of vantage that she passed but seeing who she was they did not intercept her and presently she crossed the drawbridge over the enormous chasm surrounding the forts passed the sentries there also and disappeared through the arch into the interior pierston could not see the sentry now and there occurred to him the hateful idea that this scarlet rival was meeting and talking freely to her the unprotected orphan girl of his sweet original avice perhaps relieved of duty escorting her across the interior carrying her basket her tender body encircled by his arm  what the devil are you staring at as if you were in a trance  pierston turned his head and there stood his old friend somersstill looking the longleased bachelor that he was  i might say what the devil do you do here if i werent so glad to see you  somers said that he had come to see what was detaining his friend in such an outoftheway place at that time of year and incidentally to get some fresh air into his own lungs pierston made him welcome and they went towards sylvania castle  you were staring as far as i could see at a pretty little washerwoman with a basket of clothes resumed the painter  yes it was that to you but not to me behind the mere pretty islandgirl to the world is in my eye the idea in platonic phraseologythe essence and epitome of all that is desirable in this existence i am under a doom somers yes i am under a doom to have been always following a phantom whom i saw in woman after woman while she was at a distance but vanishing away on close approach was bad enough but now the terrible thing is that the phantom does not vanish but stays to tantalize me even when i am near enough to see what it is that girl holds me though my eyes are open and though i see that i am a fool  somers regarded the visionary look of his friend which rather intensified than decreased as his years wore on but made no further remark when they reached the castle somers gazed round upon the scenery and pierston signifying the quaint little elizabethan cottage said thats where she lives  what a romantic placeand this island altogether a man might love a scarecrow or turniplantern here  but a woman mightnt scenery doesnt impress them though they pretend it does this girl is as fickle as  you once were  exactlyfrom your point of view she has told me socandidly and it hits me hard  somers stood still in sudden thought wellthat is a strange turning of the tables he said but you wouldnt really marry her pierston  i wouldtomorrow why shouldnt i what are fame and name and society to mea descendant of wreckers and smugglers like her besides i know what shes made of my boy to her innermost fibre i know the perfect and pure quarry she was dug from and that gives a man confidence  then youll win                                              while they were sitting after dinner that evening their quiet discourse was interrupted by the long low whistle from the cliffs without somers took no notice but pierston marked it that whistle always occurred at the same time in the evening when avice was helping in the house he excused himself for a moment to his visitor and went out upon the dark lawn a crunching of feet upon the gravel mixed in with the articulation of the seasteps light as if they were winged and he supposed two minutes later that the mouth of some hulking fellow was upon hers which he himself hardly ventured to look at so touching was its young beauty  hearing people aboutamong others the beforementioned married couple quarrelling the womans tones having a kinship to avices ownhe returned to the house next day somers roamed abroad to look for scenery for a marine painting and going out to seek him pierston met avice  so you have a lover my lady he said severely she admitted that it was the fact you wont stick to him he continued  i think i may to this one said she in a meaning tone that he failed to fathom then he deserted me once but he wont again  i suppose hes a wonderful sort of fellow  hes good enough for me  so handsome no doubt  handsome enough for me  so refined and respectable  refined and respectable enough for me  he could not disturb her equanimity and let her pass the next day was sunday and somers having chosen his view at the other end of the island pierston determined in the afternoon to see avices lover he found that she had left her cottage stronghold and went on towards the lighthouses at the beal turning back when he had reached the nearest he saw on the lonely road between the quarries a young man evidently connected with the stone trade with avice the second upon his arm  she looked prettily guilty and blushed a little under his glance the mans was one of the typical island physiognomieshis features energetic and wary in their expression and half covered with a close crisp black beard pierston fancied that out of his keen dark eyes there glimmered a dry sense of humour at the situation  if so avice must have told him of pierstons symptoms of tenderness this girl whom for her dear mothers sake more than for her own unquestionable attractiveness he would have guarded as the apple of his eye how could she estimate him so flippantly  the mortification of having brought himself to this position with the antitype by his early slight of the type blinded him for the moment to what struck him a short time after the man upon whose arm she hung was not a soldier what then became of her entranced gaze at the sentinel she could hardly have transferred her affections so promptly or to give her the benefit of his own theory her beloved could scarcely have flitted from frame to frame in so very brief an interval and which of them had been he who whistled softly in the dusk to her  without further attempt to find alfred somers pierston walked homeward moodily thinking that the desire to make reparation to the original woman by wedding and enriching the copywhich lent such an unprecedented permanence to his new lovewas thwarted as if by set intention of his destiny  at the door of the grounds about the castle there stood a carriage he observed that it was not one of the homely flys from the underhill town but apparently from the popular resort across the bay wondering why the visitor had not driven in he entered to find in the drawingroom nichola pineavon  at his first glance upon her fashionably dressed and graceful in movement she seemed beautiful at the second when he observed that her face was pale and agitated she seemed pathetic likewise altogether she was now a very different figure from her who sitting in her chair with such finished composure had snubbed him in her drawingroom in hamptonshire square  you are surprised at this of course you are she said in a low pleading voice languidly lifting her heavy eyelids while he was holding her hand but i couldnt help it i know i have done something to offend youhave i not o what can it be that you have come away to this outlandish rock to live with barbarians in the midst of the london season  you have not offended me dear mrs pineavon he said how sorry i am that you should have supposed it yet i am glad too that your fancy should have done me the good turn of bringing you here to see me  i am staying at budmouthregis she explained  then i did see you at a churchservice here a little while back  she blushed faintly upon her pallor and she sighed their eyes met well she said at last i dont know why i shouldnt show the virtue of candour you know what it means i was the stronger once now i am the weaker whatever pain i may have given you in the ups and downs of our acquaintance i am sorry for and would willingly repair all errors of the past bybeing amenable to reason in the future  it was impossible that jocelyn should not feel a tender impulsion towards this attractive and once independent woman who from every worldly point of view was an excellent match for hima superior match indeed except in money he took her hand again and held it awhile and a faint wave of gladness seemed to flow through her but nohe could go no further that island girl in her coquettish sunday frock and little hat with its bunch of cocks feathers held him as by strands of manila rope he dropped nicholas hand  i am leaving budmouth tomorrow she said that was why i felt i must call you did not know i had been there all through the whitsun holidays  i did not indeed or i should have come to see you  i didnt like to write i wish i had now  i wish you had too dear mrs pineavon  but it was nichola that she wanted to be as they reached the landau he told her that he should be back in town himself again soon and would call immediately at the moment of his words avice caro now alone passed close along by the carriage on the other side towards her house hard at hand she did not turn head or eye to the pair they seemed to be in her view objects of indifference  pierston became cold as a stone the chill towards nichola that the presence of the girlsprite witch troll that she wasbrought with it came like a doom he knew what a fool he was as he had said but he was powerless in the grasp of the idealizing passion he cared more for avices fingertips than for mrs pineavons whole personality  perhaps nichola saw it for she said mournfully now i have done all i could i felt that the only counterpoise to my cruelty to you in my drawingroom would be to come as a suppliant to yours  it is most handsome and noble of you my very dear friend said he with an emotion of courtesy rather than of enthusiasm  then adieux were spoken and she drove away but pierston saw only the retreating avice and knew that he was helpless in her hands the church of the island had risen near the foundations of the pagan temple and a christian emanation from the former might be wrathfully torturing him through the very false gods to whom he had devoted himself both in his craft like demetrius of ephesus and in his heart perhaps divine punishment for his idolatries had come     2 x she fails to vanish still  pierston had not turned far back towards the castle when he was overtaken by somers and the man who carried his painting lumber they paced together to the door the man deposited the articles and went away and the two walked up and down before entering  i met an extremely interesting woman in the road out there said the painter  ah she is a sprite a sylph psyche indeed  i was struck with her  it shows how beauty will out through the homeliest guise  yes it will though not always and this case doesnt prove it for the ladys attire was in the latest and most approved taste  oh you mean the lady who was driving  of course what were you thinking of the pretty little cottagegirl outside here i did meet her but whats she very well for ones picture though hardly for ones fireside this lady  is mrs pineavon a kind proud woman wholl do what people with no pride would not condescend to think of she is leaving budmouth tomorrow and she drove across to see me you know how things seemed to be going with us at one time but i am no good to any woman shes been very generous towards me which ive not been to her shell ultimately throw herself away upon some wretch unworthy of her no doubt  do you think so murmured somers after a while he said abruptly ill marry her myself if shell have me i like the look of her  i wish you would alfred or rather could she has long had an idea of slipping out of the world of fashion into the world of art she is a woman of individuality and earnest instincts i am in real trouble about her i wont say she can be wonit would be ungenerous of me to say that but try i can bring you together easily  ill marry her if shes willing with the phlegmatic dogmatism that was part of him somers added when you have decided to marry take the first nice woman you meet they are all alike  wellyou dont know her yet replied jocelyn who could give praise where he could not give love  but you do and ill take her on the strength of your judgment is she really handsomei had but the merest glance but i know she is or she wouldnt have caught your discriminating eye  you may take my word for it she looks as well at hand as afar  what colour are her eyes  her eyes i dont go much in for colour being professionally sworn to form but let me seegrey and her hair rather light than dark brown  i wanted something darker said somers airily there are so many fair models among native englishwomen still blondes are useful property well well this is flippancy but i liked the look of her                                              somers had gone back to town it was a wet day on the little peninsula but pierston walked out as far as the gardenhouse of his hired castle where he sat down and smoked this erection being on the boundarywall of his property his ear could now and then catch the tones of avices voice from her opendoored cottage in the lane which skirted his fence and he noticed that there were no modulations in it he knew why that was she wished to go out and could not he had observed before that when she was planning an outing a particular note would come into her voice during the preceding hours a doves roundness of sound no doubt the effect upon her voice of her thoughts of her lover or lovers yet the latter it could not be she was pure and singlehearted half an eye could see that whence then the two men possibly the quarrier was a relation  there seemed reason in this when going out into the lane he encountered one of the red jackets he had been thinking of soldiers were seldom seen in this outer part of the isle their beat from the forts when on pleasure was in the opposite direction and this man must have had a special reason for coming hither pierston surveyed him he was a roundfaced goodhumoured fellow to look at having two little pieces of moustache on his upper lip like a pair of minnows rampant and small black eyes over which the glengarry cap straddled flat it was a hateful idea that her tender cheek should be kissed by the lips of this heavy young man who had never been sublimed by a single battle even with defenceless savages  the soldier went before her house looked at the door and moved on down the crooked way to the cliffs where there was a path back to the forts but he did not adopt it returning by the way he had come this showed his wish to pass the house again she gave no sign however and the soldier disappeared  pierston could not be satisfied that avice was in the house and he crossed over to the front of her little freehold and tapped at the door which stood ajar  nobody came hearing a slight movement within he crossed the threshold avice was there alone sitting on a low stool in a dark corner as though she wished to be unobserved by any casual passerby she looked up at him without emotion or apparent surprise but he could then see that she was crying the view for the first time of distress in an unprotected young girl towards whom he felt drawn by ties of extraordinary delicacy and tenderness moved pierston beyond measure he entered without ceremony  avice my dear girl he said something is the matter  she looked assent and he went on now tell me all about it perhaps i can help you come tell me  i cant she murmured grammer stockwool is upstairs and shell hear mrs stockwool was the old woman who had come to live with the girl for company since her mothers death  then come into my garden opposite there we shall be quite private  she rose put on her hat and accompanied him to the door here she asked him if the lane were empty and on his assuring her that it was she crossed over and entered with him through the gardenwall  the place was a shady and secluded one though through the boughs the sea could be seen quite near at hand its moanings being distinctly audible a waterdrop from a tree fell here and there but the rain was not enough to hurt them  now let me hear it he said soothingly you may tell me with the greatest freedom i was a friend of your mothers you know that is i knew her and ill be a friend of yours  the statement was risky if he wished her not to suspect him of being her mothers false one but that lovers name appeared to be unknown to the present avice  i cant tell you sir she replied unwillingly except that it has to do with my own changeableness the rest is the secret of somebody else  i am sorry for that said he  i am getting to care for one i ought not to think of and it means ruin i ought to get away  you mean from the island  yes  pierston reflected his presence in london had been desired for some time yet he had delayed going because of his new solicitudes here but to go and take her with him would afford him opportunity of watching over her tending her mind and developing it while it might remove her from some looming danger it was a somewhat awkward guardianship for him as a lonely man to carry out still it could be done he asked her abruptly if she would really like to go away for a while  i like best to stay here she answered still i should not mind going somewhere because i think i ought to  would you like london  avices face lost its weeping shape how could that be she said  i have been thinking that you could come to my house and make yourself useful in some way i rent just now one of those new places called flats which you may have heard of and i have a studio at the back  i havent heard of em she said without interest  well i have two servants there and as my man has a holiday you can help them for a month or two  would polishing furniture be any good i can do that  i havent much furniture that requires polishing but you can clear away plaster and clay messes in the studio and chippings of stone and help me in modelling and dust all my venus failures and hands and heads and feet and bones and other objects  she was startled yet attracted by the novelty of the proposal  only for a time she said  only for a time as short as you like and as long  the deliberate manner in which after the first surprise avice discussed the arrangements that he suggested might have told him how far was any feeling for himself beyond friendship and possibly gratitude from agitating her breast yet there was nothing extravagant in the discrepancy between their ages and he hoped after shaping her to himself to win her what had grieved her to tears she would not more particularly tell  she had naturally not much need of preparation but she made even less preparation than he would have expected her to require she seemed eager to be off immediately and not a soul was to know of her departure why if she were in love and at first averse to leave the island she should be so precipitate now he failed to understand  but he took great care to compromise in no way a girl in whom his interest was as protective as it was passionate he accordingly left her to get out of the island alone awaiting her at a station a few miles up the railway where discovering himself to her through the carriagewindow he entered the next compartment his frame pervaded by a glow which was almost joy at having for the first time in his charge one who inherited the flesh and bore the name so early associated with his own and at the prospect of putting things right which had been wrong through many years     2 xi the image persists  it was dark when the fourwheeled cab wherein he had brought avice from the station stood at the entrance to the pile of flats of which pierston occupied one floorrarer then as residences in london than they are now leaving avice to alight and get the luggage taken in by the porter pierston went upstairs to his surprise his floor was silent and on entering with a latchkey the rooms were all in darkness he descended to the hall where avice was standing helpless beside the luggage while the porter was outside with the cabman  do you know what has become of my servants asked jocelyn  whatand aint they there saur ah then my belief is that what i suspected is thrue you didnt leave your winecellar unlocked did you saur by no mistake  pierston considered he thought he might have left the key with his elder servant whom he had believed he could trust especially as the cellar was not well stocked  ah then it was so shes been very queer saur this last week or two o yes sending messages down the spakintube which were like madness itself and ordering us this and that till we would take no notice at all i see them both go out last night and possibly they went for a holiday not expecting ye or maybe for good shure if yed written saur id ha got the place ready ye being out of a man too though its not me duty at all  when pierston got to his floor again he found that the cellar door was open some bottles were standing empty that had been full and many abstracted altogether all other articles in the house however appeared to be intact his letter to his housekeeper lay in the box as the postman had left it  by this time the luggage had been sent up in the lift and avice like so much more luggage stood at the door the hallporter behind offering his assistance  come here avice said the sculptor what shall we do now heres a pretty state of affairs  avice could suggest nothing till she was struck with the bright thought that she should light a fire  light a fireah yes i wonder if we could manage this is an odd coincidenceand awkward he murmured very well light a fire  is this the kitchen sir all mixed up with the parlours  yes  then i think i can do all thats wanted here for a bit at any rate till you can get help sir at least i could if i could find the fuelhouse tis no such big place as i thought  thats right take courage said he with a tender smile now ill dine out this evening and leave the place for you to arrange as best you can with the help of the porters wife downstairs  this pierston accordingly did and so their common residence began feeling more and more strongly that some danger awaited her in her native island he determined not to send her back till the lover or lovers who seemed to trouble her should have cooled off he was quite willing to take the risk of his action thus far in his solicitous regard for her                                               it was a dual solitude indeed for though pierston and avice were the only two people in the flat they did not keep each other company the former being as scrupulously fearful of going near her now that he had the opportunity as he had been prompt to seek her when he had none they lived in silence his messages to her being frequently written on scraps of paper deposited where she could see them it was not without a pang that he noted her unconsciousness of their isolated positiona position to which had she experienced any reciprocity of sentiment she would readily have been alive  considering that though not profound she was hardly a matteroffact girl as that phrase is commonly understood she was exasperating in the matteroffact quality of her responses to the friendly remarks which would escape him in spite of himself as well as in her general conduct whenever he formed some culinary excuse for walking across the few yards of tessellated hall which separated his room from the kitchen and spoke through the doorway to her she answered yes sir or no sir without turning her eyes from the particular work that she was engaged in  in the usual course he would have obtained a couple of properly qualified servants immediately but he lived on with the one or rather the less than one that this cottagegirl afforded it had been his almost invariable custom to dine at one of his clubs now he sat at home over the miserable chop or steak to which he limited himself in dread lest she should complain of there being too much work for one person and demand to be sent home a charwoman came every two or three days effecting an extraordinary consumption of food and alcoholic liquids yet it was not for this that pierston dreaded her presence but lest in conversing with avice she should open the girls eyes to the oddity of her situation avice could see for herself that there must have been two or three servants in the flat during his former residence there but his reasons for doing without them seemed never to strike her  his intention had been to keep her occupied exclusively at the studio but accident had modified this however he sent her round one morning and entering himself shortly after found her engaged in wiping the layers of dust from the casts and models  the colour of the dust never ceased to amaze her it is like the hold of a budmouth collier she said and the beautiful faces of these clay people are quite spoilt by it  i suppose youll marry some day avice remarked pierston as he regarded her thoughtfully  some do and some dont she said with a reserved smile still attending to the casts  you are very offhand said he  she archly weighed that remark without further speech it was tantalizing conduct in the face of his instinct to cherish her especially when he regarded the charm of her bending profile the wellcharacterized though softly lined nose the round chin with as it were a second leap in its curve to the throat and the sweep of the eyelashes over the rosy cheek during the sedulously lowered glance how futilely he had laboured to express the character of that face in clay and while catching it in substance had yet lost something that was essential  that evening after dusk in the stress of writing letters he sent her out for stamps she had been absent some quarter of an hour when suddenly drawing himself up from over his writingtable it flashed upon him that he had absolutely forgotten her total ignorance of london  the head postoffice to which he had sent her because it was late was two or three streets off and he had made his request in the most general manner which she had acceded to with alacrity enough how could he have done such an unreflecting thing  pierston went to the window it was halfpast nine oclock and owing to her absence the blinds were not down he opened the casement and stepped out upon the balcony the green shade of his lamp screened its rays from the gloom without over the opposite square the moon hung and to the right there stretched a long street filled with a diminishing array of lamps some single some in clusters among them an occasional blue or red one from a corner came the notes of a pianoorgan strumming out a stirring march of rossinis the shadowy black figures of pedestrians moved up down and across the embrowned roadway above the roofs was a bank of livid mist and higher a greenishblue sky in which stars were visible though its lower part was still pale with daylight against which rose chimneypots in the form of elbows prongs and fists  from the whole scene proceeded a ground rumble miles in extent upon which individual rattles voices a tin whistle the bark of a dog rode like bubbles on a sea the whole noise impressed him with the sense that no one in its enormous mass ever required rest  in this illimitable ocean of humanity there was a unit of existence his avice wandering alone  pierston looked at his watch she had been gone half an hour it was impossible to distinguish her at this distance even if she approached he came inside and putting on his hat determined to go out and seek her he reached the end of the street and there was nothing of her to be seen she had the option of two or three routes from this point to the postoffice yet he plunged at random into one till he reached the office to find it quite deserted almost distracted now by his anxiety for her he retreated as rapidly as he had come regaining home only to find that she had not returned  he recollected telling her that if she should ever lose her way she must call a cab and drive home it occurred to him that this was what she would do now he again went out upon the balcony the dignified street in which he lived was almost vacant and the lamps stood like placed sentinels awaiting some procession which tarried long at a point under him where the road was torn up there stood a red light and at the corner two men were talking in leisurely repose as if sunning themselves at noonday lovers of a feline disposition who were never seen by daylight joked and darted at each other in and out of area gates  his attention was fixed on the cabs and he held his breath as the hollow clap of each horses hoofs drew near the front of the house only to go onward into the square the two lamps of each vehicle afar dilated with its near approach and seemed to swerve towards him it was avice surely no it passed by  almost frantic he again descended and let himself out of the house moving towards a more central part where the roar still continued before emerging into the noisy thoroughfare he observed a small figure approaching leisurely along the opposite side and hastened across to find it was she     2 xii a grille descends between  o avice he cried with the tenderly subdued scolding of a mother what is this you have done to alarm me so  she seemed unconscious of having done anything and was altogether surprised at his anxiety in his relief he did not speak further till he asked her suddenly if she would take his arm since she must be tired  o no sir she assured him i am not a bit tired and i dont require any help at all thank you  they went upstairs without using the lift and he let her and himself in with his latchkey she entered the kitchen and he following sat down in a chair there  where have you been he said with almost angered concern on his face you ought not to have been absent more than ten minutes  i knew there was nothing for me to do and thought i should like to see a little of london she replied naively so when i had got the stamps i went on into the fashionable streets where ladies are all walking about just as if it were daytime twas for all the world like coming home by night from martinmas fair at the street o wells only more genteel  o avice avice you must not go out like this dont you know that i am responsible for your safety i am yourwell guardian in fact and am bound by law and morals and i dont know whatall to deliver you up to your native island without a scratch or blemish and yet you indulge in such a midnight vagary as this  but i am sure sir the gentlemen in the street were more respectable than they are anywhere at home they were dressed in the latest fashion and would have scorned to do me any harm and as to their lovemaking i never heard anything so polite before  well you must not do it again ill tell you some day why whats that you have in your hand  a mousetrap there are lots of mice in this kitchensooty mice not clean like oursand i thought id try to catch them that was what i went so far to buy as there were no shops open just about here ill set it now  she proceeded at once to do so and pierston remained in his seat regarding the operation which seemed entirely to engross her it was extraordinary indeed to observe how she wilfully limited her interests with what content she received the ordinary things that life offered and persistently refused to behold what an infinitely extended life lay open to her through him if she had only said the word he would have got a licence and married her the next morning was it possible that she did not perceive this tendency in him she could hardly be a woman if she did not and in her airy elusive offhand demeanour she was very much of a woman indeed  it only holds one mouse he said absently  but i shall hear it throw in the night and set it again  he sighed and left her to her own resources and retired to rest though he felt no tendency to sleep at some small hour of the darkness owing possibly to some intervening door being left open he heard the mousetrap click another light sleeper must have heard it too for almost immediately after the pitpat of naked feet accompanied by the brushing of drapery was audible along the passage towards the kitchen after her absence in that apartment long enough to reset the trap he was startled by a scream from the same quarter pierston sprang out of bed jumped into his dressinggown and hastened in the direction of the cry  avice barefooted and wrapped in a shawl was standing in a chair the mousetrap lay on the floor the mouse running round and round in its neighbourhood  i was trying to take en out said she excitedly and he got away from me  pierston secured the mouse while she remained standing on the chair then having set the trap anew his feeling burst out petulantly  a girl like you to throw yourself away upon such a commonplace fellow as that quarryman why do you do it  her mind was so intently fixed upon the matter in hand that it was some moments before she caught his irrelevant subject because i am a foolish girl she said quietly  what dont you love him said jocelyn with a surprised stare up at her as she stood in her concern appearing the very avice who had kissed him twenty years earlier  it is not much use to talk about that said she  then is it the soldier  yes though i have never spoken to him  never spoken to the soldier  never  has either one treated you badlydeceived you  no certainly not  well i cant make you out and i dont wish to know more than you choose to tell me come avice why not tell me exactly how things are  not now sir she said her pretty pink face and brown eyes turned in simple appeal to him from her pedestal i will tell you all tomorrow an that i will  he retreated to his own room and lay down meditating some quarter of an hour after she had retreated to hers the mousetrap clicked again and pierston raised himself on his elbow to listen the place was so still and the jerrybuilt doorpanels so thin that he could hear the mouse jumping about inside the wires of the trap but he heard no footstep this time as he was wakeful and restless he again arose proceeded to the kitchen with a light and removing the mouse reset the trap returning he listened once more he could see in the far distance the door of avices room but that thoughtful housewife had not heard the second capture from the room came a soft breathing like that of an infant  he entered his own chamber and reclined himself gloomily enough her lack of all consciousness of him the aspect of the deserted kitchen the cold grate impressed him with a deeper sense of loneliness than he had ever felt before  foolish he was indeed to be so devoted to this young woman her defencelessness her freedom from the least thought that there lurked a danger in their propinquity were in fact secondary safeguards not much less strong than that of her being her mothers image against risk to her from him yet it was out of this that his depression came  at sight of her the next morning pierston felt that he must put an end to such a state of things he sent avice off to the studio wrote to an agent for a couple of servants and then went round to his work avice was busy righting all that she was allowed to touch it was the girls delight to be occupied among the models and casts which for the first time she regarded with the wistful interest of a soul struggling to receive ideas of beauty vaguely discerned yet ever eluding her that brightness in her mothers mind which might have descended to the second avice with the maternal face and form had been dimmed by admixture with the mediocrity of her fathers and by one who remembered like pierston the dual organization the opposites could be often seen wrestling internally  they were alone in the studio and his feelings found vent putting his arms round her he said my darling sweet little avice i want to ask you somethingsurely you guess what i want to know this will you be married to me and live here with me always and ever  o mr pierston what nonsense  nonsense said he shrinking somewhat  yes sir  well why am i too old surely theres no serious difference  o noi should not mind that if it came to marrying the difference is not much for husband and wife though it is rather much for keeping company  she struggled to get free and when in the movement she knocked down the empress faustinas head he did not try to retain her he saw that she was not only surprised but a little alarmed  you havent said why it is nonsense he remarked tartly  why i didnt know you was thinking of me like that i hadnt any thought of it and all alone here what shall i do  say yes my pretty avice well then go out and be married at once and nobody be any the wiser  she shook her head i couldnt sir  it would be well for you you dont like me perhaps  yes i dovery much but not in that sort of wayquite still i might have got to love you in time if  well then try he said warmly your mother did  no sooner had the words slipped out than pierston would have recalled them he had felt in a moment that they jeopardized his cause  mother loved you said avice incredulously gazing at him  yes he murmured  you were not her false young man surely that one who  yes yes say no more about it  who ran away from her  almost  then i can never never like you again i didnt know it was a gentlemanii thought  it wasnt a gentleman then  o sir please go away i cant bear the sight of ee at this moment perhaps i shall get toto like you as i did but  no im dd if ill go away said pierston thoroughly irritated i have been candid with you you ought to be the same with me  what do you want me to tell  enough to make it clear to me why you dont accept this offer everything you have said yet is a reason for the reverse now my dear i am not angry  yes you are  no im not now what is your reason  the name of it is isaac pierston down home  how  i mean he courted me and led me on to island custom and then i went to chapel one morning and married him in secret because mother didnt care about him and i didnt either by that time and then he quarrelled with me and just before you and i came to london he went away to guernsey then i saw a soldier i never knew his name but i fell in love with him because i am so quick at that still as it was wrong i tried not to think of him and wouldnt look at him when he passed but it made me cry very much that i mustnt i was then very miserable and you asked me to come to london i didnt care what i did with myself and i came  heaven above us said pierston his pale and distressed face showing with what a shock this announcement had come why have you done such extraordinary things or rather why didnt you tell me of this before then at the present moment you are the wife of a man who is in guernsey whom you do not love at all but instead of him love a soldier whom you have never spoken to while i have nearly brought scandal upon us both by your letting me love you really you are a very wicked woman  no i am not she pouted  still avice looked pale and rather frightened and did not lift her eyes from the floor i said it was nonsense in you to want to have me she went on and even if i hadnt been married to that horrid isaac pierston i couldnt have married you after you told me that you was the man who ran away from my mother  i have paid the penalty he said sadly men of my sort always get the worst of it somehow though i never did your mother any harm now aviceill call you dear avice for your mothers sake and not for your owni must see what i can do to help you out of the difficulty that unquestionably you are in why cant you love your husband now you have married him  avice looked aside at the statuary as if the subtleties of her organization were not very easy to define  was he that blackbearded typical local character i saw you walking with one sunday the same surname as mine though of course you dont notice that in a place where there are only halfadozen surnames  yes that was ike it was that evening we disagreed he scolded me and i answered him you must have heard us and the next day he went away  well as i say i must consider what it will be best to do for you in this the first thing it seems to me will be to get your husband home  she impatiently shrugged her shoulders i dont like him  then why did you marry him  i was obliged to after wed proved each other by island custom  you shouldnt have thought of such a thing it is ridiculous and out of date nowadays  ah hes so oldfashioned in his notions that he doesnt think like that however hes gone  ahit is only a tiff between you i dare say ill start him in business if hell come is the cottage at home still in your hands  yes it is my freehold grammer stockwool is taking care o it for me  good and back there you go straightway my pretty madam and wait till your husband comes to make it up with you  i wont goi dont want him to come she sobbed i want to stay here with you or anywhere except where he can come  you will get over that now go back to the flat theres a dear avice and be ready in one hour waiting in the hall for me  i dont want to  but i say you shall  she found it was no use to disobey precisely at the moment appointed he met her there himself burdened only with a valise and umbrella she with a box and other things directing the porter to put avice and her belongings into a fourwheeled cab for the railwaystation he walked onward from the door and kept looking behind till he saw the cab approaching he then entered beside the astonished girl and onward they went together  they sat opposite each other in an empty compartment and the tedious railway journey began regarding her closely now by the light of her revelation he wondered at himself for never divining her secret whenever he looked at her the girls eyes grew rebellious and at last she wept  i dont want to go to him she sobbed in a miserable voice  pierston was almost as much distressed as she why did you put yourself and me in such a position he said bitterly it is no use to regret it now and i cant say that i do it affords me a way out of a trying position even if you had not been married to him you would not have married me  yes i would sir  what you would you said you wouldnt not long ago  i like you better now i like you more and more  pierston sighed for emotionally he was not much older than she that hitch in his development rendering him the most lopsided of gods creatures was his standing misfortune a proposal to her which crossed his mind was dismissed as disloyalty particularly to an inexperienced fellowislander and one who was by race and traditions almost a kinswoman  little more passed between the twain on that wretched nevertobeforgotten day aphrodite ashtaroth freyja or whoever the lovequeen of his isle might have been was punishing him sharply as she knew but too well how to punish her votaries when they reverted from the ephemeral to the stable mood when was it to endthis curse of his heart not ageing while his frame moved naturally onward perhaps only with life  his first act the day after depositing her in her own house was to go to the chapel where by her statement the marriage had been solemnized and make sure of the fact perhaps he felt an illogical hope that she might be free even then in the tarnished condition which such freedom would have involved however there stood the words distinctly isaac pierston ann avice caro son and daughter of soandso married on such a day signed by the contracting parties the officiating minister and the two witnesses     2 xiii she is enshrouded from sight  one evening in early winter when the air was dry and gusty the dark little lane which divided the grounds of sylvania castle from the cottage of avice and led down to the adjoining ruin of redking castle was paced by a solitary man the cottage was the centre of his beat its western limit being the gates of the former residence its eastern the drawbridge of the ruin the few other cottages thereaboutall as if carved from the solid rockwere in darkness but from the upper window of avices tiny freehold glimmered a light its rays were repeated from the fardistant sea by the lightship lying moored over the mysterious shambles quicksand which brought tamelessness and domesticity into due position as balanced opposites  the sea moanedmore than moanedamong the boulders below the ruins a throe of its tide being timed to regular intervals these sounds were accompanied by an equally periodic moan from the interior of the cottage chamber so that the articulate heave of water and the articulate heave of life seemed but differing utterances of the selfsame troubled terrestrial beingwhich in one sense they were  pierstonfor the man in the lane was hewould look from lightship to cottage window then back again as he waited there between the travail of the sea without and the travail of the woman within soon an infants wail of the very feeblest was also audible in the house he started from his easy pacing and went again westward standing at the elbow of the lane a long time then the peace of the sleeping village which lay that way was broken by light wheels and the trot of a horse pierston went back to the cottage gate and awaited the arrival of the vehicle  it was a light cart and a man jumped down as it stopped he was in a broadbrimmed hat under which no more of him could be perceived than that he wore a black beard clipped like a yew fencea typical aspect in the island  you are avices husband asked the sculptor quickly  the man replied that he was in the local accent ive just come in by todays boat he added i couldnt git here avore i had contracted for the job at peterport and had to see tot to the end  well said pierston your coming means that you are willing to make it up with her  ay i dont know but i be said the man mid so well do that as anything else  if you do thoroughly a good business in your old line awaits you here in the island  wi all my heart then said the man his voice was energetic and though slightly touchy it showed on the whole a disposition to set things right  the driver of the trap was paid off and jocelyn and isaac pierstonundoubtedly scions of a common stock in this isle of intermarriages though they had no proof of itentered the house nobody was in the groundfloor room in the centre of which stood a square table in the centre of the table a little wool mat and in the centre of the mat a lamp the apartment having the appearance of being rigidly swept and set in order for an event of interest  the woman who lived in the house with avice now came downstairs and to the inquiry of the comers she replied that matters were progressing favourably but that nobody could be allowed to go upstairs just then after placing chairs and viands for them she retreated and they sat down the lamp between themthe lover of the sufferer above who had no right to her and the man who had every right to her but did not love her engaging in desultory and fragmentary conversation they listened to the trampling of feet on the floorboards overheadpierston full of anxiety and attentiveness ike awaiting the course of nature calmly  soon they heard the feeble bleats repeated and then the local practitioner descended and entered the room  how is she now said pierston the more taciturn ike looking up with him for the answer that he felt would serve for two as well as for one  doing well remarkably well replied the professional gentleman with a manner of having said it in other places and his vehicle not being at the door he sat down and shared some refreshment with the others when he had departed mrs stockwool again stepped down and informed them that ikes presence had been made known to his wife  the truant quarrier seemed rather inclined to stay where he was and finish the mug of ale but pierston quickened him and he ascended the staircase as soon as the lower room was empty pierston leant with his elbows on the table and covered his face with his hands  ike was absent no great time descending with a proprietary mien that had been lacking before he invited jocelyn to ascend likewise since she had stated that she would like to see him jocelyn went up the crooked old steps the husband remaining below  avice though white as the sheets looked brighter and happier than he had expected to find her and was apparently very much fortified by the pink little lump at her side she held out her hand to him  i just wanted to tell ee she said striving against her feebleness i thought it would be no harm to see you though tis rather soonto tell ee how very much i thank you for getting me settled again with ike he is very glad to come home again too he says yes youve done a good many kind things for me sir  whether she were really glad or whether the words were expressed as a matter of duty pierston did not attempt to learn  he merely said that he valued her thanks now avice he added tenderly i resign my guardianship of you i hope to see your husband in a sound little business here in a very short time  i hope sofor babys sake she said with a bright sigh would youlike to see her sir  the baby o yesyour baby you must christen her avice  yesso i will she murmured readily and disclosed the infant with some timidity i hope you forgive me sir for concealing my thoughtless marriage  if you forgive me for making love to you  yes how were you to know i wish  pierston bade her goodbye kissing her hand turned from her and the incipient being whom he was to meet again under very altered conditions and left the bedchamber with a tear in his eye  here endeth that dream said he                          hymen in secret or overt guise seemed to haunt pierston just at this time with undignified mockery which savoured rather of harlequin than of the torchbearer two days after parting in a lone island from the girl he had so disinterestedly loved he met in piccadilly his friend somers wonderfully spruced up and hastening along with a preoccupied face  my dear fellow said somers what do you think i was charged not to tell you but hang it i may just as well make a clean breast of it now as later  whatyou are not going to began pierston with divination  yes what i said on impulse six months back i am about to carry out in cold blood nichola and i began in jest and ended in earnest we are going to take one another next month for good and all     part third  a young man of sixty       in me thou seest the glowing of such fire       that on the ashes of his youth doth lie       as the deathbed whereon it must expire       consumed with that which it was nourished by                                     w shakespeare     3 i she returns for the new season  twenty years had spread their films over the events which wound up with the reunion of the second avice and her husband and the hoary peninsula called an island looked just the same as before though many who had formerly projected their daily shadows upon its unrelieved summer whiteness ceased now to disturb the colourless sunlight there  the general change nevertheless was small the silent ships came and went from the wharf the chisels clinked in the quarries file after file of whiteybrown horses in strings of eight or ten painfully dragged down the hill the square blocks of stone on the antediluvian wooden wheels just as usual the lightship winked every night from the quicksands to the beal lantern and the beal lantern glared through its eyeglass on the ship the canine gnawing audible on the pebblebank had been repeated ever since at each tide but the pebbles remained undevoured  men drank smoked and spat in the inns with only a little more adulteration in their refreshments and a trifle less dialect in their speech than of yore but one figure had never been seen on the channel rock in the interval the form of pierston the sculptor whose first use of the chisel that rock had instigated  he had lived abroad a great deal and in fact at this very date he was staying at an hotel in rome though he had not once set eyes on avice since parting from her in the room with her firstborn he had managed to obtain tidings of her from time to time during the interval in this way pierston learnt that shortly after their resumption of a common life in her house ike had illused her till fortunately the business to which jocelyn had assisted him chancing to prosper he became immersed in its details and allowed avice to pursue her household courses without interference initiating that kind of domestic reconciliation which is so calm and durable having as its chief ingredient neither hate nor love but an allembracing indifference  at first pierston had sent her sums of money privately fearing lest her husband should deny her material comforts but he soon found to his great relief that such help was unnecessary social ambition prompting ike to set up as quite a gentlemanislander and to allow avice a scope for show which he would never have allowed in mere kindness  being in rome as aforesaid pierston returned one evening to his hotel to dine after spending the afternoon among the busts in the long gallery of the vatican the unconscious habit common to so many people of tracing likes in unlikes had often led him to discern or to fancy he discerned in the roman atmosphere in its lights and shades and particularly in its reflected or secondary lights something resembling the atmosphere of his native promontory perhaps it was that in each case the eye was mostly resting on stonethat the quarries of ruins in the eternal city reminded him of the quarries of maiden rock at home  this being in his mind when he sat down to dinner at the common table he was surprised to hear an american gentleman who sat opposite mention the name of pierstons birthplace the american was talking to a friend about a ladyan english widow whose acquaintance they had renewed somewhere in the channel islands during a recent tour after having known her as a young woman who came to san francisco with her father and mother many years before her father was then a rich man just retired from the business of a stonemerchant in the isle of slingers but he had engaged in large speculations and had lost nearly all his fortune jocelyn further gathered that the widowed daughters name was mrs leverre that she had a stepson her husband having been a jersey gentleman a widower and that the stepson seemed to be a promising and interesting young man  pierston was instantly struck with the perception that these and other allusions though general were in accord with the history of his longlost marcia he hardly felt any desire to hunt her up after nearly two score years of separation but he was impressed enough to resolve to exchange a word with the strangers as soon as he could get opportunity  he could not well attract their attention through the plants upon the wide table and even if he had been able he was disinclined to ask questions in public he waited on till dinner was over and when the strangers withdrew pierston withdrew in their rear  they were not in the drawingroom and he found that they had gone out there was no chance of overtaking them but pierston waked to restlessness by their remarks wandered up and down the adjoining piazza di spagna thinking they might return the streets below were immersed in shade the front of the church of the trinita de monti at the top was flooded with orange light the gloom of evening gradually intensifying upon the broad long flight of steps which footpassengers incessantly ascended and descended with the insignificance of ants the dusk wrapped up the house to the left in which shelley had lived and that to the right in which keats had died  getting back to the hotel he learnt that the americans had only dropped in to dine and were staying elsewhere he saw no more of them and on reflection he was not deeply concerned for what earthly woman going off in a freak as marcia had done and keeping silence so long would care for a belated friendship with him now in the sere even if he were to take the trouble to discover her                                              thus much marcia the other thread of his connection with the ancient isle of slingers was stirred by a letter he received from avice a little after this date in which she stated that her husband ike had been killed in his own quarry by an accident within the past year that she herself had been ill and though well again and left amply provided for she would like to see him if he ever came that way  as she had not communicated for several long years her expressed wish to see him now was likely to be prompted by something more something newer than memories of him yet the manner of her writing precluded all suspicion that she was thinking of him as an old lover whose suit events had now made practicable he told her he was sorry to hear that she had been ill and that he would certainly take an early opportunity of going down to her home on his next visit to england  he did more her request had revived thoughts of his old home and its associations and instead of awaiting other reasons for a return he made her the operating one about a week later he stood once again at the foot of the familiar steep whereon the houses at the entrance to the isle were perched like grey pigeons on a roofside  at topohillas the summit of the rock was mostly calledhe stood looking at the busy doings in the quarries beyond where the numerous black hoistingcranes scattered over the central plateau had the appearance of a swarm of craneflies resting there he went a little further made some general inquiries about the accident which had carried off avices husband in the previous year and learnt that though now a widow she had plenty of friends and sympathizers about her which rendered any immediate attention to her on his part unnecessary considering therefore that there was no great reason why he should call on her so soon and without warning he turned back perhaps after all her request had been dictated by a momentary feeling only and a considerable strangeness to each other must naturally be the result of a score of dividing years descending to the bottom he took his seat in the train on the shore which soon carried him along the bank and round to the wateringplace five miles off at which he had taken up his quarters for a few days  here as he stayed on his local interests revived whenever he went out he could see the island that was once his home lying like a great snail upon the sea across the bay it was the spring of the year local steamers had begun to run and he was never tired of standing on the thinly occupied deck of one of these as it skirted the island and revealed to him on the cliffs far up its height the ruins of redking castle behind which the little village of east quarriers lay  thus matters went on if they did not rather stand still for several days before pierston redeemed his vague promise to seek avice out and in the meantime he was surprised by the arrival of another letter from her by a roundabout route she had heard she said that he had been on the island and imagined him therefore to be staying somewhere near why did he not call as he had told her he would do she was always thinking of him and wishing to see him  her tone was anxious and there was no doubt that she really had something to say which she did not want to write he wondered what it could be and started the same afternoon  avice who had been little in his mind of late years began to renew for herself a distinct position therein he was fully aware that since his earlier manhood a change had come over his regard of womankind once the individual had been nothing more to him than the temporary abidingplace of the typical or ideal now his heart showed its bent to be a growing fidelity to the specimen with all her pathetic flaws of detail which flaws so far from sending him further increased his tenderness this maturer feeling if finer and higher was less convenient than the old ardours of passion could be felt as in youth without the recuperative intervals which had accompanied evanescence  the first sensation was to find that she had long ceased to live in the little freehold cottage she had occupied of old in answer to his inquiries he was directed along the road to the west of the modern castle past the entrance on that side and onward to the very house that had once been his own home there it stood as of yore facing up the channel a comfortable roomy structure the euonymus and other shrubs which alone would stand in the teeth of the salt wind living on at about the same stature in front of it but the paintwork much renewed a thriving man had resided there of late evidently  the widow in mourning who received him in the front parlour was alas but the sorry shadow of avice the second how could he have fancied otherwise after twenty years yet he had been led to fancy otherwise almost without knowing it by feeling himself unaltered indeed curiously enough nearly the first words she said to him were whyyou are just the same  just the same yes i am avice he answered sadly for this inability to ossify with the rest of his generation threw him out of proportion with the time moreover while wearing the aspect of comedy it was of the nature of tragedy  it is well to be you sir she went on i have had troubles to take the bloom off me  yes i have been sorry for you  she continued to regard him curiously with humorous interest and he knew what was passing in her mind that this man to whom she had formerly looked up as to a person far in advance of her along the lane of life seemed now to be a welladjusted contemporary the pair of them observing the world with fairly level eyes  he had come to her with warmth for a vision which on reaching her he found to have departed and though fairly weaned by the natural reality he was so far staunch as to linger hankeringly they talked of past days his old attachment which she had then despised being now far more absorbing and present to her than to himself  she unmistakably won upon him as he sat on a curious closeness between them had been produced in his imagination by the discovery that she was passing her life within the house of his own childhood her similar surname meant little here but it was also his and added to the identity of domicile lent a strong suggestiveness to the accident  this is where i used to sit when my parents occupied the house he said placing himself beside that corner of the fireplace which commanded a view through the window i could see a bough of tamarisk wave outside at that time and beyond the bough the same abrupt grassy waste towards the sea and at night the same old lightship blinking far out there place yourself on the spot to please me  she set her chair where he indicated and pierston stood close beside her directing her gaze to the familiar objects he had regarded thence as a boy her head and facethe latter thoughtful and worn enough poor thing to suggest a married life none too comfortablewere close to his breast and with a few inches further incline would have touched it  and now you are the inhabitant i the visitor he said i am glad to see you hereso glad avice you are fairly well provided fori think i may assume that he looked round the room at the solid mahogany furniture and at the modern piano and show bookcase  yes ike left me comfortable twas he who thought of moving from my cottage to this larger house he bought it and i can live here as long as i choose to  apart from the decline of his adoration to friendship there seemed to be a general convergence of positions which suggested that he might make amends for the desertion of avice the first by proposing to this avice when a meet time should arrive if he did not love her as he had done when she was a slim thing catching mice in his rooms in london he could surely be content at his age with comradeship after all she was only forty to his sixty the feeling that he really could be thus content was so convincing that he almost believed the luxury of getting old and reposeful was coming to his restless wandering heart at last  well you have come at last sir she went on and i am grateful to you i did not like writing and yet i wanted to be straightforward have you guessed at all why i wished to see you so much that i could not help sending twice to you  i have tried but cannot  try again it is a pretty reason which i hope youll forgive  i am sure i shant unriddle it but ill say this on my own account before you tell me i have always taken a lingering interest in you which you must value for what it is worth it originated so far as it concerns you personally with the sight of you in that cottage round the corner nineteen or twenty years ago when i became tenant of the castle opposite but that was not the very beginning the very beginning was a score of years before that when i a young fellow of oneandtwenty coming home here from london to see my father encountered a tender woman as like you as your double was much attracted by her as i saw her day after day flit past this window till i made it my business to accompany her in her walks awhile i as you know was not a staunch fellow and it all ended badly but at any rate you her daughter and i are friends  ah there she is suddenly exclaimed avice whose attention had wandered somewhat from his retrospective discourse she was looking from the window towards the cliffs where upon the open ground quite near at hand a slender female form was seen rambling along she is out for a walk avice continued i wonder if she is going to call here this afternoon she is living at the castle opposite as governess  o shes  yes her education was very thoroughbetter even than her grandmothers i was the neglected one and her father and myself both vowed that there should be no complaint on that score about her we christened her avice to keep up the name as you requested i wish you could speak to heri am sure you would like her  is that the baby faltered jocelyn  yes the baby  the person signified now much nearer was a still more modernized uptodate edition of the two avices of that blood with whom he had been involved more or less for the last forty years a ladylike creature was shealmost elegant she was altogether finer in figure than her mother or grandmother had ever been which made her more of a woman in appearance than in years she wore a largedisked sunhat with a brim like a wheel whose spokes were radiating folds of muslin lining the brim a black margin beyond the muslin being the felloe beneath this brim her hair was massed low upon her brow the colour of the thick tresses being probably from her complexion repeated in the irises of her large deep eyes her rather nervous lips were thin and closed so that they only appeared as a delicate red line a changeable temperament was shown by that mouthquick transitions from affection to aversion from a pout to a smile  it was avice the third  jocelyn and the second avice continued to gaze ardently at her  ah she is not coming in now she hasnt time murmured the mother with some disappointment perhaps she means to run across in the evening  the tall girl in fact went past and on till she was out of sight pierston stood as in a dream it was the very she in all essential particulars and with an intensification of general charm who had kissed him forty years before when he turned his head from the window his eyes fell again upon the intermediate avice at his side before but the relic of the wellbeloved she had now become its empty shrine warm friendship indeed he felt for her but whatever that might have done towards the instauration of a former dream was now hopelessly barred by the rivalry of the thing itself in the guise of a lineal successor     3 ii misgivings on the reembodiment  pierston had been about to leave but he sat down again on being asked if he would stay and have a cup of tea he hardly knew for a moment what he did a dim thought that avicethe renewed avicemight come into the house made his reseating himself an act of spontaneity  he forgot that twenty years earlier he had called the now mrs pierston an elf a witch and that lapse of time had probably not diminished the subtleties implied by those epithets he did not know that she had noted every impression that her daughter had made upon him  how he contrived to attenuate and disperse the rather tender personalities he had opened up with the new avices mother pierston never exactly defined perhaps she saw more than he thought she sawread something in his faceknew that about his nature which he gave her no credit for knowing anyhow the conversation took the form of a friendly gossip from that minute his remarks being often given while his mind was turned elsewhere  but a chill passed through jocelyn when there had been time for reflection the renewed study of his art in rome without any counterbalancing practical pursuit had nourished and developed his natural responsiveness to impressions he now felt that his old trouble his doomhis curse indeed he had sometimes called itwas come back again his divinity was not yet propitiated for that original sin against her image in the person of avice the first and now at the age of oneandsixty he was urged on and on like the jew ahasuerusor in the phrase of the islanders themselves like a blind ram  the goddess an abstraction to the general was a fairly real personage to pierston he had watched the marble images of her which stood in his workingroom under all changes of light and shade in the brightening of morning in the blackening of eve in moonlight in lamplight every line and curve of her body none naturally knew better than he and though not a belief it was as has been stated a formula a superstition that the three avices were interpenetrated with her essence  and the next aviceyour daughter he said stumblingly she is you say a governess at the castle opposite  mrs pierston reaffirmed the fact adding that the girl often slept at home because she her mother was so lonely she often thought she would like to keep her daughter at home altogether  she plays that instrument i suppose said pierston regarding the piano  yes she plays beautifully she had the best instruction that masters could give her she was educated at sandbourne  which room does she call hers when at home he asked curiously  the little one over this  it had been his own strange he murmured  he finished tea and sat after tea but the youthful avice did not arrive with the avice present he conversed as the old friendno more at last it grew dusk and pierston could not find an excuse for staying longer  i hope to make the acquaintanceof your daughter he said in leaving knowing that he might have added with predestinate truth of my new tenderlybeloved  i hope you will she answered this evening she evidently has gone for a walk instead of coming here  and bythebye you have not told me what you especially wanted to see me for  ah no i will put it off  very well i dont pretend to guess  i must tell you another time  if it is any little business in connection with your late husbands affairs do command me ill do anything i can  thank you and i shall see you again soon  certainly quite soon  when he was gone she looked reflectively at the spot where he had been standing and said best hold my tongue it will work of itself without my telling  jocelyn went from the house but as the white road passed under his feet he felt in no mood to get back to his lodgings in the town on the mainland he lingered about upon the rugged ground for a long while thinking of the extraordinary reproduction of the original girl in this new form he had seen and of himself as of a foolish dreamer in being so suddenly fascinated by the renewed image in a personality not onethird of his age as a physical fact no doubt the preservation of the likeness was no uncommon thing here but it helped the dream  passing round the walls of the new castle he deviated from his homeward track by turning down the familiar little lane which led to the ruined castle of the red king it took him past the cottage in which the new avice was born from whose precincts he had heard her first infantine cry pausing he saw near the west behind him the new moon growing distinct upon the glow  he was subject to gigantic fantasies still in spite of himself the sight of the new moon as representing one who by her socalled inconstancy acted up to his own idea of a migratory wellbeloved made him feel as if his wraith in a changed sex had suddenly looked over the horizon at him in a crowd secretly or in solitude boldly he had often bowed the knee three times to this sisterly divinity on her first appearance monthly and directed a kiss towards her shining shape the curse of his qualities if it were not a blessing was far from having spent itself yet  in the other direction the castle ruins rose square and dusky against the sea he went on towards these around which he had played as a boy and stood by the walls at the edge of the cliff pondering there was no wind and but little tide and he thought he could hear from years ago a voice that he knew it certainly was a voice but it came from the rocks beneath the castle ruin  mrs atway  a silence followed and nobody came the voice spoke again john stoney  neither was this summons attended to the cry continued with more entreaty william scribben  the voice was that of a pierstonthere could be no doubt of ityoung avices surely something or other seemed to be detaining her down there against her will a sloping path beneath the beetling cliff and the castle walls rising sheer from its summit led down to the lower level whence the voice proceeded pierston followed the pathway and soon beheld a girl in light clothingthe same he had seen through the windowstanding upon one of the rocks apparently unable to move pierston hastened across to her  o thank you for coming she murmured with some timidity i have met with an awkward mishap i live near here and am not frightened really my foot has become jammed in a crevice of the rock and i cannot get it out try how i will what shall i do  jocelyn stooped and examined the cause of discomfiture i think if you can take your boot off he said your foot might slip out leaving the boot behind  she tried to act upon this advice but could not do so effectually pierston then experimented by slipping his hand into the crevice till he could just reach the buttons of her boot which however he could not unfasten any more than she taking his penknife from his pocket he tried again and cut off the buttons one by one the boot unfastened and out slipped the foot  o how glad i am she cried joyfully i was fearing i should have to stay here all night how can i thank you enough  he was tugging to withdraw the boot but no skill that he could exercise would move it without tearing at last she said dont try any longer it is not far to the house i can walk in my stocking  ill assist you in he said  she said she did not want help nevertheless allowed him to help her on the unshod side as they moved on she explained that she had come out through the garden door had been standing on the boulders to look at something out at sea just discernible in the evening light as assisted by the moon and in jumping down had wedged her foot as he had found it  whatever pierstons years might have made him look by day in the dusk of evening he was fairly presentable as a pleasing man of no marked antiquity his outline differing but little from what it had been when he was half his years he was well preserved still upright trimly shaven agile in movement wore a tightly buttoned suit which set of a naturally slight figure in brief he might have been of any age as he appeared to her at this moment she talked to him with the coequality of one who assumed him to be not far ahead of her own generation and as the growing darkness obscured him more and more he adopted her assumption of his age with increasing boldness of tone  the flippant harmless freedom of the wateringplace miss which avice had plainly acquired during her sojourn at the sandbourne school helped pierston greatly in this role of jeune premier which he was not unready to play not a word did he say about being a native of the island still more carefully did he conceal the fact of his having courted her grandmother and engaged himself to marry that attractive lady  he found that she had come out upon the rocks through the same little private door from the lawn of the modern castle which had frequently afforded him egress to the same spot in years long past pierston accompanied her across the grounds almost to the entrance of the mansionthe place being now far better kept and planted than when he had rented it as a lonely tenant almost indeed restored to the order and neatness which had characterized it when he was a boy  like her granny she was too inexperienced to be reserved and during this little climb leaning upon his arm there was time for a great deal of confidence when he had bidden her farewell and she had entered leaving him in the dark a rush of sadness through pierstons soul swept down all the temporary pleasure he had found in the charming girls company had mephistopheles sprung from the ground there and then with an offer to jocelyn of restoration to youth on the usual terms of his firm the sculptor might have consented to sell a part of himself which he felt less immediate need of than of a ruddy lip and cheek and an unploughed brow  but what could only have been treated as a folly by outsiders was almost a sorrow for him why was he born with such a temperament and this concatenated interest could hardly have arisen even with pierston but for a conflux of circumstances only possible here the three avices the second something like the first the third a glorification of the first at all events externally were the outcome of the immemorial island customs of intermarriage and of prenuptial union under which conditions the type of feature was almost uniform from parent to child through generations so that till quite latterly to have seen one native man and woman was to have seen the whole population of that isolated rock so nearly cut off from the mainland his own predisposition and the sense of his early faithlessness did all the rest  he turned gloomily away and let himself out of the precincts before walking along the couple of miles of road which would conduct him to the little station on the shore he redescended to the rocks whereon he had found her and searched about for the fissure which had made a prisoner of this terribly belated edition of the beloved kneeling down beside the spot he inserted his hand and ultimately by much wriggling withdrew the pretty boot he mused over it for a moment put it in his pocket and followed the stony route to the street of wells     3 iii the renewed image burns itself in  there was nothing to hinder pierston in calling upon the new avices mother as often as he should choose beyond the five miles of intervening railway and additional mile or two of clambering over the heights of the island two days later therefore he repeated his journey and knocked about teatime at the widows door  as he had feared the daughter was not at home he sat down beside the old sweetheart who having eclipsed her mother in past days had now eclipsed herself in her child jocelyn produced the girls boot from his pocket  then tis you who helped avice out of her predicament said mrs pierston with surprise  yes my dear friend and perhaps i shall ask you to help me out of mine before i have done but never mind that now what did she tell you about the adventure  mrs pierston was looking thoughtfully upon him well tis rather strange it should have been you sir she replied she seemed to be a good deal interested i thought it might have been a younger mana much younger man  it might have been as far as feelings were concerned now avice ill to the point at once virtually i have known your daughter any number of years when i talk to her i can anticipate every turn of her thought every sentiment every act so long did i study those things in your mother and in you therefore i do not require to learn her she was learnt by me in her previous existences now dont be shocked i am willing to marry heri should be overjoyed to do it if there would be nothing preposterous about it or that would seem like a man making himself too much of a fool and so degrading her in consenting i can make her comparatively rich as you know and i would indulge her every whim there is the idea bluntly put it would set right something in my mind that has been wrong for forty years after my death she would have plenty of freedom and plenty of means to enjoy it  mrs isaac pierston seemed only a little surprised certainly not shocked  well if i didnt think you might be a bit taken with her she said with an arch simplicity which could hardly be called unaffected knowing the set of your mind from my little time with you years ago nothing you could do in this way would astonish me  but you dont think badly of me for it  not at all bythebye did you ever guess why i asked you to come but never mind it now the matter is past of course it would depend upon what avice felt perhaps she would rather marry a younger man  and suppose a satisfactory younger man should not appear  mrs pierston showed in her face that she fully recognized the difference between a rich bird in hand and a young bird in the bush she looked him curiously up and down  i know you would make anybody a very nice husband she said i know that you would be nicer than many men half your age and though there is a great deal of difference between you and her there have been more unequal marriages thats true speaking as her mother i can say that i shouldnt object to you sir for her provided she liked you that is where the difficulty will lie  i wish you would help me to get over that difficulty he said gently remember i brought back a truant husband to you twenty years ago  yes you did she assented and though i may say no great things as to happiness came of it ive always seen that your intentions towards me were none the less noble on that account i would do for you what i would do for no other man and there is one reason in particular which inclines me to help you with avicethat i should feel absolutely certain i was helping her to a kind husband  well that would remain to be seen i would at any rate try to be worthy of your opinion come avice for old times sake you must help me you never felt anything but friendship in those days you know and that makes it easy and proper for you to do me a good turn now  after a little more conversation his old friend promised that she really would do everything that lay in her power she did not say how simple she thought him not to perceive that she had already by writing to him been doing everything that lay in her power had created the feeling which prompted his entreaty and to show her good faith in this promise she asked him to wait till later in the evening when avice might possibly run across to see her  pierston who fancied he had won the younger avices interest at least by the part he had played upon the rocks the week before had a dread of encountering her in full light till he should have advanced a little further in her regard he accordingly was perplexed at this proposal and seeing his hesitation mrs pierston suggested that they should walk together in the direction whence avice would come if she came at all  he welcomed the idea and in a few minutes they started strolling along under the now strong moonlight and when they reached the gates of sylvania castle turning back again towards the house after two or three such walks up and down the gate of the castle grounds clicked and a form came forth which proved to be the expected one  as soon as they met the girl recognized in her mothers companion the gentleman who had helped her on the shore and she seemed really glad to find that her chivalrous assistant was claimed by her parent as an old friend she remembered hearing at divers times about this worthy london man of talent and position whose ancestry were people of her own isle and possibly from the name of a common stock with her own  and you have actually lived in sylvania castle yourself mr pierston asked avice the daughter with her innocent young voice was it long ago  yes it was some time ago replied the sculptor with a sinking at his heart lest she should ask how long  it must have been when i was awayor when i was very little  i dont think you were away  but i dont think i could have been here  no perhaps you couldnt have been here  i think she was hiding herself in the parsleybed said avices mother blandly  they talked in this general way till they reached mrs pierstons house but jocelyn resisted both the widows invitation and the desire of his own heart and went away without entering to risk by visibly confronting her the advantage that he had already gained or fancied he had gained with the reincarnate avice required more courage than he could claim in his present mood                                              such evening promenades as these were frequent during the waxing of that summer moon on one occasion as they were all good walkers it was arranged that they should meet halfway between the island and the town in which pierston had lodgings it was impossible that by this time the pretty young governess should not have guessed the ultimate reason of these rambles to be a matrimonial intention but she inclined to the belief that the widow rather than herself was the object of pierstons regard though why this educated and apparently wealthy man should be attracted by her motherwhose homeliness was apparent enough to the girls more modern trainingshe could not comprehend  they met accordingly in the middle of the pebblebank pierston coming from the mainland and the women from the peninsular rock crossing the wooden bridge which connected the bank with the shore proper they moved in the direction of henry the eighths castle on the verge of the ragstone cliff like the red kings castle on the island the interior was open to the sky and when they entered and the full moon streamed down upon them over the edge of the enclosing masonry the whole present reality faded from jocelyns mind under the press of memories neither of his companions guessed what pierston was thinking of it was in this very spot that he was to have met the grandmother of the girl at his side and in which he would have met her had she chosen to keep the appointment a meeting which mightnay musthave changed the whole current of his life  instead of that forty years had passedforty years of severance from avice till a secondly renewed copy of his sweetheart had arisen to fill her place but he alas was not renewed and of all this the pretty young thing at his side knew nothing  taking advantage of the younger womans retreat to view the sea through an opening of the walls pierston appealed to her mother in a whisper have you ever given her a hint of what my meaning is no then i think you might if you really have no objection  mrs pierston as the widow was far from being so coldly disposed in her own person towards her friend as in the days when he wanted to marry her had she now been the object of his wishes he would not have needed to ask her twice but like a good mother she stifled all this and said she would sound avice there and then  avice my dear she said advancing to where the girl mused in the windowgap what do you think of mr pierston paying his addresses to youcoming courting as i call it in my oldfashioned way supposing he were to would you encourage him  to me mother said avice with an inquiring laugh i thoughthe meant you  o no he doesnt mean me said her mother hastily he is nothing more than my friend  i dont want any addresses said the daughter  he is a man in society and would take you to an elegant house in london suited to your education instead of leaving you to mope here  i should like that well enough replied avice carelessly  then give him some encouragement  i dont care enough about him to do any encouraging it is his business i should think to do all  she spoke in her lightest vein but the result was that when pierston who had discreetly withdrawn returned to them she walked docilely though perhaps gloomily beside him her mother dropping to the rear they came to a rugged descent and pierston took her hand to help her she allowed him to retain it when they arrived on level ground  altogether it was not an unsuccessful evening for the man with the unanchored heart though possibly initial success meant worse for him in the long run than initial failure there was nothing marvellous in the fact of her tractability thus far in his modern dress and style under the rays of the moon he looked a very presentable gentleman indeed while his knowledge of art and his travelled manners were not without their attractions for a girl who with one hand touched the educated middleclass and with the other the rude and simple inhabitants of the isle her intensely modern sympathies were quickened by her peculiar outlook  pierston would have regarded his interest in her as overmuch selfish if there had not existed a redeeming quality in the substratum of old pathetic memory by which such love had been createdwhich still permeated it rendering it the tenderest most anxious most protective instinct he had ever known it may have had in its composition too much of the boyish fervour that had characterized such affection when he was cherrycheeked and light in the foot as a girl but if it was all this feeling of youth it was more  mrs pierston in fearing to be frank lest she might seem to be angling for his fortune did not fully divine his cheerful readiness to offer it if by so doing he could make amends for his infidelity to her family forty years back in the past time had not made him mercenary and it had quenched his ambitions and though his wish to wed avice was not entirely a wish to enrich her the knowledge that she would be enriched beyond anything that she could have anticipated was what allowed him to indulge his love  he was not exactly old he said to himself the next morning as he beheld his face in the glass and he looked considerably younger than he was but there was history in his facedistinct chapters of it his brow was not that blank page it once had been he knew the origin of that line in his forehead it had been traced in the course of a month or two by past troubles he remembered the coming of this pale wiry hair it had been brought by the illness in rome when he had wished each night that he might never wake again this wrinkled corner that drawn bit of skin they had resulted from those months of despondency when all seemed going against his art his strength his happiness you cannot live your life and keep it jocelyn he said time was against him and love and time would probably win  when i went away from the first avice he continued with whimsical misery i had a presentiment that i should ache for it some day and i am achinghave ached ever since this jade of an ideal learnt the unconscionable trick of inhabiting one image only  upon the whole he was not without a bodement that it would be folly to press on     3 iv a dash for the last incarnation  this desultory courtship of a young girl which had been brought about by her mothers contrivance was interrupted by the appearance of somers and his wife and family on the budmouth esplanade alfred somers once the youthful picturesque as his own paintings was now a middleaged family man with spectaclesspectacles worn too with the single object of seeing through themand a row of daughters tailing off to infancy who at present added appreciably to the income of the bathingmachine women established along the sands  mrs somersonce the intellectual emancipated mrs pineavonhad now retrograded to the petty and timid mental position of her mother and grandmother giving sharp strict regard to the current literature and art that reached the innocent presence of her long perspective of girls with the view of hiding every skull and skeleton of life from their dear eyes she was another illustration of the rule that succeeding generations of women are seldom marked by cumulative progress their advance as girls being lost in their recession as matrons so that they move up and down the stream of intellectual development like flotsam in a tidal estuary and this perhaps not by reason of their faults as individuals but of their misfortune as childrearers  the landscapepainter now an academician like pierston himselfrather popular than distinguishedhad given up that peculiar and personal taste in subjects which had marked him in times past executing instead many pleasing aspects of nature addressed to the furnishing householder through the middling critic and really very good of their kind in this way he received many large cheques from persons of wealth in england and america out of which he built himself a sumptuous studio and an awkward house around it and paid for the education of the growing maidens  the vision of somerss humble position as jackal to this lion of a family and house and studio and social reputationsomers to whom strange conceits and wild imaginings were departed joys never to returnled pierston as the painters contemporary to feel that he ought to be one of the bygones likewise and to put on an air of unromantic bufferism he refrained from entering avices peninsula for the whole fortnight of somerss stay in the neighbouring town although its grey poetical outlinethroned along the seagreeted his eyes every morn and eve across the roadstead  when the painter and his family had gone back from their bathing holiday he thought that he too would leave the neighbourhood to do so however without wishing at least the elder avice goodbye would be unfriendly considering the extent of their acquaintance one evening knowing this time of day to suit her best he took the fewminutes journey to the rock along the thin connecting string of junction and arrived at mrs pierstons door just after dark  a light shone from an upper chamber on asking for his widowed acquaintance he was informed that she was ill seriously though not dangerously while learning that her daughter was with her and further particulars and doubting if he should go in a message was sent down to ask him to enter his voice had been heard and mrs pierston would like to see him  he could not with any humanity refuse but there flashed across his mind the recollection that avice the youngest had never yet really seen him had seen nothing more of him than an outline which might have appertained as easily to a man thirty years his junior as to himself and a countenance so renovated by faint moonlight as fairly to correspond it was with misgiving therefore that the sculptor ascended the staircase and entered the little upper sittingroom now arranged as a sickchamber  mrs pierston reclined on a sofa her face emaciated to a surprising thinness for the comparatively short interval since her attack come in sir she said as soon as she saw him holding out her hand dont let me frighten you  avice was seated beside her reading the girl jumped up hardly seeming to recognize him o its mr pierston she said in a moment adding quickly with evident surprise and off her guard i thought mr pierston was  what she had thought he was did not pass her lips and it remained a riddle for jocelyn until a new departure in her manner towards him showed that the words much younger would have accurately ended the sentence had pierston not now confronted her anew he might have endured philosophically her changed opinion of him but he was seeing her again and a rooted feeling was revived  pierston now learnt for the first time that the widow had been visited by sudden attacks of this sort not infrequently of late years they were said to be due to angina pectoris the latter paroxysms having been the most severe she was at the present moment out of pain though weak exhausted and nervous she would not however converse about herself but took advantage of her daughters absence from the room to broach the subject most in her thoughts  no compunctions had stirred her as they had her visitor on the expediency of his suit in view of his years her fever of anxiety lest after all he should not come to see avice again had been not without an effect upon her health and it made her more candid than she had intended to be  troubles and sickness raise all sorts of fears mr pierston she said what i felt only a wish for when you first named it i have hoped for a good deal since and i have been so anxious thatthat it should come to something i am glad indeed that you are come  my wanting to marry avice you mean dear mrs pierston  yesthats it i wonder if you are still in the same mind you are then i wish something could be doneto make her agree to itso as to get it settled i dread otherwise what will become of her she is not a practical girl as i wasshe would hardly like now to settle down as an islanders wife and to leave her living here alone would trouble me  nothing will happen to you yet i hope my dear old friend  well it is a risky complaint and the attacks when they come are so agonizing that to endure them i ought to get rid of all outside anxieties folk say nowdo you want her sir  with all my soul but she doesnt want me  i dont think she is so against you as you imagine i fancy if it were put to her plainly now i am in this state it might be done  they lapsed into conversation on the early days of their acquaintance until mrs pierstons daughter reentered the room  avice said her mother when the girl had been with them a few minutes about this matter that i have talked over with you so many times since my attack here is mr pierston and he wishes to be your husband he is much older than you but in spite of it that you will ever get a better husband i dont believe now will you take him seeing the state i am in and how naturally anxious i am to see you settled before i die  but you wont die mother you are getting better  just for the present only come he is a good man and a clever man and a rich man i want you o so much to be his wife i can say no more  avice looked appealingly at the sculptor and then on the floor does he really wish me to she asked almost inaudibly turning as she spoke to pierston he has never quite said so to me  my dear one how can you doubt it said jocelyn quickly but i wont press you to marry me as a favour against your feelings  i thought mr pierston was younger she murmured to her mother  that counts for little when you think how much there is on the other side think of our position and of hisa sculptor with a mansion and a studio full of busts and statues that i have dusted in my time and of the beautiful studies you would be able to take up surely the life would just suit you your expensive education is wasted down here  avice did not care to argue she was outwardly gentle as her grandmother had been and it seemed just a question with her of whether she must or must not very welli feel i ought to agree to marry him since you tell me to she answered quietly after some thought i see that it would be a wise thing to do and that you wish it and that mr pierston really doeslike me soso that  pierston was not backward at this critical juncture despite unpleasant sensations but it was the historic ingredient in this genealogical passionif its continuity through three generations may be so describedwhich appealed to his perseverance at the expense of his wisdom the mother was holding the daughters hand she took pierstons and laid avices in it  no more was said in argument and the thing was regarded as determined afterwards a noise was heard upon the windowpanes as of fine sand thrown and lifting the blind pierston saw that the distant lightship winked with a bleared and indistinct eye a drizzling rain had come on with the dark and it was striking the window in handfuls he had intended to walk the two miles back to the station but it meant a drenching to do it now he waited and had supper and finding the weather no better accepted mrs pierstons invitation to stay over the night  thus it fell out that again he lodged in the house he had been accustomed to live in as a boy before his father had made his fortune and before his own name had been heard of outside the boundaries of the isle  he slept but little and in the first movement of the dawn sat up in bed why should he ever live in london or any other fashionable city if this plan of marriage could be carried out surely with this young wife the island would be the best place for him it might be possible to rent sylvania castle as he had formerly donebetter still to buy it if life could offer him anything worth having it would be a home with avice there on his native cliffs to the end of his days  as he sat thus thinking and the daylight increased he discerned a short distance before him a movement of something ghostly his position was facing the window and he found that by chance the lookingglass had swung itself vertical so that what he saw was his own shape the recognition startled him the person he appeared was too grievously far chronologically in advance of the person he felt himself to be pierston did not care to regard the figure confronting him so mockingly its voice seemed to say theres tragedy hanging on to this but the question of age being pertinent he could not give the spectre up and ultimately got out of bed under the weird fascination of the reflection whether he had overwalked himself lately or what he had done he knew not but never had he seemed so aged by a score of years as he was represented in the glass in that cold grey morning light while his soul was what it was why should he have been encumbered with that withering carcase without the ability to shift it off for another as his ideal beloved had so frequently done  by reason of her mothers illness avice was now living in the house and on going downstairs he found that they were to breakfast en teteatete she was not then in the room but she entered in the course of a few minutes pierston had already heard that the widow felt better this morning and elated by the prospect of sitting with avice at this meal he went forward to her joyously as soon as she saw him in the full stroke of day from the window she started and he then remembered that it was their first meeting under the solar rays  she was so overcome that she turned and left the room as if she had forgotten something when she reentered she was visibly pale she recovered herself and apologized she had been sitting up the night before the last she said and was not quite so well as usual  there may have been some truth in this but pierston could not get over that first scared look of hers it was enough to give daytime stability to his night views of a possible tragedy lurking in this wedding project he determined that at any cost to his heart there should be no misapprehension about him from this moment  miss pierston he said as they sat down since it is well you should know all the truth before we go any further that there may be no awkward discoveries afterwards i am going to tell you something about myselfif you are not too distressed to hear it  nolet me hear it  i was once the lover of your mother and wanted to marry her only she wouldnt or rather couldnt marry me  o how strange said the girl looking from him to the breakfast things and from the breakfast things to him mother has never told me that yet of course you might have been i mean you are old enough  he took the remark as a satire she had not intended o yesquite old enough he said grimly almost too old  too old for mother hows that  because i belonged to your grandmother  no how can that be  i was her lover likewise i should have married her if i had gone straight on instead of round the corner  but you couldnt have been mr pierston you are not old enough why how old are youyou have never told me  i am very old  my mothers and my grandmothers said she looking at him no longer as at a possible husband but as a strange fossilized relic in human form pierston saw it but meaning to give up the game he did not care to spare himself  your mothers and your grandmothers young man he repeated  and were you my greatgrandmothers too she asked with an expectant interest in his case as a drama that overcame her personal considerations for a moment  nonot your greatgrandmothers your imagination beats even my confessions but i am very old as you see  i did not know it said she in an appalled murmur you do not look so and i thought that what you looked you were  and youyou are very young he continued  a stillness followed during which she sat in a troubled constraint regarding him now and then with something in her open eyes and large pupils that might have been sympathy or nervousness pierston ate scarce any breakfast and rising abruptly from the table said he would take a walk on the cliffs as the morning was fine  he did so proceeding along the northeast heights for nearly a mile he had virtually given avice up but not formally his intention had been to go back to the house in halfanhour and pay a morning visit to the invalid but by not returning the plans of the previous evening might be allowed to lapse silently as mere pourparlers that had come to nothing in the face of avices want of love for him pierston accordingly went straight along and in the course of an hour was at his budmouth lodgings  nothing occurred till the evening to inform him how his absence had been taken then a note arrived from mrs pierston it was written in pencil evidently as she lay  i am alarmed she said at your going so suddenly avice seems to think she has offended you she did not mean to do that i am sure it makes me dreadfully anxious will you send a line surely you will not desert us nowmy heart is so set on my childs welfare  desert you i wont said jocelyn it is too much like the original case but i must let her desert me  on his return with no other object than that of wishing mrs pierston goodbye he found her painfully agitated she clasped his hand and wetted it with her tears  o dont be offended with her she cried shes young we are one peopledont marry a kimberlin it will break my heart if you forsake her now avice  the girl came my manner was hasty and thoughtless this morning she said in a low voice please pardon me i wish to abide by my promise  her mother still tearful again joined their hands and the engagement stood as before  pierston went back to budmouth but dimly seeing how curiously through his being a rich suitor ideas of beneficence and reparation were retaining him in the course arranged by her mother and urged by his own desire in the face of his understanding     3 v on the verge of possession  in anticipation of his marriage pierston had taken a new red house of the approved kensington pattern with a new studio at the back as large as a mediaeval barn hither in collusion with the elder avicewhose health had mended somewhathe invited mother and daughter to spend a week or two with him thinking thereby to exercise on the latters imagination an influence which was not practicable while he was a guest at their house and by interesting his betrothed in the fitting and furnishing of this residence to create in her an ambition to be its mistress  it was a pleasant reposeful time to be in town there was nobody to interrupt them in their proceedings and it being out of the season the largest tradesmen were as attentive to their wants as if those firms had never before been honoured with a single customer whom they really liked pierston and his guests almost equally inexperiencedfor the sculptor had nearly forgotten what knowledge of householding he had acquired earlier in lifecould consider and practise thoroughly a species of skeletondrill in receiving visitors when the pair should announce themselves as married and at home in the coming winter season  avice was charming even if a little cold he congratulated himself yet again that time should have reserved for him this final chance for one of the line she was somewhat like her mother whom he had loved in the flesh but she had the soul of her grandmother whom he had loved in the spiritand for that matter loved now only one criticism had he to pass upon his choice though in outward semblance her grandam idealized she had not the first avices candour but rather her mothers closeness he never knew exactly what she was thinking and feeling yet he seemed to have such prescriptive rights in women of her blood that her occasional want of confidence did not deeply trouble him  it was one of those ripe and mellow afternoons that sometimes colour london with their golden light at this time of the year and produce those marvellous sunset effects which if they were not known to be made up of kitchen coalsmoke and animal exhalations would be rapturously applauded behind the perpendicular oblique zigzagged and curved zinc tallboys that formed a grey pattern not unlike early gothic numerals against the sky the men and women on the tops of the omnibuses saw an irradiation of topaz hues darkened here and there into richest russet  there had been a sharp shower during the afternoon and pierstonwho had to take care of himselfhad worn a pair of goloshes on his short walk in the street he noiselessly entered the studio inside which some gleams of the same mellow light had managed to creep and where he guessed he should find his prospective wife and motherinlaw awaiting him with tea but only avice was there seated beside the teapot of brown delf which as artists they affected her back being toward him she was holding her handkerchief to her eyes and he saw that she was weeping silently  in another moment he perceived that she was weeping over a book by this time she had heard him and came forward he made it appear that he had not noticed her distress and they discussed some arrangements of furniture when he had taken a cup of tea she went away leaving the book behind her  pierston took it up the volume was an old schoolbook stievenards lectures francaises with her name in it as a pupil at sandbourne high school and datemarkings denoting lessons taken at a comparatively recent time for avice had been but a novice as governess when he discovered her  for a schoolgirlwhich she virtually wasto weep over a schoolbook was strange could she have been affected by some subject in the readings impossible pierston fell to thinking and zest died for the process of furnishing which he had undertaken so gaily somehow the bloom was again disappearing from his approaching marriage yet he loved avice more and more tenderly he feared sometimes that in the solicitousness of his affection he was spoiling her by indulging her every whim  he looked round the large and ambitious apartment now becoming clouded with shades out of which the white and cadaverous countenances of his studies casts and other lumber peered meditatively at him as if they were saying what are you going to do now old boy they had never looked like that while standing in his past homely workshop where all the real labours of his life had been carried out what should a man of his age who had not for years done anything to speak ofcertainly not to add to his reputation as an artistwant with a new place like this it was all because of the elect lady and she apparently did not want him  pierston did not observe anything further in avice to cause him misgiving till one dinnertime a week later towards the end of the visit then as he sat himself between her and her mother at their limited table he was struck with her nervousness and was tempted to say why are you troubled my little dearest in tones which disclosed that he was as troubled as she  am i troubled she said with a start turning her gentle hazel eyes upon him yes i suppose i am it is because i have received a letterfrom an old friend  you didnt show it to me said her mother  noi tore it up  why  it was not necessary to keep it so i destroyed it  mrs pierston did not press her further on the subject and avice showed no disposition to continue it they retired rather early as they always did but pierston remained pacing about his studio a long while musing on many things not the least being the perception that to wed a woman may be by no means the same thing as to be united with her the old friend of avices remark had sounded very much like lover otherwise why should the letter have so greatly disturbed her  there seemed to be something uncanny after all about london in its relation to his contemplated marriage when she had first come up she was easier with him than now and yet his bringing her there had helped his cause the house had decidedly impressed heralmost overawed her and though he owned that by no law of nature or reason had her mother or himself any right to urge on avice partnership with him against her inclination he resolved to make the most of having her under his influence by getting the wedding details settled before she and her mother left  the next morning he proceeded to do this when he encountered avice there was a trace of apprehension on her face but he set that down to a fear that she had offended him the night before by her taciturnity directly he requested her mother in avices presence to get her to fix the day quite early mrs pierston became brighter and brisker she too plainly had doubts about the wisdom of delay and turning to her daughter said now my dear do you hear  it was ultimately agreed that the widow and her daughter should go back in a day or two to await pierstons arrival on the weddingeve immediately after their return                                              in pursuance of the arrangement pierston found himself on the south shore of england in the gloom of the aforesaid evening the isle as he looked across at it with his approach being just discernible as a moping countenance a creature sullen with a sense that he was about to withdraw from its keeping the rarest object it had ever owned he had come alone not to embarrass them and had intended to halt a couple of hours in the neighbouring seaport to give some orders relating to the wedding but the little railway train being in waiting to take him on he proceeded with a natural impatience resolving to do his business here by messenger from the isle  he passed the ruins of the tudor castle and the long featureless rib of grinding pebbles that screened off the outer sea which could be heard lifting and dipping rhythmically in the wide vagueness of the bay at the underhill island townlet of the wells there were no flys and leaving his things to be brought on as he often did he climbed the eminence on foot  halfway up the steepest part of the pass he saw in the dusk a figure pausingthe single person on the incline though it was too dark to identify faces pierston gathered from the way in which the halting stranger was supporting himself by the handrail which here bordered the road to assist climbers that the person was exhausted  anything the matter he said  o nonot much was returned by the other but it is steep just here  the accent was not quite that of an englishman and struck him as hailing from one of the channel islands cant i help you up to the top he said for the voice though that of a young man seemed faint and shaken  no thank you i have been ill but i thought i was all right again and as the night was fine i walked into the island by the road it turned out to be rather too much for me as there is some weakness left still and this stiff incline brought it out  naturally youd better take hold of my armat any rate to the brow here  thus pressed the stranger did so and they went on towards the ridge till reaching the limekiln standing there the stranger abandoned his hold saying thank you for your assistance sir goodnight  i dont think i recognize your voice as a natives  no it is not i am a jersey man goodnight sir  goodnight if you are sure you can get on here take this stickit is no use to me saying which pierston put his walkingstick into the young mans hand  thank you again i shall be quite recovered when i have rested a minute or two dont let me detain you please  the stranger as he spoke turned his face towards the south where the beal light had just come into view and stood regarding it with an obstinate fixity as he evidently wished to be left to himself jocelyn went on and troubled no more about him though the desire of the young man to be rid of his company after accepting his walkingstick and his arm had come with a suddenness that was almost emotional and impressionable as jocelyn was no less now than in youth he was saddened for a minute by the sense that there were people in the world who did not like even his sympathy  however a pleasure which obliterated all this arose when pierston drew near to the house that was likely to be his dear home on all future visits to the isle perhaps even his permanent home as he grew older and the associations of his youth reasserted themselves it had been too his fathers house the house in which he was born and he amused his fancy with plans for its enlargement under the supervision of avice and himself it was a still greater pleasure to behold a tall and shapely figure standing against the light of the open door and presumably awaiting him  avice who it was gave a little jump when she recognized him but dutifully allowed him to kiss her when he reached her side though her nervousness was only too apparent and was like a childs towards a parent who may prove stern  how dear of you to guess that i might come on at once instead of later said jocelyn well if i had stayed in the town to go to the shops and so on i could not have got here till the last train how is motherour mother as i shall call her soon  avice said that her mother had not been so wellshe feared not nearly so well since her return from london so that she was obliged to keep her room the visit had perhaps been too much for her but she will not acknowledge that she is much weaker because she will not disturb my happiness  jocelyn was in a mood to let trifles of manner pass and he took no notice of the effort which had accompanied the last word they went upstairs to mrs pierston whose obvious relief and thankfulness at sight of him was grateful to her visitor  i am so o so glad you are come she said huskily as she held out her thin hand and stifled a sob i have been so  she could get no further for a moment and avice turned away weeping and abruptly left the room  i have so set my heart on this mrs pierston went on that i have not been able to sleep of late for i have feared i might drop off suddenly before she is yours and lose the comfort of seeing you actually united your being so kind to me in old times has made me so sure that she will find a good husband in you that i am over anxious i know indeed i have not liked to let her know quite how anxious i am  thus they talked till jocelyn bade her goodnight it being noticeable that mrs pierston chastened by her illnesses maintained no longer any reserve on her gladness to acquire him as her soninlaw and her feelings destroyed any remaining scruples he might have had from perceiving that avices consent was rather an obedience than a desire as he went downstairs and found avice awaiting his descent he wondered if anything had occurred here during his absence to give mrs pierston new uneasiness about the marriage but it was an inquiry he could not address to a girl whose actions could alone be the cause of such uneasiness  he looked round for her as he supped but though she had come into the room with him she was not there now he remembered her telling him that she had had supper with her mother and jocelyn sat on quietly musing and sipping his wine for something near halfanhour wondering then for the first time what had become of her he rose and went to the door avice was quite near him after allonly standing at the front door as she had been doing when he came looking into the light of the full moon which had risen since his arrival his sudden opening of the diningroom door seemed to agitate her  what is it dear he asked  as mother is much better and doesnt want me i ought to go and see somebody i promised to take a parcel toi feel i ought and yet as you have just come to see mei suppose you dont approve of my going out while you are here  who is the person  somebody down that way she said indefinitely it is not very far off i am not afraidi go out often by myself at night hereabout  he reassured her goodhumouredly if you really wish to go my dear of course i dont object i have no authority to do that till tomorrow and you know that if i had it i shouldnt use it  o but you have mother being an invalid you are in her place apart fromtomorrow  nonsense darling run across to your friends house by all means if you want to  and youll be here when i come in  no i am going down to the inn to see if my things are brought up  but hasnt mother asked you to stay here the spare room was got ready for you dear me i am afraid i ought to have told you  she did ask me but i have some things coming directed to the inn and i had better be there so ill wish you goodnight though it is not late i will come in quite early tomorrow to inquire how your mother is going on and to wish you goodmorning you will be back again quickly this evening  o yes  and i neednt go with you for company  o no thank you it is no distance  pierston then departed thinking how entirely her manner was that of one to whom a question of doing anything was a question of permission and not of judgment he had no sooner gone than avice took a parcel from a cupboard put on her hat and cloak and following by the way he had taken till she reached the entrance to sylvania castle there stood still she could hear pierstons footsteps passing down east quarriers to the inn but she went no further in that direction turning into the lane on the right of which mention has so often been made she went quickly past the last cottage and having entered the gorge beyond she clambered into the ruin of the red kings or bowandarrow castle standing as a square black mass against the moonlit indefinite sea     3 vi the wellbeloved iswhere  mrs pierston passed a restless night but this she let nobody know nor what was painfully evident to herself that her prostration was increased by anxiety and suspense about the wedding on which she had too much set her heart  during the very brief space in which she dozed avice came into her room as it was not infrequent for her daughter to look in upon her thus she took little notice merely saying to assure the girl i am better dear dont come in again get to sleep yourself  the mother however went thinking anew she had no apprehensions about this marriage she felt perfectly sure that it was the best thing she could do for her girl not a young woman on the island but was envying avice at that moment for jocelyn was absurdly young for three score a goodlooking man one whose history was generally known here as also were the exact figures of the fortune he had inherited from his father and the social standing he could claima standing however which that fortune would not have been large enough to procure unassisted by his reputation in his art  but avice had been weak enough as her mother knew to indulge in fancies for local youths from time to time and mrs pierston could not help congratulating herself that her daughter had been so docile in the circumstances yet to every one except perhaps avice herself jocelyn was the most romantic of lovers indeed was there ever such a romance as that man embodied in his relations to her house rejecting the first avice the second had rejected him and to rally to the third with final achievement was an artistic and tender finish to which it was ungrateful in anybody to be blind  the widow thought that the second avice might probably not have rejected pierston on that occasion in the london studio so many years ago if destiny had not arranged that she should have been secretly united to another when the proposing moment came  but what had come was best my god she said at times that night to think my aim in writing to him should be fulfilling itself like this  when all was right and done what a success upon the whole her life would have been she who had begun her career as a cottagegirl a small quarryowners daughter had sunk so low as to the position of laundress had engaged in various menial occupations had made an unhappy marriage for love which had however in the long run thanks to jocelyns management much improved her position was at last to see her daughter secure what she herself had just missed securing and established in a home of affluence and refinement  thus the sick woman excited herself as the hours went on at last in her tenseness it seemed to her that the time had already come at which the household was stirring and she fancied she heard conversation in her daughters room but she found that it was only five oclock and not yet daylight her state was such that she could see the hangings of the bed tremble with her tremors she had declared overnight that she did not require any one to sit up with her but she now rang a little handbell and in a few minutes a nurse appeared ruth stockwool an island woman and neighbour whom mrs pierston knew well and who knew all mrs pierstons history  i am so nervous that i cant stay by myself said the widow and i thought i heard becky dressing miss avice in her wedding things  o nonot yet maam theres nobody up but ill get you something  when mrs pierston had taken a little nourishment she went on i cant help frightening myself with thoughts that she wont marry him you see he is older than avice  yes he is said her neighbour but i dont see how anything can hender the wedden now  avice you know had fancies at least one fancy for another man a young fellow of fiveandtwenty and shes been very secret and odd about it i wish she had raved and cried and had it out but shes been quite the other way i know shes fond of him still  whatthat young frenchman mr leverre o sandbourne ive heard a little of it but i should say there wadden much between em  i dont think there was but ive a sort of conviction that she saw him last night i believe it was only to bid him goodbye and return him some books he had given her but i wish she had never known him he is rather an excitable impulsive young man and he might make mischief he isnt a frenchman though he has lived in france his father was a jersey gentleman and on his becoming a widower he married as his second wife a native of this very island thats mainly why the young man is so at home in these parts  ahnow i follow ee she was a bencomb his stepmother i heard something about her years ago  yes her father had the biggest stonetrade on the island at one time but the name is forgotten here now he retired years before i was born however mother used to tell me that she was a handsome young woman who tried to catch mr pierston when he was a young man and scandalized herself a bit with him she went off abroad with her father who had made a fortune here but when he got over there he lost it nearly all in some way years after she married this jerseyman mr leverre who had been fond of her as a girl and she brought up his child as her own  mrs pierston paused but as ruth did not ask any question she presently resumed her selfrelieving murmur  how miss avice got to know the young man was in this way when mrs leverres husband died she came from jersey to live at sandbourne and made it her business one day to cross over to this place to make inquiries about mr jocelyn pierston as my name was pierston she called upon me with her son and so avice and he got acquainted when avice went back to sandbourne to the finishing school they kept up the acquaintance in secret he taught french somewhere there and does still i believe  well i hope shell forget en he idden good enough  i hope soi hope so now ill try to get a little nap  ruth stockwool went back to her room where finding it would not be necessary to get up for another hour she lay down again and soon slept her bed was close to the staircase from which it was divided by a lath partition only and her consciousness either was or seemed to be aroused by light brushing touches on the outside of the partition as of fingers feeling the way downstairs in the dark the slight noise passed and in a few seconds she dreamt or fancied she could hear the unfastening of the back door  she had nearly sunk into another sound sleep when precisely the same phenomena were repeated fingers brushing along the wall close to her head down downward the soft opening of the door its close and silence again  she now became clearly awake the repetition of the process had made the whole matter a singular one early as it was the first sounds might have been those of the housemaid descending though why she should have come down so stealthily and in the dark did not make itself clear but the second performance was inexplicable ruth got out of bed and lifted her blind the dawn was hardly yet pink and the light from the sandbank was not yet extinguished but the bushes of euonymus against the white palings of the front garden could be seen also the light surface of the road winding away like a riband to the north entrance of sylvania castle thence round to the village the cliffs and the cove behind upon the road two dark figures could just be discerned one a little way behind the other but overtaking and joining the foremost as ruth looked after all they might be quarriers or lighthousekeepers from the south of the island or fishermen just landed from a nights work there being nothing to connect them with the noises she had heard indoors she dismissed the whole subject and went to bed again                                              jocelyn had promised to pay an early visit to ascertain the state of mrs pierstons health after her nights rest her precarious condition being more obvious to him than to avice and making him a little anxious subsequent events caused him to remember that while he was dressing he casually observed two or three boatmen standing near the cliff beyond the village and apparently watching with deep interest what seemed to be a boat far away towards the opposite shore of south wessex at halfpast eight he came from the door of the inn and went straight to mrs pierstons on approaching he discovered that a strange expression which seemed to hang about the housefront that morning was more than a fancy the gate door and two windows being open though the blinds of other windows were not drawn up the whole lending a vacant dazed look to the domicile as of a person gaping in sudden stultification nobody answered his knock and walking into the diningroom he found that no breakfast had been laid his flashing thought was mrs pierston is dead  while standing in the room somebody came downstairs and jocelyn encountered ruth stockwool an open letter fluttering in her hand  o mr pierston mr pierston the lordalord  what mrs pierston  no no miss avice she is goneyesgone read ye this sir it was left in her bedroom and we be fairly gallied out of our senses  he took the letter and confusedly beheld that it was in two handwritings the first section being in avices  my dear motherhow ever will you forgive me for what i have done so deceitful as it seems and yet till this night i had no idea of deceiving either you or mr pierston  last night at ten oclock i went out as you may have guessed to see mr leverre for the last time and to give him back his books letters and little presents to me i went only a few stepsto bowandarrow castle where we met as we had agreed to do since he could not call when i reached the place i found him there waiting but quite ill he had been unwell at his mothers house for some days and had been obliged to stay in bed but he had got up on purpose to come and bid me goodbye the overexertion of the journey upset him and though we stayed and stayed till twelve oclock he felt quite unable to go back homeunable indeed to move more than a few yards i had tried so hard not to love him any longer but i loved him so now that i could not desert him and leave him out there to catch his death so i helped himnearly carrying himon and on to our door and then round to the back here he got a little better and as he could not stay there and everybody was now asleep i helped him upstairs into the room we had prepared for mr pierston if he should have wanted one i got him into bed and then fetched some brandy and a little of your tonic did you see me come into your room for it or were you asleep  i sat by him all night he improved slowly and we talked over what we had better do i felt that though i had intended to give him up i could not now becomingly marry any other man and that i ought to marry him we decided to do it at once before anybody could hinder us so we came down before it was light and have gone away to get the ceremony solemnized  tell mr pierston it was not premeditated but the result of an accident i am sincerely sorry to have treated him with what he will think unfairness but though i did not love him i meant to obey you and marry him but god sent this necessity of my having to give shelter to my love to prevent i think my doing what i am now convinced would have been wrongever your loving daughter avice  the second was in a mans hand  dear mother as you will soon be to meavice has clearly explained above how it happened that i have not been able to give her up to mr pierston i think i should have died if i had not accepted the hospitality of a room in your house this night and your daughters tender nursing through the dark dreary hours we love each other beyond expression and it is obvious that if we are human we cannot resist marrying now in spite of friends wishes will you please send the note lying beside this to my mother it is merely to explain what i have doneyours with warmest regard henri leverre  jocelyn turned away and looked out of the window  mrs pierston thought she heard some talking in the night but of course she put it down to fancy and she remembers miss avice coming into her room at one oclock in the morning and going to the table where the medicine was standing a sly girlall the time her young man within a yard or two in the very room and a using the very clean sheets that you sir were to have used they are our best linen ones got up beautiful and a kept wi rosemary really sir one would say you stayed out o your chammer o purpose to oblige the young man with a bed  dont blame them dont blame them said jocelyn in an even and characterless voice dont blame her particularly she didnt make the circumstances i did it was how i served her grandmother  well shes gone you neednt make a mystery of it tell it to all the island say that a man came to marry a wife and didnt find her at home tell everybody that shes run away it must be known sooner or later  one of the servants said after waiting a few moments we shant do that sir  ohwhy wont you  we liked her too well with all her faults  ahdid you said he and he sighed he perceived that the younger maids were secretly on avices side  how does her mother bear it jocelyn asked is she awake  mrs pierston had hardly slept and having learnt the tidings inadvertently became so distracted and incoherent as to be like a person in a delirium till a few moments before he arrived all her excitement ceased and she lay in a weak quiet silence  let me go up pierston said and send for the doctor  passing avices chamber he perceived that the little bed had not been slept on at the door of the spare room he looked in in one corner stood a walkingstickhis own  where did that come from  we found it there sir  ah yesi gave it to him tis like me to play anothers game  it was the last spurt of bitterness that jocelyn let escape him he went on towards mrs pierstons room preceded by the servant  mr pierston has come maam he heard her say to the invalid but as the latter took no notice the woman rushed forward to the bed what has happened to her mr pierston o what do it mean  avice the second was lying placidly in the position in which the nurse had left her but no breath came from her lips and a rigidity of feature was accompanied by the precise expression which had characterized her face when pierston had her as a girl in his studio he saw that it was death though she appeared to have breathed her last only a few moments before  ruth stockwools composure deserted her tis the shock of finding miss avice gone that has done it she cried she has killed her mother  dont say such a terrible thing exclaimed jocelyn  but she ought to have obeyed her mothera good mother as she was how she had set her heart upon the wedding poor soul and we couldnt help her knowing what had happened o how ungrateful young folk be that girl will rue this mornings work  we must get the doctor said pierston mechanically hastening from the room  when the local practitioner came he merely confirmed their own verdict and thought her death had undoubtedly been hastened by the shock of the ill news upon a feeble heart following a long strain of anxiety about the wedding he did not consider that an inquest would be necessary                                              the two shadowy figures seen through the grey gauzes of the morning by ruth five hours before this time had gone on to the open place by the north entrance of sylvania castle where the lane to the ruins of the old castle branched off a listener would not have gathered that a single word passed between them the man walked with difficulty supported by the woman at this spot they stopped and kissed each other a long while  we ought to walk all the way to budmouth if we wish not to be discovered he said sadly and i cant even get across the island even by your help darling it is two miles to the foot of the hill  she who was trembling tried to speak consolingly  if you could walk we should have to go down the street of wells where perhaps somebody would know me now if we get below here to the cove cant we push off one of the little boats i saw there last night and paddle along close to the shore till we get to the north side then we can walk across to the station very well it is quite calm and as the tide sets in that direction it will take us along of itself without much rowing ive often got round in a boat that way  this seemed to be the only plan that offered and abandoning the straight road they wound down the defile spanned further on by the old castle arch and forming the original fosse of the fortress  the stroke of their own footsteps lightly as these fell was flapped back to them with impertinent gratuitousness by the vertical faces of the rock so still was everything around a little further and they emerged upon the open ledge of the lower tier of cliffs to the right being the sloping pathway leading down to the secluded creek at their basethe single practicable spot of exit from or entrance to the isle on this side by a seagoing craft once an active wharf whence many a fine public building had sailedincluding saint pauls cathedral  the timorous shadowy shapes descended the footway one at least of them knowing the place so well that she found it scarcely necessary to guide herself down by touching the natural wall of stone on her right hand as her companion did thus with quick suspensive breathings they arrived at the bottom and trod the few yards of shingle which on the forbidding shore hereabout could be found at this spot alone it was so solitary as to be unvisited often for fourandtwenty hours by a living soul upon the confined beach were drawn up two or three fishinglerrets and a couple of smaller ones beside them being a rough slipway for launching and a boathouse of tarred boards the two lovers united their strength to push the smallest of the boats down the slope and floating it they scrambled in  the girl broke the silence by asking where are the oars  he felt about the boat but could find none i forgot to look for the oars he said  they are locked in the boathouse i suppose now we can only steer and trust to the current  the currents here were of a complicated kind it was true as the girl had said that the tide ran round to the north but at a special moment in every flood there set in along the shore a narrow reflux contrary to the general outer flow called the southern by the local sailors it was produced by the peculiar curves of coast lying east and west of the beal these bent southward in two back streams the upchannel flow on each side of the peninsula which two streams united outside the beal and there met the direct tidal flow the confluence of the three currents making the surface of the sea at this point to boil like a pot even in calmest weather the disturbed area as is well known is called the race  thus although the outer sea was now running northward to the roadstead and the mainland of wessex the southern ran in full force towards the beal and the race beyond it caught the lovers hapless boat in a few moments and unable to row across itmere rivers width that it wasthey beheld the grey rocks near them and the grim wrinkled forehead of the isle above sliding away northwards  they gazed helplessly at each other though in the longliving faith of youth without distinct fear the undulations increased in magnitude and swung them higher and lower the boat rocked received a smart slap of the waves now and then and wheeled round so that the lightship which stolidly winked at them from the quicksand the single object which told them of their bearings was sometimes on their right hand and sometimes on their left nevertheless they could always discern from it that their course whether stemwards or sternwards was steadily south  a bright idea occurred to the young man he pulled out his handkerchief and striking a light set it on fire she gave him hers and he made that flare up also the only available fuel left was the small umbrella the girl had brought this was also kindled in an opened state and he held it up by the stem till it was consumed  the lightship had loomed quite large by this time and a few minutes after they had burnt the handkerchiefs and umbrella a coloured flame replied to them from the vessel they flung their arms round each other  i knew we shouldnt be drowned said avice hysterically  i thought we shouldnt too said he  with the appearance of day a boat put off to their assistance and they were towed towards the heavy red hulk with the large white letters on its side     3 vii an old tabernacle in a new aspect  the october day thickened into dusk and jocelyn sat musing beside the corpse of mrs pierston avice having gone away nobody knew whither he had acted as the nearest friend of the family and attended as well as he could to the sombre duties necessitated by her mothers decease it was doubtful indeed if anybody else were in a position to do so of avice the seconds two brothers one had been drowned at sea and the other had emigrated while her only child besides the present avice had died in infancy as for her friends she had become so absorbed in her ambitious and nearly accomplished design of marrying her daughter to jocelyn that she had gradually completed that estrangement between herself and the other islanders which had been begun so long ago as when a young woman she had herself been asked by pierston to marry him on her tantalizing inability to accept the honour offered she and her husband had been set up in a matteroffact business in the stone trade by her patron but that unforgettable request in the london studio had made her feel ever since a refined kinship with sculpture and a proportionate aloofness from mere quarrying which was perhaps no more than a venial weakness in avice the second her daughters objection to jocelyn she could never understand to her own eye he was no older than when he had proposed to her  as he sat darkling here the ghostly outlines of former shapes taken by his love came round their sister the unconscious corpse confronting him from the wall in sad array like the pictured trojan women beheld by aeneas on the walls of carthage many of them he had idealized in bust and in figure from time to time but it was not as such that he remembered and reanimated them now rather was it in all their natural circumstances weaknesses and stains and then as he came to himself their voices grew fainter they had all gone off on their different careers and he was left here alone  the probable ridicule that would result to him from the events of the day he did not mind in itself at all but he would fain have removed the misapprehensions on which it would be based that however was impossible nobody would ever know the truth about him what it was he had sought that had so eluded tantalized and escaped him what it was that had led him such a dance and had at last as he believed just now in the freshness of his loss been discovered in the girl who had left him it was not the flesh he had never knelt low to that not a woman in the world had been wrecked by him though he had been impassioned by so many nobody would guess the further sentimentthe cordial lovingkindnesswhich had lain behind what had seemed to him the enraptured fulfilment of a pleasing destiny postponed for forty years his attraction to the third avice would be regarded by the world as the selfish designs of an elderly man on a maid  his life seemed no longer a professional mans experience but a ghost story and he would fain have vanished from his haunts on this critical afternoon as the rest had done he desired to sleep away his tendencies to make something happen which would put an end to his bondage to beauty in the ideal  so he sat on till it was quite dark and a light was brought there was a chilly wind blowing outside and the lightship on the quicksand afar looked harassed and forlorn the haggard solitude was broken by a ring at the door  pierston heard a voice below the accents of a woman they had a ground quality of familiarity a superficial articulation of strangeness only one person in all his experience had ever possessed precisely those tones rich as if they had once been powerful explanations seemed to be asked for and given and in a minute he was informed that a lady was downstairs whom perhaps he would like to see  who is the lady jocelyn asked  the servant hesitated a little mrs leverrethe mother of theyoung gentleman miss avice has run off with  yesill see her said pierston  he covered the face of the dead avice and descended leverre he said to himself his ears had known that name before today it was the name those travelling americans he had met in rome gave the woman he supposed might be marcia bencomb  a sudden adjusting light burst upon many familiar things at that moment he found the visitor in the drawingroom standing up veiled the carriage which had brought her being in waiting at the door by the dim light he could see nothing of her features in such circumstances  mr pierston  i am mr pierston  you represent the late mrs pierston  i dothough i am not one of the family  i know it i am marciaafter forty years  i was divining as much marcia may the lines have fallen to you in pleasant places since we last met but of all moments of my life why do you choose to hunt me up now  whyi am the stepmother and only relation of the young man your bride eloped with this morning  i was just guessing that too as i came downstairs but  and i am naturally making inquiries  yes let us take it quietly and shut the door  marcia sat down and he learnt that the conjunction of old things and new was no accident what mrs pierston had discussed with her nurse and neighbour as vague intelligence was now revealed to jocelyn at first hand by marcia herself how many years after their separation and when she was left poor by the death of her impoverished father she had become the wife of that bygone jersey lover of hers who wanted a tender nurse and mother for the infant left him by his first wife recently deceased how he had died a few years later leaving her with the boy whom she had brought up at st heliers and in paris educating him as well as she could with her limited means till he became the french master at a school in sandbourne and how a year ago she and her son had got to know mrs pierston and her daughter on their visit to the island to ascertain she added more deliberately not entirely for sentimental reasons what had become of the man with whom i eloped in the first flush of my young womanhood and only missed marrying by my own will  pierston bowed  well that was how the acquaintance between the children began and their passionate attachment to each other she detailed how avice had induced her mother to let her take lessons in french of young leverre rendering their meetings easy marcia had never thought of hindering their intimacy for in her recent years of affliction she had acquired a new interest in the name she had refused to take in her purseproud young womanhood and it was not until she knew how determined mrs pierston was to make her daughter jocelyns wife that she had objected to her sons acquaintance with avice but it was too late to hinder what had been begun he had lately been ill and she had been frightened by his not returning home the night before the note she had received from him that day had only informed her that avice and himself had gone to be married immediatelywhither she did not know  what do you mean to do she asked  i do nothing there is nothing to be done it is how i served her grandmotherone of times revenges  served her so for me  yes now she me for your son  marcia paused a long while thinking that over till arousing herself she resumed but cant we inquire which way they went out of the island or gather some particulars about them  ayeyes we will  and pierston found himself as in a dream walking beside marcia along the road in their common quest he discovered that almost every one of the neighbouring inhabitants knew more about the lovers than he did himself  at the corner some men were engaged in conversation on the occurrence it was allusive only but knowing the dialect pierston and marcia gathered its import easily as soon as it had got light that morning one of the boats was discovered missing from the creek below and when the flight of the lovers was made known it was inferred that they were the culprits  unconsciously pierston turned in the direction of the creek without regarding whether marcia followed him and though it was darker than when avice and leverre had descended in the morning he pursued his way down the incline till he reached the waterside  is that you jocelyn  the inquiry came from marcia she was behind him about halfway down  yes he said noticing that it was the first time she had called him by his christian name  i cant see where you are and i am afraid to follow  afraid to follow how strangely that altered his conception of her till this moment she had stood in his mind as the imperious invincible marcia of old there was a strange pathos in this revelation he went back and felt for her hand ill lead you down he said and he did so  they looked out upon the sea and the lightship shining as if it had quite forgotten all about the fugitives i am so uneasy said marcia do you think they got safely to land  yes replied some one other than jocelyn it was a boatman smoking in the shadow of the boathouse he informed her that they were picked up by the lightship men and afterwards at their request taken across to the opposite shore where they landed proceeding thence on foot to the nearest railway station and entering the train for london this intelligence had reached the island about an hour before  theyll be married tomorrow morning said marcia  so much the better dont regret it marcia he shall not lose by it i have no relation in the world except some twentieth cousins in the isle of whom her father was one and ill take steps at once to make her a good match for him as for me i have lived a day too long     3 viii alas for this grey shadow once a man  in the month of november which followed pierston was lying dangerously ill of a fever at his house in london  the funeral of the second avice had happened to be on one of those drenching afternoons of the autumn when the raw rain flies level as the missiles of the ancient inhabitants across the beaked promontory which has formed the scene of this narrative scarcely alighting except against the upright sides of things sturdy enough to stand erect one person only followed the corpse into the church as chief mourner jocelyn pierstonfickle lover in the brief faithful friend in the long run no means had been found of communicating with avice before the interment though the death had been advertised in the local and other papers in the hope that it might catch her eye  so when the pathetic procession came out of the church and moved round into the graveyard a hired vehicle from budmouth was seen coming at great speed along the open road from topohill it stopped at the churchyard gate and a young man and woman alighted and entered the vehicle waiting they glided along the path and reached pierstons side just as the body was deposited by the grave  he did not turn his head he knew it was avice with henri leverreby this time he supposed her husband her remorseful grief though silent seemed to impregnate the atmosphere with its heaviness perceiving that they had not expected him to be there pierston edged back and when the service was over he kept still further aloof an act of considerateness which she seemed to appreciate  thus by his own contrivance neither avice nor the young man held communication with jocelyn by word or by sign after the burial they returned as they had come  it was supposed that his exposure that day in the bleakest churchyard in wessex telling upon a distracted mental and bodily condition had thrown pierston into the chill and fever which held him swaying for weeks between life and death shortly after his return to town when he had passed the crisis and began to know again that there was such a state as mental equilibrium and physical calm he heard a whispered conversation going on around him and the touch of footsteps on the carpet the light in the chamber was so subdued that nothing around him could be seen with any distinctness two living figures were present a nurse moving about softly and a visitor he discerned that the latter was feminine and for the time this was all  he was recalled to his surroundings by a voice murmuring the inquiry does the light try your eyes  the tones seemed familiar they were spoken by the woman who was visiting him he recollected them to be marcias and everything that had happened before he fell ill came back to his mind  are you helping to nurse me marcia he asked  yes i have come up to stay here till you are better as you seem to have no other woman friend who cares whether you are dead or alive i am living quite near i am glad you have got round the corner we have been very anxious  how good you are andhave you heard of the others  they are married they have been here to see you and are very sorry she sat by you but you did not know her she was broken down when she discovered her mothers death which had never once occurred to her as being imminent they have gone away again i thought it best she should leave now that you are out of danger now you must be quiet till i come and talk again  pierston was conscious of a singular change in himself which had been revealed by this slight discourse he was no longer the same man that he had hitherto been the malignant fever or his experiences or both had taken away something from him and put something else in its place  during the next days with further intellectual expansion he became clearly aware of what this was the artistic sense had left him and he could no longer attach a definite sentiment to images of beauty recalled from the past his appreciativeness was capable of exercising itself only on utilitarian matters and recollection of avices good qualities alone had any effect on his mind of her appearance none at all  at first he was appalled and then he said thank god  marcia who with something of her old absolutism came to his house continually to inquire and give orders and to his room to see him every afternoon found out for herself in the course of his convalescence this strange death of the sensuous side of jocelyns nature she had said that avice was getting extraordinarily handsome and that she did not wonder her stepson lost his heart to heran inadvertent remark which she immediately regretted in fear lest it should agitate him he merely answered however yes i suppose she is handsome shes morea wise girl who will make a good housewife in time i wish you were not handsome marcia  why  i dont quite know why wellit seems a stupid quality to me i cant understand what it is good for any more  oi as a woman think theres good in it  is there then i have lost all conception of it i dont know what has happened to me i only know i dont regret it robinson crusoe lost a day in his illness i have lost a faculty for which loss heaven be praised  there was something pathetic in this announcement and marcia sighed as she said perhaps when you get strong it will come back to you  pierston shook his head it then occurred to him that never since the reappearance of marcia had he seen her in full daylight or without a bonnet and thick veil which she always retained on these frequent visits and that he had been unconsciously regarding her as the marcia of their early time a fancy which the small change in her voice well sustained the stately figure the good colour the classical profile the rather large handsome nose and somewhat prominent regular teeth the full dark eye formed still the marcia of his imagination the queenly creature who had infatuated him when the first avice was despised and her successors unknown it was this old idea which in his revolt from beauty had led to his regret at her assumed handsomeness he began wondering now how much remained of that presentation after forty years  why dont you ever let me see you marcia he asked  o i dont know you mean without my bonnet you have never asked me to and i am obliged to wrap up my face with this wool veil because i suffer so from aches in these cold winter winds though a thick veil is awkward for any one whose sight is not so good as it was  the impregnable marcias sight not so good as it was and her face in the aching stage of life these simple things came as sermons to jocelyn  but certainly i will gratify your curiosity she resumed goodnaturedly it is really a compliment that you should still take that sort of interest in me  she had moved round from the dark side of the room to the lampfor the daylight had goneand she now suddenly took off the bonnet veil and all she stood revealed to his eyes as remarkably goodlooking considering the lapse of years  i amvexed he said turning his head aside impatiently you are fair and fiveandthirtynot a day more you still suggest beauty you wont do as a chastisement marcia  ah but i may to think that you know woman no better after all this time  how  to be so easily deceived think it is lamplight and your sight is weak at present and well i have no reason for being anything but candid now god knows so i will tell you my husband was younger than myself and he had an absurd wish to make people think he had married a young and freshlooking woman to fall in with his vanity i tried to look it we were often in paris and i became as skilled in beautifying artifices as any passee wife of the faubourg st germain since his death i have kept up the practice partly because the vice is almost ineradicable and partly because i found that it helped me with men in bringing up his boy on small means at this moment i am frightfully made up but i can cure that ill come in tomorrow morning if it is bright just as i really am youll find that time has not disappointed you remember i am as old as yourself and i look it  the morrow came and with it marcia quite early as she had promised it happened to be sunny and shutting the bedroom door she went round to the window where she uncovered immediately in his full view and said see if i am satisfactory nowto you who think beauty vain the rest of meand it is a good deallies on my dressingtable at home i shall never put it on againnever  but she was a woman and her lips quivered and there was a tear in her eye as she exposed the ruthless treatment to which she had subjected herself the cruel morning raysas with jocelyn under avices scrutinyshowed in their full bareness unenriched by addition undisguised by the arts of colour and shade the thin remains of what had once been marcias majestic bloom she stood the image and superscription of agean old woman pale and shrivelled her forehead ploughed her cheek hollow her hair white as snow to this the face he once kissed had been brought by the raspings chisellings scourgings bakings freezings of forty invidious yearsby the thinkings of more than half a lifetime  i am sorry if i shock you she went on huskily but firmly as he did not speak but the moth frets the garment somewhat in such an interval  yesyes marcia you are a brave woman you have the courage of the great women of history i can no longer love but i admire you from my soul  dont say i am great say i have begun to be passably honest it is more than enough  wellill say nothing then more than how wonderful it is that a woman should have been able to put back the clock of time thirty years  it shames me now jocelyn i shall never do it any more                                              as soon as he was strong enough he got her to take him round to his studio in a carriage the place had been kept aired but the shutters were shut and they opened them themselves he looked round upon the familiar objectssome complete and matured the main of them seedlings grafts and scions of beauty waiting for a mind to grow to perfection in  noi dont like them he said turning away they are as ugliness to me i dont feel a single touch of kin with or interest in any one of them whatever  jocelynthis is sad  nonot at all he went again towards the door now let me look round he looked back marcia remaining silent the aphroditeshow i insulted her fair form by those failuresthe freyjas the nymphs and fauns eves avices and other innumerable wellbelovedsi want to see them never any more instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and there shall be burning instead of beauty said the prophet  and they came away on another afternoon they went to the national gallery to test his taste in paintings which had formerly been good as she had expected it was just the same with him there he saw no more to move him he declared in the timedefying presentations of perugino titian sebastiano and other statuesque creators than in the work of the pavement artist they had passed on their way  it is strange said she  i dont regret it that fever has killed a faculty which has after all brought me my greatest sorrows if a few little pleasures let us be gone  he was now so well advanced in convalescence that it was deemed a most desirable thing to take him down into his native air marcia agreed to accompany him i dont see why i shouldnt said she an old friendless woman like me and you an old friendless man  yes thank heaven i am old at last the curse is removed  it may be shortly stated here that after his departure for the isle pierston never again saw his studio or its contents he had been down there but a brief while when finding his sense of beauty in art and nature absolutely extinct he directed his agent in town to disperse the whole collection which was done his lease of the building was sold and in the course of time another sculptor won admiration there from those who knew not joseph the next year his name figured on the retired list of academicians                                              as time went on he grew as well as one of his age could expect to be after such a blasting illness but remained on the isle in the only house he now possessed a comparatively small one at the top of the street of wells a growing sense of friendship which it would be foolish to interrupt led him to take a somewhat similar house for marcia quite near and remove her furniture thither from sandbourne whenever the afternoon was fine he would call for her and they would take a stroll together towards the beal or the ancient castle seldom going the whole way his sciatica and her rheumatism effectually preventing them except in the driest atmospheres he had now changed his style of dress entirely appearing always in a homely suit of local make and of the fashion of thirty years before the achievement of a tailoress at east quarriers he also let his irongrey beard grow as it would and what little hair he had left from the baldness which had followed the fever and thus numbering in years but twoandsixty he might have passed for seventyfive  though their early adventure as lovers had happened so long ago its history had become known in the isle with mysterious rapidity and fulness of detail the gossip to which its bearing on their present friendship gave rise was the subject of their conversation on one of these walks along the cliffs  it is extraordinary what an interest our neighbours take in our affairs he observed they say those old folk ought to marry better late than never thats how people arewanting to round off other peoples histories in the best machinemade conventional manner  yes they keep on about it to me too indirectly  do they i believe a deputation will wait upon us some morning requesting in the interests of matchmaking that we will please to get married as soon as possible how near we were to doing it forty years ago only you were so independent i thought you would have come back and was much surprised that you didnt  my independent ideas were not blameworthy in me as an islander though as a kimberlin young lady perhaps they would have been there was simply no reason from an islanders point of view why i should come back since no result threatened from our union and i didnt my father kept that view before me and i bowed to his judgment  and so the island ruled our destinies though we were not on it yeswe are in hands not our own did you ever tell your husband  no  did he ever hear anything  not that i am aware  calling upon her one day he found her in a state of great discomfort in certain gusty winds the chimneys of the little house she had taken here smoked intolerably and one of these winds was blowing then her drawingroom fire could not be kept burning and rather than let a woman who suffered from rheumatism shiver fireless he asked her to come round and lunch with him as she had often done before as they went he thought not for the first time how needless it was that she should be put to this inconvenience by their occupying two houses when one would better suit their now constant companionship and disembarrass her of the objectionable chimneys moreover by marrying marcia and establishing a parental relation with the young people the rather delicate business of his making them a regular allowance would become a natural proceeding  and so the zealous wishes of the neighbours to give a geometrical shape to their story were fulfilled almost in spite of the chief parties themselves when he put the question to her distinctly marcia admitted that she had always regretted the imperious decision of her youth and she made no ado about accepting him  i have no love to give you know marcia he said but such friendship as i am capable of is yours till the end  it is nearly the same with meperhaps not quite but like the other people i have somehow felt and you will understand why that i ought to be your wife before i die  it chanced that a day or two before the ceremony which was fixed to take place very shortly after the foregoing conversation marcias rheumatism suddenly became acute the attack promised however to be only temporary owing to some accidental exposure of herself in making preparations for removal and as they thought it undesirable to postpone their union for such a reason marcia after being well wrapped up was wheeled into the church in a chair                                              a month thereafter when they were sitting at breakfast one morning marcia exclaimed wellgood heavens while reading a letter she had just received from avice who was living with her husband in a house pierston had bought for them at sandbourne  jocelyn looked up  whyavice says she wants to be separated from henri did you ever hear of such a thing shes coming here about it today  separated what does the child mean pierston read the letter ridiculous nonsense he continued she doesnt know what she wants i say she shant be separated tell her so and theres an end of it whyhow long have they been married not twelve months what will she say when they have been married twenty years  marcia remained reflecting i think that remorseful feeling she unluckily has at times of having disobeyed her mother and caused her death makes her irritable she murmured poor child  lunchtime had hardly come when avice arrived looking very tearful and excited marcia took her into an inner room had a conversation with her and they came out together  o its nothing said marcia i tell her she must go back directly she has had some luncheon  ah thats all very well sobbed avice bbbut if you had been mmarried so long as i have yyou wouldnt say go back like that  what is it all about inquired pierston  he said that if he were to die iishould be looking out for somebody with fair hair and grey eyes justjust to spite him in his grave because hes dark and hes quite sure i dont like dark people and then he saidbut i wont be so treacherous as to tell any more about him i wish  avice your mother did this very thing and she went back to her husband now you are to do the same let me see there is a train  she must have something to eat first sit down dear  the question was settled by the arrival of henri himself at the end of luncheon with a very anxious and pale face pierston went off to a business meeting and left the young couple to adjust their differences in their own way  his business was among kindred undertakings which followed the extinction of the wellbeloved and other ideals to advance a scheme for the closing of the old natural fountains in the street of wells because of their possible contamination and supplying the townlet with water from pipes a scheme that was carried out at his expense as is well known he was also engaged in acquiring some old mossgrown mullioned elizabethan cottages for the purpose of pulling them down because they were damp which he afterwards did and built new ones with hollow walls and full of ventilators  at present he is sometimes mentioned as the late mr pierston by gourdlike young artcritics and journalists and his productions are alluded to as those of a man not without genius whose powers were insufficiently recognized in his lifetime
