two misses wetherell have grown so much alike it would be difficult for a stranger to tell one from the other and to add to his confusion they have fallen into the habit of dressing much alike in a fashion of their own that went out long ago while the hair of both is white and even in their voices they have caught each others tones  the elder miss wetherell she has paused from her work and is looking out of the windows  such a lovely sunset dear  the younger miss wetherell she leaves her work and joins her sister the two stand holding each others hands looking out  beautiful a silence  the

fresh logs upon the fire turns to go  oh bennet  you will remind charles to put a footwarmer in the carriage  bennet  i will see to it myself  he goes out  the younger miss wetherell  thank you bennet  to her sister ones feet are always so cold after a railway journey  the elder miss wetherell  ive been told that nowadays they heat the carriages  the younger miss wetherell  ah it is an age of luxury  i wish i knew which were her favourite flowers  it is so nice to be greeted by ones favourite flowers  the elder miss wetherell  i feel sure she loves lilies  the younger miss wetherell  and they are so appropriate to a bride so   announced by bennet dr freemantle bustles in  he is a dapper little man cleanshaven with quick brisk ways  dr freemantle he shakes hands  well and how are we this afternoon  he feels the pulse of the younger miss wetherell steadier  much steadier  of the elder miss wetherell  nervous tension greatly relieved  the younger miss wetherell  she has been sleeping much better  dr freemantle he pats the hand of the elder miss wetherell excellent  excellent  the elder miss wetherell  she ate a good breakfast this morning  dr freemantle he pats the hand of the younger miss wetherell couldnt have a better sign  he smiles from one to the other brain disturbance caused by futile opposition to the inevitable evidently abating  one page marcus aurelius every morning before breakfast  adapt thyself says marcus aurelius to the things with which thy lot has been cast  whatever happens  the younger miss wetherell  you see doctor it was all so sudden  dr freemantle  the unexpected  it has a way of taking us by surprisebowling us overcompletely  till we pull ourselves together  make the best of what cant be helpedlike brave sweet gentlewomen  he presses their hands  they are both wiping away a tear  when do you expect them  the elder miss wetherell  tonight by the halfpast eight train we had a telegram this morning from dover  dr freemantle  um and this is to be her room  he takes it in the noble and renowned constance friend and confidant of the elder pitt maker of history first lady bantockby hoppneralways there to keep an eye on her remind her of the family traditions brilliant idea brilliant  they are both smiling with pleasure  the elder miss wetherell  and you dont thinkit is what we wanted to ask youthat there is any fear of her finding it a little trying the light  you see this is an exceptionally sunny room  the younger miss wetherell  and these actressesif all one hears is true   the dying sun is throwing his last beams across the room  dr freemantle  which thank god it isnt  he seats himself in a large easychair  the two ladies sit side by side on a settee ill tell you just exactly what youve got to expect  a ladya few years older than the boy himself but still young  exquisite figure dressedperhaps a trifle too regardless of expense  hairmaybe just a shade too golden  all that can be altered  features piquant with expressive eyes the use of which she probably understands and an almost permanent smile displaying an admirably preserved and remarkably even set of teeth  but above all clever thats our sheetanchor  the womans clever  she will know how to adapt herself to her new position  the younger miss wetherell turning to her sister  yes she must be clever to have obtained the position that she has  to the doctor vernon says that she was quite the chief attraction all this winter in paris  the elder miss wetherell  and the french public is so critical  dr freemantle drily  um  i was thinking rather of her cleverness in landing poor vernon  the lads not a fool  the elder miss wetherell  we must do her justice  i think she was really in love with him  dr freemantle still more drily  very possibly  most cafe chantant singers i take it would bewith an english lord  he laughs  the elder miss wetherell  you see she didnt know he was a lord  dr freemantle  didnt know  the younger miss wetherell  no  she married him thinking him to be a plain mr wetherell an artist  dr freemantle  where dye get all that from  the elder miss wetherell  from vernon himself  youve got his last letter dear  she has opened her chatelaine bag  oh no ive got it myself  the younger miss wetherell  hes not going to break it to her till they reach here this evening  the elder miss wetherell she reads  yes  i shall not break it to her before we reach home  we were married quietly at the hotel de ville and she has no idea i am anything else than plain vernon james wetherell a fellowcountryman of her own and a fellowartist  the dear creature has never even inquired whether i am rich or poor  i like her for that  dr freemantle  you mean to tell mehe jumps up  with his hands in his jacket pockets he walks to and fro  i suppose its possible  the elder miss wetherell  you see she isnt the ordinary class of musichall singer  dr freemantle  i should say not  the elder miss wetherell  she comes of quite a good family  the younger miss wetherell  her uncle was a bishop  dr freemantle  bishop  of where  the elder miss wetherell with the letter  he says he cant spell it  its somewhere in new zealand  dr freemantle  do they have bishops over there  the younger miss wetherell  well evidently  the elder miss wetherell  then her cousin is a judge  dr freemantle  in new zealand  the elder miss wetherell again referring to the letter  noin ohio  dr freemantle  seems to have been a somewhat scattered family  the younger miss wetherell  people go about so much nowadays  mrs bennet has entered  she is the housekeeper  mrs bennet she is about to speak to the misses wetherell sees the doctor  good afternoon doctor  dr freemantle  afternoon mrs bennet  mrs bennet she turns to the misses wetherell her watch in her hand  i was thinking of having the fire lighted in her ladyships bedroom  it is half past six  the elder miss wetherell  you are always so thoughtful  she may be tired  mrs bennet  if so everything will be quite ready  she goes out closing door  dr freemantle  what do they think about it allthe bennets  you have told them  the younger miss wetherell  we thought it better  you see one hardly regards them as servants  they have been in the family so long  three generations of them  the elder miss wetherell  really since our poor dear brothers death bennet has been more like the head of the house than the butler  the younger miss wetherell  of course he doesnt say much  the elder miss wetherell  it is her having been on the stage that they feel so  the younger miss wetherell  you see they have always been a religious family  the elder miss wetherell  do you know i really think they feel it more than we do  i found peggy crying about it yesterday in the scullery  dr freemantle he has been listening with a touch of amusement peggy bennet  the younger miss wetherell  yes  charles bennets daughter  dr freemantle  happen to have a servant about the place who isnt a bennet  the younger miss wetherell  no no i dont really think we have oh yesthat new girl mrs bennet engaged last week for the dairy what is her name  the elder miss wetherell  arnold  the younger miss wetherell  ah yes arnold  dr freemantle  ah  the elder miss wetherell  i think shes a cousin dear  the younger miss wetherell  only a second cousin  dr freemantle  um  well i should tell the whole family to buck up seems to me from what you tell me that their master is bringing them home a treasure  he shakes hands briskly with the ladies may look in again tomorrow  dont forgetone page marcus aurelius before breakfastin case of need  he goes out  the sun has sunk  the light is twilight  the elder miss wetherell  he always cheers one up  the younger miss wetherell  hes so alive  mrs bennet comes in from the dressingroom  she leaves the door ajar  the sound of a hammer is heard  it ceases almost immediately  oh mrs bennet we were going to ask youwho is to be her ladyships maid  have you decided yet  mrs bennet  i have come to the conclusionlooking at the thing from every point of viewthat jane would be the best selection  the younger miss wetherell  jane  the elder miss wetherell  but does she understand the duties  mrs bennet  a ladys maid being so much alone with her mistress is bound to have a certain amount of influence  and jane has exceptionally high principles  the younger miss wetherell  that is true dear  mrs bennet  as regards the duties she is very quick at learning anything new  of course at first   the sound of hammering again comes from the bedroom  the younger miss wetherell  who is that hammering in her ladyships bedroom  mrs bennet  it is bennet miss edith  we thought it might be helpful  a few texts hung where they would always catch her ladyships eye  she notices the look of doubt  nothing offensive mere general exhortations such as could be read by any lady  the misses wetherell look at one another but do not speak  i take it dinner will be at half past seven as usual  the elder miss wetherell  yes mrs bennet thank you  they will not be here till about nine  they will probably prefer a little supper to themselves  mrs bennet goes outon her way to the kitchen  the misses wetherell look at one another again  the hammering recommences  the younger miss wetherell she hesitates a moment then goes to the open door and calls  bennetbennet  she returns and waits bennet comes in  oh bennet your wife tells us you are putting up a few texts in her ladyships bedroom  bennet  it seemed to me that a silent voice speaking to her as it were from the wall   the younger miss wetherell  it is so good of youonly youyou will be careful there is nothing she could regard as a personal allusion  bennet  many of the most popular i was compelled to reject purely for that reason  the elder miss wetherell  we felt sure we could trust to your discretion  the younger miss wetherell  you see coming as she does from a good family   bennet  it is thati speak merely for myselfthat gives me hope of reclaiming her  a silence  the two ladies feeling a little helpless again look at one another  the elder miss wetherell  we must be very sympathetic  the younger miss wetherell  and patient bennet  bennet  it is what i am preparing myself to be  of course if you think them inadvisable i can take them down again  the younger miss wetherell  no bennet oh no  i should leave them up  very thoughtful of you indeed  bennet  it seemed to me one ought to leave no stone unturned  he returns to his labours in the bedroom  the younger miss wetherell after a pause  i do hope shell like the bennets  the elder miss wetherell  i think she willafter a time when she is used to them  the younger miss wetherell  i am so anxious it should turn out well  the elder miss wetherell  i feel sure shes a good woman  vernon would never have fallen in love with her if she hadnt been good they take each others hand and sit side by side as before upon the settee  the twilight has faded  only the faint firelight remains surrounded by shadows  do you remember when he was a little mite how he loved to play with your hair  the younger miss wetherell laughs  i always envied you your hair  the younger miss wetherell  he was so fond of us both  do you remember when he was recovering from the measles his crying for us to bath him instead of mrs bennet  i have always reproached myself that we refused  the elder miss wetherell  he was such a big boy for his age  the younger miss wetherell  i think we might have stretched a point in a case of illness  the room has grown very dark  the door has been softly opened vernon and fanny have entered noiselessly  fanny remains near the door hidden by a screen vernon has crept forward  at this point the two ladies become aware that somebody is in the room  they are alarmed  the elder miss wetherell  whos there  vernon  its all right aunt  its only i  the two ladies have risen  they run forward both take him in their arms  the younger miss wetherell  vernon  the elder miss wetherell  my dear boy  the younger miss wetherell  but we didnt expect you   the elder miss wetherell  and your wife dear  vernon  shes here  the elder miss wetherell  here  fanny from behind the screen laughs  vernon  well have some light  he whispers to them  not a word havent told her yet  feeling his way to the wall he turns on the electric light  fanny is revealed having slipped out from behind the screen  there is a pause  vernon standing near the fire watches admiringly  fanny  hope you are going to like me  the younger miss wetherell  my dear i am sure we shall  the elder miss wetherell  it is so easy to love the young and pretty  they have drawn close to her  they seem to hesitate  fanny laughs  it doesnt come off does it vernon dear  vernon laughs  the two ladies laughing kiss her  im so glad you think im pretty  as a matter of fact im not  theres a certain charm about me i admit  it deceives people  the younger miss wetherell  we were afraidyou know dear boys she looks at vernon and smiles sometimes fall in love with women much older than themselvesespecially womenshe grows confused she takes the girls hand  we are so relieved that youthat you are yourself dear  fanny  you were quite right dear  they are sweet  which is which  vernon laughs  upon my word i never can tell  the younger miss wetherell  vernon  and you know i was always your favourite  the elder miss wetherell  dear  vernon  then this is aunt alice  the younger miss wetherell  no dear edith  vernon throws up his hands in despair  they all laugh  fanny  i think i shall dress you differently put you in blue and you in pink  she laughs  is this the drawingroom  vernon  your room dear  fanny  i like a room where one can stretch ones legs  she walks across it  a little too much desk referring to a massive brass bound desk facing the three windows  the elder miss wetherell  it belonged to the elder pitt  fanny  um  suppose we must find a corner for it somewhere  thats a good picture  the younger miss wetherell  it is by hoppner  fanny  one of your artist friends  vernon  wellyou see dear thats a portrait of my great grandmother painted from life  fanny she whistles  i am awfully ignorant on some topics  one good thing i always was a quick study  not a badlooking woman  the elder miss wetherell  we are very proud of her  she was the first   vernon hastily  we will have her history some other time  the younger miss wetherell who understands signs to her sister of course  shes tired  we are forgetting everything  you will have some tea wont you dear  fanny  no thanks  we had tea in the train  with the more or less helpful assistance of vernon she divests herself of her outdoor garments  the elder miss wetherell she holds up her hands in astonishment tea in the train  the younger miss wetherell  we were not expecting you so soon  you said in your telegram   vernon  oh it was raining in london  we thought we would come straight onleave our shopping for another day  fanny  i believe you were glad it was raining  saved you such a lot of money  old stingy  the elder miss wetherell  then did you walk from the station dear  fanny  didnt it seem a long way  she laughs up into his face he was so bored  vernon laughs  the younger miss wetherell  i had better tellshe is going towards the bell  vernon he stops her  oh let them alone  plenty of time for all that fuss  he puts them both gently side by side on the settee sit down and talk  havent i been clever  he puts his arm round fanny laughing  you thought i had made an ass of myself didnt you  did you get all my letters  the younger miss wetherell  i think so dear  fanny she is sitting in an easychair  vernon seats himself on the arm  do you know ive never had a loveletter from you  vernon  you gave me no time  she met me a month ago and married me last week  fanny  it was quick work  he camehe sawi conquered  laughs  the elder miss wetherell  they say that love at first sight is often the most lasting  vernon he puts his arm around her  you are sure you will never regret having given up the stage  the excitement the   fanny  the excitement  do you know what an actresss life always seemed to me like  dancing on a tightrope with everybody throwing stones at you  one soon gets tired of that sort of excitement  oh i was never in love with the stage  had to do something for a living  the younger miss wetherell  it must be a hard life for a woman  the elder miss wetherell  especially for anyone not brought up to it  fanny  you see i had a good voice and what i suppose you might call a natural talent for acting  it seemed the easiest thing  the younger miss wetherell  i suppose your family were very much opposed to it  vernon rises  he stands with his back to the fire  fanny  my family  hadnt any  the elder miss wetherell  no family  bennet enters  vernon and fanny left the door open  he halts framed by the doorway  fanny  no  you see i was an only child  my father and mother both died before i was fourteen  the younger miss wetherell  but your uncle  fanny  oh him  it was to get away from him and all that crew that i went on the stage  the elder miss wetherell  it is so sad when relations dont get on together  fanny  sadder still when they think theyve got a right to trample on you just because you happen to be an orphan andi dont want to talk about my relations  i want to forget them  i stood them for nearly six months  i dont want to be reminded of them  i want to forget that they ever existed  i want to forget   bennet has come down very quietly  fanny from where he stands is the only one who sees him  he stands looking at her his features as ever immovable  at sight of him her eyes and mouth open wider and wider  the words die away from her tongue  vernon has turned away to put a log on the fire and so has not seen her expression only hears her sudden silence  he looks up and sees bennet  vernon  ah bennet  he advances holding out his hand  you quite well  bennet shaking hands with him  quite well  vernon  good  and all the family  bennet  nothing to complain of  charles has had a touch of influenza  vernon  ah sorry to hear that  bennet  and your lordship  vernon  fit as a fiddleyour new mistress  fanny has risen  bennet turns to her  for a moment his back is towards the other three  fanny alone sees his face  bennet  we shall endeavour to do our duty to her ladyship  he turns to vernon  i had arranged for a more fitting reception   vernon  to tell the honest truth bennet the very thing we were afraid ofwhy we walked from the station and slipped in by the side door  laughing  has the luggage come  bennet  it has just arrived  it was about that i came to ask  i could not understand   the misses wetherell have also risen  fannys speechless amazement is attributed by them and vernon to natural astonishment at discovery of his rank  the younger miss wetherell  you will be wanting a quiet talk together  we shall see you at dinner  vernon  what time is dinner  the younger miss wetherell  half past seven  to fanny  but dont you hurry dear  i will tell cook to delay it a little  she kisses her  the elder miss wetherell  you will want some time to arrange that pretty hair of yours  she also kisses the passive speechless fanny  they go out hand in hand  bennet  i will see while i am here that your lordships room is in order  vernon  why wheres robert then  bennet  he has gone into town to do some shopping  we did not expect your lordship much before nine  there may be one or two things to see to  he goes into his lordships apartments closing the door behind him  fanny  vernon where am i  vernon  at home dear  fanny  yes but where  vernon  at bantock hall rutlandshire  fanny sits down on the setteedrops down rather  youre not angry with me  you know how the world always talks in these cases  i wanted to be able to prove to them all that you married me for myself  not because i was lord bantock  can you forgive me  fanny she still seems in a dream  yesof course  you didntyou wouldntshe suddenly springs up  vernon you do love me  she flings her arms round his neck  vernon  dear  fanny  you will never be ashamed of me  vernon  dearest  fanny  i was only a musichall singer  theres no getting over it you know  vernon  i should have loved you had you been a beggarmaid  fanny she still clings to him  with an uncle a costermonger and an aunt who sold matches  it wouldnt have made any difference to you would it  you didnt marry me for my family did you  you didnt did you  vernon  darling  i married you because you are the most fascinating the most lovable the most wonderful little woman in the world  fanny gives a sob  as for your familyive got a confession to make to you dear  i made inquiries about your family before i proposed to you  not for my own sakebecause i knew id have to answer a lot of stupid questions  it seemed to me quite a good family  fanny  it is  oh it is  there never was such a respectable family  thats why i never could get on with them  vernon laughing  well you havent got toany more  we neednt even let them know   bennet returns  bennet  robert i find has returned  it is ten minutes to seven  vernon  thanks  well i shall be glad of a bath  he turns to fanny  bennet will send your maid to you  he whispers to her youll soon get used to it all  as for the confounded familywe will forget all about them  fanny answers with another little stifled sob  bennet is drawing the curtains his back to the room vernon seeing that bennet is occupied kisses the unresponsive fanny and goes out  at the sound of the closing of the door fanny looks up  she goes to the door through which vernon has just passed listens a moment then returns  bennet calmly finishes the drawing of the curtains  then he too crosses slowly till he and fanny are facing one another across the centre of the room  fanny  well what are you going to do  bennet  my duty  fanny  whats that  something unpleasant i know  i can bet my bottom dollar  bennet  that my girl will depend upon you  fanny  how upon me  bennet  whether you prove an easy or a difficult subject  to fit you for your position a certain amount of training will i fancy be necessary  fanny  training  im to beshe draws herself up  are you aware who i am  bennet  oh yes  and who you were  his lordship i take it would hardly relish the discovery that he had married his butlers niece he might consider the situation awkward  fanny  and whos going to train me  bennet  i am  with the assistance of your aunt and such other members of your family as i consider can be trusted  fanny for a moment she is speechless then she bursts out  that ends it  i shall tell him  i shall tell him this very moment  she sweeps towards the door  bennet  at this moment you will most likely find his lordship in his bath  fanny  i dont care  do you thinkdo you think for a moment that im going to allow myselfi lady bantock to beher hand upon the door  i shall tell him and youll only have yourself to blame  he loves me  he loves me for myself  i shall tell him the whole truth and ask him to give you all the sack  bennet  youre not forgetting that youve already told him once who you were  it stops her  what she really did was to leave the marriage arrangements in the hands of her business manager george p newte as agent for a musichall star he is ideal but it is possible that in answering lord bantocks inquiries concerning fannys antecedents he may not have kept strictly to the truth  fanny  i never did  ive never told him anything about my family  bennet  curious  i was given to understand it was rather a classy affair  fanny  i cant help what other people may have done  because some silly idiot of a man may possiblyshe will try a new tack  she leaves the door and comes to him  uncle dear wouldnt it be simpler for you all to go away  hes awfully fond of me  hell do anything i ask him  i could merely say that i didnt like you and get him to pension you off  you and aunt could have a little roadside inn somewherewith ivy  bennet  seeing that together with the stables and the garden there are twentythree of us   fanny  no of course he couldnt pension you all  you couldnt expect   bennet  i think his lordship might prefer to leave things as they are  good servants nowadays are not so easily replaced  and neither your aunt nor i are at an age when change appeals to one  fanny  you see its almost bound to creep out sooner or later and then   bennet  we will make it as late as possible he crosses and rings the bell giving you time to prove to his lordship that you are not incapable of learning  fanny she drops back on the settee  she is halfcrying  some people would be pleased that their niece had married well  bennet  i am oldfashioned enough to think also of my duty to those i serve  if his lordship has done me the honour to marry my niece the least i can is to see to it that she brings no discredit to his name  mrs bennet followed by jane bennet a severelooking woman of middle age has entered upon the words the least i can do bennet stays them a moment with his hand while he finishes  then he turns to his wife  you will be interested to find susannah that the new lady bantock is not a stranger  mrs bennet  not a stranger  she has reached a position from where she sees the girl  fanny  you wicked girl  where have you been all these years  bennet interposing  there will be other opportunities for the discussion of family differences  just now her ladyship is waiting to dress for dinner  mrs bennet sneering  her ladyship  jane also sneering  i think she might have forewarned us of the honour in store for us  mrs bennet  yes why didnt she write  fanny  because i didnt know  do you thinkshe risesthat if i had i would ever have married himto be brought back here and put in this ridiculous position  do you think that i am so fond of you all that i couldnt keep away from you at any price  mrs bennet  but you must have known that lord bantock   fanny  i didnt know he was lord bantock  i only knew him as mr wetherell an artist  he wanted to feel sure that i was marrying him for himself alone  he never told meernest bennet a very young footman has entered in answer to bennets ring of a minute ago  he has come forward step by step staring all the while openmouthed at fanny  turning she sees him beside her  hulloa ernie  how are the rabbits  she kisses him  bennet  dont stand there gaping  i rang for some wood  tell your brother dinner will be at a quarter to eight  ernest never speaking still staring at fanny gets clumsily out again  fanny  well i suppose id better see about dressing  do i dine with his lordship or in the servants hall  mrs bennet turns to her husband  you see  still the old impertinence  fanny  only wanted to know  my only desire is to give satisfaction  bennet he moves towards the door  you will do it by treating the matter more seriously  at dinner by keeping your eye upon me you will be able to tell whether you are behaving yourself or not  mrs bennet  and mind you are punctual  i have appointed jane to be your maid  fanny  jane  mrs bennet in arms  have you any objections  fanny  no oh no so long as youre all satisfied  mrs bennet  remember you are no longer on the musichall stage in dressing for bantock hall you will do well to follow her advice  bennet who has been waiting with the door in his hand goes out mrs bennet follows  jane in the tones of a patient executioner  are you ready  fanny  quite ready dear  of coursei dont know what you will think of thembut ive only brought modern costumes with me  jane not a lady who understands satire  we must do the best we can  she marches outinto the dressingroom  fanny after following a few steps stops and thinks  ernest has entered with the wood  he is piling it in the basket by the fire his entrance decides her  she glances through the open door of the dressingroom then flies across to the desk seats herself and begins feverishly to write a telegram  fanny  ernie  he comes across to her  have you still got your bicycle  ernest  yes  fanny  could you get this telegram off for me before eight oclock i dont want it sent from the village i

closes door behind him  merely been putting the room a bit tidy  she is flying round collecting her outdoor garments  thought it would please you  so sorry if ive kept you waiting  jane has appeared at door  after you dear  jane goes out again  fanny with her pile of luggage follows  curtain    act ii    scene  the same  timethe next morning  the door opens  dr freemantle enters shown in by bennet who follows him  dr freemantle talking as he enters  wonderful  wonderful  i dont really think i ever remember so fine a spring  bennet he is making up the fire  im afraid we shall have to pay for it later on  dr freemantle  i expect so  law of the universe you know bennet law of the universe  everything in this world has got to be paid for  bennet  except trouble  the doctor laughs  the times  he hands it to him  dr freemantle  thanks  thanks  seats himself  wont be long his lordship will he  bennet  i dont think so  i told him you would be here about eleven  dr freemantle  umwhat do you think of her  bennet  ofof her ladyship  dr freemantle  whats she like  bennet  they have sunk their voices  well it might have been worse  dr freemantle  ah  theres always that consolation isnt there  bennet  i think her ladyshipwith managementmay turn out very satisfactory  dr freemantle  you like her  bennet  at present i must say for her she appears willing to be taught  dr freemantle  and you think it will last  bennet  i think her ladyship appreciates the peculiarity of her position  i will tell the miss wetherells you are here  dr freemantle  ah thanks  bennet  i fancy her ladyship will not herself be visible much before lunch time  i understand she woke this morning with a headache  he goes out  the doctor reads a moment  then the door of the dressingroom opens and fanny enters  her dress is a wonderful contrast to her costume of last evening  it might be that of a poor and demure nursery governess  her hair is dressed in keeping  she hardly seems the same woman  fanny seeing the doctor she pauses  oh  dr freemantle rises  i beg pardon have i the pleasure of seeing lady bantock  fanny  yes  dr freemantle  delighted  may i introduce myselfdr freemantle i helped your husband into the world  fanny  yes  ive heard of you  you dont mind my closing this door do you  her very voice and manner are changed  dr freemantle a little puzzled  not at all  fanny she closes the door and returns  wontwont you be seated  dr freemantle  thanks  they both sit  hows the headache  fanny  oh its better  dr freemantle  ah  a silence  forgive meim an old friend of the family  youre not a bit what i expected  fanny  but you like it  i mean you think thiswith a gestureis all right  dr freemantle  my dear young lady its charming  you couldnt be anything else  fanny  thank you  dr freemantle  i merely meant thatwell i was not expecting anything so delightfully demure  fanny  thats the ideaseemly  the lady bantocks have always been seemly  she puts it as a question  dr freemantle more and more puzzled  yesoh yes  they have always beenhis eye catches that of constance first lady bantock looking down at him from above the chimneypiece  his tone changes well yes in their way you know  fanny  you see im in the difficult position of following her late ladyship  she appears to have been exceptionally seemly  this is her frock  i mean it was her frock  dr freemantle  god bless my soul  you are not dressing yourself up in her late ladyships clothes  the dear good woman has been dead and buried these twenty years  fanny she looks at her dress  yes it struck me as being about that period  dr freemantle he goes across to her  whats the trouble  too much bennet  fanny she looks up  there is a suspicion of a smile  one might saysufficient  dr freemantle laughs  excellent servants  if theyd only remember it  he glances roundsinks his voice  take my advice put your foot downbefore its too late  fanny  sit down please  she makes room for him on the settee because im going to be confidential  you dont mind do you  dr freemantle seating himself  my dear i take it as the greatest compliment i have had paid to me for years  fanny  you put everything so nicely  im two persons  im an angelperhaps that is too strong a word  dr freemantle doubtfully  well   fanny  well say saint  or else imthe other thing  dr freemantle  do you know i think you could be  fanny  its not a question about which there is any doubt  dr freemantle  of course in this case a little bit of the devil   fanny she shakes her head  theres such a lot of mine  it has always hampered me never being able to hit the happy medium  dr freemantle  it is awkward  fanny  i thought i would go on being an angel   dr freemantle  saint  fanny  sainttillwell till it became physically impossible to be a saint any longer  dr freemantle  and then  fanny she rises turns to him with a gesture of halfcomic half tragic despair  well then i cant help it can i  dr freemantle  i think youre making a mistake  an explosion will undoubtedly have to take place  that being so the sooner it takes place the better  he rises  what are you afraid of  fanny she changes her tonethe talk becomes serious  youve known vernon all his life  dr freemantle  no one better  fanny  tell me  ive known him only as a lover  what sort of a man is he  a pause  they are looking straight into each others eyes  dr freemantle  a man it pays to be perfectly frank with  fanny  its a very old family isnt it  dr freemantle  old  good lord no  first lord bantock was only vernons greatgrandfather  that is the woman that did it all  he is looking at the hoppner  fanny  how do you mean  dr freemantle  got them their title  made the name of bantock of importance in the history of the georges  clever woman  fanny leaning over a chair she is staring into the eyes of the first lady bantock  i wonder what she would have done if she had ever got herself into a really firstclass muddle  dr freemantle  one things certain  fanny turns to him  shed have got out of it  fanny addresses the portrait  i do wish you could talk  vernon bursts into the room  he has been riding  he throws aside his hat and stick  vernon  hulloa  this is good of you  he shakes hands with the doctor  how are you  without waiting for any reply he goes to fanny kisses her  good morning dear  how have you been getting on together you two  has she been talking to you  dr freemantle  oh yes  vernon  doesnt she talk well  i say what have you been doing to yourself  fanny  jane thought this stylewith a gesturemore appropriate to lady bantock  vernon  um  wonder if shes right  to the doctor  what do you think  dr freemantle  i think it a question solely for lady bantock  vernon  of course it is  to fanny  you know you mustnt let them dictate to you  dear good faithful souls all of them  but they must understand that you are mistress  fanny she seizes eagerly at the chance  you might mention it to them dear  it would come so much better from you  vernon  no you  they will take more notice of you  fanny  id so much rather you did it  to dr freemantle  dont you think it would come better from him  dr freemantle laughs  im afraid youll have to do it yourself  vernon  you see dear it might hurt them coming from me  it would seem like ingratitude  mrs bennetwhy it wasnt till i began to ask questions that i grasped the fact that she wasnt my real mother as for old bennet ever since my father diedwell i hardly know how i could have got on without him  it was charles bennet that taught me to ride i learned my letters sitting on janes lap  fanny  yes  perhaps i had better do it myself  vernon  im sure it will be more effective  of course i shall support you  fanny  thank you  oh by the by dear i shant be able to go

greetings with the doctor  fanny  you know you promised to obey  tickles his nose with a flower  vernon laughingto the doctor  you see what it is to be married  dr freemantle laughs  very trying  vernon turning to his aunts  fanny isnt coming with us  the younger miss wetherell to fanny  oh my dear  fanny  its only a headache  she takes her aside  im rather glad of it  i want an excuse for a little time to myself  the younger miss wetherell  i understand dear  its all been so sudden  she kisses herthen to the room  shell be all the better alone  we three will go on  she nods and signs to her sister  fanny kissing the elder miss wetherell  dont you get betting  the elder miss wetherell  oh no dear we never do  its just to see the dear horses  she joins her sister  they whisper  vernon to the doctor to whom he has been talking  can we give you a lift  dr freemantle  well you might as far as the vicarage  goodbye lady bantock  fanny shaking hands  goodbye doctor  vernon  sure you wont be lonely  fanny laughs  think i cant exist an hour without you  mr conceited  vernon laughs and kisses her  come along  he takes the doctor and his younger aunt towards the door  the elder miss wetherell who is following last  i like you in that frock  fanny laughs  so glad  its ernest who attends to the fires isnt it  the elder miss wetherell  yes dear  fanny  i wish youd send him up  at

bradshaw  fivesixthreefivesixthree finds page  st pancras eight oclock  oh lord  stamford 1045  leave stamfordernest has entered  is that you ernest  ernest  yes  fanny  shut the door  sure it went

twenty past eleven  fanny  if he does hell be here about twelvei believe ill go and meet him  could i get out without being seen  ernest  youll have to pass the lodge  fanny  whos at the lodge now  ernest  mother  fanny  damn  bennet has entered unnoticed and drawn near  at this point from behind he boxes ernests ears  ernest  here steady  bennet  on the occasions when your cousin forgets her position you will remember it and remind her of it  get out  ernest clumsily as ever gets out  a sort of person has called who according to his own account happened to be passing this way and would like to see you  fanny who has been trying to hide the bradshawwith affected surprise  to see me  bennet drily  yes  i thought you would be surprised  he claims to be an old friend of yoursmr george newte  fanny still keeping it up  george newte  of courseah yes  do you mind showing him up  bennet  i thought i would let you know he had arrived in case you might be getting anxious about him  i propose giving him a glass of beer and sending him away again  fanny flares up  look here uncle you and i have got to understand one another  i may put up with being bullied myselfif i cant see any help for itbut im not going to stand my friends being insulted  you show mr newte up here  a silence  bennet  i shall deem it my duty to inform his lordship of mr newtes visit  fanny  there will be no need to  mr newte if his arrangements permit will be staying to dinner  bennet  that we shall see about  he goes out  fanny following him to door  and tell them i shall want the best bedroom got ready in case mr newte is able to stay the night  ive done it  she goes to piano dashes into the merry widow waltz or some other equally inappropriate but wellknown melody and then there enters newte shown in by bennet  newte is a cheerful person attractively dressed in clothes suggestive of a successful bookmaker he carries a white pot hat and tasselled cane  his gloves are large and bright  he is smoking an enormous cigar  bennet  mr newte  fanny she springs up and greets him  they are evidently good friends   hulloa george  newte  hulloa fani beg your pardon lady bantock  laughs  was just passing this way   fanny cutting him short  yes  so nice of you to call  newte  i said to myselfhis eye catches bennet he stops  ah thanks  he gives bennet his hat and stick but bennet does not seem satisfied  he has taken from the table a small china tray  this he is holding out to newte evidently for newte to put something in it but what  newte is puzzled he glances at fanny  the idea strikes him that perhaps it is a tip bennet is waiting for  it seems odd but if it be the customhe puts his hand to his trousers pocket  bennet  the smokingroom is on the groundfloor  newte  ah my cigar  i beg your pardon  i couldnt understand he puts it on the traybreaks into a laugh  bennet  thank you  her ladyship is suffering from a headache  if i might suggesta little less boisterousness  he goes out  newte he watches him out  i say your lord chamberlains a bit of a freezer  fanny  yes  wants hanging out in the sun  how did you manage to get here so early  she sits  newte  well your telegram rather upset me  i thoughtcorrect etiquette for me to sit down here do you think  fanny  dont ask me  got enough new tricks of my own to learn laughs  should chance it if i were you  newte  such a long time since i was at court  he sits  yes i was up at five oclock this morning  fanny laughs  oh you poor fellow  newte  caught the first train to melton and came on by cart whats the trouble  fanny  a good deal  why didnt you tell me what i was marrying  newte  i did  i told you that he was a gentleman that he   fanny  why didnt you tell me that he was lord bantock  you knew didnt you  newte begins to see worries ahead  cant object to my putting a cigar in my mouth if i dont light itcan he  fanny  oh light itanything you like that will help you to get along  newte bites the end off the cigar and puts it between his teeth this helps him  no i didnt knownot officially  fanny  what do you meannot officially  newte  he never told me  fanny  he never told you anythingfor the matter of that  i understood you had found out everything for yourself  newte  yes and one of the things i found out was that he didnt want you to know  i could see his little game  wanted to play the lord burleigh fake  well what was the harm  didnt make any difference to you  fanny  didnt make any difference to me  jumps up  do you know what ive done  married into a family that keeps twentythree servants every blessed one of whom is a near relation of my own he sits paralysed  she goes on  that baldheaded old owlwith a wave towards the doorthat wanted to send you off with a glass of beer and a flea in your earthats my uncle  the woman that opened the lodge gate for you is my aunt amelia  the carrotyheaded young man that answered the door to you is my cousin simeon  he always used to insist on kissing me  im expecting him to begin again  my ladys maid is my cousin jane  thats why im dressed like this my own clothes have been packed off to the local dressmaker to be made decent  meanwhile theyve dug up the family vault to find something for me to go on with  he has been fumbling in all his pockets for matches  she snatches a box from somewhere and flings it to him  for heavens sake light it  then perhaps youll be able to do something else than stare  i have claret and watermixed with my dinner  uncle pours it out for me  theyve locked up my cigarettes  aunt susannah is coming in tomorrow morning to hear me say my prayers  doesnt trust me by myself  thinks ill skip them shes the housekeeper here  ive got to know them by heart before i go to bed tonight and now ive mislaid them  she goes to the deskhunts for them  newte having lighted his eternal cigar he can begin to think  but why should they   fanny still at desk  because theyre that sort  they honestly think they are doing the right and proper thingthat providence has put it into their hands to turn me out a passable substitute for all a lady bantock should be which so far as i can understand is something between the late lamented queen victoria and goodytwo shoes  they are the people that i ran away from the people ive told you about the people ive always said id rather starve than ever go back to  and here i am plumped down in the midst of them againfor life  honoria bennet the stillroom maid has entered  she is a pert young minx of about fannys own age  what is is  what is it  honoria  merely passing through  sorry to have excited your ladyship  goes into dressingroom  fanny  my cousin honoria  theyve sent her up to keep an eye upon me  little cat  she takes her handkerchief drapes it over the keyhole of the dressingroom door  newte at sight of honoria he has jumped up and hastily hidden his cigar behind him  what are you going to do  fanny she seats herself and suggests to him the writingchair hear from youfirst of allexactly what you told vernon  newte sitting  about you  fanny nods  about meand my family  newte  wellcouldnt tell him much of course  wasnt much to tell  fanny  i want what you did tell  newte  i told him that your late father was a musician  fanny  yes  newte  had been unfortunate  didnt go into particulars  didnt seem to be any need for it  that your mother had died when you were still only a girl and that you had gone to live with relatives  he looks for approval  fanny  yes  newte  that you hadnt got on well with themartistic temperament all that sort of thingthat in consequence you had appealed to your fathers old theatrical friends and that theythat they having regard to your talentand beauty   fanny  thank you  newte  had decided that the best thing you could do was to go upon the stage  he finishes tolerably well pleased with himself  fanny  thats all right  very good indeed  what else  newte after an uncomfortable pause  well thats about all i knew  fanny  yes but what did you tell him  newte  well of course i had to tell him something  a man doesnt marry without knowing just a little about his wifes connections wouldnt be reasonable to expect him  youd never told me anything never would except that youd liked to have boiled the lot  what was i to do  he is playing with a quill pen he has picked up  fanny she takes it from him  what did you do  newte with fine frankness  i did the best i could for you old girl and he was very nice about it  said it was better than hed expected and that id made him very happyvery happy indeed  fanny she leans across puts her hand on his  youre a dear good fellow georgealways have been  i wouldnt plague you only it is absolutely necessary i should knowexactly what you did tell him  newte a little sulkily  i told him that your uncle was a bishop  fanny sits backstaring at him  a what  newte  a bishop  bishop of waiapu new zealand  fanny  why new zealand  newte  why not  had to be somewhere  didnt want him archbishop of canterbury did you  fanny  did he believe it  newte  shouldnt have told him had there been any fear that he wouldnt  fanny  i see  any other swell relations of mine knocking about  newte  onea judge of the supreme court in ohio  same name anyhow ogorman  thought id make him a cousin of yours  ive always remembered him  met him when i was over there in ninety eightdamn him  a silence  fanny she rises  well nothing else for it  got to tell him it was all a pack of lies  not blaming you old boymy fault  didnt know he was going to ask any questions or id have told him myself bit of bad luck thats all  newte  why must you tell him  only upset him  fanny  its either my telling him or leaving it for them to do  you know me george  how long do you see me being bossed and bullied by my own servants  besides its bound to come out in any case  newte he rises  kindly but firmly he puts her back into her chair then pacing to and fro with his hands mostly in his trousers pockets he talks  now you listen to me old girl  ive been your business manager ever since you started in  ive never made a mistake before he turns and faces herand i havent made one this time  fanny  i dont really see the smartness george stuffing him up with a lot of lies he can find out for himself  newte  if he wants to  a couple of telegrams one to his grace the bishop of waiapu the other to judge denis ogorman columbus ohio would have brought him back the information that neither gentlemen had ever heard of you  if he hadnt been careful not to send them he wasnt marrying you with the idea of strengthening his family connections  he was marrying you because he was just gone on you couldnt help himself  fanny  in that case you might just as well have told him the truth  newte  which he would then have had to pass on to everyone entitled to ask questions  cant you understand  somebody in the interest of everybody had to tell a lie  well whats a business manager for  fanny  but i cant do it george  you dont know them  the longer i give in to them the worse theyll get  newte  cant you square them  fanny  no thats the trouble  they are honest  theyre the faithful retainers out of a melodrama  they are working eighteen hours a day on me not for any advantage to themselves but because they think it their duty to the family  they dont seem to have any use for themselves at all  newte  well what about the boy  cant he talk to them  fanny  vernon  theyve brought him up from a babyspanked him all round i expect  might as well ask a boy to talk to his old schoolmaster  besides if he did talk then it would all come out as i tell you its bound to come outand the sooner the better  newte  it must not come out  its too late  if we had told him at the beginning that he was proposing to marry into his own butlers familywell its an awkward situationhe might have decided to risk it  or he might have cried off  fanny  and a good job if he had  newte  now talk sense  you wanted himyou took a fancy to him from the beginning  hes a nice boy and theres something owing to him it is his trump card and he knows it  dont forget that  hes been busy explaining to all his friends and relations why they should receive you with open arms  really nice girl born gentlewoman good old church of england familyno objection possible  for you to spring the truth upon him nowwell it doesnt seem to me quite fair to him  fanny  then am i to live all my life dressed as a charity girl  newte  you keep your head and things will gradually right themselves  this family of yourstheyve got some sense i suppose  fanny  never noticed any sign of it myself  newte  maybe youre not a judge  laughs  theyll listen to reason  you let me have a talk to them one of these days see if i cant show themfirst one and then the otherthe advantage of leaving to better themselveswith the help of a little ready money  later onchoosing your proper timeyou can break it to him that you have discovered theyre distant connections of yours a younger branch of the family that youd forgotten  give the show time to settle down into a run  then you can begin to make changes  fanny  youve a wonderful way with you george  it always sounds right as you put iteven when one jolly well knows that it isnt  newte  well its always been right for you old girl aint it  fanny  yes  youve been a rattling good friend  she takes his hands  almost wish id married you instead  wed have been more suited to one another  newte shakes his head  nothing like having your fancy  youd never have been happy without him  he releases her  twas a good engagement or id never have sanctioned it  fanny  i suppose it will be the last one you will ever get me  she has dropped for a moment into a brown study  newte he turns  i hope so  fanny she throws off her momentary mood with a laugh  poor fellow you never even got your commission  newte  ill take ten per cent of all your happiness old girl  so make it as much as you can for my benefit  goodbye  he holds out hand  fanny  youre not going  youll stop to lunch  newte  not today  fanny  do  if you dont theyll think its because i was frightened to ask you  newte  all the better  the more the other party thinks hes having his way the easier always to get your own  your trouble is you know that you never had any tact  fanny  i hate tact  newte laughs  we could have had such a jolly little lunch together  im all alone till the evening  there were ever so many things i wanted to talk to you about  newte  what  fanny  ah how can one talk to a man with his watch in his hand he puts it away and stands waiting but she is cross  i think youre very disagreeable  newte  i must really get back to town  i oughtnt to be away now only your telegram   fanny  i know  im an ungrateful little beast  she crosses and rings bell  youll have a glass of champagne before you go  newte  well i wont say no to that  fanny  how are all the girls  newte  oh chirpy  im bringing them over to london  we open at the palace next week  fanny  what did they think of my marriage  gerty was a bit jealous wasnt she  newte  well would have been if shed

love  ernest appears in answer to her bell  oh ernest tell bennetthe eyes and mouth of ernest open to see that mr newte has some refreshment before he leaves  a glass of champagne andand some caviare  dont forget  ernest goes out  goodbye  youll come again  newte  whenever you want meand rememberthe watchword is tact  fanny  yes ive got the word all right  laughs  dont forget to give my love to the girls  newte  i wont  so long  he goes out  fanny closes the door  honoria has reentered from the dressing room  she looks from the handkerchief still hanging over the keyhole to fanny  honoria  your ladyships handkerchief  fanny  yes  such a draught through that keyhole  honoria takes the handkerchief hands it to fanny  i will tell the housekeeper  fanny  thanks  maybe you will also mention it to the butler possibly also to theshe suddenly changes  honoria  suppose it had been youyou know youre awfully prettywho had married lord bantock and he had brought you back here among them alluncle aunt all the lot of themwhat would you have done  honoria she draws herself up  i should have made it quite plain from the first that i was mistress and that they were my servants  fanny  you would you think   honoria checking her outburst  but then dearyou will excuse my speaking plainlythere is a slight difference between the two cases she seats herself on the settee  fanny is standing near the desk you see what we all feel about you dear isthat you arewell hardly a fit wife for his lordship  fannys hands are itching to box the girls ears  to save herself she grinds out through her teeth the word tack  of course dear it isnt altogether your fault  fanny  thanks  honoria  your mothers marriage was most unfortunate  fanny her efforts to suppress her feelings are justbut only just successful  need we discuss that  honoria  well he was an irishman dear theres no denying it fanny takes a cushion from a chairwith her back to honoria she strangles it  jane has entered and is listening  still perhaps it is a painful subject  and we hopeall of usthat with time and patience we may succeed in eradicating the natural results of your bringingup  jane  some families finding themselves in our position would seek to turn it to their own advantage  we think only of your good  fanny  yes thats what i feelthat you are worrying yourselves too much about me  youre too conscientious all of you  you in particular jane because you know youre not strong  youll end up with a nervous breakdown  mrs bennet has entered  honoria slips out  fanny turns to her aunt  i was just saying how anxious im getting about jane  i dont like the look of her at all  what she wants is a holiday  dont you agree with me  mrs bennet  there will be no holiday i fear for any of us for many a long day  fanny  but you must  you must think more of yourselves you know youre not looking well aunt at all  what you both want is a monthat the seaside  mrs bennet  your object is too painfully apparent for the subject to need discussion  true solicitude for us would express itself better in greater watchfulness upon your own behaviour  fanny  why what have i done  bennet enters followed unwillingly by ernest  mrs bennet  your uncle will explain  bennet  shut that door  ernest does so  they group round bennet ernest a little behind  fanny remains near the desk  sit down fanny bewildered speechless sits  carry your mind back please to the moment when with the bradshaw in front of you you were considering with the help of your cousin ernest the possibility of your slipping out unobserved to meet and commune with a person you had surreptitiously summoned to visit you during your husbands absence  fanny  while i think of it did he have anything to eat before he went  i told ernest toask you to see that he had a glass of champagne and a   bennet waves her back into silence  mr newte was given refreshment suitable to his station  she goes to interrupt  again he waves her back  we are speaking of more important matters  your cousin reminded you that you would have to pass the lodge occupied by your aunt amelia  i state the case correctly  fanny  beautifully  bennet  i said nothing at the time doubting the evidence of my own ears  the boy howeverwhere is the boyernest is pushed forwardhas admittedreluctantlythat he also heard it  a pause  the solemnity deepens  you made use of an expression   fanny  oh cut it short  i said damn  a shudder passes  im sorry to have frightened you but if you knew a little more of really good society you would know that ladiesquite slapup ladieswhen theyre excited do  mrs bennet interrupting with almost a scream  she defends it  bennet  you will allow me to be the judge of what a lady says even when she is excited  as for this man newte   fanny  the best friend you ever had  she is up again  you thank your stars all of you and tell the others too the whole blessed twentythree of youyou thank your stars that i did surreptitiously beg and pray him to run down by the first train and have a talk with me and that providence was kind enough to you to enable him to come  its a very different tune youd have been singing at this momentall of youif he hadnt  i can tell you that  mrs bennet  and pray what tune should we have been singing if providence hadnt been so thoughtful of us  fanny she is about to answer then checks herself and sits again you take care you dont find out  theres time yet  mrs bennet  we had better leave her  bennet  threats my good girl will not help you  mrs bennet with a laugh  shes in too tight a corner for that  bennet  a contrite heart is what your aunt and i desire to see  he takes from his pocket a small book places it open on the desk  i have marked one or two passages on pages 937  we will discuss them togetherlater in the day  they troop out in silence the key turns in the lock  fanny takes up the bookturns to the cover reads  the sinners manual  she turns to page 93  curtain    act iii    scene  the same  timea few days later  a table is laid for tea  ernest enters with the teaurn  he leaves the door open through it comes the sound of an harmonium accompanying the singing of a hymn  fanny comes from her dressing room  she is dressed more cheerfully than when we last saw her but still seemly  she has a book in her hand  she pauses hearing the music goes nearer to the open door and listens then crosses and takes her place at the table  the music ceases  fanny  another prayer meeting  ernest nods  i do keep em busy  ernest  dye know what they call you downstairs  fanny  what  ernest  the family cross  fanny  im afraid its about right  ernest  what have you been doing this time  swearing again  fanny  worse  ive been lying  ernest gives vent to a low whistle  said i didnt

him mix you up in any of his ventures  dear old george hes as honest as the day but if he gets hold of an idea theres always thousands in it for everybody  vernon  ill be careful  ernest has left the door open  the harmonium breaks forth again together with vocal accompaniment as before  whats on downstairs thena party  fanny  bennet is holding a prayer meeting  vernon  a prayer meeting  fanny  one of the younger members of the family has been detected telling a deliberate lie  vernon is near the door listening with his back towards her or he would see that she is smiling  black sheep i suppose to be found in every flock  music ceases ernest having arrived with the news of his lordships return  vernon returning to the table having closed the door  good old man you know bennet  all of them  so highprincipled  dont often get servants like that nowadays  fanny  seems almost selfish keeping the whole collection to ourselves  vernon laughs  pon my word it does  but what can we do  theyll never leave usnot one of them  fanny  no i dont believe they ever will  vernon  do you know i sometimes think that you dont like them fanny makes a movement  of course they are a bit bossy i admit but all that comes from their devotion their   fanny  the wonder to me is that brought up among them admiring them as you do you never thought of marrying one of them  vernon staggered  marrying them  fanny  i didnt say them  i said one of them  theres honoria shes pretty enough anyhow  sos alice charles bennets daughter and bertha and graceall of them beautiful  and whats even better stillgood  she says it viciously  didnt you ever think of them  vernon  well laughswell one hardly marries into ones own kitchen  fanny  isnt that rather snobbish  you say theyre more like friends than servants  theyve lived with your people side by side for three generations doing their duty honourably  theres never been a slur upon their name  theyre highprincipled  you know it  theyve better manners than ninetenths of your smart society and theyre healthy  whats wrong with themeven from a lords point of view  vernon recovering himself  well dont pitch into me about it its your fault if i didnt marry themi mean one of them  he laughs puts his empty cup back on the table  maybe id have thought about itif i hadnt met you  fanny takes his hand in hers  i wish you hadnt asked newte any questions about me  it would have been so nice to feel that you had married mejust because you couldnt help itjust because i was i and nothing else mattered  vernon  lets forget i ever did  he kneels beside her  i didnt do it for my own sake as you know  a man in my position has to think of other people  his wife has to take her place in society people insist upon knowing something about her  its not enough for the stupid county that shes the cleverest most bewilderingly beautiful bewitching lady in the land  fanny  and how long will you think all that  vernon  for ever and ever and ever  fanny  oh you dear boy  she kisses him  you dont know how a woman loves the man she loves to love her  laughs  isnt that complicated  vernon  not at all  were just the same  we love to love the woman we love  fanny  provided the county will let us  and the county has said a man may not marry his butlers niece  vernon laughing  youve got butlers on the brain  if ever i do run away with my own cook or underhousemaid it will be your doing  fanny  you havent the pluck  the county would laugh at you  you men are so frightened of being laughed at  vernon he rises  well if it saves us from making asses of ourselves   fanny  wasnt there a niece of old bennets a girl who had been brought up abroad and who wasnt a domestic servantnever had been who stayed with them here at the gardeners cottage for a short time some few years ago  vernon  you mean poor rose bennets daughterthe one who ran away and married an organgrinder  fanny  an organgrinder  vernon  something of that sortyes  they had her over did all they could  a crazy sort of girl used to sing french ballads on the village green to all the farm labourers she could collect  shortened poor bennets life by about ten years  laughs  but why  not going to bully me for not having fallen in love with her are you because that really wasnt my fault  i never even saw her  twas the winter we spent in rome  she bolted before we got back  never gave me a chance  fanny  i accept the excuse  laughs  no i was merely wondering what the county would have done if by any chance you had married her  couldnt have said you were marrying into your own kitchen in her case because she was never in your kitchenabsolutely refused to enter it im told  vernon laughs  it would have been a nice point as they say in legal circles  if people had liked her theyd have tried to forget that her cousins had ever been scullerymaids  if not theyd have taken good care that nobody did  bennet enters  he brings some cut flowers with the placing of which he occupies himself  bennet  i did not know your lordship had returned  vernon  found a telegram waiting for me in the village  whats become of that niece of yours bennetyour sister roses daughter who was here for a short time and ran away again  ever hear anything about her  bennet very quietly he turns lets his eyes for a moment meet fannys  then answers as he crosses to the windows  the last i heard about her was that she was married  vernon  satisfactorily  bennet  looking at it from her point of viewmost satisfactorily  vernon laughs  but looking at it from hismore doubtful  bennet  she was not without her attractions  her chief faults i am inclined to think were those arising from want of discipline in youth  i have hopes that it is not even yet too late to root out from her nature the weeds of indiscretion  vernon  and you think he is the man to do it  bennet  perhaps not  but fortunately there are those about her fully alive to the duty devolving upon them  vernon  um  sounds a little bit like penal servitude for the poor girl the way you put it bennet  bennet  even penal servitude may be a blessing if it serves to correct a stubborn spirit  vernon  well have to make you a jp bennet  must be jolly careful i dont ever get tried before you  laughs  is that the cart  bennet he looks out through the window  yes your lordship  vernon he takes up his cap  i may be bringing someone back with me  to fanny who throughout has remained seated  why not put on your hatcome with me  fanny she jumps up delighted  shall i  bennet  your ladyship is not forgetting that today is wednesday  fanny  whats the odds  theres nobody to call  everybody is still in town  bennet  it has always been the custom of the lady bantocks when in residence to be at home on wednesdays  vernon  perhaps better not  it may cause talk if by chance anybody does come  i was forgetting it was wednesday  fanny sits again  i shant do anything without consulting you  goodbye  fanny  goodbye  vernon goes out  bennet  you think it wise discussing with his lordship the secret history of the bennet family  fanny  what do you mean by telling him my father was an organ grinder  if the british public knew the difference between music and a hurdygurdy he would have kept a butler of his own  bennet  i am not aware of having mentioned to his lordship that you ever to my knowledge even had a father  it is not my planfor the present at all eventsto inform his lordship anything about your family  take care i am not forced to  fanny  because my father a composer who had his work performed at the lamoureux concertsas i can prove because ive got the programmehad the misfortune to marry into a family of lackeysim not talking about my mother  she was never really one of you  she had the soul of an artist  bennet white with suppressed fury he is in front of her his very look is enough to silence her  now you listen to me my girl once and for all  i told you the night of your arrival that whether this business was going to prove a pleasant or an unpleasant one depended upon you  you make it an easy onefor your own sake  with one word i can bring your house of cards about your ears  ive only to tell him the truth for him to know you as a cheat and liar  she goes to speak again he silences her  you listen to me  youve seen fit to use strong language now im using strong language  this boy who has married you in a moment of impulse what does he know about the sort of wife a man in his position needs  what do you made to sing for your living on the paris boulevardswhose only acquaintance with the upper classes has been at shady restaurants  fanny  he didnt want a woman of his own class  he told me so  it was because i wasnt a colourless conventional puppet with a book of etiquette in place of a soul that he was first drawn towards me  bennet  yes  at twentytwo boys like unconventionality  men dont  theyve learnt its true name vulgarity  do you think ive stood behind english society for forty years without learning anything about it  what you call a colourless puppet is what we call an english lady  and that youve got to learn to be  you talk of lackeys  if your mother my poor sister rose came from a family of lackeys there would be no hope for you  with her blood in your veins the thing can be done  we bennetshe draws himself upwe serve  we are not lackeys  fanny  all right  dont you call my father an organgrinder and i wont call you lackeys  unfortunately that doesnt end the trouble  bennet  the trouble can easily be ended  fanny  yes  by my submitting to be ruled in all things for the remainder of my life by my own servants  bennet  say relations and it need not sound so unpleasant  fanny  yes it would  it would sound worse  one can get rid of ones servants  she has crossed towards the desk  her chequebook lies there half hidden under other papers  it catches her eye  her hand steals unconsciously towards it  she taps it idly with her fingers  it is all the work of a moment  nothing comes of it  just the idea passes through her brainnot for the first time  she does nothing noticeablemerely stands listless while one might count half a dozenthen turns to him again  dont you think youre going it a bit too strong all of you  im not a fool  ive got a lot to learn i know  id be grateful for help  what youre trying to do is to turn me into a new woman entirely  bennet  because that is the only way to help you  men do not put new wine into old bottles  fanny  oh dont begin quoting scripture  i want to discuss the thing sensibly  dont you see it cant be done  i cant be anybody else than myself  i dont want to  bennet  my girl youve got to be  root and branch inside and outside before youre fit to be lady bantock mother of the lord bantocks that are to be youve got to be a changed woman  a pause  fanny  and its going to be your job from beginning to endyours and the rest of you  what i wear and how i look is janes affair my prayers will be for what aunt susannah thinks i stand in need of what i eat and drink and say and do you will arrange for me  and when you die cousin simeon i suppose will take your place  and when aunt susannah dies it will merely be a change to aunt amelia and if jane ever dies honoria will have the dressing and the lecturing of me  and so on and so on world without end for ever and ever amen  bennet  before that time you will i shall hope have learnt sufficient sense to be grateful to us  he goes out  fanny she turnswalks slowly back towards the teatable  halfway she pauses and leaning over the back of a chair regards in silence for a while the portrait of the first lady bantock  i do wish i could tell what you were saying  the door opens  the misses wetherell come in  they wear the

timeearly the next morning  the door opens softly  newte steals in  he fumbles his way across to the windows draws the blinds  the morning sun streams in  he listensno one seems to be stirring  he goes out returns immediately with a butlers tray containing all things necessary for a breakfast and the lighting of a fire  he places the tray on table throws his coat over a chair and is on his knees busy lighting the fire when enter the misses wetherell clad in dressinggowns and caps  yet still they continue to look sweet  they also creep in hand in hand  the crouching newte is hidden by a hanging fire screen  they creep forward till the coat hanging over the chair catches their eye  they are staring at it as robinson crusoe might at the footprint when newte rises suddenly and turns  the misses wetherell give a suppressed scream and are preparing for flight  newte he stays them  no call to run away ladies  when a mans travelledas i haveacross america in a sleepingcar with a comicopera troop theres not much left for him to know  you want your breakfast  he wheedles them to the table  well be able to talk cosilybefore anybody else comes  they yield themselves  he has a way

younger miss wetherell  we hope you slept all right  dr freemantle  excellently  shall be glad of a shave thats all laughs  both he and newte suggest the want of one  newte who has been officiating  help yourself to milk and sugar  dr freemantle who has seated himself  have the bennets gone  newte  well they had their notice all right  the younger miss wetherell they have begun to cry  it has been so wrong and foolish of us  we have never learnt to do anything for ourselves  the elder miss wetherell  we dont even know where our things are  dr freemantle  they cant all have gonethe whole twentythree of them at a couple of hours notice  to newte  havent seen any of them have you  newte  no sign of any of them downstairs  dr freemantle  oh they must be still here  not up i suppose  it

with the new curate  vernon asked them on sunday  the younger miss wetherell  perhaps theres something cold  the elder miss wetherell  vernon so dislikes a cold lunch  dr freemantle to newte  were you able to get hold of vernon last night  newte  waited up till he came in about two oclock  merely answered that he wasnt in a talkative moodbrushed past me and locked himself in  dr freemantle  he wouldnt say anything to me either  rather a bad sign when he wont talk  newte  whats he likely to do  dr freemantle  dont know  of course it will be all over the county  the younger miss wetherell  and dear vernon is so sensitive  dr freemantle  it had to comethe misfortune is   newte  the misfortune is that people wont keep to their own line of business  why did he want to come fooling around her  she was doing well for herself  she could have married a man who would have thought more of her than all the damn fools in the county put together  why couldnt he have left her alone  dr freemantle he is sitting at the head of the table between newte on his right and the misses wetherell on his left  he lays his hand on newtes sleevewith a smile  im sure you can forgive a man with eyes and ears in his headfor having fallen in love with her  newte  then why doesnt he stand by her  what if her uncle is a butler  if he wasnt a fool hed be thanking his stars that twas anything half as respectable  dr freemantle  im not defending himwere not sure yet that he needs any defence  he has married a clever charming girl ofas you saya better family than hed any right to expect  the misfortune is thatby a curious bit of illluckit happens to be his own butler  newte  if she takes my advice shell return to the stage  no sense stopping where youre not wanted  the younger miss wetherell  but how can she  the elder miss wetherell  you see theyre married  dr freemantle to change the subject  youll take an egg  newte has been boiling some  he has just served them  the elder

the old ladies have their backs to the door  dr freemantle who is pouring out tea is the first to see him  he puts down the teapot staring  the old ladies look round  a silence  newte turns  bennet is

breakfast was required to be any earlier than usual or i should have had it ready  the younger miss wetherell  we are sure you would bennet  but you see under the circumstances wewe hardly liked to

have never felt to be a trouble to me  the elder miss wetherell  we know bennet  you have always been so conscientious  but of course after whats happenedthey are on the verge of tears again  bennet

first puzzled then indignant now breaks out  whats the little game on hereeh  yesterday afternoon you were given the sackby your mistress lady bantock with a months wages in lieu of noticenot an hour before you deserved it  what do you mean going on like this as if nothing had happened  is lady bantock to be ignored in this house as if she didnt existor is she not  he brings his fist down on the table  he has been shouting rather than speaking  i want this thing settled  bennet  your bath mr newte is quite ready  newte as soon as he can recover speech  never you mind my bath i want   vernon

kettle from the fire as he passes and goes out  vernon  thank you  he responds mechanically to the kisses of his two aunts who have risen and come to him  newte  can i have a word with you  vernon  a little later on if you dont mind mr newte  he passes him  newte he is about to speak changes his mind  all right go your own way  goes out  dr freemantle  remember says marcus aurelius   vernon  yesgood old sort marcus aurelius  he drops listlessly into a chair  dr freemantle smiles resignedly looks at the misses wetherell shrugs his shoulders and goes out closing the door after him  the misses wetherell whisper togetherlook round cautiously steal up behind him encouraging one another  the elder miss wetherell  shes so young  the younger miss wetherell  and so adaptable  vernon he is sitting bowed down with his face in his hands  ah it was the deception  the younger miss wetherell she puts her old thin hand on his shoulder  what would you have done dear if she had told youat first  vernon he takes her hand in hisanswers a little brokenly  i dont know  the elder miss wetherell  theres something we wanted to tell you he looks at her  they look across at each other  the first lady bantock your greatgrandmamma   the younger miss wetherell  she danced with george iii  the elder miss wetherell  she was a butchers daughter  the younger miss wetherell  he was quite a little butcher  the elder miss wetherell  of course as a rule dear we never mention it  the younger miss wetherell  we felt you ought to know  they take each others hands on tiptoe they steal out  they close the door softly behind them  vernon rises  he looks at the portraitdraws nearer to it  with his hands in his pockets stops dead in front of it and contemplates it in silence  the door of the dressingroom opens  fanny enters she is dressed for going out  she stands for a moment the door in her hand  vernon turns  she closes the door and comes forward  vernon  good morning  fanny  good morning  george stayed the night didnt he  vernon  yes  hes downstairs now  fanny  he wont be going for a little while  vernon  cant till the ten oclock train  have you had breakfast  fanny  iive had something to eat  im sorry for what i did last nightalthough they did deserve it  laughs  i suppose its a matter than can easily be put right again  vernon  you have no objection to their staying  fanny  why should i  vernon  what do you mean  fanny  theres only one hope of righting a mistake  and that is going back to the point from where one went wrongand that was our marriage  a moment  vernon  we havent given it a very long trial  fanny with an odd smile  it went to pieces at the first  i was in trouble all last night you must have known it  you left me alone  vernon  jane told me you had locked yourself in  fanny  you never tried the door for yourself dear  she pretends to rearrange something on the mantelpieceany excuse to turn away her face for a moment  she turns to him again smiling  it was a mistake the whole thing  you were partly to blame  you were such a nice boy  i fancied youto use georges words  she laughs and when a woman wants a thing she is apt to be a bit unscrupulous about how she gets it  she moves about the room touching the flowers rearranging a cushion a vase  i didnt invent the bishop that was georges embroidery  another laugh  but of course i ought to have told you everything myself  i ought not to have wanted a man to whom it would have made one atom of difference whether my cousins were scullerymaids or not  somehow i felt that to you it might  vernon winces  its natural enough  you have a big position to maintain  i didnt know you were a lordthat was your doing  george did find it out but he never told me least of all that you were lord bantockor you may be pretty sure i should have come out with the truth if only for my own sake  it hasnt been any joke for me coming back here  vernon  yes  i can see theyve been making things pretty hard for you  fanny  oh they thought they were doing their duty  he is seated she comes up behind him puts her hands on his shoulders  i want you to take them all back again  i want to feel i have made as little commotion in your life as possible  it was just a little mistake  and everybody will say how fortunate it was that she took herself off so soon with thatshe was about to say that theatrical johnny thinking of newte  she checks herself  and you will marry somebody belonging to your own class  and those are the only sensible marriages there are  vernon  have you done talking  fanny  yes  yes i think thats all  vernon  then perhaps youll let me get in a word  you think me a snob  fanny makes a movement  as a matter of fact i am  fanny  no thats not fair  you wouldnt have married a girl off the musichall stage  vernon  niece of a bishop cousin to a judge  whether i believed it or not doesnt matter  the sham that isnt likely to be found out is as good as the truth to a snob  if he had told me your uncle was a butler i should have hesitated  thats where the mistake began well go back to that  wont you sit down  fanny sits  i want you to stop  therell be no mistake this time  im asking my butlers niece to do me the honour to be my wife  fanny  thats kind of you  vernon  oh im not thinking of you  im thinking of myself  i want you  i fell in love with you because you were pretty and charming  theres something else a man wants in his wife besides that  ive found it  he jumps up goes over to her brushing aside things in his way  im not claiming it as a right you can go if you like  you can earn your own living i know  but you shant have anybody else  youll be lady bantock and nobody elseas long as i live  he has grown quite savage  fanny she bites her lip to keep back the smile that wants to come that cuts both ways you know  vernon  i dont want anybody else  fanny she stretches out her hand and lays it on his  wont it be too hard for you  youll have to tell them allyour friends everybody  vernon  theyve got to be told in any case  if you are here for them to see theyll be able to understandthose that have got any sense  bennet comes in with breakfast for two on a tray  he places it on a table  fanny she has risen she goes over to him  good morning uncle she puts up her face  he stares but she persists  bennet kisses her  lord bantockshe looks at vernonhas a request to make to you  he wishes me to remain here as his wife  i am willing to do so provided you give your consent  vernon  quite right bennet  i ought to have asked for it before i apologise  will you give your consent to my marriage with your niece  fanny  one minute  you understand what it means  from the moment you give itif you do give iti shall be lady bantock your mistress  bennet  my dear fanny  my dear vernon  i speak for the first and last time as your uncle  i am an oldfashioned person and my ideas i have been told are those of my class  but observation has impressed it upon me that success in any scheme depends upon each person being fit for their place  yesterday in the interests of you both i should have refused my consent  today i give it with pleasure feeling sure i am handing over to lord bantock a wife in every way fit for her position  kissing her he gives her to vernon who grips his hand  he returns to the table  breakfast your ladyship is quite ready  they take their places at the table  fanny takes off her hat bennet takes off the covers  curtain
