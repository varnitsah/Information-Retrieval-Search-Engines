6724277	the works  of  lord byron        a new revised and enlarged edition with illustrations    poetry volume 1    edited by  ernest hartley coleridge ma   1898     preface to the poems   the text of the present issue of lord byrons poetical works is based on that of the works of lord byron in six volumes 12mo which was published by john murray in 1831 that edition followed the text of the successive issues of plays and poems which appeared in the authors lifetime and were subject to his own revision or that of gifford and other accredited readers a more or less thorough collation of the printed volumes with the mss which were at moores disposal yielded a number of variorum readings which have appeared in subsequent editions published by john murray fresh collations of the text of individual poems with the original mss have been made from time to time with the result that the text of the latest edition onevol 8vo 1891 includes some emendations and has been supplemented by additional variants textual errors of more or less importance which had crept into the numerous editions which succeeded the seventeenvolume edition of 1832 were in some instances corrected but in others passed over for the purposes of the present edition the printed text has been collated with all the mss which passed through moores hands and also for the first time with mss of the following plays and poems viz english bards and scotch reviewers childe harold canto iv don juan cantos vixvi werner the deformed transformed lara parisina the prophecy of dante the vision of judgment the age of bronze the island the only works of any importance which have been printed directly from the text of the first edition without reference to the mss are the following which appeared in the liberal 182223 viz heaven and earth the blues and morgante maggiore  a new and it is believed an improved punctuation has been adopted in this respect byron did not profess to prepare his mss for the press and the punctuation for which gifford is mainly responsible has been reconsidered with reference solely to the meaning and interpretation of the sentences as they occur  in the hours of idleness and other early poems the typography of the first four editions as a rule has been preserved a uniform typography in accordance with modern use has been adopted for all poems of later date variants being the readings of one or more mss or of successive editions are printed in italics as footnotes text ed immediately below the text they are marked by roman numerals words and lines through which the author has drawn his pen in the mss or revises are marked ms erased  poems and plays are given so far as possible in chronological order childe harold and don juan which were written and published in parts are printed continuously and minor poems including the first four satires have been arranged in groups according to the date of composition epigrams and jeux desprit have been placed together in chronological order towards the end of the sixth volume a bibliography of the poems will immediately precede the index at the close of the sixth volume  the edition contains at least thirty hitherto unpublished poems including fifteen stanzas of the unfinished seventeenth canto of don juan and a considerable fragment of the third part of the deformed transformed the eleven unpublished poems from mss preserved at newstead which appear in the first volume are of slight if any literary value but they reflect with singular clearness and sincerity the temper and aspirations of the tumultuous and moody stripling to whom the numbers came but who wisely abstained from printing them himself  byrons notes of which many are published for the first time and editorial notes enclosed in brackets are printed immediately below the variorum readings the editorial notes are designed solely to supply the reader with references to passages in other works illustrative of the text or to interpret expressions and allusions which lapse of time may have rendered obscure  much of the knowledge requisite for this purpose is to be found in the articles of the dictionary of national biography to which the fullest acknowledgments are due and much has been arrived at after long research involving a minute examination of the literature the magazines and often the newspapers of the period  inasmuch as the poems and plays have been before the public for more than three quarters of a century it has not been thought necessary to burden the notes with the eulogies and apologies of the great poets and critics who were byrons contemporaries and regarded his writings both for good and evil for praise and blame from a different standpoint from ours perhaps even yet the time has not come for a definite and positive appreciation of his genius the tide of feeling and opinion must ebb and flow many times before his rank and station among the poets of all time will be finally adjudged the splendour of his reputation which dazzled his own countrymen and for the first time attracted the attention of a contemporary european audience to an english writer has faded and belongs to history but the poets work remains inviting a more intimate and a more extended scrutiny than it has hitherto received in this country the reader who cares to make himself acquainted with the method of byrons workmanship to unravel his allusions and to follow the tenour of his verse will it is hoped find some assistance in these volumes  i beg to record my especial thanks to the earl of lovelace for the use of mss of his grandfathers poems including unpublished fragments for permission to reproduce portraits in his possession and for valuable information and direction in the construction of some of the notes  my grateful acknowledgments are due to dr garnett cb dr a h murray mr r e graves and other officials of the british museum for invaluable assistance in preparing the notes and in compiling a bibliography of the poems  i have also to thank mr leslie stephen and others for important hints and suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages in hints from horace  in correcting the proofs for the press i have had the advantage of the skill and knowledge of my friend mr frank e taylor of chertsey to whom my thanks are due  on behalf of the publisher i beg to acknowledge with gratitude the kindness of the lady dorchester the earl stanhope lord glenesk and sir theodore martin kcb for permission to examine mss in their possession and of mrs chaworth musters for permission to reproduce her miniature of miss chaworth and for other favours he desires also to acknowledge the generous assistance of mr and miss webb of newstead abbey in permitting the publication of ms poems and in making transcripts for the press  i need hardly add that throughout the progress of the work the advice and direct assistance of mr john murray and mr r e prothero have been always within my reach they have my cordial thanks  ernest hartley coleridge    facsimile of title page   poems on various occasions       virginibus puerisque canto      hor lib 3 ode 1    the

protestations   which swell with nonsense love orations   our love is fixd i think weve provd it   nor time nor place nor art have movd it   then wherefore should we sigh and whine   with groundless jealousy repine   with silly whims and fancies frantic   merely to make our love romantic   why should you weep like lydia languish   and fret with selfcreated anguish   or doom the lover you have chosen   on winter nights to sigh half frozen   in leafless shades to sue for pardon   only because the scenes a garden   for gardens seem by one consent   since shakespeare set the precedent   since juliet first declard her passion   to form the place of assignation   oh would some modern muse inspire   and seat her by a seacoal fire   or had the bard at christmas written   and laid the scene of love in britain   he surely in commiseration   had changd the place of declaration   in italy ive no objection   warm nights are proper for reflection   but here our climate is so rigid   that love itself is rather frigid   think on our chilly situation   and curb this rage for imitation   then let us meet as oft weve done   beneath the influence of the sun   or if at midnight i must meet you   within your mansion let me greet you i   there we can love for hours together   much better in such snowy weather   than placd in all th arcadian groves   that ever witnessd rural loves   then if my

trifling alteration of her name into an english damsel walking in a garden of their own creation during the month of december in a village where the author never passed a winter such has been the

dew   60    thrice did he raise the goblet high     and thrice his lips refused to taste   for thrice he caught the strangers eye     on his with deadly fury placd   61    and is it thus a brother hails     a brothers fond remembrance here   if thus affections strength prevails     what might we not expect from fear   62    roused by the sneer he raisd the bowl     would oscar now could share

where few attend tis useless to indite   where few can read tis folly sure to write   where none but girls and striplings dare admire   and critics rise in every country squire   but yet this last my candid muse admits   when peers are poets squires may well be wits   when schoolboys vent their amorous flames in verse   matrons may sure their characters asperse   and if a little parson joins the train   and echos back his patrons voice again   though not delighted yet i must forgive   parsons as well as other folks must live   from rage he rails not rather say from dread   he does not speak

english bards and scotch reviewers  a satire  by  lord byron        i had rather be a kitten and cry mew     than one of these same metre balladmongers      shakespeare       such shameless bards we have and yet tis true     there are as mad abandond critics too      pope       preface 1   all my friends learned and unlearned have urged me not to publish this satire with my name if i were to be turned from the career of my humour by quibbles quick and paper bullets of the brain i should have complied with their counsel but i am not to be terrified by abuse or bullied by reviewers with or without arms i can safely say that i have attacked none personally who did not commence on the offensive an authors works are public property he who purchases may judge and publish his opinion if he pleases and the authors i have endeavoured to commemorate may do by me as i have done by them i dare say they will succeed better in condemning my scribblings than in mending their own but my object is not to prove that i can write well but if possible to make others write better  as the poem has met with far more success than i expected i have endeavoured in this edition to make some additions and alterations to render it more worthy of public perusal   in the first edition of this satire published anonymously fourteen lines on the subject of bowless pope were written by and inserted at the request of an ingenious friend of mine 2 who has now in the press a volume of poetry in the present edition they are erased and some of my own substituted in their stead my only reason for this being that which i conceive would operate with any other person in the same mannera determination not to publish with my name any production which was not entirely and exclusively my own composition  with 3 regard to the real talents of many of the poetical persons whose performances are mentioned or alluded to in the following pages it is presumed by the author that there can be little difference of opinion in the public at large though like other sectaries each has his separate tabernacle of proselytes by whom his abilities are overrated his faults overlooked and his metrical canons received without scruple and without consideration but the unquestionable possession of considerable genius by several of the writers here censured renders their mental prostitution more to be regretted imbecility may be pitied or at worst laughed at and forgotten perverted powers demand the most decided reprehension no one can wish more than the author that some known and able writer had undertaken their exposure but mr gifford has devoted himself to massinger and in the absence of the regular physician a country practitioner may in cases of absolute necessity be allowed to prescribe his nostrum to prevent the extension of so deplorable an epidemic provided there be no quackery in his treatment of the malady a caustic is here offered as it is to be feared nothing short of actual cautery can recover the numerous patients afflicted with the present prevalent and distressing rabies for rhymingas to the edinburgh reviewers it would indeed require an hercules to crush the hydra but if the author succeeds in merely bruising one of the heads of the serpent though his own hand should suffer in the encounter he will be amply satisfied   footnote 1 the preface as it is here printed was prefixed to the second third and fourth editions of english bards and scotch reviewers the preface to the first edition began with the words with regard to the real talents etc the text of the poem follows that of the suppressed fifth edition which passed under byrons own supervision and was to have been issued in 1812 from that edition the preface was altogether excluded  in an annotated copy of the fourth edition of 1811 underneath the note this preface was written for the second edition and printed with it the noble author had left this country previous to the publication of that edition

the first edition     introduction to english bards and scotch reviewers   the article upon hours of idleness which lord brougham  after denying it for thirty years confessed that he had written notes from a diary by sir m e grant duff 1897 ii 189 was published in the edinburgh review of january 1808 english bards and scotch reviewers did not appear till march 1809 the article gave the opportunity for the publication of the satire but only in part provoked its composition years later byron had not forgotten its effect on his mind on april 26 1821 he wrote to shelley i recollect the effect on me of the edinburgh on my first poem it was rage and resistance and redress but not despondency nor despair and on the same date to murray i know by experience that a savage review is hemlock to a sucking author and the one on me which produced the english bards etc knocked me down but i got up again etc it must however be remembered that byron had his weapons ready for an attack before he used them in defence in a letter to miss pigot dated october 26 1807 he says that he has written one poem of 380 lines to be published in a few weeks with notes the poem  is a satire it was entitled british bards and finally numbered 520 lines with a view to publication or for his own convenience it was put up in type and printed in quarto sheets a single copy which he kept for corrections and additions was preserved by dallas and is now in the british museum after the review appeared he enlarged and recast the british bards and in march 1809 the satire was published anonymously byron was at no pains to conceal the authorship of english bards and scotch reviewers and before starting on his pilgrimage he had prepared a second and enlarged edition which came out in october 1809 with his name prefixed two more editions were called for in his absence and on his return he revised and printed a fifth when he suddenly resolved to suppress the work on his homeward voyage he expressed in a letter to dallas june 28 1811 his regret at having written the satire a year later he became intimate among others with lord and lady holland whom he had assailed on the supposition that they were the instigators of the article in the edinburgh review and on being told by rogers that they wished the satire to be withdrawn he gave orders to his publisher cawthorn to burn the whole impression a few copies escaped the flames one of two copies retained by dallas which afterwards belonged to murray and is now in his grandsons possession was the foundation of the text of 1831 and of all subsequent issues another copy which belonged to dallas is retained in the british museum  towards the close of the last century there had been an outburst of satirical poems written in the style of the dunciad and its offspring the rosciad of these giffords baviad and maviad 17945 and t j mathias pursuits of literature 17947 were the direct progenitors of english bards and scotch reviewers the rolliad 1794 the children of apollo circ 1794 cannings new morality 1798 and wolcots coarse but virile lampoons must also be reckoned among byrons earlier models the ministry of all the talents gave rise to a fresh batch of political jeux dÃ©sprits and in 1807 when byron was still at cambridge the air was full of these ephemera to name only a few all the talents by polypus eaton stannard barrett was answered by all the blocks an antidote to all the talents by flagellum w h ireland elijahs mantle a tribute to the memory of the r h william pitt by james sayer the caricaturist provoked melvilles mantle being a parody on  elijahs mantle the simpliciad a satiricodidactic poem and lady anne hamiltons epics of the ton are also of the same period one and all have perished but byron read them and in a greater or less degree they supplied the impulse to write in the fashion of the day  british bards would have lived but unquestionably the spur of the article a years delay and above all the advice and criticism of his friend hodgson who was at work on his gentle alterative for the reviewers 1809 for further details see vol i letters letter 102 note 1 produced the brilliant success of the enlarged satire english bards and scotch reviewers was recognized at once as a work of genius it has intercepted the popularity of its great predecessors who are often quoted but seldom read it is

scene but there is no record of any intimacy or acquaintance before 1813 when byron was living at geneva lewis visited the maison diodati in august 1816 on which occasion he translated to him goethes faust by word of mouth and drew up a codicil to his will witnessed by byron shelley and polidori which contained certain humane provisions for the wellbeing of the negroes on his jamaica estates he also visited him at la mira in august 1817 byron wrote of him after his death he was a good man and a clever one but he was a bore a damned boreone may say but i liked him  to judge from his letters

not the slightest idea that what he was then writing could injure the principles of any human being he was said byron too great a bore to lie and the plea is evidently offered in good faith as a

recollection i do not think that personal differences sanction the unjust condemnation of a brother scribbler but i see no reason why they should act as a preventive when the author noble or ignoble has for a series of years beguiled a discerning public as the advertisements have it with divers reams of most orthodox imperial nonsense besides i do not step aside to vituperate the earl nohis works come fairly in review with those of other patrician literati if before i escaped from my teens i said anything in favour of his lordships paper books it was in the way of dutiful dedication and more from the advice of others than my own judgment and i seize the first opportunity of pronouncing my sincere recantation i have heard that some persons conceive me to be under obligations to lord carlisle if so i shall be most particularly happy to learn what they are and when conferred that they may be duly appreciated and publicly acknowledged what i have humbly advanced as an opinion on his

went to the press that my trusty and wellbeloved cousins the edinburgh reviewers are preparing a most vehement critique on my poor gentle unresisting muse whom they have already so bedeviled with their ungodly ribaldry     tantÃ¦ne animis coelestibus irÃ¦   i suppose i must say of jeffrey as sir andrew aguecheek saith an i had known he was so cunning of fence i had seen him damned ere i had fought him what a pity it is that i shall be beyond the bosphorus before the next number has passed the tweed but i yet hope to light my pipe with it in persia 1  my northern friends have accused me with justice of personality towards their great literary anthropophagus jeffery but what else was to be done with him and his dirty pack who feed by lying and slandering and slake their thirst by evil speaking i have adduced facts already well known and of jeffreys mind i have stated my free opinion nor has he thence sustained any injurywhat scavenger was ever soiled by being pelted with mud it may be said that i quit england because i have censured there persons of honour and wit about town but i am coming back again and their vengeance will keep hot till my return those who know me can testify that my motives for leaving england are very different from fears literary or personal those who do not may one day be convinced since the publication of this thing my name has not been concealed i have been mostly in london ready to answer for my transgressions and in daily expectation of sundry cartels but alas the age of chivalry is over or in the vulgar tongue there is no spirit nowadays  there is a youth ycleped hewson clarke subaudi esquire a sizer of emanuel college and i believe a denizen of berwickupontweed whom i have introduced in these pages to much better company than he has been accustomed to meet he is notwithstanding a very sad dog and for no reason that i can discover except a personal quarrel with a bear kept by me at cambridge to sit for a fellowship and whom the jealousy of his trinity contemporaries prevented from success has been abusing me and what is worse the defenceless innocent above mentioned in the satirist for one year and some months i am utterly unconscious of having given him any provocation indeed i am guiltless of having heard his name till coupled with the satirist he has therefore no reason to complain and i dare say that like sir fretful plagiary he is rather pleased than otherwise i have now mentioned all who have done me the honour to notice me and mine that is my bear and my book except the editor of the satirist who it seems is a gentlemangod wot i wish he could impart a little of his gentility to his subordinate scribblers i hear that mr jerningham1 is about to take up the cudgels for his mÃ¦cenas lord carlisle i hope not he was one of the few who in the very short intercourse i had with him treated me with kindness when a boy and whatever he may say or do pour on i will endure i have nothing further to add save a general note of thanksgiving to readers purchasers and publishers and in the words of scott i wish     to all and each a fair good night   and rosy dreams and slumbers light    footnote 1 the article never appeared and lord byron in the hints from horace taunted jeffrey with a silence which seemed to indicate that the critic was beaten from the field   footnote 2 edward jerningham 17271812 third son of sir george jerningham bart was an indefatigable versifier between the publication of his first poem the nunnery in 1766 and his last the old bards farewell in 1812 he sent to the press no less than thirty separate compositions as a contributor to the british album gifford handled him roughly in the baviad lines 21 22 and mathias in a note to pursuits of literature brackets him with payne knight as ecrivain du commun et poÃ«te vulgaire he was a dandy with a literary turn who throughout a long life knew every one who was worth knowing some of his letters have recently been

proof b       introduction to hints from horace    three mss of hints from horace are extant two in the possession of lord lovelace mss l a and b and a third in the possession of mr murray ms m  proofs of lines 173272 and 1272 proofs a b are among the egerton mss in the british museum they were purchased from the rev alexander dallas january 12 1867 and are doubtless fragments of the proofs set up in type for cawthorn in 1811 they are in bookform and show that the volume was intended to be uniform with the fifth edition of english bards and scotch reviewers of 1811 the text corresponds closely but not exactly with that adopted by murray in 1831 and does not embody the variants of the several mss it is probable that complete proofs were in moores possession at the time when he included the selections from the hints in his letters and journals pp 263269 and that the text of the entire poem as published in 1831 was derived from this source selections numbering in all 156 lines had already appeared in recollections of the life of lord byron by r c dallas 1824 pp 104113 byron estimating the merit by the difficulty of the performance rated the hints from horace extravagantly high he only forbore to publish them after the success of childe harold because he felt as he states that he should be heaping coals of fire upon his head if he were in his hour of triumph to put forth a sequel to a lampoon provoked by failure nine years afterwards when he resolved to print the work with some omissions he gravely maintained that it excelled the productions of his mature genius as far he said as versification goes it is good and on looking back at what i wrote about that period i am astonished to see how little i have trained on i wrote better then than now but that comes of my having fallen into the atrocious bad taste of the times september 23 1820 the opinion of j c hobhouse that the hints would require a good deal of slashing to adapt them to the passing hour and other considerations again led byron to suspend the publication authors are frequently bad judges of their own works but of all the literary hallucinations upon record there are none which exceed the mistaken preferences of lord byron shortly after the appearance of the corsair he fancied that english bards was still his masterpiece when all his greatest works had been produced he contended that his translation from pulci was his grand performancethe best thing he ever did in his life and throughout the whole of his literary career he regarded these hints from horace with a special and unchanging fondness     hints from horace   athens capuchin convent march 12 1811 i     who would not laugh if lawrence 1 hired to grace ii   his costly canvas with each flattered face

rhymes allude if mr townsend succeeds in his undertaking as there is reason to hope how much will the world be indebted to mr cumberland for bringing him before the public but till that eventful day arrives it may be doubted whether the premature display of his plan sublime as the ideas confessedly are has notby raising expectation too high or diminishing curiosity by developing his argumentrather incurred the hazard of injuring mr townsends future prospects mr cumberland whose talents i shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my praise and mr townsend must not suppose me actuated by unworthy motives in this suggestion i wish the author all the success he can wish himself and shall be truly happy to see epic poetry weighed up from the bathos where it lies sunken with southey cottle cowley mrs or abraham ogilvy wilkie pye and all the dull of past and present days even if he is not a milton he may be better than blackmore if not a homer an antimachus i should deem myself presumptuous as a young man in offering advice were it not addressed to one still younger mr townsend has the greatest difficulties to encounter but in conquering them he will find employment in having conquered them his reward i know too well the scribblers scoff the critics contumely and i am afraid time will teach mr townsend to know them better those who succeed and those who do not must bear this alike and it is hard to say which have most of it i trust that mr townsends share will be from envy he will soon know mankind well enough not to attribute this expression to malice this

 review given to me the other day by the captain of an english   frigate off salamis there is a similar concession to the mediocrity   of jamie grahams british georgics it is fortunate for campbell   that his fame neither depends on his last poem nor the puff of the   edinburgh review the catalogues of our english are also less   fastidious than the pillars of the roman librarians a word more with   the author of gertrude of wyoming at the end of a poem and even of   a couplet we have generally that unmeaning thing we call a thought   so mr campbell concludes with a thought in such a manner as to fulfil   the whole of popes prescription and be as unmeaning as the best of   his brethren      because i may not stain with grief     the deathsong of an indian chief    when i was in the fifth

would have adopted my fifth form sublimeat least in   so conspicuous a situation sorrow has been dry in proverbs and   wet in sonnets this many a day and now it stains and stains   a sound of all feasible things to be sure deathsongs might have   been stained with that same grief to very good purpose if outalissi   had clapped down his stanzas on wholesome paper for the edinburgh   evening post or any other given hyperborean gazette or if the said   outalissi had been troubled with the slightest second sight of his own   notes embodied on the last proof of an overcharged quarto but as he   is supposed to have been an improvisatore on this occasion and   probably to the last tune he ever chanted in this world it would have   done him no discredit to have made his exit with a

is dated march 17 1811 remained unpublished as a whole in this country during byrons lifetime the arrangement which had been made with cawthorn to bring out a fifth edition of english bards included the issue of a separate volume containing hints from horace and the curse of minerva and as moore intimates it was the withdrawal of the latter in deference to the wishes of lord elgin or his connections which led to the suppression of the other satires  the quarto edition of the curse of minerva printed by t davison in 1812 was probably set up at the same time as murrays quarto edition of childe harold and reserved for private circulation with or without byrons consent the poem as a whole was published in philadelphia by de silver and co 1815 8vo for variants see p 453 note in a letter to murray march 6 1816 he says that he disowns the curse etc as stolen and published in a miserable and villainous copy in the magazine the reference is to the malediction of minerva or the athenian

five or six years had gone by the blank spaces between the triglyphs must have revealed their recent exposure to the light and the shattered edges of the cornice which here and there had been raised

the address spoken at the opening of the theatre oct 10 1812 he put in hand a satire on waltzing it was published anonymously in the following spring but possibly because it was somewhat coolly received he told murray april 21 1813 to contradict the report that he was the author of a certain malicious publication on waltzing in his memoranda chiefly with reference to my byron moore notes byrons hatred of waltzing and records a passage of arms between the lame boy and mary chaworth which arose from her dancing with some person who was unknown to her then and always he must have experienced the bitter sense of exclusion from active amusements but it is a hasty assumption that byron only denounced waltzing because he was unable to waltz himself to modern sentiment on the moral side waltzing is unassailable but the first impressions of spectators to whom it was a novelty were distinctly unfavourable  in a letter from germany may 17 1799 coleridge describes a dance round the maypole at rÃ¼beland    the dances were reels and the waltzes but chiefly the latter this   dance is in the higher circles sufficiently voluptuous but here the   motions of it were far more faithful interpreters of the passions  a year later hc robinson writing from frankfort in 1800 diary and letters i 76 says the dancing is unlike anything you ever saw you must have heard of it under the name of waltzing that is rolling and turning though the rolling is not horizontal but perpendicular yet werther after describing his first waltz with charlotte says and i say so too i felt that if i were married my wife should waltz or roll with no one but myself ten years later gillray publishes a caricature of the waltz as a french dance which he styles le bon genre it is not a pretty picture by degrees however and with some reluctance society yielded to the fascinations of the stranger    my cousin hartington writes lady caroline lamb in 1812 memoirs   of viscount melbourne by wt mccullagh torrens i 105 wanted to   have waltzes and quadrilles and at devonshire house it could not be   allowed so we had them in the great drawingroom at whitehall all   the bon ton assembled there continually there was nothing so   fashionable  no event says thomas raikes personal reminiscences p 284 ever produced so great a sensation in english society as the introduction of the german waltz old and young returned to school and the mornings were now absorbed at home in practising the figures of a french quadrille or whirling a chair round the room to learn the step and measure of the german waltz the antiwaltzing party took the alarm cried it down mothers forbad it and every ballroom became a scene of feud and contention the foreigners were not idle in forming their Ã©lÃ¨ves baron tripp neumann st aldegonde etc persevered in spite of all prejudices which were marshalled against them it was not however till byrons malicious publication had been issued and forgotten that the new dance received full recognition when raikes concludes the emperor alexander was seen waltzing round the room at almacks with his tight uniform and numerous decorations or gronow recollections 1860 pp 32 33 lord palmerston might have been seen describing an infinite number of circles with madame de lieven insular prejudices gave way and waltzing became general         the waltz  an apostrophic hymn

in town thinking no harm and our girls being come to a marriageable or as they call it marketable age and having besides a chancery suit inveterately entailed upon the family estate we came up in our

arriving to see poor dear mrs hornem with her arms half round the loins of a huge hussarlooking gentleman i never set eyes on before and his to say truth rather more than half round her waist turning round and round to a dd seesaw upanddown sort of tune that reminded me of the black joke only more affettuoso1 till it made me quite giddy with wondering they were not so by and by they stopped a bit and i thought they would sit or fall downbut no with mrs hs hand on his shoulder quam familiariter2 as terence said when i was at school they walked about a minute and then at it again like two cockchafers spitted on the same bodkin i asked what all this meant when with a loud laugh a child no older than our wilhelmina a name i never heard but in the vicar of wakefield though her mother would call her after the princess of swappenbach said ld mr hornem cant you see theyre valtzing or waltzing i forget which and then up she got and her mother and sister and away they went and roundabouted it till suppertime now that i know what it is i like it of all things and so does mrs h though i have broken my shins and four times overturned mrs hornems maid in practising the preliminary steps in a morning indeed so much do i like it that having a turn for rhyme tastily displayed in some election ballads and songs in honour of all the victories but till lately i have had little practice in that way i sat down and with the aid of william fitzgerald esq and a few hints from dr busby whose recitations i attend and am monstrous fond of master busbys manner of delivering
