38651151	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     bills paper chase   sailormen ave their faults said the night watchman frankly  im not denying of it  i used to ave myself when i was at sea but being close with their money is a fault as can seldom be brought agin em  i saved some money oncetwo golden sovereigns owing to a ole in my pocket  before i got another ship i slept two nights on a doorstep and ad nothing to eat and i found them two sovereigns in the lining o my coat when i was over two thousand miles away from the nearest pub  i ony knew one miser all the years i was at sea  thomas geary is name was and we was shipmates aboard the barque grenada homeward bound from sydney to london  thomas was a man that was getting into years sixty i think e was and old enough to know better  ed been saving ard for over forty years and as near as we could make out e was worth a matter o six undered pounds  he used to be fond o talking about it and letting us know how much better off e was than any of the rest of us  we was about a month out from sydney when old thomas took sick  bill hicks said that it was owing to a hapenny he couldnt account for but walter jones whose family was always ill and thought e knew a lot about it said that e knew wot it was but e couldnt remember the name of it and that when we got to london and thomas saw a doctor we should see as ow e was right  whatever it was the old man got worse and worse  the skipper came down and gave im some physic and looked at is tongue and then e looked at our tongues to see wot the difference was  then e left the cook in charge of im and went off  the next day thomas was worse and it was soon clear to everybody but im that e was slipping is cable  he wouldnt believe it at first though the cook told im bill hicks told him and walter jones ad a grandfather that went off in just the same way  im not going to die says thomas how can i die and leave all that money  itll be good for your relations thomas says walter jones  i aint got any says the old man  well your friends then thomas says walter softlike  aint got any says the old man agin  yes you ave thomas says walter with a kind smile i could tell you one youve got  thomas shut his eyes at im and began to talk pitiful about is money and the ard work ed ad saving of it  and byandby e got worse and didnt reckernise us but thought we was a pack o greedy drunken sailormen  he thought walter jones was a shark and told im so and try all e could walter couldnt persuade im different  he died the day arter  in the morning e was whimpering about is money agin and angry with bill when e reminded im that e couldnt take it with im and e made bill promise that e should be buried just as e was  bill tucked him up arter that and when e felt a canvas belt tied round the old mans waist e began to see wot e was driving at  the weather was dirty that day and there was a bit o sea running consequently all ands was on deck and a boy about sixteen wot used to elp the steward down aft was lookin arter thomas  me and bill just run down to give a look at the old man in time  i am going to take it with me bill says the old man  thats right says bill  my mindseasy now says thomas  i gave it to jimmytotothrow overboard for me  wot says bill staring  thats right bill says the boy  he told me to  it was a little packet o banknotes  he gave me tuppence for doing it  old thomas seemed to be listening  is eyes was open and e looked artful at bill to think what a clever thing ed done  nobodys gointo spendmy money e says  nobodys  we drew back from is bunk and stood staring at im  then bill turned to the boy  go and tell the skipper es gone e says and mind for your own sake dont tell the skipper or anybody else that youve thrown all that money overboard  why not  says jimmy  becos youll be locked up for it says bill youd no business to do it  youve been and broke the law  it ought to ha been left to somebody  jimmy looked scared and arter e was gone i turned to bill and i looks at im and i says whats the little game bill  game  said bill snorting at me  i dont want the pore boy to get into trouble do i  pore little chap  you was young yourself once  yes i says but im a bit older now bill and unless you tell me what your little game is i shall tell the skipper myself and the chaps too  pore old thomas told im to do it so wheres the boy to blame  do you think jimmy did  says bill screwing up his nose at me  that little varmint is walking about worth six undered quid  now you keep your mouth shut and ill make it worth your while  then i see bills game  all right ill keep quiet for the sake of my half i says looking at im  i thought hed ha choked and the langwidge e see fit to use was amost as much as i could answer  very well then e says at last halves it is  it aint robbery becos it belongs to nobody and it aint the boys becos e was told to throw it overboard  they buried pore old thomas next morning and arter it was all over bill put is and on the boys shoulder as they walked forard and e says poor old thomas as gone to look for is money he says wonder whether ell find it  was it a big bundle jimmy  no says the boy shaking is ead  they was six undered pound notes and two sovereigns and i wrapped the sovereigns up in the notes to make em sink  fancy throwing money away like that bill seems a sin dont it  bill didnt answer im and that afternoon the other chaps below being asleep we searched is bunk through and through without any luck and at last bill sat down and swore e must ha got it about im  we waited till night and when everybody was snoring ard we went over to the boys bunk and went all through is pockets and felt the linings and then we went back to our side and bill said wot e thought about jimmy in whispers  he must ha got it tied round is waist next to is skin like thomas ad i says  we stood there in the dark whispering and then bill couldnt stand it any longer and e went over on tiptoe to the bunk agin  he was tremblin with excitement and i wasnt much better when all of a sudden the cook sat up in is bunk with a dreadful laughing scream and called out that somebody was ticklin im  i got into my bunk and bill got into is and we lay there listening while the cook who was a terrible ticklish man leaned out of is bunk and said wot ed do if it appened agin  go to sleep says walter jones youre dreamin  who dyou think would want to tickle you  i tell you says the cook somebody come over and tickled me with a and the size of a leg o mutton  i feel creepy all over  bill gave it up for that night but the next day e pretended to think jimmy was gettin fat an e caught old of im and prodded im all over he thought e felt something round is waist but e couldnt be sure and jimmy made such a noise that the other chaps interfered and told bill to leave im alone for a whole week we tried to find that money and couldnt and bill said it was a suspicious thing that jimmy kept aft a good deal more than e used to and e got an idea that the boy might ha idden it somewhere there  at the end of that time owever owing to our being shortanded jimmy was sent forard to work as ordinary seaman and it began to be quite noticeable the way e avoided bill  at last one day we got im alone down the focsle and bill put is arm round im and got im on the locker and asked im straight out where the money was  why i chucked it overboard he says  i told you so afore  what a memory youve got bill  bill picked im up and laid im on the locker and we searched im thoroughly  we even took is boots off and then we ad another look in is bunk while e was putting em on agin  if youre innercent says bill why dont you call outeh  because you told me not to say anything about it bill says the boy but i will next time  loud i will  look ere says bill you tell us where it is and the three of usll go shares in it  thatll be two undered pounds each and well tell you ow to get yours changed without getting caught  were cleverer than you are you know  i know that bill says the boy but its no good me telling you lies i chucked it overboard  very good then says bill getting up  im going to tell the skipper  tell im says jimmy  i dont care  then youll be searched arter youve stepped ashore says bill and you wont be allowed on the ship agin  youll lose it all by being greedy whereas if you go shares with us youll ave two undered pounds  i could see as ow the boy adnt thought o that and try as e would e couldnt ide is feelins  he called bill a rednosed shark and e called me somethin ive forgotten now  think it over says bill mind youll be collared as soon as youve left the gangway and searched by the police  and will they tickle the cook too i wonder  says jimmy savagely  and if they find it youll go to prison says bill giving im a clump o the side o the ead and you wont like that i can tell you  why aint it nice bill  says jimmy holding is ear  bill looked at im and then e steps to the ladder  im not going to talk to you any more my lad e says  im going to tell the skipper  he went up slowly and just as e reached the deck jimmy started up and called im  bill pretended not to ear and the boy ran up on deck and follered im and arter a little while they both came down again together  did you wish to speak to me my lad  says bill olding is ead up  yes says the boy fiddling with is fingers if you keep your ugly mouth shut well go shares  ho  says bill i thought you throwed it overboard  i thought so too bill says jimmy very softly and when i came below agin i found it in my trousers pocket  where is it now  says bill  never mind where it is says the boy you couldnt get it if i was to tell you  itll take me all my time to do it myself  where is it  says bill agin  im goin to take care of it  i wont trust you  and i cant trust you says jimmy  if you dont tell me where it is this minute says bill moving to the ladder agin im off to tell the skipper  i want it in my ands or at any rate my share of it  why not share it out now  because i avent got it says jimmy stamping is foot thats why and its all your silly fault  arter you came pawing through my pockets when you thought i was asleep i got frightened and id it  where  says bill  in the second mates mattress says jimmy  i was tidying up down aft and i found a ole in the underneath side of is mattress and i shoved it in there and poked it in with a bit o stick  and ow are you going to get it  says bill scratching is ead  thats wot i dont know seeing that im not allowed aft now says jimmy  one of usll ave to make a dash for it when we get to london and mind if theres any ankypanky on your part bill ill give the show away myself  the cook came down just then and we ad to leave off talking and i could see that bill was so pleased at finding that the money adnt been thrown overboard that e was losing sight o the difficulty o getting at it in a day or two owever e see it as plain as me and jimmy did and as time went by he got desprit and frightened us both by anging about aft every chance e got  the companionway faced the wheel and there was about as much chance o getting down there without being seen as there would be o taking a mans false teeth out of is mouth without is knowing it  jimmy went down one day while bill was at the wheel to look for is knife wot e thought ed left down there and ed ardly got down afore bill saw im come up agin olding on to the top of a mop which the steward was using  we couldnt figure it out nohow and to think o the second mate a little man with a large famly who never ad a penny in is pocket sleeping every night on a six undered pound mattress sent us pretty near crazy  we used to talk it over whenever we got a chance and bill and jimmy could scarcely be civil to each other  the boy said it was bills fault and e said it was the boys  the ony thing i can see says the boy one day is for bill to ave a touch of sunstroke as es leaving the wheel one day tumble eadfirst down the companionway and injure isself so severely that e cant be moved  then theyll put im in a cabin down aft and praps ill ave to go and nurse im  anyway hell be down there  its a very good idea bill i says  ho says bill looking at me as if e would eat me  why dont you do it then  id sooner you did it bill says the boy still i dont mind which it is  why not toss up for it  get away says bill  get away afore i do something you wont like you bloodthirsty little murderer  ive got a plan myself he says in a low voice after the boy ad opped off and if i cant think of nothing better ill try it and mind not a word to the boy  he didnt think o nothing better and one night just as we was making the channel e tried is plan  he was in the second mates watch and byandby e leans over the wheel and says to im in a low voice this is my last vyge sir  oh says the second mate who was a man as didnt mind talking to a man before the mast  hows that  ive got a berth ashore sir says bill and i wanted to ask a favour sir  the second mate growled and walked off a pace or two  ive never been so appy as ive been on this ship says bill none of us ave  we was saying so the other night and everybody agreed as it was owing to you sir and your kindness to all of us  the second mate coughed but bill could see as e was a bit pleased  the feeling came over me says bill that when i leave the sea for good id like to ave something o yours to remember you by sir  and it seemed to me that if i ad yourmattress i should think of you evry night o my life  my wot says the second mate staring at im your mattress sir says bill  if i might make so bold as to offer a pound for it sir  i want something wots been used by you and ive got a fancy for that as a keepsake the second mate shook is ead  im sorry bill e says gently but i couldnt let it go at that  id sooner pay thirty shillins than not ave it sir says bill umbly  i gave a lot of money for that mattress says the mate agin  i forgit ow much but a lot  you dont know ow valuable that mattress is  i know its a good one sir else you wouldnt ave it says bill would a couple o pounds buy it sir  the second mate humd and had but bill was afeard to go any igher  so far as e could make out from jimmy the mattress was worth about eighteen penceto anybody who wasnt pertiklar  ive slept on that mattress for years says the second mate looking at im from the corner of is eye  i dont believe i could sleep on another  still to oblige you bill you shall ave it at that if you dont want it till we go ashore  thankee sir says bill ardly able to keep from dancing and ill and over the two pounds when were paid off  i shall keep it all my life sir in memory of you and your kindness  and mind you keep quiet about it says the second mate who didnt want the skipper to know wot ed been doing because i dont want to be bothered by other men wanting to buy things as keepsakes  bill promised im like a shot and when e told me about it e was nearly crying with joy  and mind e says ive bought that mattress bought it as it stands and its got nothing to do with jimmy  well each pay a pound and halve wots in it  he persuaded me at last but that boy watched us like a cat watching a couple of canaries and i could see we should ave all we could do to deceive im  he seemed more suspicious o bill than me and e kep worrying us nearly every day to know what we were going to do  we beat about in the channel with a strong eadwind for four days and then a tug picked us up and towed us to london  the excitement of that last little bit was orrible  fust of all we ad got to get the mattress and then in some way we ad got to get rid o jimmy  bills idea was for me to take im ashore with me and tell im that bill would join us arterwards and then lose im but i said that till id got my share i couldnt bear to lose sight o bills honest face for alf a second  and besides jimmy wouldnt ave gone  all the way up the river e stuck to bill and kept asking im wot we were to do  e was alf crying and so excited that bill was afraid the other chaps would notice it  we got to our berth in the east india docks at last and arter we were made fast we went below to ave a wash and change into our shoregoing togs  jimmy watched us all the time and then e comes up to bill biting is nails and says  hows it to be done bill  hang about arter the rest ave gone ashore and trust to luck says bill looking at me  well see ow the land lays when we draw our advance  we went down aft to draw ten shillings each to go ashore with  bill and me got ours fust and then the second mate who ad tipped im the wink followed us out unconcernedlike and anded bill the mattress rolled up in a sack  ere you are bill e says  much obliged sir says bill and is ands trembled so as e could ardly old it and e made to go off afore jimmy come on deck  then that fool of a mate kept us there while e made a little speech twice bill made to go off but e put is and on is arm and kept im there while e told im ow hed always tried to be liked by the men and ad generally succeeded and in the middle of it up popped master jimmy  he gave a start as he saw the bag and is eyes opened wide and then as we walked forward e put is arm through bills and called im all the names e could think of  youd steal the milk out of a cats saucer e says but mind you dont leave this ship till ive got my share  i meant it for a pleasant surprise for you jimmy says bill trying to smile  i dont like your surprises bill so i dont deceive you says the boy  where are you going to open it  i was thinking of opening it in my bunk says bill  the perlice might want to examine it if we took it through the dock  come on jimmy old man  yes all right says the boy nodding is ead at im  ill stay up ere  you might forget yourself bill if i trusted myself down there with you alone  you can throw my share up to me and then youll leave the ship afore i do  see  go to blazes says bill and then seeing that the last chance ad gone we went below and e chucked the bundle in is bunk  there was only one chap down there and arter spending best part o ten minutes doing is hair e nodded to us and went off  half a minute later bill cut open the mattress and began to search through the stuffing while i struck matches and watched im  it wasnt a big mattress and there wasnt much stuffing but we couldnt seem to see that money  bill went all over it agin and agin and then e stood up and looked at me and caught is breath painful  do you think the mate found it e says in a usky voice  we went through it agin and then bill went halfway up the focsle ladder and called softly for jimmy  he called three times and then with a sinking sensation in is stummick e went up on deck and i follered im  the boy was nowhere to be seen  all we saw was the ships cat aving a wash and brushup afore going ashore and the skipper standing aft talking to the owner  we never saw that boy agin  he never turned up for is box and e didnt show up to draw is pay  everybody else was there of course and arter id got mine and come outside i see pore bill with is back up agin a wall staring ard at the second mate who was looking at im with a kind smile and asking im ow hed slept  the last thing i saw of bill the pore chap ad got is ands in is trousers pockets and was trying is hardest to smile back
