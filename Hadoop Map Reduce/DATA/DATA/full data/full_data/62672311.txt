tiers of narrow steel bunks three deep on all sides an entrance in rear benches on the floor before the bunks the room is crowded with men shouting cursing laughing singinga confused inchoate uproar swelling into a sort of unity a meaningthe bewildered furious baffled defiance of a beast in a cage nearly all the men are drunk many bottles are passed from hand to hand all are dressed in dungaree pants heavy ugly shoes some wear singlets but the majority are stripped to the waist  the treatment of this scene or of any other scene in the play should by no means be naturalistic the effect sought after is a cramped space in the bowels of a ship imprisoned by white steel the lines of bunks the uprights supporting them cross each other like the steel framework of a cage the ceiling crushes down upon the mens heads they cannot stand upright this accentuates the natural stooping posture which shovelling coal and the resultant overdevelopment of back and shoulder muscles have given them the men themselves should resemble those pictures in which the appearance of neanderthal man is guessed at all are hairychested with long arms of tremendous power and low receding brows above their small fierce resentful eyes all the civilized white races are represented but except for the slight differentiation in color of hair skin eyes all these men are alike  the curtain rises on a tumult of sound

strong men in themmen that was sons of the sea as if twas the mother that bore them oh the clean skins of them and the clear eyes the straight backs and full chests of them brave men they was and bold men surely wed be sailing out bound down round the horn maybe wed be making sail in the dawn with a fair breeze singing a chanty song wid no care to it and astern the land would be sinking low and dying out but wed give it no heed but a laugh and never a look behind for the day that was was enough for we was free menand im thinking tis only slaves do be giving heed to the day thats gone or the day to comeuntil theyre old like me with a sort of religious exaltation oh to be scudding south again wid the power of the trade wind driving her on steady through the nights and the days full sail on her nights and days nights when the foam of the wake would be flaming wid fire when the skyd be blazing and winking wid stars or the full of the moon maybe then youd see her driving through the gray night her sails stretching aloft all silver and white not a sound on the deck the lot of us dreaming dreams till youd believe twas no real ship at all you was on but a ghost ship like the flying dutchman they say does be roaming the seas forevermore widout touching a port and there was the days too a warm sun on the clean decks sun warming the blood of you and wind over the miles of shiny green ocean like strong drink to your lungs workaye hard workbut whod mind that at all sure you worked under the sky and twas work wid skill and daring to it and wid the day done in the dog watch

discovered reclining in deck chairs the former is a girl of twenty slender delicate with a pale pretty face marred by a selfconscious expression of disdainful superiority she looks fretful nervous and discontented bored by her own anemia her aunt is a pompous and proudand fatold lady she is a type even to the point of a double chin and lorgnettes she is dressed pretentiously as if afraid her face alone would never indicate her position in life mildred is dressed all in white  the impression to be conveyed by this scene is one of the beautiful vivid life of the sea all aboutsunshine on the deck in a great flood the fresh sea wind blowing across it in the midst of this these two incongruous artificial figures inert and disharmonious the elder like a gray lump of dough touched up with rouge the younger looking as if the vitality of her stock had been sapped before she was conceived so that she is the expression not of its life energy but merely of the artificialities that energy had won for itself in the spending  mildredlooking up with affected dreaminess how the black smoke swirls back against the sky is it not beautiful  auntwithout looking up i dislike smoke of any kind  mildredmy greatgrandmother smoked a pipea clay pipe  auntruffling vulgar  mildredshe was too distant a relative to be vulgar time mellows pipes  auntpretending boredom but irritated did the sociology you took up at college teach you thatto play the ghoul on every possible occasion excavating old bones why not let your greatgrandmother rest in her grave  mildreddreamily with her pipe beside herpuffing in paradise  auntwith spite yes you are a natural born ghoul you are even getting to look like one my dear  mildredin a passionless tone i detest you aunt looking at her critically do you know what you remind me of of a cold pork pudding against a background of linoleum tablecloth in the kitchen of abut the possibilities are wearisome she closes her eyes  auntwith a bitter laugh merci for your candor but since i am and must be your chaperonein appearance at leastlet us patch up some sort of armed truce for my part you are quite free to indulge any pose of eccentricity that beguiles youas long as you observe the amenities  mildreddrawling the inanities  auntgoing on as if she hadnt heard after exhausting the morbid thrills of social service work on new yorks east sidehow they must have hated you by the way the poor that you made so much poorer in their own eyesyou are now bent on making your slumming international well i hope whitechapel will provide the needed nerve tonic do not ask me to chaperone you there however i told your father i would not i loathe deformity we will hire an army of detectives and you may investigate everythingthey allow you to see  mildredprotesting with a trace of genuine earnestness please do not mock at my attempts to discover how the other half lives give me credit for some sort of groping sincerity in that at least i would like to help them i would like to be some use in the world is it my fault i dont know how i would like to be sincere to touch life somewhere with weary bitterness but im afraid i have neither the vitality nor integrity all that was burnt out in our stock before i was born grandfathers blast furnaces flaming to the sky melting steel making millionsthen father keeping those home fires burning making more millionsand little me at the tailend of it all im a waste product in the bessemer processlike the millions or rather i inherit the acquired trait of the byproduct wealth but none of the energy none of the strength of the steel that made it i am sired by gold and darned by it as they say at the race trackdamned in more ways than one she laughs mirthlessly  auntunimpressedsuperciliously you seem to be going in for sincerity today it isnt becoming to you reallyexcept as an obvious pose be as artificial as you are i advise theres a sort of sincerity in that you know and after all you must confess you like that better  mildredagain affected and bored yes i suppose i do pardon me for my outburst when a leopard complains of its spots it must sound rather grotesque in a mocking tone purr little leopard purr scratch tear kill gorge yourself and be happyonly stay in the jungle where your spots are camouflage in a cage they make you conspicuous  aunti dont know what you are talking about  mildredit would be rude to talk about anything to you lets just talk she looks at her wrist watch well thank goodness its about time for them to come for me that ought to give me a new thrill aunt  auntaffectedly troubled you dont mean to say youre really going the dirtthe heat must be frightful  mildredgrandfather started as a puddler i should have inherited an immunity to heat that would make a salamander shiver it will be fun to put it to the test  auntbut dont you have to have the captainsor someonespermission to visit the stokehole  mildredwith a triumphant smile i have itboth his and the chief engineers oh they didnt want to at first in spite of my social service credentials they didnt seem a bit anxious that i should investigate how the other half lives and works on a ship so i had to tell them that my father the president of nazareth steel chairman of the board of directors of this line had told me it would be all right  aunthe didnt  mildredhow naive age makes one but i said he did aunt i even said he had given me a letter to themwhich i had lost and they were afraid to take the chance that i might be lying excitedly so its ho for the stokehole the second engineer is to escort me looking at her watch again its time and here he comes i think the second engineer enters he is a husky finelooking man of thirtyfive or so he stops before the two and tips his cap visibly embarrassed and illatease  second engineermiss douglas  mildredyes throwing off her rugs and getting to her feet are we all ready to start  second engineerin just a second maam im waiting for the fourth hes coming along  mildredwith a scornful smile you dont care to shoulder this responsibility alone is that it  second

lots of white dresses  second engineeri have an old coat you might throw over  mildredi have fifty dresses like this i will throw this one into the sea when i come back that ought to wash it clean dont you think  second engineerdoggedly theres ladders to climb down that are none too cleanand dark alleyways  mildredi will wear this very dress and none other  second engineerno offence meant its none of my business i was only warning you  mildredwarning that sounds thrilling  second engineerlooking down the deckwith a sigh of relieftheres the fourth now hes waiting for us if youll come  mildredgo on ill follow you he goes mildred turns a mocking smile on her aunt an oafbut a handsome virile oaf  auntscornfully poser  mildredtake care he said there were dark alleyways  auntin the same tone poser  mildredbiting her lips angrily you are right but would that my millions were not so anemically chaste  auntyes for a fresh pose i have no doubt you would drag the name of douglas in the gutter  mildredfrom which it sprang goodby aunt dont pray too hard that i may fall into the fiery furnace  auntposer  mildredviciously old hag she slaps her aunt insultingly across the face and walks off laughing gaily  auntscreams after her i said poser  curtain     scene iii   scenethe stokehole in the rear the dimlyoutlined bulks of the furnaces and boilers high overhead one hanging electric bulb sheds just enough light through the murky air laden with coal dust to pile up masses of shadows everywhere a line of men stripped to the waist is before the furnace doors they bend over looking neither to right nor left handling their shovels as if they were part of their bodies with a strange awkward swinging rhythm they use the shovels to throw open the furnace doors then from these fiery round holes in the black a flood of terrific light and heat pours full upon the men who are outlined in silhouette in the crouching inhuman attitudes of chained gorillas the men shovel with a rhythmic motion swinging as on a pivot from the coal which lies in heaps on the floor behind to hurl it into the flaming mouths before them there is a tumult of noisethe brazen clang of the furnace doors as they are flung open or slammed shut the grating teethgritting grind of steel against steel of crunching coal this clash of sounds stuns ones ears with its rending dissonance but there is order in it rhythm a mechanical regulated recurrence a tempo and rising above all making the air hum with the quiver of liberated energy the roar of leaping flames in the furnaces the monotonous throbbing beat of the engines  as the curtain rises the furnace doors are shut the men are taking a breathing spell one or two are arranging the coal behind them pulling it into more accessible heaps the others can be dimly made out leaning on their shovels in relaxed attitudes of exhaustion  paddyfrom somewhere in the lineplaintively yerra will this divils own watch nivir end me back is broke im destroyed entirely

followed his movements of getting into position throw open their furnace doors with a deafening clang the fiery light floods over their shoulders as they bend round for the coal rivulets of sooty sweat have traced maps on their backs the enlarged muscles form bunches of high light and shadow  yankchanting a count as he shovels without seeming effort onetwotreehis voice rising exultantly in the joy of battle dats de stuff let her have it all togedder now sling it into her let her ride shoot de piece now call de toin on her drive her into it feel her move watch her smoke speed dats her middle name give her coal youse guys coal dats her booze drink it up baby lets see yuh sprint dig in and gain a lap dere she gooes this last in the chanting formula of the gallery gods at the sixday bike race he slams his furnace door shut the others do likewise with as much unison as their wearied bodies will permit the effect is of one fiery eye after another being blotted out with a series of accompanying bangs  paddygroaning me back is broke im bate outbatethere is a pause then the inexorable whistle sounds again from the dim regions above the electric light there is a growl of cursing rage from all sides  yankshaking his fist upwardcontemptuously take it easy dere you who dyuh tinks runnin dis game me or you when i git ready we move not before when i git ready get me

on the left with mildred between them she starts turns paler her pose is crumbling she shivers with fright in spite of the blazing heat but forces herself to leave the engineers and take a few steps nearer the men she is right behind yank all this happens quickly while the men have their backs turned  yankcome on youse guys he is turning to get coal when the whistle sounds again in a peremptory irritating note this drives yank into a sudden fury while the other men have turned full around and stopped dumfounded by the spectacle of mildred standing there in her white dress yank does not turn far enough to see her besides his head is thrown back he blinks upward through the murk trying to find the owner of the whistle he brandishes his shovel murderously over his head in one hand pounding on his chest gorillalike with the other shouting toin off dat whistle come down outa dere yuh yellow brassbuttoned belfast bum yuh come down and ill knock yer brains out yuh lousey stinkin yellow mut

defensively with a snarling murderous growl crouching to spring his lips drawn back over his teeth his small eyes gleaming ferociously he sees mildred like a white apparition in the full light from the open furnace doors he glares into her eyes turned to stone as for her during his speech she has listened paralyzed with horror terror her whole personality crushed beaten in collapsed by the terrific impact of this unknown abysmal brutality naked and shameless as she looks at his gorilla face as his eyes bore into hers she utters a low choking cry and shrinks away from him putting both hands up before her eyes to shut out the sight of his face to protect her own this startles yank to a reaction his mouth falls open his eyes grow bewildered  mildredabout to faintto the engineers who now have her one by each armwhimperingly take me away oh the filthy beast she faints they carry her quickly back disappearing in the darkness at the left rear an iron door clangs shut rage and bewildered fury rush back on yank he feels himself insulted in some unknown fashion in the very heart of his pride he roars god damn yuh and hurls his shovel after them at the door which has just closed it hits the steel bulkhead with a clang and falls clattering on the steel floor from overhead the whistle sounds again in a long angry insistent command  curtain     scene iv   scenethe firemens forecastle yanks watch has just come off duty and had dinner their faces and bodies shine from a soap and water scrubbing but around their eyes where a hasty dousing does not touch the coal dust sticks like black makeup giving them a queer sinister expression yank has not washed either face or body he stands out in contrast to them a blackened brooding figure he is seated forward on a bench in the exact attitude of rodins the thinker the others most of them smoking pipes are staring at yank halfapprehensively as if fearing an outburst halfamusedly as if they saw a joke somewhere

can be heard on the one cage a sign from which the word gorilla stands out the gigantic animal himself is seen squatting on his haunches on a bench in much the same attitude as rodins thinker yank enters from the left immediately a chorus of angry chattering and screeching breaks out the gorilla turns his eyes but makes no sound or move  yankwith a hard bitter laugh welcome to your city huh hail hail de gangs all here at the sound of his voice the chattering dies away into an attentive silence yank walks up to the gorillas cage and leaning over the railing stares in at its occupant who stares back at him silent and motionless there is a pause of dead stillness then yank begins to talk in a friendly confidential tone halfmockingly but with a deep undercurrent of sympathy say yuhre
