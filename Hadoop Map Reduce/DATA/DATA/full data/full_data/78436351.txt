accession  in berlin from tuesday 31st may 1740 day of the late kings death till the thursday following the post was stopped and the gates closed no estafette can be despatched though dickens and all the ambassadors are busy writing on the thursday regiments officers principal officials having sworn and the new king being fairly in the saddle estafettes and postboys shoot forth at the top of their speed and rumor towards every point of the compass apprises mankind what immense news there is dickens in statepaper office 4th june 1740  a kings accession is always a hopeful phenomenon to the public more especially a young kings who has been talked of for his talents and aspiringsfor his sufferings were it nothing moreand whose antimachiavel is understood to be in the press vaguely everywhere there has a notion gone abroad that this young king will prove considerable here at last has a lover of philosophy got upon the throne and great philanthropies and magnanimities are to be expected think rash editors and idle mankind rash editors in england and elsewhere we observe are ready to believe that friedrich has not only disbanded the potsdam giants but means to reduce the prussian army one half or so for ease temporary ease which we hope will be lasting of parties concerned and to go much upon emancipation political rosewater and friendship to humanity as we now call it  at his first meeting of council they say he put this question could not the prussian army be reduced to 45000 the excellent young man to which the council had answered hardly your majesty the julichandberg affair is so ominous hitherto these may be secrets and dubious to people out of doors thinks a wise editor but one thing patent to the day was this surely symbolical enough on one of his majestys first drives to potsdam or from it a thousand childrenin round numbers a thousand of them all with the red string round their necks and liable to be taken for soldiers if needed in the regiment of their cantona thousand children met this young king at a turn of his road and with shrill unison of wail sang out oh deliver us from slaveryfrom the red threads your majesty why should poor we be liable to suffer hardship for our country or otherwise your majesty can no one else be got to do it sang out the thousand children and his majesty assented on the spot thinks the rash editor gentlemans magazine london 1740 x 318 newspapers c goose madam exclaimed a philanthropist projector once whose scheme of sweeping chimneys by pulling a live goose down through them was objected to goose madam you can take two ducks then if you are so sorry for the gooserash editors think there is to be a reign of astraea redux in prussia by means of this young king and forget to ask themselves as the young king must by no means do how far astraea may be possible for prussia and him  at home too there is prophesying enough vague hope enough which for most part goes wide of the mark this young king we know did prove considerable but not in the way shaped out for him by the publicit was in far other ways for no public in the least knows in such cases nor does the man himself know except gradually and if he strive to learn as to the publicdoubtless says a friend of mine doubtless it was the atlantic ocean that carried columbus to america lucky for the atlantic and for columbus and us but the atlantic did not quite vote that way from the first nay its votes i believe were very various at different stages of the matter this is a truth which kings and men not intending to be driftlogs or waste brine obedient to the moon are much called to have in mind withal from perhaps an early stage of their voyage  friedrichs actual demeanor in these his first weeks which is still decipherable if one study well has in truth a good deal of the brilliant of the popularmagnanimous but manifests strong solid quality withal and a head steadier than might have been expected for the berlin world is all in a rather auroral condition and friedrich too isthe chains suddenly cut loose and such hopes opened for the young man he has great things ahead feels in himself great things and doubtless exults in the thought of realizing them magnanimous enough popular hopeful enough with voltaire and the highest of the world looking onbut yet he is wise too creditably aware that there are limits that this is a bargain and the terms of it inexorable we discern with pleasure the old veracity of character shining through this giddy new element that all these fine procedures are at least unaffected to a singular degree true and the product of nature on his part and that in short the complete respect for fact which used to be a quality of his and which is among the highest and also rarest in man has on no side deserted him at present  a trace of airy exuberance of natural exultancy not quite repressible on the sudden change to freedom and supreme power from what had gone before perhaps that also might be legible if in those opaque beadrolls which are called histories of friedrich anything human could with certainty be read he flies much about from place to place now at potsdam now at berlin at charlottenburg reinsberg nothing loath to run whither business calls him and appear in public the gazetteer world as we noticed which has been hitherto a most mute world breaks out here and there into a kind of husky jubilation over the great things he is daily doing and rejoices in the prospect of having a philosopher king which function the young man only twentyeight gone cannot but wish to fulfil for the gazetteers and the world he is a busy man and walks boldly into his grand enterprise of making men happy to the admiration of voltaire and an enlightened public far and near  bielfeld speaks of immense concourses of people crowding about charlottenburg to congratulate to solicit to c tells us how he himself had to lodge almost in outhouses in that royal village of hope his emotions at reinsberg and everybodys while friedrich wilhelm lay dying and all stood like greyhounds on the slip and with what arrowswiftness they shot away when the great news came all this he has already described at wearisome length in his fantastic semifabulous way bielfeld i 6877 ib 81 friedrich himself seemed moderately glad to see bielfeld received his highflown congratulations with a benevolent yet somewhat composed air and gave him afterwards in the course of weeks an unexpectedly small appointment to go to hanover under truchsess von waldburg and announce our accession which is but a simple mostly formal service yet perhaps what bielfeld is best equal to  the britannic majesty or at least his hanover people have been beforehand with this civility baron munchhausen no doubt by orders given for such contingency had appeared at berlin with the due compliment and condolence almost on the first day of the new reign first messenger of all on that errand britannic majesty evidently in a conciliatory humorhaving his dangerous spanish war on hand britannic majesty in person shortly after gets across to hanover and friedrich despatches truchsess with bielfeld adjoined to return the courtesy  friedrich does not neglect these points of good manners along with which something of substantial may be privately conjoined for example if he had in secret his eye on julich and berg could anything be fitter than to ascertain what the french will think of such an enterprise what the french and next to them what the english that is to say hanoverians who meddle much in affairs of the reich for these reasons and others he likewise probably with more study than in the bielfeld case despatches colonel camas to make his compliment at the french court and in an expert way take soundings there camas a fat sedate military gentleman of advanced years full of observation experience and sound sensewith one arm which he makes do the work of two and nobody can notice that the other arm resting in his coatbreast is of cork so expert is hewill do in this matter what is feasible probably not much for the present he is to call on voltaire as he passes who is in holland again at the hague for some months back and deliver him a little cask of hungary wine which probably his majesty had thought exquisite of which and the other insignificant passages between them we hear more than enough in the writings and correspondences of voltaire about this time  in such way friedrich disposes of his bielfelds who are rather numerous about him now and henceforth adventurers from all quarters especially of the literary type in hopes of being employed much hovered round friedrich through his whole reign but they met a rather strict judge on arriving it cannot be said they found it such a goshen as they expected  favor friendly intimacy it is visible from the first avails nothing with this young king beyond and before all things he will have his work done and looks out exclusively for the man ablest to do it hence bielfeld goes to hanover to grin out euphuisms and make graceful courtbows to our sublime little uncle there on the other hand friedrich institutes a new knighthood order of merit so called which indeed is but a small feat testifying mere hope and exuberance as yet and may even be made worse than nothing according to the knights he shall manage to have happily it proved a successful new order in this last allessential particular and to the end of friedrichs life continued to be a great and coveted distinction among the prussians  beyond doubt this is a radiant enough young majesty entitled to hope and to be the cause of hope handsome to begin with decidedly welllooking all say and of graceful presence though hardly five feet seven and perhaps stouter of limb than the strict belvedere standard height it appears was five feet five inches rhenish which in english measure is five feet seven or a hairsbreadth

day after his accession officers and chief ministers taking the oath friedrich to his officers on whom he counts for the same zeal now which he had witnessed as their comrade recommends mildness of demeanor from the higher to the lower and that the common soldier be not treated with harshness when not deserved and to his ministers he is still more emphatic in the like or a higher strain officially announcing to them by letter that a new reign has commenced he uses these words legible soon after to a glad berlin public our grand care will be to further the countrys wellbeing and to make every one of our subjects einen jeden unserer unterthanen contented and happy our will is not that you strive to enrich us by vexation of our subjects but rather that you aim steadily as well towards the advantage of the country as our particular interest forasmuch as we make no difference between these two objects but consider them one and the same this is written and gets into print within the month and his majesty that same day wednesday 2d june when it came to personal reception and actual taking of the oath was pleased to add in words which also were printed shortly this comfortable corollary my will henceforth is if it ever chance that my particular interest and the general good of my countries should seem to go against each otherin that case my will is that the latter always be preferred dickens despatch 4th june 1740 preuss friedrichs jugend und thronbesteigung berlin 1840 p 325quoting from the berlin newspapers of 28th june and 2d july 1740  this is a fine dialect for incipient royalty and it is brandnew at that time it excites an admiration in the then populations which to us so long used to it and to what commonly comes of it is not conceivable at once there can be no doubt the young king does faithfully intend to develop himself in the way of making men happy but here as elsewhere are limits which he will recognize ahead some of them perhaps nearer than was expected  meanwhile his first acts in this direction correspond to these fine words the year 1740 still grim with cold into the heart of summer bids fair to have a late poor harvest

wisdom and humanity for which doubtless blessings of a very sincere kind rise to him from several millions of his fellowmortals  nay furthermore as can be dimly gathered this scarcity continuing some

prussian court shall a question try for answer again by that savage method the use of torture had i believe fallen rather obsolete in prussia but now the very threat of it shall vanishthe threat of it as we may remember had reached friedrich himself at one time three or four years ago it is farther said a dark murder happened in berlin man killed one night in the open streets murderer discoverable by no methodunless he were a certain candidatus of divinity to whom some trace of evidence pointed but who sorrowfully persisted in absolute and total denial this poor candidatus had been threatened with the rack and would most likely have at length got it had not the real murderer been discoveredmuch to the discredit of the rack in berlin this candidatus was only threatened nor do i know when the last actual instance in prussia was but in enlightened france and most other countries there was as yet no scruple upon it barbier the diarist at paris some time after this tells us of a gang of thieves there who were regularly put to the torture and they blabbed too ils ont jase says barbier with official jocosity barbier journal historique du regne de louis xv paris 1849 ii 338 date dec 1742  friedrichs cabinet order we need not say was greeted everywhere at home and abroad by three rounds of applausein which surely all of us still join though the per contra also is becoming visible to some of us and our enthusiasm grows less complete than formerly this was friedrichs first step in lawreform done on his fourth day of kingship a long career in that kind lies ahead of him in reform of law civil as well as criminal his efforts ended with life only for his love of justice was really great and the mendacities and wiggeries attached to such a necessary of life as law found no favor from him at any time     will have philosophers about him and a real academy of sciences  to neglect the philosophies fine arts interests of human culture he is least of all likely the idea of building up the academy of sciences to its pristine height or far higher is evidently one of those that have long lain in the crownprinces mind eager to realize themselves immortal wolf exiled but safe at marburg and refusing to return in friedrich wilhelms time had lately dedicated a book to the crownprince indicating that perhaps under a new reign he might be more persuadable friedrich makes haste to persuade instructs the proper person reverend herr reinbeck head of the consistorium at berlin to write and negotiate all reasonable conditions shall be granted the immortal wolfand friedrich adds with his own hand as postscript i request you ihn to use all diligence about wolf a man that seeks truth and loves it must be reckoned precious in any human society and i think you will make a conquest in the realm of truth if you persuade wolf hither again in oeuvres de frederic xxvii ii 185 the letter given this is of date june 6th not yet a week since friedrich came to be king the reinbeckwolf negotiation which ensued can be read in busching by the curious buschings beitrage  freiherr von wolf i 63137 it represents to us a croaky thrifty longheaded old herr professor in no haste to quit marburg except for something better obliged to wear woollen shoes and leggings bad at mounting stairs and otherwise needing soft treatment willing though with caution to work at an academy of sciencesbut dubious if the french are so admirable as they seem to themselves in such operations veteran wolf one dimly begins to learn could himself build a german academy of sciences to some purpose if encouraged this latter was probably the stone of stumbling in that direction veteran wolf did not get to be president in the new academy of sciences but was brought back streets all in triumph to his old place at halle and there with little other work that was heard of but we hope in warm shoes and without much mounting of stairs lived peaceably victorious the rest of his days friedrichs thoughts are not of a german homebuilt academy but of a french one and for this he already knows a builder has silently had him in his eye these two years pastvoltaire giving hint in the letter we once heard of at loo builder shall be that sublime maupertuis scientific lion of paris ever since his feat in the polar regions and the charming narrative he gave of it what a feat what a book exclaimed the parisian cultivated circles male and female on that occasion and maupertuis with plenty of bluster in him carefully suppressed assents in a grandly modest way his portraits are in the printshops ever since one very singular portrait just coming out at which there is some laughing a coarsefeatured blusterous rather triumphantlooking man blusterous though finely complacent for the nonce in copious dressinggown and fur cap comfortably squeezing the earth and her meridians flat as if he had done it with his left hand and with the other and its outstretched finger asking mankind are not you aware thenare not we answers voltaire by and by with endless waggeries upon him though at present so reverent friedrich in these same days writes this autograph which who of men or lions could resist   to monsieur de maupertuis at paris  no datedatable june 1740  my heart and my inclination excited in me from the moment i mounted the throne the desire of having you here that you

for maupertuis and raised matters to a still higher pitch maupertuis is on the road and we shall see him before long     and every one shall get to heaven in his own way  here is another little fact which had immense renown at home and abroad in those summer months and long afterwards  june 22d 1740 the geistliche departement board of religion we may term it reports that the romancatholic schools which have been in use these eight years past for children of soldiers belonging to that persuasion are especially in berlin perverted directly in the teeth of royal ordinance 1732 to seducing protestants into catholicism annexed or ready for annexing is the specific report of fiscalgeneral to this effectupon which what would it please his majesty to direct us to do  his majesty writes on the margin these words rough and ready which we give with all their grammatical blotches on them indicating a mind made up on one subject which was much more dubious then to most other minds than it now is  die religionen musen mussen alle tollerirt tolerirt werden und mus muss der fiscal nuhr nur das auge darauf haben das dass keine der andern abrug tuhe abbruch thue den denn hier mus muss ein jeder nach seiner fasson selich facon selig werden preuss thronbesteigung p 333 rodenbeck in die  which in english might run as follows  all religions must be tolerated tollerated and the fiscal must have an eye that none of them make unjust encroachment on the other for in this country every man must get to heaven in his own way  wonderful words precious to the then leading spirits and which the spelling and grammar being mended flew abroad over all the world the enlightened public everywhere answering his majesty once more with its loudest bravissimo on this occasion with what enthusiasm of admiring wonder it is now difficult to fancy after the lapse of sixscore years and indeed in regard to all these worthy acts of human improvement which we are now concerned with account should be held were it possible on friedrichs behalf how extremely original and bright with the splendor of new gold they then were and how extremely they are fallen dim by general circulation since that account should be held and yet it is not possible no human imagination is adequate to it in the times we are now got into     free press and newspapers the best instructors  toleration in friedrichs spiritual circumstances was perhaps no great feat to friedrich but what the reader hardly expected of him was freedom of the press or an attempt that way from england from holland friedrich had heard of free press of newspapers the best instructors it is a fact that he hastens to plant a seed of that kind at berlin sets about it on the second day of his reign so eager is he berlin had already some meagre intelligenzblatt weekly or thriceweekly advertiser perhaps two but it is a real newspaper frondent with genial leafy speculation and food for the mind that friedrich is intent upon a literarypolitical newspaper or were it even two newspapers one french one german and he rapidly makes the arrangements for it despatches jordan on the second day to seek some fit frenchman arrangements are soon made a

or roads in time comingnone that led to results worth naming freedom of the press in the case of these journals was never violated nor was any need for violating it general freedom of the press friedrich did not grant in any quite official or steady way but in practice under him it always had a kind of real existence though a fluctuating ambiguous one and we have to note through friedrichs whole reign a marked disinclination to concern himself with censorship or the shackling of mens poor tongues and pens nothing but some officious report that there was offence to foreign courts or the chance of offence in a poor mans pamphlet could induce friedrich to interfere with him or itand indeed his interference was generally against his ministers for having wrong informed him and in favor of the poor pamphleteer appealing at the fountainhead anonymous laveaux vie de frederic ii roi de prusse strasbourg 1787 iv 82 a worthless now nearly forgotten book but competent on this point if on any laveaux a handy fellow fugitive exmonk with fugitive exnun attached having lived much at berlin always in the pamphleteering line to the end of his life disgusting satires against him vie privee by voltaire matinees du roi de prusse and still worse lies and nonsenses were freely sold at berlin and even bore to be printed there friedrich saying nothing caring nothing he has been known to burn pamphlets publiclyone pamphlet we shall ourselves see on fire yetbut it was without the least hatred to them and for official reasons merely to the last he would answer his reporting ministers le presse est libre free press you must considergrandly reluctant to meddle with the press or go down upon the dogs barking at his door those ill effects of free press first stage of the ill effects he endured in this manner but the good effects seem to have fallen below his expectation friedrichs enthusiam for freedom of the press prompt enough as we see never rose to the extreme pitch and it rather sank than increased as he continued his experiences of men and things this of formey and the two newspapers was the only express attempt he made in that direction and it proved a rather disappointing one the two newspapers went their way thenceforth friedrich sometimes making use of them for small purposes once or twice writing an article himself of wildly quizzical nature perhaps to be noticed by us when the time comes but are otherwise except for chronological purposes of the last degree of insignificance to gods or men  freedom of the press says my melancholic friend is a noble thing and in certain nations at certain epochs produces glorious effectschiefly in the revolutionary line where that has grown indispensable freedom of the press is possible where everybody disapproves the least abuse of it where the censorship is as it were exercised by all the world when the world as even in the freest countries it almost irresistibly tends to become is no longer in a case to exercise that salutary function and cannot keep down loud unwise speaking loud unwise persuasion and rebuke it into silence whenever printed freedom of the press will not answer very long among sane human creatures and indeed in nations not in an exceptional case it becomes impossible amazingly soon  all these are phenomena of friedrichs first week let these suffice as sample in that first kind splendid indications surely and shot forth in swift enough succession flash following flash upon an attentive world betokening shall we say what internal sea of splendor struggling to disclose itself probably lies in this young king and how high his hopes go for mankind and himself yes surelyand introducing we remark withal the new era of philanthropy enlightenment and so much else with french revolution and a world well suicided hanging in the rear clearly enough to this young ardent friedrich foremost man of his time and capable of doing its inarticulate or dumb aspirings belongs that questionable honor and a very singular one it would have seemed to friedrich had he lived to see what it meant  friedrichs rapidity and activity in the first months of his reign were wonderful to mankind as indeed through life he continued to be a most rapid and active king he flies about mustering troops ministerial boards passing edicts inspecting accepting homages of provincesdecides and does every day that passes an amazing number of things writes many letters too finds moments even for some verses and occasionally draws a snatch of melody from his flute  his letters are copiously preserved but as usual they are in swift official tone and tell us almost nothing to his sisters he writes assurances to his friends his suhms duhans voltaires eager invitations general or particular to come to him my state has changed is his phrase to voltaire and other dear intimates a tone of pensiveness at first even of sorrow and pathos traceable in it come to meand the tone in an old dialect different from friedrichs might have meant pray for me an immense new scene is opened full of possibilities of good and bad his hopes being great his anxieties the shadow of them are proportionate duhan his good old tutor does arrive algarotti arrives warmly welcomed both with voltaire there are difficulties but surely he too will before long manage to arrive the good suhm who had been saxon minister at petersburg to his sorrow this long while back got in motion soon enough but alas his lungs were ruined by the russian climate and he did not arrive something pathetic still in those final letters of suhm passionately speeding on like a spent steed struggling homeward he has to pause at warsaw and in a few days dies therein a way mournful to friedrich and us to duhan and duhans children afterwards he was punctually not too lavishly attentive in like manner to suhms nephews whom the dying man had recommended to himwe will now glance shortly at a second and contemporaneous phasis of friedrichs affairs     intends to be practical withal and every inch a king  friedrich is far indeed from thinking to reduce his army as the foreign editor imagines on the contrary he is with all industry increasing it he changed the potsdam giants into four regiments of the usual stature he is busy bargaining with his brotherinlaw of brunswick and with other neighbors for still new regimentsmakes up within the next few months eight regiments an increase of say 16000 men it would appear he means to keep an eye on the practicalities withal means to have a fightingapparatus of the utmost potentiality for one thing here are other indications  we saw the old dessauer in a sad hour lately speaking beside the mark and with what olympian glance suddenly tearless the new king flashed out upon him knowing nothing of authority that could reside in any dessauer nor was that a solitary experience the like befell wherever needed heinrich of schwedt the ill

condemned us to death which nobody is now upbraiding him with rushes up from landsberg unbidden to pay his congratulations and condolences driven by irresistible exuberance of loyalty to his

this manner on a sudden it is said he had thoughts of resigning so indignant was he no doubt he went home to landsberg gloomily reflective with the pipeclay of his mind in such a ruinous condition but there was no serious anger on friedrichs part and he consoled his little schulenburg soon after by expediting some promotion he had intended him terribly proud young majesty this exclaim the sweet voices and indeed if they are to have a saturnian kingdom by appearance it will be on conditions only  anticipations there had been that old unkindnesses against the crownprince some of which were cruel enough might be remembered now and certain people had their just fears considering what account stood against them others vice versa their hopes but neither the fears nor the hopes realized themselves especially the fears proved altogether groundless derschau who had voted death in that copenick courtmartial upon the crownprince is continued in his functions in the light of his kings countenance as if nothing such had been derschau and all others so concerned not the least question was made of them nor of what they had thought or had done or said on an occasion once so tragically vital to a certain man  nor is reward much regulated by past services to the crownprince or even by sufferings endured for him shocking ingratitude exclaim the sweet voices here toobeing of weak judgment many of them poor kattes father a faithful old soldier not capable of being more he does rather conspicuously make feldmarschall make reichsgraf happy could these honors be a consolation to the old man the munchows of custrinreaders remember their kindness in that sad time how the young boy went into petticoats again and came to the crownprinces cell with all manner of furnishingsthe

majorship to captaincy in their respective regiments him of the petticoats he had already taken altogether to himself preuss i 66 and of him we shall see a glimpse at wilhelminas shortly as a milkbeard jeune morveux in personal attendance on his majesty this was a notable exception and in effect there came good public service eminent some of it from these munchows in their various departments and it was at length perceived to have been in the main because they were of visible faculty for doing work that they had got work to do and the exceptional case of the munchows became confirmatory of the rule  lieutenant keith again whom we once saw galloping from wesel to save his life in that bad affair of the crownprinces and his was nothing like so fortunate lieutenant keith by speed on that wesel occasion and help of chesterfields secretary got across to england got into the portuguese service and has there been soldiering very silently these ten years pastskin and body

mit verwandten und freunden p 281 small promotion in comparison with hope thought the poor lieutenant but had to rest satisfied with it and struggle to understand that perhaps he was fit for nothing bigger and that he must exert himself to do this small thing well hardness of heart in high places friedrich one is glad to see had not forgotten the poor fellow could he have done better with him some ten years hence quite incidentally there came to keith one morning a fine purse of money from his majesty one pretty gift in keiths experiencemuch the topic in berlin while a certain solemn

consequence been dismissed the prussian service and had taken service with the dutch lieutenant spaen either did not return at all or disliked the aspects when he did and immediately withdrew to holland again which probably was wise of him at a late period king friedrich then a great king on one of his cleve journeys fell in with spaen who had become a dutch general of rank and was of good manners and style of conversation king friedrich was charmed to see him became his guest for the night conversed delightfully with him about old prussian matters and about new and in the colloquy never once alluded to that interesting passage in his young life and spaens nicolai anekdoten vi 178 hard as polished steel thinks spaen perhaps but if candid must ask himself withal are facts any

nothing of the y in it as may be worth remembering in a more important instance  old friendship it would seem is without weight in public appointments here old friends are somewhat astonished to find this friend of theirs a king every inch to old comrades if they were useless much more if they were worse than useless how disappointing one wretched herr name suppressed but known at the time and

that had not entered into the mind of jordans royal friend the munchows he did promote the finks sons of his tutor finkenstein to these and other old comrades in whom he had discovered fitness it is no doubt abundantly grateful to him to recognize and employ it as he notably does in these and in other instances but before all things he has decided to remember that he is king that he must accept the severe laws of that trust and do it or not have done anything  an inverse sign pointing in the same way is the passionate search he is making in foreign countries for such men as will suit him in these same months for example he bethinks him of two counts schmettau in the austrian service with whom he had made acquaintance in the rhine campaign of a count von rothenburg whom he saw in the french camp there and is negotiating to have them if possible the schmettaus are prussian by birth though in austrian service them he obtains under form of an order home with good conditions under it they came and proved useful men to him rothenburg a shining kind of figure in diplomacy as well as soldiership was alsatian german foreign to prussia but him too friedrich obtained and made much of as will be notable by and by and in fact the soul of all these noble tendencies in friedrich which surely are considerable is even this that he loves men of merit and does not love men of none that he has an endless appetite for men of merit and feels consciously and otherwise that they are the one thing beautiful the one thing needful to him  this which is the product of all fine tendencies is likewise their centre or focus out of which they start again with some chance of fulfilmentand we may judge in how many directions friedrich was willing to expand himself by the multifarious kinds he was inviting and negotiating for academiciansand not maupertuis only but all manner of mathematical geniuses euler whom he got at gravesande muschenbroek whom he failed of and literary geniuses innumerable first and last academicians musicians players dancers even much more soldiers and civilservice men no man that carries any honest can do about with him but may expect some welcome here which continued through friedrichs reign and involved him in much petty trouble not always successful in the lower kinds of it for his court was the cynosure of ambitious creatures on the wing or inclined for taking wing like a lantern kindled in the darkness of the worldand many owls impinged upon him whom he had to dismiss with brevity  perhaps it had been better to stand by mere prussian or german merit native to the ground or rather undoubtedly it had in some departments as in the military the administrative diplomatic friedrich was himself among the best of judges but in various others he had mainly mainly by no means blindly or solely to accept noise of reputation as evidence of merit and in these if we compute with rigor his success was intrinsically not considerable the more honor to him that he never wearied of trying a man that does not care for merit says the adage cannot himself have any but a king that does not care for merit what shall we say of such a king     behavior to his mother to his wife  one other fine feature significant of many let us notice his affection for his mother when his mother addressed him as your majesty he answered as the books are careful to tell us call me son that is the title of all others most agreeable to me words which there can be no doubt came from the heart fain would he shoot forth to greatness in filial piety as otherwise fain solace himself in doing something kind to his mother generously lovingly though again with clear view of the limits he decrees for her a title higher than had been customary as well as more accordant with his feelings not queen dowager but her majesty the queen mother he decides to build her a new palace under the lindens it is to be and of due magnificence in a month or two he had even got bits of the foundation dug and the houses to be pulled down bought or bargained for rodenbeck p 15 30th june23d aug 1740 and correct stenzel iv 44which enterprise however was renounced no doubt with consent as the public aspects darkened nothing in the way of honor in the way of real affection heartily felt and demonstrated was wanting to queen sophie in her widowhood but on the other hand of public influence no vestige was allowed if any was ever claimed and the good kind mother lived in her monbijou the centre and summit of berlin society and restricted herself wisely to private matters she has her domesticities family affections readings speculations gives evening parties at monbijou one glimpse of her in 1742 we get that of a perfectly private royal lady which though it has little meaning yet as it is authentic coming from buschings hand may serve as one little twinkle in that total darkness and shall be left to the reader and his fancy  a count henkel a thuringian gentleman of high speculation high pietistic ways extremely devout and given even to writing of religion came to berlin about some silesian propertiesa man i should think of lofty melancholic aspect and in severe type somewhat of a lion on account of his book called deathbed scenes in four volumes came to berlin and on the 15th august 1742 towards evening as the everpunctual busching looking into henkels papers gives it was presented to the queen mother who retained him to supper supper not beginning till about ten oclock the queen mother was extremely gracious to henkel but investigated him a good deal and put a great many questions not quite easy to answer in that circle as why he did not play what he thought of comedies and operas what preachers he was acquainted with in berlin whether he too was a writer of books covertly alluding to the deathbed scenes notes busching and abundance of other questioning she also recounted many fantastic anecdotes viel abenteuerliches about count von zinzendorf founder of hernnhuth farshining spiritual paladin of that day whom her majesty thinks rather a spiritual quixote and declared that they were strictly true buschings beitrage iv 27 upon which exit henkel borne by busching and our light is snuffed out  this is one momentary glance i have met with of queen sophie in her dowager state the rest though there were seventeen years of it in all is silent to mankind and me and only her death and her sons great grief about it so great as to be surprising is mentioned in the books  actual painful sorrow about his father much more any new outburst of weeping and lamenting is not on record after that first morning time does its work and in such a whirl of occupations sooner than elsewhere and the loved dead lie silent in their mausoleum in our heartsserenely sad as eternity not in loud sorrow as of time friedrich was pious as a son however he might be on other heads to the last years of his life as from the first days of his reign it was evident in what honor he held friedrich wilhelms memory and the words my father when they turned up in discourse had in that fine voice of his a tone which the observers noted to his mother he failed no day when in berlin however busy to make his visit and he never spoke to her except hat in hand  with his own queen friedrich still consorts a good deal in these first times is with her at charlottenburg berlin potsdam reinsberg for a day or two as occasion gives sometimes at reinsberg for weeks running in the intervals of war and business glad to be at rest amid his old pursuits by the side of a kind innocent being familiar to him so it lasts for a length of time but these happy intervals we can remark grow rarer whether the ladys humor as they became rarer might not sink withal and produce an acceleration in the rate of decline she was thought to be capable of pouting faire la fachee at one period we are left to our guesses there is not anywhere the smallest whisper to guide us deep silence reigns in all prussian booksto feel or to suspect yourself neglected and to become more amiable thereupon in which course alone lies hope is difficult for any queen enough we can observe these meetings within two or three years have become much rarer and perhaps about the end of the third or fourth year they altogether cease and pass merely into the formal character in which state they continued fixed liable to no uncertainty and were transacted to the end of friedrichs life with inflexible regularity as the annual reviews were this is a curious section of his life which there will be other opportunities of noticing but there is yet no thought of it anywhere nor for years to come though fables to the contrary were once current in books laveaux c     no change in his fathers methods or ministries  in the old mode of administration in the ministries government boards he made no change these administrative methods of his wise fathers are admirable to friedrich who knows them well and they continue to be so these men of his fathers them also friedrich knows and that they were well chosen in methods or in men he is inclined to make the minimum of alteration at present one finance hofrath of a projecting turn named eckart who had abused the last weak years of friedrich wilhelm and much afflicted mankind by the favor he was in this eckart friedrich appointed a commission to inquire into found the public right in regard to eckart and dismissed him with ignominy not with much other punishment minister boden on the contrary high in the finance department who had also been much grumbled at friedrich found to be a good man and friedrich not only retained boden but advanced him and continued to make more and more use of him in time coming his love of perfection in work done his care of thrift seemed almost greater than his late fathers had beento the disappointment of many in the other departments podewils thulmeyer and the rest went on as

right pitch for this king about a hundred and fifty new figures of the page and goldstick kind is the reckoning given helden geschichte i 353 so many of these and there is an increase of 16000 to ones army going on that is the proportion noticeable in the facts as his father left them friedrich persisted all his life in the semblances or outer vestures he changed to this extent for the presentthese are the phenomena of friedrichs accession noted by us  readers see there is radiance enough perhaps slightly in excess but of intrinsically good quality in the aurora of this new reign a brilliant valiant young king much splendor of what we could call a golden or soft nature visible in those newera doings of his in those strong affections to his friends and also what we like almost better in him something of a steelbright or stellar splendor meaning clearness of eyesight intrepidity severe loyalty to factwhich is a fine addition to the softer element and will keep it and its philanthropies and magnanimities well under rule such a man is rare in this world how extremely rare such a man born king he is swift and he is persistent sharply discerning fearless to resolve and perform carries his great endowments lightly as if they were not heavy to him he has known hard misery been taught by stripes a light stoicism sits gracefully on him  what he will grow to probably to something considerable very certainly to something far short of his aspirations far different from his own hopes and the worlds concerning him it is not we it is father time that does the controlling and fulfilling of our hopes and strange work he makes of them and us for example has not friedrichs grand new era inaugurated by him in a week with the leading spirits all adoring issued since in french revolution and a world well suicidedthe leading spirits much thrown out in consequence new era has gone to great lengths since friedrichs time and the leading spirits do not now adore it but yawn over it or worse which changes to us the then aspect of friedrich and his epoch and his aspirations a good dealon the whole friedrich will go his way time and the leading spirits going theirs and like the rest of us will grow to what he can his actual size is not great among the kingdoms his outward resources are rather to be called small the prussian dominion at that date is in extent about fourfifths of an england proper and perhaps not onefifth so fertile subject population is well under two millions and a half revenue not much above one million sterling the exact statistic cipher is

sound to readers his hopes at this time are manyand among them i perceive there is not wanting secretly in spite of his experiences some hope that he himself may be a good deal happier than formerly nor is there any ascetic humor on his part to forbid trial he is much determined to try probably enough as we guess and gather his agreeablest anticipations at this time were of reinsberg how in the intervals of work well done he would live there wholly to the muses have his chosen spirits round him his colloquies his suppers of the gods why not there might be a king of intellects conceivable withal protecting cherishing practically guiding the chosen illuminative souls of this world a new charlemagne the smallest new charlemagne of spiritual type with his paladins round him how glorious how salutary in the dim generations now goingthese too were hopes which proved signally futile rigorous time could not grant these at allgranted in his own hard way other things instead but all along the lifeelement the epoch though friedrich took it kindly and never complained was ungenial to such a man  somewhat of a rotten epoch this into which friedrich has been born to shape himself and his activities royal and otherexclaims smelfungus once in an older earnest time when the eternally awful meanings of this universe had not yet sunk into dubieties to any one much less into levities or into mendacities into huge hypocrisies carefully regulatedso luminous vivid and ingenuous a young creature had not wanted divine manna in his pilgrimage through life nor in that case had he come out of it in so lean a condition but the highest man of us is born brother to his contemporaries struggle as he may there is no escaping the family likeness by spasmodic indignant contradiction of them by stupid compliance with themyou will inversely resemble if you do not directly like the starling you cant get outmost surely if there do fall manna from heaven in the given generation and nourish in us

robust is nature the mighty mother  but in general that sad gospel souls extinct stomachs well alive is the credible one not articulately preached but practically believed by the abject generations and acted on as it never was before what immense sensualities there were is known and also as some small offset though that has not yet begun in 1740 what immense quantities of physical labor and contrivance were got out of mankind in that epoch and down to this day as if having lost its heaven it had struck desperately down into the earth as if it were a beaverkind and not a mankind any more we had once a barbaossa and a world all grandly true but from that to karl vi and his holy romish reich in such a state of holiness i here cut short my abstruse friend  readers are impatient to have done with these miscellaneous preludings and to be once definitely under way such a journey lying ahead yes readers a journey indeed and at this point permit me to warn you that where the ground where dryasdust and the destinies yield anything humanly illustrative of friedrich and his work one will have to linger and carefully gather it even as here large tracts occur bestrewn with mere pedantisms diplomatic cobwebberies learned marinestores and inhuman matter over which we shall have to skip emptyhanded this also was among the sad conditions of our enterprise that it has to go now too slow and again too fast not in proportion to natural importance of objects but to several inferior considerations withal so busy has perverse destiny been on it perverse destiny edacious chanceand the dryasdusts too and nightmares in prussia as elsewhere we know how strong they are  friedrichs character in old age has doubtless its curious affinities its disguised identities with these prognostic features and indications of his youth and to our readersif we do ever get them to the goal of seeing friedrich a little with their own eyes and judgmentsthere may be pleasant contrasts and comparisons of that kind in store one day but the far commoner experience which also has been my ownhere is smelfunguss stern account of that  my friend you will be luckier than i if after ten years not to say in a sense twenty years thirty years of reading and rummaging in those sad prussian books ancient and new which often are laudably authentic too and exact as to details you can gather any character whatever of friedrich in any period of his life or conceive him as a human entity at all it is strange after such thousandfold writing but it is true his history is considerably unintelligible to mankind at this hour left chaotic enigmatic in a good many pointsthe military part of it alone being brought to clearness and rendered fairly conceivable and credible to those who will study and as to the man himself or what his real physiognomy can have been well it must be owned few men were of such rapidity of face and aspect so difficult to seize the features of in his action too there was such rapidity such secrecy suddenness a man that could not be read even by the candid except as in flashes of lightning and then the anger of bystanders uncandid who got hurt by him the hasty malevolences the stupidities the opacities enough in modern times what is saying much perhaps no mans motives intentions and procedure have been more belied misunderstood misrepresented during his life nor i think since that have many men fared worse by the limner or biographic class the favorable to him and the unfavorable or been so smeared of and blotched of and reduced to a mere blur and dazzlement of crosslights incoherences incredibilities in which nothing not so much as a human nose is clearly discernible by way of featurecourage reader nevertheless on the above terms let us march according to promise    chapter ii  the homagings  young friedrich as his father had done considers it unnecessary to be crowned old friedrich first of the name and of the king series we did see crowned with a pinch of snuff tempering the solemnities that coronation once well done suffices all his descendants hitherto such an expense of moneyof diluted mendacity too such haranguing gesturing symbolic fugling all grown half falseavoid lying even with your eyes or knees or the coat upon your back so far as you easily can  nothing of coronation but it is thought needful to have the huldigungen homagings done the fealties sworn and the young majesty in due course goes about or gives directions now here now there in his various provinces getting that accomplished but even in that friedrich is by no means straitlaced or punctilious does it commonly by deputy only in three places konigsberg berlin cleve does he appear in person mainly by deputy and always with the minimum of fuss and no haranguing that could be avoided nowhere are the old stande provincial parliaments assembled now or afterwards sufficient for this and for every occasion are the permanent committees of the stande nor is much speaking unessential for despatch of business used to these  standeof ritterschaft mainly of gentry small and greatexisted once in all those countries as elsewhere says one historian and some of them in preussen for example used to be rather loud and inclined to turbulence till the curb from a judicious bridlehand would admonish them but for a long while pastespecially since the great electors time who got an excise law passed or the foundations of a good excise law laid preuss iv 432 and thronbesteigung pp 379383 and what with excise what with domainfarms had a fixed annual budget which he reckoned fair to both partiesthey have been dying out for want of work and under friedrich wilhelm may be said to have gone quite dead what work was left for them prussian budget is fixed many things are fixed why talk of them farther the prussian king nothing of a fool like certain otherswhich indeed is the cardinal point though my author does not say sois respectfully aware of the facts round him and can listen to the rumors too so far as he finds good the king sees himself terribly interested to get into the right course in all things and avoid the wrong one probably he does in his way seek wise advice concerning the arduous matters of the kingdom nay i believe he is diligent to have it of the wisestwho knows if stande would always give it wiser especially stande in the haranguing conditionenough they are not applied to there is no freedom in that country no freedom to speak of continues he but i do a little envy them their fixed budget and some other things what pleasure there can be in having your household arrangements tumbled into disorder every new year by a newcontrived scale of expenses for you i never could ascertain  friedrich is not the man to awaken parliamentary sleepingdogs well settled by his ancestors once or twice out of preussen in friedrich wilhelms time there was heard some whimper which sounded like the beginning of a bark but friedrich wilhelm was on the alert for it are you coming in with your nie pozwalam your liberum veto then none of your polish vagaries here tout le pays sera ruine the whole country will be ruined say you such had been the poor marshal or provincial speakers remonstrance on one occasion i dont believe a word of that but i do believe the government by junkers country squires and nie pozwalam will be ruinedas it is fully meant to be i am establishing the kings sovereignty like a rock of bronze ich stabilire die souverainetat wie einen rocher von bronze some extremely strong kind of rock forster b iii urkundenbuch i 50 preuss iv 420 n nie pozwalam the formula of liberum veto signifies i dont permit this was one of friedrich wilhelms marginalia in response to such a thing and the mutinous whimper died out again parliamentary assemblages are sometimes collective wisdoms but by no means always so in magdeburg we remember what trouble friedrich wilhelm had with his unreasonable ritters ritters there in their assembled capacity had the reich behind them and could not be dealt with like preussen but friedrich wilhelm by wise slow methods managed magdeburg too and reduced it to silence or to words necessary for despatch of business  in each province a permanent committeechosen i suppose by king and knights assenting chosen i know not how but admitted to be wisely chosenrepresents the once parliament or stande and has its potency for doing good service in regard to all provincial matters from roads and bridges upwards and is impotent to do the least harm roads and bridges church matters repartition of the landdues army mattersin fact they are an effective nonharanguing parliament to the kings deputy in every such province well calculated to illuminate and forward his subaltern amtmen and him nay we observe it is oftenest in the way of gifts and solacements that the king articulately communicates with these committees or their ritterschafts projects for draining of bogs for improved highways for better husbandry loans granted them loanbanks established for the provinces behoofno need of parliamentary eloquence on such occasions but of something far different  it is from this quiescent or busy but noiseless kind of stande and populations that friedrich has his huldigung to takeand the operation whether done personally or by deputy must be an abundantly simple one he for his part is fortunate enough to find everywhere the sovereignty established rock of bronze not the least shaken in his time he will graciously undertake by written act which is read before the stande king or kings deputy witnessing there to maintain the privileges of his stande and populations the stande answer on oath with lifted hand and express invocation of heaven that they will obey him as true subjects and sodoubtless with something of dining superadded but no whisper of it put on recordthe huldigung will everywhere very quietly transact itself  the huldigung itself is nothing to us even with friedrich thereas at konigsberg berlin cleve the three exceptional places to which nevertheless let us briefly attend him for the sake of here and there some direct glimpse we may get of the then friedrichs actual physiognomy and ways other direct view or the chance of such is not conceded us out of those sad prussian books which are very full on this of the huldigung if silent on so many other points preuss thronbesteigung p 382     friedrich accepts the homages personally in three places  to konigsberg is his first excursion on this errand preussen has perhaps or may be suspected of having some remnants of sour humors left in it and remembrances of stande with haranguings and even mutinies there if anywhere the king in person may do good on such an occasion he left berlin july 7th bound thitherward here is note of that first royal tourspecimen of several hundreds such which he had to do in the course of the next fortyfive years  friend algarotti charming talker attended him who else official and nonofficial ask not the journey is to be circuitous to combine various businesses and also to have its amusements they went by custrin glancing at old known country which is at its greenest in this season by custrin across the neumark into pommern after that by an intricate winding route reviewing regiments inspecting garrisons now here now there doing all manner of inspections talking i know not what oftenest lodging with favored generals if it suited distance to konigsberg by the direct road is about 500 miles by this winding one it must have been 800 journey thither took nine days in all obliquely through pommern almost to the coast of the baltic their ultimatum there a place called coslin where they reviewed with strictnessomitting colberg a small seafortress not far rearward time being short thence into westpreussen into polish territory and swiftly across that keeping dantzig and its noises wide enough to the left one night in poland and the next they are in ostpreussen place called liebstadtagain on homeground and diligently reviewing there  the review at liebstadt is remarkable in this that the regiments one regiment especially not being what was fit a certain grenadiercaptain got cashiered on the spot and the old commandant himself was soon after pensioned and more gently sent his ways so strict is his majesty contrariwise he found lieutenantgeneral von kattes garrison at angerburg next day in a very high perfection and colonel posadowskys regiment specially so with which latter gentleman he lodged that night and made him farther happy by the order of merit colonel posadowsky garrison of angerburg far off in eastpreussen chevalier of the order of merit henceforth if we ever meet him again to the good old lieutenantgeneral von katte who no doubt dined with them his majesty handed on the same occasion a patent of feldmarschallintends soon to make him graf and did it as readers know both colonel and general attended him thenceforth still by a circuitous route to konigsberg to assist in the solemnities there by gumbinnen by trakehnenthe stud of trakehnen that also his majesty saw and made review of not without emotion we can fancy as the sleek colts were trotted out on those new terms at trakehnen katte and the colonel would be his majestys guests for the night they stayed this is their extreme point eastward konigsberg now lies a good way west of them but at trakehnen they turn and saturday 16th july 1740 after another hundred miles or so along the pleasant valley of the pregel get to konigsberg ready to begin business on monday morningon sunday if necessary from preuss thronbesteigung pp 382 385 rodenbeck p 16 c  on sunday there did a kind of memorability occur the huldigungspredigt homage sermonby a reverend herr quandt chief preacher there which would not be worth mentioning except for this circumstance that his majesty exceedingly admired quandt and thought him a most demosthenic genius and the best of all the germans quandts text was in these words thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy god helpeth thee first chronicles xii 18 quandt began in a sonorous voice raising his face with respectful enthusiasm to the king thine are we o friedrich and on thy side thou son of friedrich wilhelm and so went on sermon brief sonorous compact and sticking close to its text friedrich stood immovable gazing on the eloquent demosthenic quandt with admiration heightened by surprisewrote of quandt to voltaire and with sustained enthusiasm to the public long afterwards and to the end of his days was wont to make quandt an exception if perhaps almost the only one from german barbarism and disharmony of mind and tongue so that poor quandt cannot ever since get entirely forgotten but needs always to be raked up again for this reason when others have ceased an almost melancholy adventure for poor quandt and another  the huldigung was rather grand harangue and counterharangue permitted to the due length and proper festivities following but the stande could not manage to get into vocal covenanting or deliberating at all friedrich before leaving berlin had answered their hint or request that way in these words we are likewise graciously inclined to give to the said stande before their homaging the same assurance which they got from our herr fathers majesty who is now with godgeneral assurance that their and everybodys rights shall be maintained as we see they arewith which it is hoped hoffentlich they will be content and get to peace upon this matter sich dabei beruhigen werden preuss thronbesteigung p 380 it will be best for them  friedrich gave away much corn here that is opened his corngranaries on charitable terms and took all manner of measures here as in other places for relief of the scarcity there was of the illuminations never so

adjoining there was little of notable in it the upholstery arrangements thrifty in the extreme his majesty is prone to thrift in this of the huldigung as would appear perhaps regarding the affair as

august 1740 dickens who has been reporting hitherto in a favorable though in a languid exoteric manner not being in any height of favor england or hehad express audience of his majesty being summoned out to potsdam for that end sunday evening about 7 pmmajesty intending to be off on the cleve journey tomorrow let us accompany dickens readers may remember george ii has been at hanover for some weeks past bielfeld diligently grinning euphemisms and courtly graciosities to him truchsess hinting on opportunity that there are perhaps weighty businesses in the rear which however on the britannic side seem loath to start britannic majesty is much at a loss about his spanish war so dangerous for kindling france and the whole world upon him in regard to which prussia might be so important for or againstthis in compressed form is what dickens witnesses at potsdam that sunday evening from 7 pm  audience lasted above an hour king turned directly upon business wishes to have categorical answers as to three points already submitted to his britannic majestys consideration clear footing indispensable between us what you want of me say it and be plain what i want of you is these three things  1 guarantee for julich and berg all the world knows whose these duchies are will his britannic majesty guarantee me there and if so how and to what lengths will he proceed about it  2 settlement about ostfriesland expectancy of ostfriesland soon to fall heirless which was granted me long since though hanover makes hagglings counterclaimings i must have some settlement about that  3 the like about those perplexities in mecklenburg no difficulty there if we try heartily nor is there such pressing haste about it  these are my three claims on england and i will try to serve england as far in return if it will tell me how ah beware of throwing yourself into the arms of france modestly suggests dickenswell if france will guarantee me those duchies and you will not do anything answers his majesty with a fine laugh england i consider my most natural friend and ally but i must know what there is to depend on there princes are ruled by their interest cannot follow their feelings let me have an explicit answer say at wesel where i am to be on the 24th ten days hence britannic majesty is at hanover and can answer within that time this he twice told me wesel 24th in the course of our interview permit me to recommend the matter to your lordshipmy lord harrington now attending the britannic majesty  during the whole audience adds dickens the king was in extreme good humor and not only heard with attention all the considerations i offered but was not the least offended at any objections i made to what he said it is undoubtedly the best way to behave with frankness to him these last are dickenss own words let them modestly be a memorandum to your lordship this king goes himself direct to the point and straightforwardness as a primary condition will profit your lordship with him dickens in statepaper office 17th august 1740  most true advice thisand would perhaps be followed were it quite easy but things are very complicated and the britannic majesty much plagued with spanish war and parliamentary noises in that unquiet island is doubtless glad to get away to hanover for a little and would fain be on holiday in these fine rural months which is not well possible

perfect leg much to be commendedwhich his majesty knows standing always with one leg slightly advanced and the order of the garter on it that mankind may take notice here is bielfelds description

the new government here i must observe that hitherto the king of prussia does as it were everything himself and that excepting the finance minister von boden who preaches frugality and finds for that doctrine uncommon acceptance almost greater even than in the former reign his majesty allows no counselling from any minister so that herr von podewils who is now the working hand in the department of foreign affairs has nothing given him to do but to expedite the orders he receives from the cabinet his advice not being asked upon any matter and so it is with the other ministers people thought the loss of herr von thulmeyer veteran foreign minister whom we have transiently heard of in the doublemarriage time and perhaps have even seen at london or elsewhere died 4th august rodenbeck p 20 would

excursion not of direct sort into the cleve countries  king friedrich did not quite keep his day at wesel indeed this 24th was not the first day but the last of several he had appointed to himself for finis to that journey in the cleve countries journey rather complex to arrange he has several businesses ahead in those parts and as usual will group them with good judgment and thrift of time not inspections merely but amusements meetings with friends especially french friends the question is how to group them with skill so that the necessary elements may converge at the right moment and one shot kill three or four birds this is friedrichs fine way perceptible in all these journeys the french friends flying each on his own track with his own load of impediments voltaire with his madame for instance are a difficult element in such problem and there has been and is much scheming and corresponding about it within the last month especially  voltaire is now at brussels with his du

to read parts of it with the eyes of friedrich and voltairehas a certain amiability and is nothing like so waste and dreary as it looks in the chaotic or sackedcity condition friedrich writes with brevity oftenest on practicalities the antimachiavel the coming interview and the like evidently no time to spare writes always with considerable sincerity with friendliness much admiration and an ingenuous vivacity to m de voltaire voltaire at his leisure in brussels or the old palace and its spiderwebs writes much more expansively not with insincerity he eitherwith endless airy graciosities

i had plumes himself a little but studies to be modest withal has not much of the peacock and of the turkey has nothing to his old friends all which is very naive and transparent natural and even

respectable books on the opera and other topics are now all forgotten and crave not to be mentioned to me he is not supremely beautiful though much the gentleman in manners as in ruffles and ingeniously logicalrather yellow to me in mind as in skin and with a taint of obsolete venetian macassar but to friedrich he is thricedear who loves the sharp faceted cut of the man and does not

precise account of it two accounts indeed one from the kings own hand will not fail of a certain craving to become acquainted with details this craving foolish rather than wise we consider it

doggerel permissible perhaps as a sample of the friedrich manufacture surely not otherwise there remains yet more than half of it readers see what their foolish craving has brought upon them doggerel out of which no clear story such story as there is can be had though except the exaggeration and contortion there is nothing of fiction in it we fly to the newspaper happily at least a prose composition which begins at this point and shall use the doggerel henceforth as illustration only or as repetition in the friedrichmirror of a thing otherwise made clear to us  having got into strasburg and the raven hotel friedrich now on french ground at last or at least on halffrench germanfrench is intent to make the most of circumstances the landlord with one of friedrichs servants is straightway despatched into the proper coffeehouses to raise a supperparty of officers politely asks any likely officer if he will not do a foreign gentleman seemingly of some distinction signifies boniface the honor to sup with him at the ravenno by jupiter answer the most in their various dialects who is he that we should sup with him three struck by the singularity of the thing undertake and with these we must be content friedrichor call him m le comte dufour with pfuhl schaffgotsch and such escort as we seepolitely apologizes on the entrance of these officers many pardons gentlemen and many thanks knowing nobody desirous of acquaintancesince you are so good how happy by a little informality to have brought brave officers to keep me company whom i value beyond other kinds of men  the officers found their host a most engaging gentleman his supper was superb plenty of wine and one red kind they had never tasted before and liked extremelyof which he sent some bottles to their lodging next day the conversation turned on military matters and was enlivened with the due sallies this foreign count speaks french wonderfully a brilliant man whom the others rather fear perhaps something more than a count the officers loath to go remembered that their two battalions had to parade next morning that it was time to be in bed i will go to your review said the stranger count the delighted officers undertake to come and fetch him they settle with him time and method how happy  on the morrow accordingly they call and fetch him he looks at the review review done they ask him to supper for this evening with pleasure and walks with them about the esplanade to see the guard march by before parting he takes their names writes them in his tablets says with a smile he is too much obliged ever to forget them this is wednesday the 24th of august 1740 fieldmarshal broglio is commandant in strasburg and these obliging officers are of the regiment piedmonttheir names on the kings tablets i never heard mentioned by anybody or never till the kings doggerel was fished up again fieldmarshal broglio my readers have transiently seen afar offgalloping with only one boot some say almost in his shirt at the ford of secchia in those italian campaigns five years ago the austrians having stolen across upon himhe had a furious gallop with no end of ridicule on that occasion is now commandant here and we shall have a great deal more to do with him within the next year or two  this same day 24th while i the newspaper volunteer reporter or own correspondent seemingly a person of some standing whose words carry credibility in the tone of them was with fieldmarshal broglio our governor here there came two gentlemen to be presented to him german cavaliers they were called who i now find must have been the prince of prussia and algarotti the fieldmarshala rather highstalking whiteheaded old military gentleman bordering on seventy of piedmontese air and breed apt to be sudden and make flounderings but the soul of honor was very polite to the two cavaliers and kept them to dinner after dinner there came a sostyled silesian nobleman who likewise was presented to the fieldmarshal and affected not to know the other two him i now find to have been the prince of anhalt  of his majestys supper with the officers that wednesday we are left to think how brilliant it was his majesty we hear farther went to the opera that nightthe polichinello or whatever the italian comodie wasand a little girl came to his box with two lotterytickets fifteen pence each begging the foreign gentleman for the love of heaven to buy them of her which he did tearing them up at once and giving the poor creature four ducats equivalent to two guineas or say in effect even five pounds of the present british currency the fame of this foreign count and his party at the raven is becoming very loud over strasburg especially in military circles our volunteer own correspondent proceeds whom we mean to contrast with the royal doggerel by and by  next morning thursday 25th august as the marshal with above two hundred officers was out walking on the esplanade there came a soldier of the regiment luxemburg who after some stiff fugling motions of the nature of salutation partly and partly demand for privacy intimated to the marshal surprising news that the stranger in the raven was the king of prussia in person he the soldier at present of the regiment luxemburg had in other days before he deserted been of the prussian crownprinces regiment had consequently seen him in berlin potsdam and elsewhere a thousand times and more and even stood sentry where he was the fact is beyond dispute your excellency said this soldierwhew  whereupon a certain colonel marquis de loigle with or without a hint from broglio makes off for the raven introduces himself as was easy contrives to get invited to stay dinner which also was easy during dinner the foreign gentleman expressed some wish to see their fortress colonel loigle sends word to broglio broglio despatches straightway an officer and fine carriage will the foreign gentleman do me the honor the foreign gentleman still struggling for incognito declines the uppermost seat of honor in the carriage the two officers loigle and this new one insist on taking the inferior place alas the incognito is pretty much out calling at some coffeehouse or the like on the road a certain female madame de fienne named the foreign gentleman sirewhich so startled him that though he utterly declined such title the two officers saw well how it was  after survey of the works the two attendant officers had returned to the fieldmarshal and about 4 pm the high stranger made appearance there but the thing had now got wind king of prussia here incognito the place was full of officers who came crowding about him he escaped deftly into the marechals own cabinet sat there an hour talking to the marechal little admiring the marechals talk as we shall find still insisting on the incognitoto which broglio put out in his high paces by this sudden thing and apt to flounder as i have heard was not polite enough to conform altogether what shall i do in this sudden case poor broglio is thinking to himself must write to court perhaps try to detain friedriohs chief thought naturally is one cannot be away out of this too soon shant we go to the play then monsieur le marechal playhour is comeown correspondent of the newspaper proceeds  the marechal then went to the play and all his officers with him thinking their royal prize was close at their heels marechal and officers fairly ahead coast once clear their royal prize hastened back to the raven paid his bill hastily summoning schaffgotsch and the others within hearing shot off like lightning and was seen in strasburg no more algarotti who was in the box with broglio heard the news in the house regretful rumor among the officers he is gone in about a quarter of an hour algarotti too slipped out and vanished by extra poststraight towards wesel but could not overtake the king whose road in the latter part of it went zigzag on business as is likely nor see him again till they met in that town from heldengeschichte i 420424 c  this is the prose truth of those fifty or eightandforty hours in strasburg which were so mythic and romantic at that time shall we now apply to the royal doggerel again where we left off and see the other side of the picture once settled in the raven within strasburgs walls the doggerel continues  you fancy well that there was now something to exercise my curiosity and what desire i had to know the french nation in france itself       there i saw at length those french      of whom you have sung the glories      a people despised by the

as you would a staccato on the flute by him in after months on new occasion rising there was no end to his gibings and bitter pleasantries on the ridiculous reception broglio had given him at

straggle of pungent sense in itlike the outskirts of lightning seen in that dismally wet weather which the royal party had its wit is very copious but slashy bantery and proceeds mainly by exaggeration and turning topsyturvy a rather barren species of wit of humor in the fine poetic sense no vestige but there is surprising veracitytruthfulness unimpeachable if you will read well what promptitude toowhat funds for conversation when needed this scraggy piece which is better than the things people often talk to one another was evidently written as fast as the pen could goit is done if such a hand could have done it in the manner of bachaumont and la chapelle says voltaire scornfully in that scandalous vie priveeof which phrase this is the commentary if readers need one  some seventy or eighty years before that date a m bachaumont and a m la chapelle his intimate published in prose skipping off into dancings of verse every now and then a charming relation of a certain voyage or home tour whence or whither or correctly when this editor forgets first printed in 1665 say the bibliographies but known to la fontaine some time before goodbachaumont practically an important and distinguished person not literary by trade or indeed otherwise than by ennui was he that had given some fifteen years before the nickname fronde bickering of schoolboys to the wretched historical object which is still so designated in french annals which they had made in partnership relation capable still of being read if one were tolerably idleit was found then to be charming by all the world and gave rise to a new fashion in writing which voltaire often adopts and is supremely good at and in which friedrich who is also fond of it by no means succeeds so well  enough friedrich got to wesel back to his business in a day or two and had done as we forever have with the strasburg escapade and its doggerel     friedrich finds m de maupertuis not yet m de voltaire  friedrich got to wesel on the 29th found maupertuis waiting there according to appointment an elaborately polite somewhat sublime scientific gentleman ready to engraft on the berlin crabtree and produce real apples and academics there so soon as the king the proprietor may have leisure for such a thing algarotti has already the honor of some acquaintance with maupertuis maupertuis has been at brussels on the road hither saw voltaire and even madamewhich latter was rather a ticklish operation owing to grudges and tiffs of quarrel that had risen but it proved successful under the delicate guidance of voltaire voltaire is up to oiling the wheels there you are monsieur like the dont name what though profane voltaire does writing to maupertuis a month agothree kings running after you a

no reader guesses in our time what a shining celestial body the maupertuis who is now fallen so dim again then was to mankind in cultivated french society there is no such lion as m maupertuis since he returned from flattening the earth in the arctic regions the exact sciences what else is there to depend on thinks french cultivated society and has not monsieur done a feat in that line monsieur with fine exmilitary manners has a certain austere gravity reticent loftiness and polite dogmatism which confirms that opinion a studious exmilitary manwas captain of dragoons once but too fond of studywho is conscious to himself or who would fain be conscious that he is in all points mathematical moral and other the man a difficult man to live with in society comes really near the limit of what we call genius of originality poetic greatness in thinkingbut never once can get fairly over said limit though always struggling dreadfully to do so think of it a fatal kind of man especially if you have made a lion of him at any time of his envies deephidden splenetic discontents and rages with voltaires return for them there will be enough to say in the ulterior stages he wearsat least ten years hence he openly wears though i hope it is not yet so flagranta red wig with yellow bottom criniere jaune and as flattener of the earth is with his own flattish red countenance and impregnable stony eyes a man formidable to look upon though intent to be amiable if you do the proper homage as to the quarrel with madame take this note which may prove illustrative of some things by and by  maupertuis is well known at cirey such a lion could not fail there all manner of bernouillis clairauts high mathematical people are frequent guests at cirey reverenced by madamewho indeed has had her own private professor of mathematics one konig from switzerland recommended by those bernouillis diligently teaching her the pure sciences this good while back not without effect and has only just parted with him when she left on this brussels expedition a bon garcon voltaire says though otherwise i think a little noisy on occasion there has been no end of madames kindness to him nay to his brother and himsons of a theological professorial syriachebrew kind of man at berne who has too many sonsand i grieve to report that this heedless konig has produced an explosion in madames feelings such as little beseemed him on the road to paris namely as we drove hitherward to the honsbruck lawsuit by way of paris in autumn last there had fallen out some dispute about the monads the vis viva

thoughtless fellow who is still rather young and is without malice but thoughtless konig strong in his opinion about the infinitely little appealed to maupertuis am not i right monsieur he is right beyond question wrote maupertuis to madame somewhat dryly thinks voltaire and the result is there is considerable rage in one celestial mind ever since against another male one in red wig and yellow bottom and they are not on speaking terms for a good many months past voltaire has his heart sore jen ai le coeur perce about it needs to doubledose maupertuis with flattery and in fact has used the utmost diplomacy to effect some varnish of a reconcilement as maupertuis passed on this occasion as for konig who had studied in some dutch university he went by and by to be librarian to the prince

feverish distemper which for several months after impeded his movements would he have yielded to it he has much business on hand toosome of it of prickly nature just nowbut is intent as ever on seeing voltaire among the first things diligently reading in the voltairefriedrich correspondence which is a sad jumble of misdates and opacities in the common editions preuss the recent latest editor and the only wellinformed one as we said prints with accuracy but cannot be read at all in the sense of understood without other light this of the aguish condition frequently turns up quartan ague it seems occasionally very bad but friedrich struggles with it will not be cheated of any of his purposes by it  he had a busy fortnight here busier than we yet imagine much employment there naturally is of the usual inspection sort which fails in no quarter of his dominions but which may be particularly important here in these disputed bergjulich countries when the time of decision falls how he does his inspections we knowand there are still weightier matters afoot here in a silent way of which we shall have to speak before long and all the world will speak business enough parts of it grave and silent going on and the much that is public miscellaneous small done all of it in a rapidpunctual precise mannerand always after the crowded day some passages of supper with the sages to wind up with on melodious terms a most alert and miscellaneously busy young king in spite of the ague  it was in these cleve countries and now as probably as afterwards that the light scene recorded in laveauxs poor history and in all the anecdotebooks transacted itself one day substance of the story is true though the details of it go all at randomsomewhat to this effect  inspecting his finance affairs and questioning the parties interested friedrich notices a certain convent in cleve which appears to have payable from the forestdues considerable revenues bequeathed by the old dukes for masses to be said on their behalf he goes to look at the place questions the monks on this point who are all drawn out in two rows and have broken into tedeum at sight of him husht you still say those masses then certainly your majestyand what good does anybody get of them your majesty those old sovereigns are to obtain heavenly mercy by them to be delivered out of purgatory by thempurgatory it is a sore thing for the forests all this while and they are not yet out those poor souls after so many hundred years of praying monks have a fatal apprehension no when will they be out and the thing complete monks

included in this hildebrandt collection are of sure authenticity the rest occasionally true and often with a kind of mythic truth in them worth attending to are otherwise of all degrees of dubiety down to the palpably false and absurd  mournful state of the catholic religion so called how long must these wretched monks go on doing their lazy thricedeleterious torpid blasphemy and a king not histrionic but real merely signify that he laughs at them and it meseems a heavier whip than that of satire might be in place here your majesty the lighter whip is easierah yes undoubtedly cry many men but horrible accounts are running up enough to sink the world at last while the heavier whip is lazily withheld and lazy blasphemy fallen torpid chronic and quite unconscious of being blasphemous insinuates itself into the very heartsblood of mankind patience however the heavy whip too is comingunless universal death be coming king friedrich is not the man to wield such whip quite other work is in store for king friedrich and nature will not by any suggestion of that terrible task put him out in the one he has he is nothing of a luther of a cromwell can look upon fakirs praying by their rotatory calabash as a ludicrous platitude and grin delicately as above with the approval of his wiser contemporaries speed to him on his own course  what answer friedrich found to his english proposalsanswer due here on the 24th from captain dickensi do not pointedly learn but can judge of it by harringtons reply to that despatch of dickenss which entreated candor and open dealing towards his prussian majesty harrington is at herrenhausen still with the britannic majesty there both of them much at a loss about their spanish war and the french and other aspects upon it suppose his prussian majesty were to give himself to france against us we will hope not harringtons reply is to the effect hum drumberg and julich say you impossible to answer minds not made up herewhat will his prussian majesty do for us not much i should guess till something more categorical come from you his prussian majesty is careful not to spoil anything by overhaste but will wait and try farther to the utmost whether england or france is the likelier bargain for him  better still the prussian majesty is intent to do something for himself in that bergjulich matter we find him silently examining these wesel localities for a proper entrenched camp camp say of 40000 against a certain contingency that may be looked for camp which will much occupy the gazetteers when they get eye on it this is one of the concerns he silently attends to on occasion while riding about in the cleve countries then there is another small item of business important to do well which is now in silence diligently getting under way at wesel which also is of remarkable nature and will astonish the gazetteer and diplomatic circles this is the affair with the bishop of liege called also the affair of herstal which his majesty has had privately laid up in the corner of his mind as a thing to be done during this excursion of which the reader shall hear anon to great lengthswere a certain small preliminary matter voltaires arrival in these parts once off our hands  friedrichs first meeting with voltaire these other high things were once loud in the gazetteer and diplomatic circles and had no doubt they were

were not yet of the argus quality now familiar to us have been intent on friedrich during this baireuthcleve journey especially since that sudden eclipse of him at strasburg lately forming now one scheme of route for him now another newspapers and even private friends being a good deal uncertain about his movements rumor now ran since his reappearance in the cleve countries that friedrich meant to have a look at holland before going home and that had in fact been a notion or intention of friedrichs holland we could pass through brussels on the way and see voltaire thought he  in brussels

have to yield to the quartan fever which is more tenacious than a jansenist and whatever desire i had of going to antwerp and brussels i find myself not in a condition to undertake such a journey without risk i would ask of you then if the road from brussels to cleve would not to you seem too long for a meeting it is the one means of seeing you which remains to me confess that i am unlucky for now when i could dispose of my person and nothing hinders me from seeing you the fever gets its hand into the business and seems to intend disputing me that satisfaction  let us deceive the fever my dear voltaire and let me at least have the pleasure of embracing you make my best excuses polite rather than sincere to madame the marquise that i cannot have the satisfaction of seeing her at brussels all that are about me know the intention i was in which certainly nothing but the fever could have made me change  sunday next i shall be at a little place near cleveschloss of moyland which

2d form of himthat is vie de voltaire par t j d v p 117     what voltaire thought of the interview twenty years afterwards  of the interview itself with general birdseye view of the visit combined in a very incorrect state there is direct testimony by voltaire himself voltaire himself twenty years after in far other humor all jarred into angry sarcasm for causes we shall see by and byvoltaire at the request of friends writes down as his friedrich reminiscences that scandalous vie privee above spoken of a most sad document and this is the passage referring to the little place in the neighborhood of cleve where friedrich now waited for him errors corrected by our laborious friend after quoting something of that strasburg doggerel the whole of which is now too well known to us voltaire proceeds  from strasburg he king friedrich went to see his lower german provinces he said he would come and see me incognito at brussels we prepared a fine house for himwere ready to prepare such hired house as we had for him with many apologies for its slight degree of perfection error firstbut having fallen ill in the little mansionroyal of meuse chateau de meuse a couple of leagues from clevefell ill at wesel and there is no chateau de meuse in the world errors 2d and 3dhe wrote to me that he expected i would make the advances i went accordingly to present my profound homages maupertuis who already had his views and was possessed with the rage of being president to an academy had of his own accordno being invited and at my suggestion error 4thpresented himself there and was lodged with algarotti and keyserling which latter i suppose had come from berlin not being of the strasburg party he in a garret of this palace  at the door of the court i found by way of guard one soldier privycouncillor rambonet minister of statevery subaltern man never heard of him except in the herstal business and here was walking in the court blowing in his fingers to keep them warm sunday night 11th september 1740 world all bathed in moonshine and mortals mostly shrunk into their huts out of the raw air he rambonet wore big linen ruffles at his wrists very dirty visibly so in the moonlight error 5th extends ad libitum over all the following details a holed hat an old official periwigruined into a totally unsymmetric state as would seemone side of which hung down into one of his pockets and the other scarcely crossed his shoulder i was told this man was now intrusted with an affair of importance here and that proved truethe herstal affair  i was led into his majestys apartment nothing but four bare walls there by the light of a candle i perceived in a closet a little trucklebed two feet and a half broad on which lay a man muffled up in a dressinggown of coarse blue duffel this was the king sweating and shivering under a wretched blanket there in a violent fit of fever i made my reverence and began the acquaintance by feeling his pulse as if i had been his chief physician the fit over he dressed himself and took his place at table algarotti keyserling maupertuis and the kings envoy to the statesgeneralone rasfeld skilled in herstal matters i could guesswe were of this supper and discussed naturally in a profound manner the immortality of the soul liberty fate the androgynes of plato the androgynoi or menwomen in platos convivium by no means the finest symbolic fancy of the divine platoand other small topics of that nature voltaire oeuvres piece once called vie privee ii 26 27  this is voltaires account of the visitwhich included three suppers all huddled into one by him hereand he says nothing more of it launching off now into new errors about herstal the antimachiavel and so forth new and uglier errors with much more of mendacity and serious malice in them than in this harmless halfdozen now put on the score against him  of this supperparty i know by face four of the guests maupertuis voltaire algarotti keyserlingrasfeld rambonet can sit as simulacra or mute accompaniment voltaire arrived on sunday evening stayed till wednesday wednesday morning 14th of the month the party broke up voltaire rolling off to left hand towards brussels or the hague king to right on inspection business and circuitously homewards three suppers there had been two busy days intervening discussions about fate and the androgynoi of plato by no means the one thing done by voltaire and the rest on this occasion we shall find elsewhere he declaimed his mahomet sublime new tragedy not yet come out in the course of these three evenings to the speechless admiration of his royal host for one and in the daytime that he even drew his pen about the herstal business which is now getting to its crisis and wrote one of the manifestoes still discoverable and we need not doubt in spite of his now sneering tone that things ran high and grand here in this paltry little schloss of moyland and that those three were actually suppers of the gods for the time being  councillor rambonet with the holed hat and unsymmetric wig continues voltaire in the satirical vein had meanwhile mounted a hired hack cheval de louage mischievous voltaire i have no doubt he went on wheels probably of his own he rode all night and next morning arrived at the gates of liege where he took act in the name of the king his master whilst 2000 men of the wesel troops laid liege under contribution the pretext of this fine marching of troopsnot a pretext at all but the assertion correct in all points of just claims long trodden down and now made good with more spirit than had been expectedwas certain rights which the king pretended to over a suburb of liege he even charged me to work at a manifesto and i made one good or bad not doubting but a king with whom i supped and who called me his friend must be in the right the affair soon settled itself by means of a million of ducatsnothing like the sum as we shall seewhich he exacted by weight to clear the costs of the tour to strasburg which according to his complaint in that poetic letter doggerel above given were so heavy  that is voltaires view grown very corrosive after twenty years he admits with all the satire i naturally felt myself attached to him for he had wit graces and moreover he was a king which always forms a potent seduction so weak is human nature usually it is we of the writing sort that flatter kings but this king praised me from head to foot while the abbe desfontaines and other scoundrels gredins were busy defaming me in paris at least once a week     what voltaire thought of the interview at the time  but let us take the contemporary account which also we have at first hand which is almost pathetic to read such a contrast between ruddy morning and the storms of the afternoon here are two letters from voltaire fine transparent human letters as his generally are the first of them written directly on getting back to the hague and to the feeling of his eclipsed condition  voltaire to m de maupertuis with the king the hague 18th september 1740  i serve you monsieur sooner than i promised and that is the way you ought to be served i send you the answer of m smithprobably some german or dutch schmidt spelt here in english connected with the sciences say with watercarriage the typographies or one need not know what you will see where the

one cideville a month later all the more genuine as there was no chance of the kings hearing about this one cideville some kind of literary advocate at rouen who is wearisomely known to the reader of voltaires letters had done what is rather an endemical disorder at this time some verses for the king of prussia which he wished to be presented to his majesty the presentation owing to accidents did not take place hear how voltaire from his cobweb palace at the hague busy with antimachiavel van duren and many other things18th october 1740 on which day we find him writing many lettersexplains the sad accident  voltaire to m de cideville at rouen  at the hague king of prussias palace 18th october 1740   this is my case dear cideville when you sent me enclosed in your letter those verses among which there are some of charming and inimitable turn for our marcus aurelius of the north i did well design to pay my court to him with them he was at that time to have come to brussels incognito we expected him there but the quartan fever which unhappily he still has deranged all his projects he sent me a courier to brusselsmark that point my cidevilleand so i set out to find him in the neighborhood of cleve  it was there i saw one of the amiablest men in the world who forms the charm of society who would be everywhere sought after if he were not king a philosopher without austerity full of sweetness complaisance and obliging ways agremens not remembering that he is king when he meets his friends indeed so completely forgetting it that he made me too almost forget it and i needed an effort of memory to recollect that i here saw sitting at the foot of my bed a sovereign who had an army of 100000 men that was the moment to have read your amiable verses to himyes but thenmadame du chatelet who was to have sent them to me did not ne la pa fait alas no they are still at brussels those charming verses and i for a month past am here in my cobweb palace but i swear to you the instant i return to brussels i c c voltaire lxii 282  finally here is what friedrich thought of it ten days after parting with voltaire we will read this also though otherwise ahead of us as yet to be certified on all sides and sated for the rest of our lives concerning the friedrichvoltaire first interview  king friedrich to m jordan at berlin  potsdam 24th september 1740  most respectable inspector of the poor the invalids orphans crazy people and bedlamsi have read with mature meditation the very profound jordanic letter which was waiting hereand do accept your learned proposal  i have seen that voltaire whom i was so curious to know but i saw him with the quartan hanging on me and my mind as unstrung as my body with men of his kind one ought not to be sick one ought even to be specially well and in better health than common if one could  he has the eloquence of cicero the mildness of pliny the wisdom of agrippa he combines in short what is to be collected of virtues and talents from the three greatest men of antiquity his intellect is at work incessantly every drop of ink is a trait of wit from his pen he declaimed his mahomet to us an admirable tragedy which he has donewhich the official people smelling heresies in it toleration horrors of fanaticism and the like will not let him act as readers too well knowhe transported us out of ourselves i could only admire and hold my tongue the du chatelet is lucky to have him for of the good things he flings out at random a person who had no faculty but memory might make a brilliant book that minerva has just published her work on physics not wholly bad it was konigwhom we know and whose late tempest in a certain teapotthat dictated the theme to her she has adjusted ornamented here and there with some touch picked from voltaire at her suppers the chapter on space is pitiable thein short she is still raw in the pure sciences and should have waited  adieu most learned most scientific most profound jordanor rather most gallant most amiable most jovial jordani salute thee with assurance of all those old feelings which thou hast the art of inspiring in every one that knows thee vale  i write the moment of my arrival be obliged to me friend for i have been working i am going to work still like a turk or like a jordan oeuvres de frederic xvii 71  this is hastily thrown off for friend jordan the instant after his majestys circuitous return home readers cannot yet attend his majesty there till they have brought the affair of herstal and other remainders of the cleve journey along with them    chapter v  affair of herstal  this rambonet whom voltaire found walking in the court of the old castle of moyland is an official gentleman otherwise unknown to history who has lately been engaged in a public affair and is now off again about it on a hired hack or otherwisewith very good instructions in his head affair which though in itself but small is now beginning to make great noise in the world as friedrich wends homewards out of his cleve journey he has set it fairly alight voltaire and he before quitting moyland and now it will go of itself the affair of herstal or of the bishop of liege friedrichs first appearance on the stage of politics concerning which some very brief notice if intelligible will suffice readers of the present day  heristal now called herstal was once a castle known to all mankind king pipins castle who styled himself pipin of heristal before he became king of the franks and begot charlemagne it lies on the maas in that fruitful spa country left bank of the maas a little to the north of liege and probably began existence as a grander place than liege luttich which was at first some monastery dependent on secular herstal and its grandeursthink only how the race has gone between these two entities spiritual liege now a big city black with the smoke of forges and steammills herstal an insignificant village accidentally talked of for a few weeks in 1740 and no chance ever to be mentioned again by men  herstal in the confused vicissitudes of a thousand years had passed through various fortunes and undergone change of owners often enough fifty years ago it was in the hands of the nassauorange house dutch william our english protestant king who probably scarce knew of his possessing it was lord of herstal till his death dutch william had no children to inherit herstal he was of kinship to the prussian house as readers are aware and from that circumstance not without a great deal of discussion and difficult division of the orange heritage this herstal had at the long last fallen to friedrich wilhelms share it and neuchatel and the cobweb palace and some other places and pertinents  for dutch william was of kin we say friedrich i of prussia by his mother the noble wife of the great elector was full cousin to dutch william and the marriage contracts were expressthough the high mightinesses made difficulties and the collateral orange branches were abundantly reluctant when it came to the fulfilling point for indeed the matter was intricate orange itself for example what was to be done with the principality of orange clearly prussias but it lies imbedded deep in the belly of france that will be a caesareanoperation for you had not neuchatel happened just then to fall home to france or in some measure to france and be heirless prussias heritage of orange would have done little for prussia principality of orange was by this chance long since mainly in the first kings time got settled neuchatel 3d november 1707 to friedrich i natives preferring him to fifteen other claimants louis xiv loudly protesting not till treaty of utrecht 14th march 1713 first month of friedrich wilhelms reign would louis xiv on cession of orange consent and sanction but there needed many years more of good waiting and of good pushing on friedrich wilhelms part and it was not till 1732 that friedrich wilhelm got the dutch heritages finally brought to the square neuchatel and valengin as aforesaid in lieu of orange and now furthermore the old palace at loo that vieille cour and biggest cobwebs with pertinents with garden of honslardik and a string of items bigger and less not worth enumerating of the items this herstal was oneand truly so far as this went friedrich wilhelm often thought he had better never have seen it so much trouble did it bring him     how the herstallers had behaved to friedrich wilhelm  the herstal people knowing the prussian recruiting system and other rigors were extremely unwilling to come under friedrich wilhelms sway could they have helped it they refused fealty swore they never would swear nor did they till the appearance or indubitable foreshine of friedrich wilhelms bayonets advancing on them from the east brought compliance and always after spite of such quasifealty they showed a piglike obstinacy of humor a certain insignificant and as it were impertinent deeprooted desire to thwart irritate and contradict the said friedrich wilhelm especially in any recruiting matter that might arise knowing that to be the weak side of his prussian majesty all this would have amounted to nothing had it not been that their neighbor the prince bishop of liege who imagined himself to have some obscure claims of sovereignty over herstal and thought the present a good opportunity for asserting these was diligent to aid and abet the herstal people in such their mutinous acts obscure claims of which this is the summary should the reader not prefer to skip it  the bishop of lieges claims on herstal which lie wrapt from mankind in the extensive jungle of his lawpleadings like a bedlam happily fallen extinct seem to me to have grown mainly from two facts more or less radical  fact first in kaiser barbarossas time year 1171 herstal had been given in pawn to the church of liege for a loan by the then proprietor duke of lorraine and brabant loan was repaid i do not learn when and the pawn given back to the satisfaction of said duke or dukes heirs never quite to the satisfaction of the church which had been in possession and was loath to quit after hoping to continue give us back herstal it ought to be ours unappeasable sigh or grumble to this effect is heard thenceforth at intervals in the chapter of liege and has not ceased in friedrichs time but as the world in its loud thoroughfares seldom or never heard or could hear such sighing in the chapter nothing had come of ittill  fact second in kaiser karl vs time the prince bishop of liege happened to be a natural son of old kaiser maxsand had friends at headquarters of a very choice nature had namely in this sort kaiser karl for nephew or halfnephew and what perhaps was still better as nearer hand had karls aunt maria queen of hungary then governess of the netherlands for halfsister liege in these choice circumstances and by other good chances that turned up again got temporary clutch or halfclutch of herstal for a couple of years date 15461548 the prince of orange real proprietor whose ancestor had bought it for money down being then a minor once and perhaps a second time in like circumstance but had always to renounce it again when the prince of orange came to maturity and ever since the chapter of liege sighs as before herstal is perhaps in a sense ours we had once some kind of right to itsigh inaudible in the loud public thoroughfares that is the bishops claim the name of him if anybody care for it is georg ludwig titular count of berg now a very old man bishop of liege he and has been snatching at herstal again very eagerly by any skirt or tagrag that might happen to fly loose these eight years past in a rash and provoking manner delices du pais de liege liege 1738 heldengeschichte ii 5762age eightytwo at present poor old fool he had better have sat quiet there lies a rod in pickle for him during these late months and will be surprisingly laid on were the time come  i have law authority over herstal and power of judging there in the last appeal said this bishopyou thought friedrich wilhelm who was far off and had little time to wasteany prussian recruiter that behaves ill bring him to me said the bishop who was on the spot and accordingly it had been done one notable instance two years ago a prussian lieutenant locked in the liege jail on complaint of riotous herstal thereupon a prussian officer of rank colonel kreutzen worthy old malplaquet gentleman coming as royal messenger not admitted to audience nay laid hold of by the liege bailiff instead and other unheardof procedures heldengeschichte ii 6373 so that friedrich wilhelm had nothing but trouble with this petty herstal and must have thought his neighbor bishop a very contentious highflying gentleman who took great liberties with the lions whiskers when he had the big animal at an advantage  the episcopal procedures eight years ago about the first homaging of herstal had been of similar complexion nor had other such failed in the interim though this last outrage exceeded them all this last began in the end of 1738 and span itself out through 1739 when friedrich wilhelm lay in his final sickness less able to deal with it than formerly being a peaceable man unwilling to awaken conflagrations for a small matter friedrich wilhelm had offered through kreutzen on this occasion to part with herstal altogether to sell it for 100000 thalers say 16000 pounds to the highflying bishop and honestly wash his hands of it but the highflying bishop did not consent gave no definite answer and so the matter laylike an unsettled extremely irritating paltry little matterat the time friedrich wilhelm died  the gazetteers and public knew little about these particulars or had forgotten them again but at the prussian court they were in lively remembrance what the young friedrichs opinion about them had been we gather from this succinct notice of the thing written seven or eight years afterwards exact in all points and still carrying a breath of the old humor in it a miserable bishop of liege thought it a proud thing to insult the late king some subjects of herstal which belongs to prussia had revolted the bishop gave them his protection colonel kreutzen was sent to liege to compose the thing by treaty credentials with him full power and all in order imagine it the bishop would not receive him three days day after day he saw this envoy apply at his palace and always denied him entrance these things had grown past endurance preuss oeuvres memoires de brandebourg end ii 53 and friedrich had taken note of herstal along with him on this cleve journey privately intending to put herstal and the highflying bishop on a suitabler footing before his return from those countries  for indeed on friedrichs accession matters had grown worse not better of course there was fealty to be sworn but the herstal people abetted by the highflying bishop have declined swearing it apology for the past prospect of amendment for the future there is less than ever what is the young king to do with this paltry little hamlet of herstal he could in theory go into some reichshofrath some reichskammergericht kind of treble and tenfold english courtofchancery which has lawsuits 250 years oldif he were a theoretic german king he can plead in the diets and the wetzlar reichskammergericht without end all german sovereigns have power to send their ambassador thither who is like a mastiff chained in the backyard observes friedrich elsewhere with privilege of barking at the moonunrestricted privilege of barking at the moon if that will avail a practical man or kings ambassador or perhaps the bishop of liege will bethink him at last what considerable liberty he is taking with some peoples whiskers four months are gone bishop of liege has not in the least bethought him we are in the neighborhood in person with note of the thing in our memory     friedrich takes the rod out of pickle  accordingly the rath rambonet whom voltaire found at moyland that sunday night had been over at liege went exactly a week before with this message of very peremptory tenor from his majesty  to the prince bishop of liege  wesel 4th september 1740  my cousinknowing all the assaults atteintes made by you upon my indisputable rights over my free barony of herstal and how the seditious ringleaders there for several years past have been countenanced bestarket by you in their detestable acts of disobedience against mei have commanded my privy councillor rambonet to repair to your presence and in my name to require from you within two days a distinct and categorical answer to this question whether you are still minded to assert your pretended sovereignty over herstal and whether you will protect the rebels at herstal in their disorders and abominable disobedience  in case you refuse or delay beyond the term the answer which i hereby of right demand you will render

 rambonet had started straightway for liege with this missive and had duly presented it there i guess on the 7thwith notice that he would wait fortyeight hours and then return with what answer or noanswer there might be getting no written answer or distinct verbal one getting only some vague mumblement as good as none rambonet had disappeared from liege on the 9th and was home at moyland when voltaire arrived that sunday eveningjust walking about to come to heat again after reporting progress to the above effect  rambonet i judge enjoyed only one of those divine suppers at moyland and dashed off again on hired hack or otherwise the very next morning that contingency of noanswer having been the anticipated one and all things put in perfect readiness for it rambonets new errand was to take act as voltaire calls it at the gates of liegeto deliver at liege a succinct manifesto pair of manifestoes both in print ready beforehand and bearing date that same sunday wesel 11th september much calculated to amaze his reverence at liege succinct good manifestoes said to be of friedrichs own writing the essential of the two is this  exposition of the reasons which have induced his majesty the king of prussia to make just reprisals on the prince bishop of liege  his majesty the king of prussia being driven beyond bounds by the rude proceedings of the prince bishop of liege has with regret seen himself forced to recur to the method of arms in order to repress the violence and affront which the bishop has attempted to put upon him this resolution has cost his majesty much pain the rather as he is by principle and disposition far remote from whatever could have the least relation to rigor and severity  but seeing himself compelled by the bishop of liege to take new methods he had no other course but to maintain the justice of his rights la justice de ses droits and demand reparation for the indignity done upon his minister von kreuzen as well as for the contempt with which the bishop of liege has neglected even to answer the letter of the king  as too much rigor borders upon cruelty so too much patience resembles weakness thus although the king would willingly have sacrificed his interests to the public peace and tranquillity it was not possible to do so in reference to his honor and that is the chief motive which has determined him to this resolution so contrary to his intentions  in vain has it been attempted by methods of mildness to come to a friendly agreement it has been found on the contrary that the kings moderation only increased the princes arrogance that mildness of conduct on one side only furnished resources to pride on the other and that in fine instead of gaining by soft procedure one was insensibly becoming an object of vexation and disdain  there being no means to have justice but in doing it for oneself and the king being sovereign enough for such a dutyhe intends to make the prince of liege feel how far he was in the wrong to abuse such moderation so unworthily but in spite of so much unhandsome behavior on the part of this prince the king will not be inflexible satisfied with having shown the said prince that he can punish him and too just to overwhelm him frederic wesel september 11th 1740 heldengeschichte ii 77 said to be by friedrich himself stenzel iv 59  whether rambonet insinuated his paperpacket into the palace of seraing left it at the gate of liege fixed by nail if he saw good or in what manner he took act i never knew and indeed rambonet vanishes from human history at this point it is certain only that he did his formality say two days henceand that the fact foreshadowed by it is likewise in the same hours hour after hour getting steadily done  for the manifestoes printed beforehand dated wesel 11th september were not the only thing ready at wesel waiting as on the slip for the contingency of noanswer majorgeneral borck with the due battalions squadrons and equipments was also ready majorgeneral borck the same who was with us at baireuth lately had just returned from that journey when he got orders to collect 2000 men horse and foot with the due

readers already know does not write or speak farther on the subject and readers and he may consider the herstal affair thus set agoing under borcks auspices as in effect finished and that his majesty has left it on a satisfactory footing and may safely turn his back on it to wait the sure issue at berlin before long     what voltaire thought of herstal  voltaire told us he himself did one

till i pulled him straight and it is evident beautifully so your majesty how voltaire busied himself in the gazettes and diplomatic circles setting friedrichs case right voltaire very loyal to friedrich and his liege cause at that timeand the contrast between what his contemporary letters say on the subject and what his ulterior pasquil called vie privee says is again great  the dull stagnant world shaken awake by this liege adventure gives voice variously and in the gazetteer and diplomatic circles it is much criticised by no means everywhere in the favorable tone at this first blush of the business he had written an antimachiavel says the abbe st pierre and even says voltaire in the pasquil not the contemporary letters and he acts thus truly he does monsieur de voltaire and all men with light upon the subject or even with the reverse upon it must make their criticisms for the rest borcks 2000 arguments are there which borck handles well with polite calm rigor by degrees the dust will fall and facts everywhere be seen for what they are  as to the highflying bishop finding that hysterics are but wasted on friedrich and borck and produce no effect with their 2000 validities he flies next to the kaiser to the imperial diet in shrillsounding latin obtestations of which we already gave a flying snatch your humilissimus and fidelissimus vassallus and most

dilection to know therefore that you must straightway withdraw those troops which have broken into the liege territory make speedy restitution of all that has been extortedespecially general von borck

after he ate too many mushroomsand immense results followed  dehortatoriums had their interest at berlin and elsewhere for the diplomatic circles but did not produce the least effect on borck or friedrich though friedrich noted the kaisers manner in these things and thought privately to himself as was evident to the discerning what an amount of wig on that old gentleman a notable kaisers ambassador herr botta who had come with some accession compliments in these weeks was treated slightingly by friedrich hardly admitted to audience and friedrichs public reply to the last dehortatorium had almost something of sarcasm in it evil counsellors yourself most dread kaiser it is you that are misled by counsellors who might chance to set germany on fire were others as unwise as they which latter phrase was remarkable to mankindthere is a long account already run up between that old gentleman with his seckendorfs grumkows with his dull insolencies wiggeries and this young gentleman who has nearly had his heart broken and his fathers house driven mad by them borck remains at his post rations duly delivered and fifty louis a day for his own private expenses and there is no answer to the kaiser or in sharp brief terms about chances of setting germany on fire rather worse than none  readers see as well as friedrich did what the upshot of this affair must bewe will now finish it off and wash our hands of it before following his majesty to berlin the poor bishop had applied shrieking to the french for helpand there came some colloquial passages between voltaire and fenelon if that were a result he had shrieked in like manner to the dutch but without result of any kind traceable in that quarter nowhere except from the kaiser is so much as a dehortatorium to be got whereupon the once highflying now vainly shrieking bishop discerns clearly that there is but one course leftthe course which has lain wide open for some years past had not his flight gone too high for seeing it before three weeks are over seeing how dehortatoriums go he sends his ambassadors to berlin his apologies proposals ambassadors arrived 28th september last dehortatorium not yet out business was completed 20th october rodenbeck in diebus would not your majesty perhaps consent to sell this herstal as your father of glorious memory was pleased to be willing once  friedrich answers straightway to the effect certainly pay me the price it was once already offered for 100000 thalers plus the expenses since incurred that will be 180000 thalers besides what you have spent already on general borcks days wages to which we will add that wretched little fraction of old debt clear as noon but never paid nor any part of it 60000 thalers due by the see of liege ever since the treaty of utrecht 60000 for which we will charge no interest that will make 240000 thalers36000 pounds instead of the old sum you might have had it at produce that cash and take herstal and all the dust that has risen out of it well home with you stenzel iv 60 who counts in gulden and is not distinct the bishop thankfully complies in all points negotiation speedily done 20th oct the final date bishop has not i think quite so much cash on hand but will pay all he has and 4 per centum interest till the whole be liquidated his ambassadors get gold snuffboxes and return mildly glad  and thus in some six weeks after borcks arrival in those parts borcks function is well done the noise of gazettes and diplomatic circles lays itself again and herstal famous once for king pipin and famous again for king friedrich lapses at length into obscurity which we hope will never end hopethough who can say roucoux quite close upon it becomes a battleground in some few years and memorabilities go much at random in this world     chapter vi  returns by hanover does not call on his royal uncle there  friedrich spent ten days on his circuitous journey home considerable inspection to be done in minden magdeburg not to speak of other businesses he had the old newspapers are still more intent upon him now that the herstal affair has broken into flame especially the english newspapers who guess that there are passages of courtship going on between great george their king and him here is one fact correct in every point for the old london public letters from hanover say that the king of prussia passed within a small distance of that city the 16th inst ns on his return to berlin but did not stop at herrenhausenabout which there has been such hoping and speculating among us lately daily post 22d september 1740 other london newspapers from july 31st downwards a fact which the extinct editor seems to meditate for a day or two after which he says partly in italics opening his lips the second time like a friar bacons head significant to the public letters from hanover tell us that the interview which it was said his majesty was to have with the king of prussia did not take place for certain private reasons which our correspondent leaves us to guess at  it is well known friedrich did not love his little uncle then or thenceforth still less his little uncle him what is this prussia rising alongside of us higher and higher as if it would reach our own sublime level thinks the little uncle to himself at present there is no quarrel between them on the contrary as we have seen there is a mutual capability of helping one another which both recognize but will an interview tend to forward that useful result friedrich in the intervals of an ague with herstal just broken out may have wisely decided no our sublime little uncle of the waxy complexion with the proudly staring fisheyesno wit in him not much sense and a great deal of pridestands dreadfully erect plumb and more with the garterleg advanced when one goes to see him and his remarks are not of an entertaining nature leave him standing there to him let truchsess and bielfeld suffice in these hurries in this ague that is still upon us upon which the dull old newspapers owls of minerva that then were endeavor to draw inferences the noticeable fact is friedrich did on this occasion pass within a mile or two of his royal uncle without seeing him and had not through life another opportunity never saw the sublime little man at all nor was again so near him  i believe friedrich little knows the thickcoming difficulties of his britannic majesty at this juncture and is too impatient of these laggard procedures on the part of a man with eyes a fleurdetete modern readers too have forgotten jenkinss ear it is not till after long study and survey that one begins to perceive the anomalous profundities of that phenomenon to the poor english nation and its poor george ii  the english sent off last year a scanty expedition six ships of the line only six under vernon a fiery admiral a little given to be fiery in parliamentary talk withal and these did proceed to portobello on the spanish main of south america did hurl out on portobello such a fiery destructive deluge of gunnery and bayonetwork as quickly reduced the poor place to the verge of ruin and forced it to surrender with whatever navy garrison goods and resources were in it to the discretion of fiery vernonwho does not prove implacable he or his to a petitioning enemy yes humble the insolent but then be merciful to them say the admiring gazetteers the actual monster how cheering to think who tore off mr jenkinss ear was got hold of actual monster or even three or four different monsters who each did it the hold got being mythical as readers see and naturally thought he would be slit to ribbons but our people magnanimously pardoned him magnanimously flung him aside out of sight gentlemans magazine x 124 145 date of the event is 3d december ns 1739 impossible to shoot a dog in cold blood  whereupon vernon returned home triumphant and there burst forth such a jubilation over the day of small things as is now astonishing to think of had the termagants own thalamus and treasury been bombarded suddenly one night by redhot balls madrid city laid in ashes or baby carloss apanage extinguished from creation there could hardly have been greater english joy witness the portobellos they still have new towns so named so flamy is the murky element growing on that head and indeed had the cipher of tarbarrels burnt and of alebarrels drunk and the general account of wick and tallow spent in illuminations and in aldermanic exertions on the matter been accurately taken one doubts if portobello sold without shot fired to the highest bidder at its floweriest would have covered such a sum for they are a singular nation if stirred up from their stagnancy and are much in earnest about this spanish war  it is said there is now another far grander expedition on the stocks military this time as well as naval intended for the spanish mainbut of that for the present we will defer speaking enough the spanish war is a most serious and most furious business to those old english and to us after forced study of it shines out like faroff conflagration with a certain lurid significance in the then night of things night otherwise fallen dark and somniferous to modern mankind as britannic majesty and his walpoles have from the first been dead against this spanish war the problem is all the more ominous and the dreadful corollaries that may hang by it the more distressing to the royal mind  for example there is known or as good as known to be virtually some family compact or covenanted brotherhood of bourbonism french and spanish political people quake to ask themselves how will the french keep out of this war if it continue any length of time and in that case how will austria europe at large jenkinss ear will have kindled the universe not the spanish main only and we shall be at a fine pass the britannic majesty reflects that if france take to fighting him the first stab given will probably be in the accessiblest quarter and the intensely most sensitiveour own electoral dominions where no parliament plagues us our dear native country hanover extremely interesting to know what friedrich of prussia will do in such contingency  well truly it might have been king georges best bargain to close with friedrich to guarantee julich and berg and get fredrich to stand between the french and hanover while george with an england behind him in such humor went wholly into that spanish business the one thing needful to them at present truly but then again there are considerations what is this friedrich just come out upon the world what real fighting power has he after all that ridiculous drilling and recruiting friedrich wilhelm made will he be faithful in bargain is not perhaps from of old his bias always toward france rather and the kaiser what will the kaiser say to it these are questions for a britannic majesty seldom was seen such an insoluble imbroglio of potentialities dangerous to touch dangerous to leave lyingand his britannic majestys procedures upon it are of a very slow intricate sort and will grow still more so year after year in the new intricacies that are coming and be a weariness to my readers and me for observe the simultaneous fact all this while robinson at vienna is dunning the imperial majesty to remember old marlborough days and the laws of nature and declare for us against france in case of the worst what an attempt imperial majesty has no money imperial majesty remembers recent days rather and his own last quarrel with france on the polishelection score in which you seapowers cruelly stood neuter one comfort and pretty much one only is left to a nearly bankrupt imperial heart that france does at any rate ratify pragmatic sanction and instead of enemy to that inestimable document has become friendif only she be well let alone let well alone says the sad kaiser bankrupt of heart as well as purse i have saved the pragmatic got fleury to guarantee it i will hunt wild swine and not shadows any more ask me not and now this herstal business the imperial dehortatoriums perhaps of a high nature that are like to come more hopeless proposition the britannic majesty never made than this to the kaiser but he persists in it orders robinson to persist knocks at the austrian door with one hand at the prussian or antiaustrian with the other and gazes with those proud fisheyes into perils and potentialities and a sea of troubles wearisome to think of were not one bound to it here from a singular constitutional history of england not yet got into print are two excerpts which i will request the reader to try if he can take along with him in view of much that is coming  1 a just warthis war which posterity scoffs at as the war of jenkinss ear was if we examine it a quite indispensable one the dim muchbewildered english driven into it by their deepest instincts were in a chaotic inarticulate way right and not wrong in taking it as the commandment of heaven for such in a sense it was as shall by and by appear not perhaps since the grand reformation controversy under oliver cromwell and elizabeth had there to this poor english people who are essentially dumb inarticulate from the weight of meaning they have notwithstanding the palaver one hears from them in certain epochs been a more authentic cause of war and what was the fatal and yet foolish circumstance their constitutional captains especially their king would never and could never regard it as such but had to be forced into it by the public rage there being no other method left in the case  i say a most necessary war though of a most stupid appearance such the fatality of itbegun carried on ended as if by a people in a state of somnambulism more confused operation never was a solid placid people heavily asleep and snoring much shall we say and inarticulately grunting and struggling under indigestions constitutional and other do but listen to the hum of those extinct pamphlets and parliamentary oratories of theirsyet an honestly intending people and keenly alive to any commandment from heaven that could pierce through the thick skin of them into their big obstinate heart such a commandment then and there was that monition about jenkinss ear upon which so pungent was it to them they started violently out of bed into painful sleepwalking and went for twenty years and more clambering and sprawling about far and wide on the giddy edge of precipices over housetops and frightful cornices and parapets in a dim fulfilment of the said heavens command i reckon that this war though there were intervals treaties of peace more than one and the war had various namesdid not end till 1763 and then by degrees the poor english nation found that at say a thousand times the necessary expense and with imminent peril to its poor head and all the bones of its body it had actually succeededby dreadful exertions in its sleep this will be more apparent by and by and may be a kind of comfort to the sad english reader drearily surveying such somnambulisms on the part of his poor ancestors  2 two difficultiesthere are two grand difficulties in this farcetragedy of a war of which only one and that not the worst of the pair is in the least surmised by the english hitherto difficulty first which is even worse than the other and will surprisingly attend the english in all their wars now coming is that their fightingapparatus though made of excellent material cannot fightbeing in disorganic condition one branch of it especially the military one as they are pleased to call it being as good as totally chaotic and this in a quiet habitual manner this long while back with the naval branch it is otherwise which also is habitual there the english almost as if by nature can sail and fight in ships cannot well help doing it sailors innumerable are bred to them they are planted in the ocean opulent stormy neptune clipping them in all his moods forever and then by nature being a dumb muchenduring muchreflecting stout veracious and valiant kind of people they shine in that way of life which specially requires such without much forethought they have sailors innumerable and of the best quality the english have among them also strange as it may seem to the cursory observer a great gift of organizing witness their arkwrights and others and this gift they may often in matters naval more than elsewhere get the chance of exercising for a ships crew or even a fleet unlike a land army is of itself a unity its fortunes disjoined dependent on its own management and it falls moreover as no land army can to the undivided guidance of one manwho by hypothesis being english has now and then from of old chanced to be an organizing man and who is always much interested to know and practise what has been well organized for you are in contact with verities to an unexampled degree when you get upon the ocean with intent to sail on it much more to fight on itbottomless destruction raging beneath you and on all hands of you if you neglect for any reason the methods of keeping it down and making it float you to your aim  the english navy is in tolerable order at that period but as to the english armywe may say it is in a wrong sense the wonder of the world and continues so throughout the whole of this history and farther never before among the rational sons of adam were armies sent out on such termsnamely without a general or with no general understanding the least of his business the english have a notion that generalship is not wanted that war is not an art as playing chess is as finding the longitude and doing the differential calculus are and a much deeper art than any of these that war is taught by nature as eating is that courageous soldiers led on by a courageous wooden pole with cockedhat on it will do very well in the world i have not found opacity of platitude go deeper among any people this is difficulty first not yet suspected by an english people capable of great opacity on some subjects  difficulty second is that their ministry whom they had to force into this war perhaps do not go zealously upon it and perhaps even in the above circumstances they totally want knowledge how to go upon it were they never so zealous difficulty second might be much helped were it not for difficulty first but the administering of war is a thing also that does not come to a man like eatingthis second difficulty suspicion that walpole and perhaps still higher heads want zeal gives his britannic majesty infinite trouble andand so in short he stands there with the garterleg advanced looking loftily into a considerable sea of troublesthat day when friedrich drove past him friday 16th september 1740 and never came so near him again  the next business for friedrich was a visit at brunswick to the affinities and kindred in passing where also was an important little act to be done betrothal of the young prince august wilhelm heirpresumptive whom we saw in strasburg to a princess of that house louisa amelia younger sister of friedrichs own queen a modest promising arrangement which turned out well enoughthough the young prince father to the kings that since are was not supremely fortunate otherwise betrothal was 20th september 1740 marriage 5th january 1742 buchholz i 207 after which the review at magdeburg and home on the 24th there to be busy as a turk or as a m jordanaccording to what we read long since     chapter vii  withdraws to reinsberg hoping a peaceable winter  by this herstal token which is now blazing abroad now and for a month to come it can be judged that the young king of prussia intends to stand on his own footing quite peremptorily if need be and will by no means have himself led about in imperial harness as his late father was so that a dull public herrenhausen very specially and gazetteer owls of minerva everywhere may expect events all the more indubitably when that spadework comes to light in the wesel country it is privately certain the gazetteers not yet sure about it till they see the actual spades going this new king does fully intend to assert his rights on bergjulich and will appear there with his iron ramrods the instant old kurpfalz shall decease let france and the kaiser say no to it or say yes there are in fact at a fit place buderich in the neighborhood of wesel certain rampartworks beginnings as of an entrenched camp going onfor review purposes merely say the gazetteers in italics here it privately is friedrichs resolution shall a prussian army of the due strength could be wellnigh 100000 strong if needful make its appearance directly on old kurpfalzs decease if one live to see such event stenzel iv 61 france and the kaiser will probably take good survey of that buderich phenomenon before meddling  to do his work like a king and shun no peril and no toil in the course of what his work may be is friedrichs rule and intention nevertheless it is clear he expects to approve himself magnanimous rather in the peaceable operations than in the warlike and his outlooks are of all places and pursuits towards reinsberg and the fine arts for the time being his public activity meanwhile they describe as prodigious though the ague still clings to him such building instituting managing operahouse french theatre palace for his motherday by day many things to be recorded by editor formey though the rule about them here is silence except on cause  no doubt the ague is itself privately a point of moment such a vexatious paltry little thing in this bright whirl of activities public and other which he continues managing in spite of it impatient to be rid of it but it will not go there it reappears always punctual to its fourth daylike a snarling streetdog in the high ballroom and workroom he is drinking pyrmont water has himself proposed quinquina a remedy just come up but the doctors shook their heads has tried snatches of reinsberg too short he intends soon to be out there for a right spell of country there to be happy and get quit of his ague the ague wentand by a remedy which surprised the

kindred and the altered scene of things poor lady she is perceptibly more tremulous than usual and her narrative not in dates only but in more memorable points dances about at a sad rate interior agitations and tremulous shrill feelings shivering her this way and that and throwing things topsyturvy in ones recollection like the magnetic needle shaky but steadfast agitee mai constante truer nothing can be points forever to the pole but also what obliquities it makes will shiver aside in mad escapades if you hold the paltriest bit of old iron near itpaltriest clack of gossip about this loved brother of mine brother we will hope silently continues to be pole so that the needle always comes back again otherwise all would go to wreck here in abridged and partly rectified form are the phenomena witnessed  we arrived at berlin the end of october monday 17th as above said my younger brothers followed by the princes of the blood and by all the court received us at the bottom of the stairs i was led to my apartment where i found the reigning queen my sisters ulrique amelia and the princesses of the blood as above schwedt and the rest i learned with much chagrin that the king was ill of tertian ague quartan but that is no matter he sent me word that being in his fit he could not see me but that he depended on having that pleasure tomorrow the queen mother to whom i went without delay was in a dark condition rooms all hung with their lugubrious drapery everything yet in the depth of mourning for my father what a scene for me nature has her rights i can say with truth i have almost never in my life been so moved as on this occasion interview with mammawe can fancy itwas of the most touching wilhelmina had been absent eight years she scarcely knows the young ones again all so grownfinds change on change and that time as he always is has been busy that night the supperparty was exclusively a family one  her brothers welcome to her on the morrow though ardent enough she found deficient in sincerity deficient in several points as indeed a brother up to the neck in business and just come out of an aguefit does not appear to the best advantage wilhelmina noticed how ill he looked so lean and brokendown maigre et defait within the last two months but seems to have taken no account of it farther in striking her balances with friedrich and indeed in her narrative of this visit not we will hope in the visit itself she must have been in a high state of magnetic deflectionpretty nearly her maximum of such discoverable in those famous memoirssuch a tumult is there in her statements all gone to groundandlofty tumbling in this place so discrepant are the still ascertainable facts from this topsyturvy picture of them sketched by her four years hence in 1744 the truest of magnetic needles but so sensitive if you bring foreign iron near it  wilhelmina was loaded with honors by an impartial berlin public that is court public but all being in mourning the court was not brilliant the queen mother saw little company and was sunk in sorrowhad not the least influence in affairs so jealous was the new king of his authorityto the queen mothers surprise says wilhelmina for the rest here is a king becoming truly unpopular or we fancy so in our deflected state and judging by the rumor of cliques a general discontent reigning in the country love of his subjects pretty much gone people speaking of him in no measured terms in certain cliques cares nothing about those who helped him as prince royal say some others complain of his avarice meaning steady vigilance in outlay as surpassing the late kings this one complained of his violences of temper emportemens that one of his suspicions of his distrust his haughtinesses his dissimulation meaning polite impenetrability when he saw good several circumstances known to wilhelminas own experience compel wilhelminas assent on those points i would have spoken to him about them if my brother of prussia young august wilhelm betrothed the other day and the queen regnant had not dissuaded me farther on i will give the explanation of all thisnever did it anywhere i beg those who may one day read these memoirs to suspend their judgment on the character of this great prince till i have developed it wilhelmina ii 326 o my princess you are true and bright but you are shrill and i admire the effect of atmospheric electricity not to say of any neighboring marinestore shop or miserable bit of broken pan on one of the finest magnetic needles ever made and set trembling  wilhelmina is incapable of deliberate falsehood and this her impression or reminiscence with all its exaggeration is entitled to be heard in evidence so far from this and from other sources readers will assure themselves that discontents were not wanting that king friedrich was not amiable to everybody at this timewhich indeed he never grew to be at any other time he had to be a king that was the trade he followed not the quite different one of being amiable all round amiability is good my princess but the question rises to whomfor example to the young gentleman who shot himself in lobegun there are young gentlemen and old sometimes in considerable quantities to whom if you were in your duty as a king of men or even as a king of one man and his affairs if that is all your kingdom you should have been hateful instead of amiable that is a stern truth too much forgotten by wilhelmina and others again what a deadening and killing circumstance is it in the career of amiability that you are bound not to be communicative of your inner man but perpetually and strictly the reverse it may be doubted if a good king can be amiable certainly he cannot in any but the noblest ages and then only to a select few i should guess friedrich was at no time fairly loved not by those nearest to him he was rapid decisive of wiry compact nature had nothing of his fathers amplitudes simplicities nothing to sport with and fondle far from it tremulous sensibilities ardent affections these we clearly discover in him in extraordinary vivacity but he wears them under his polished panoply and is outwardly a radiant but metallic object to mankind let us carry this along with us in studying him and thank wilhelmina for giving us hint of it in her oblique waywilhelmimas love for her brother rose to quite heroic pitch in coming years and was at its highest when she died that continuation of her memoirs in which she is to develop her brothers character was never written it has been sought for in modern times and a few insignificant pages with evidence that there is not and was not any more are all that has turned up pertz ueber die denkwurdigkeiten der markgrafin van bayreuth paper read in the akademie der wissenschaften berlin 25th april 1850  incapable of falsity prepense we say but the known facts which stand abundantly on record if you care to search them out are merely as follows friedrich with such sincerity as there might be did welcome wilhelmina on the morrow of her arrival spoke of reinsberg and of air and rest and how pleasant it would be rolled off next morning having at last gathered up his businesses and got them well in hand to reinsberg accordingly whither wilhelmina with the queen regnant and others of agreeable quality followed in two days intending a long and pleasant spell of country out there which hope was tolerably fulfilled even for wilhelmina though there did come unexpected interruptions not of friedrichs bringing     unexpected news at reinsberg  friedrichs pursuits and intended conquests for the present are of peaceable and even gay nature french theatre italian operahouse these are among the immediate outlooks voltaire skilled in french acting if anybody ever were is multifariously negotiating for a company of that kindlet him be swift be successful letters of voltaire passim in these months an italian opera there shall be the

and all the famed operahouses on his road graun one of the best judges living is likewise off to italy gathering singers our opera too shall be a successful thing and we hope a speedy such are friedrichs outlooks at this time  a miscellaneous pleasant company is here truchsess and bielfeld home from hanover among them wilhelmina is herevoltaire himself perhaps coming again friedrich drinks his pyrmont waters works at his public businesses all day which are now well in hand and manageable by couriers at evening he appears in company and is the astonishment of everybody brilliant like a

eclipse hidden in the interior laboring under his aguefit question rises shall the express be introduced or be held back the news he brings is huge unexpected transcendent and may agitate the sick

after about an hour the tremblingfit being over and fredersdorf having cautiously preluded a little and prepared the way the despatch is delivered and the king left with his immense piece of news news that his imperial majesty karl vi died after short illness on thursday the 20th last kaiser dead house of hapsburg and its five centuries of tough wrestling and uneasy dominancy in this world ended gone to the distaffthe counterwrestling ambitions and cupidities not dead and nothing but pragmatic sanction left between the fallen house and them friedrich kept silence showed no sign how transfixed he was to hear such tidings which he foresaw would have immeasurable consequences in the world  one of the first was that it cured friedrich of his ague it braced him it and perhaps a little quinquina which he now insisted on into such a tensity of spirit as drove out his ague like a mere hiccough quite gone in the course of next week and we hear no more of that importunate annoyance he summoned secretary eichel be ready in so many minutes hence rose from his bed dressed himself preuss thronbesteigung p 416and then by eichels help sent off e  for schwerin his chief general and podewils his chief minister a resolution which is rising or has risen in the royal mind will be ready for communicating to these two by the time they arrive on the second day hence this done friedrich i believe joined his company in the evening and was as light and brilliant as if nothing had happened    chapter viii  the kaisers death  the kaisers death came upon the public unexpectedly though not quite so upon observant persons closer at hand he was not yet fiftysix out a firmbuilt man had been of sound constitution of active not intemperate habits but in the last six years there had come such torrents of ill luck rolling down on him he had suffered immensely far beyond what the world knew of and to those near him and anxious for him his strength seemed much undermined five years ago in summer 1735 robinson reported from a sure hand nothing can equal the emperors agitation under these disasters brought upon him by fleury and the spaniards as afterclap to his polishelection feat his good empress is terrified many times he will die in the course of the night when singly with her he gives a loose to his affliction confusion and despair seapowers will not help fleury and mere ruin will engulf what augments this agitation is his distrust in every one of his own ministers except perhaps bartenstein robinson to lord warrington 5th july 1735 in statepaper officewho is not much of a support either though a gnarled weighty old stick in his way professor at strasburg once not interesting to us here the rest his imperial majesty considers to be of sublimated blockhead type it appears prince eugene had died lately and with eugene all good fortune  and then close following the miseries of that turk war crashing down upon a man they say duke franz maria theresas husband nominal commander in those campaigns with the seckendorfs and wallises under him going such a road was privately eager to have done with the business on any terms lest the kaiser should die first and leave it weltering no wonder the poor kaiser felt broken disgusted with the long shadowhunt of life and took to practical fieldsports rather an army that cannot fight wargenerals good only to be locked in fortresses an exchequer that has no money after such wagging of the wigs and such privycouncilling and such warcouncillinglet us hunt wild swine and not think of it that thank heaven we still have that and pragmatic sanction well engrossed and generally sworn to by mankind after much effort  the outer public of that time and voltaire among them more deliberately afterwards spoke of mushrooms an indigestion of mushrooms and it is probable there was something of mushrooms concerned in the event another subsequent frenchman still more irreverent adds to this of the excess of mushrooms that the kaiser made light of it when the doctors told him he had few hours to live he would not believe it and bantered his physicians on the sad news look me in the eyes said he have i the air of one dying when you see my sight growing dim then let the sacraments be administered whether i order or not doctors insisting the kaiser replied since you are foolish fellows who know neither the cause nor the state of my disorder i command that once i am dead you open my body to know what the matter was you can then come and let me know anecdotes germaniques paris 1769 p 692in which also there is perhaps a glimmering of distorted truth though as monsieur mistakes even the day 18th october says he not 20th one can only accept it as rumor from the outside  here by an extremely sombre domestic gentleman of

majesty felt slightly indisposedindigestion of mushrooms or whatever it was had begun at halbthurn the night before we rather understand and was the occasion of his leaving the doctors called it cold on the stomach and thought it of no consequence in the night of saturday it became alarming inflammation thought the doctors inflammation of the liver and used their potent appliances which only made the danger come and go and on the tuesday all day the doctors did not doubt his imperial majesty was dying look me in the eyes pack of fools you will have to dissect me you will then know any truth in all that no matter  at noon of that tuesday he took the sacrament the popes nuncio administering his majesty showed uncommonly great composure of soul and resignation to the divine will being indeed certainso he expressed it to a principal official person sunk in grief bartenstein shall we guess who stood by himcertain of his cause not afraid in contemplating that dread judgment now near look at me a man that is certain of his cause can enter on such a journey with good courage and a composed mind mit gutem und delassenem muth to the doctors dubitating what the disease was he said if gazelli my late worthy doctor were still here you would soon know but as it is you will learn it when you dissect meand once asked to be shown the cup where his heart would lie after that operation  sacrament

nor would his imperial majesty permit her to enter this deathroom on account of her condition so important to the world but his majesty turning towards that side where her apartment was raised his right hand and commanded her husband and the archduchess her younger sister to tell his theresa that he blessed her herewith notwithstanding her absence poor kaiser poor theresa most distressing of all was the scene with the kaiserin the night before on getting knowledge of the sad certainty she had fainted utterly away starke ohnmacht and had to be carried into the grand duchesss maria theresas room being summoned now with her children for the last blessing she cried as in despair do not leave me your dilection do not ach euer liebden verlassen mich doch nicht poor good souls her imperial

with the termagant seemed the reverse of wise but there was something of a high proud heart in it too if we examine and even the pragmatic sanction though in practice not worth one regiment of iron

solemnities without loss of a moment to which bartenstein and the authorities answered poohpooh as if it were nothing it is the first ripple of an immeasurable tide or deluge in that kind threatening

after the expresses went for them schwerin and podewils punctually arrived at reinsberg they were carried into the interior privacies to long conferences with his majesty that day and for the next four days majesty and they even dining privately together grave business of state none guesses how grave evidently going on the resolution friedrich laid before them fruit of these two days since the news from vienna was probably the most important ever formed in prussia or in europe during that century resolution to make good our rights on silesia by this great opportunity the best that will ever offer resolution which had sprung i find and got to sudden fixity in the head of the young king himself and which met with little save opposition from all the other sons of adam at the first blush and for long afterwards and indeed the making of it good of it and of the immense results that hung by it was the main business of this young kings life henceforth and cost him labors like those of hercules and was in the highest degree momentous to existing and not yet existing millions of mankindto the readers of this history especially  it is almost touching to reflect how unexpectedly like a bolt out of the blue all this had come upon friedrich and how it overset his fine program for the winter at reinsberg and for his life generally not the peaceable magnanimities but the warlike are the thing appointed friedrich this winter and mainly henceforth those golden or soft radiances which we saw in him admirable to voltaire and to friedrich and to an esurient philanthropic worldit is not those it is the steelbright or stellar kind that are to become predominant in friedrichs existence grim hailstorms thunders and tornado for an existence to him instead of the opulent genialities and halcyon weather anticipated by himself and others indisputably enough to us if not yet to friedrich reinsberg and life to the muses are done on a sudden from the opposite side of the horizon see miraculous opportunity rushing hitherwardswift terrible clothed with lightning like a courser of the gods dare you clutch him by the thundermane and fling yourself upon him and make for the empyrean by that course rather be immediate about it then the time is now or else neverno fair judge can blame the young man that he laid hold of the flaming opportunity in this manner and obeyed the new omen to seize such an opportunity and perilously mount upon it was the part of a young magnanimous king less sensible to the perils and more to the other considerations than one older would have been  schwerin and podewils were no doubt astonished to learn what the royal purpose was and could not want for commonplace objections many and strong had this been the scene for dwelling on them or dressing them out at eloquent length but they knew well this was not the scene for doing more than with eloquent modesty hint them that the resolution being already taken would not alter for commonplace and that the question now lying for honorable members was how to execute it it is on this as i collect that schwerin and podewils in the kings company did with extreme intensity consult during those four days and were most probably of considerable use to the king though some of their modifications adopted by him turned out not as they had predicted but as he on all the military details and outlines and on all the diplomacies of this business here are two oracles extremely worth consulting by the young king  to seize silesia is easy a country open on all but the south side open especially on our side where a battalion of foot might force it the three or four fortresses of which only two glogau and neisse can be reckoned strong are provided with nothing as they ought to be not above 3000 fighting men in the whole province and these little expecting fight silesia can be seized but the maintaining of itwe must try to maintain it thinks friedrich  at reinsberg it is not yet known that kurbaiern has protested but it is well guessed he means to do so and that france is at his back in some sort kurbaiern probably kursachsen and plenty more france being secretly at their back what low condition austria stands in all its ready resources run to the lees is known and that france getting lively at present with its belleisles and adventurous spirits not restrainable by fleury is always on the watch to bring austria lower capable in spite of pragmatic sanction to snatch the golden moment and spring hunterlike on a moribund austria were the huntingdogs once out and in cry to friedrich it seems unlikely the pragmatic sanction will be a law of nature to mankind in these circumstances his opinion is the old political system has expired with the kaiser here is europe burning in one corner of it by jenkinss ear and such a smoulder of combustible material awakening nearer hand will not europe probably blaze into general war pragmatic sanction going to waste sheepskin and universal scramble ensuing in which he who has 100000 good soldiers and can handle them may be an important figure in urging claims and keeping what he has got hold of  friedrichs mind as to the fact is fixed seize silesia we will but as to the manner of doing it schwerin and podewils modify him their counsel is do not step out in hostile attitude at the very first saying these duchies liegnitz brieg wohlau jagerndorf are mine and i will fight for them say only having as is well known interests of various kinds in this silesia i venture to take charge of it in the perilous times now come and will keep it safe for the real owner silesia seized in this fashion continue they negotiate with the queen of hungary offer her help large help in men and money against her other enemies perhaps she will consent to do us rightshe never will consent is friedrichs opinion but it is worth trying urge the ministerswell answers friedrich be it in that form that is the softspoken cautious form any form will do if the fact be there that is understood to have been the figure of the deliberation in this conclave at reinsberg during the four days stenzel from what sources he does not clearly say no doubt from sources of some authenticity gives this as summary of it iv 6165 and now it remains only to fix the military details to be ready in a minimum of time and to keep our preparations and intentions in impenetrable darkness from all men in the interim adieu messieurs  and so on the 1st of november fifth morning since they came schwerin and podewils a world of new business silently ahead of them return to berlin intent to begin the same all the kings will have to take their resolution on this matter wisely or else unwisely king friedrichs let it prove the wisest or not is notably the rapidestcomplete and fairly entering upon action on november 1st at london the news of the kaisers death had arrived the day before britannic majesty and ministry thrown much into the dumps by it much into the vague are nothing like so prompt with their resolution on it somewhat sorrowfully in the vague in fact they will go jumbling hither and thither for about three years to come before making up their minds to a resolution so intricate is the affair to the english nation and them intricate indeed and even imaginarydefinable mainly as a bottomless abyss of nightmare dreams to the english nation and them productive of strong somnambulisms as my friend has it     mystery in berlin for seven weeks while the preparations go on voltaire visits friedrich to decipher it but cannot  podewils and schwerin gone king friedrich though still very busy in workinghours returns to his society and its gayeties and brilliancies apparently with increased appetite after these four days of abstinence still busy in his workinghours as a king must be couriers coming and going hundreds of businesses despatched each day and in the evening what a relish for societypraetorius is quite astonished at it music dancing playacting suppers of the gods not done till four in the morning sometimes these are the accounts praetorius hears at berlin from all persons who return from reinsberg writes he the unanimous report is that the king works the whole day through with an assiduity that is unique and then in the evening gives himself to the pleasures of society with a vivacity of mirth and sprightly humor which makes those eveningparties charming excerpt in preuss thronbesteigung  p 418 so it had to last with frequent short journeys on friedrichs part and at last with change to berlin as headquarters for about seven weeks to cometill the beginning of december and the day of action namely a notable little interim in friedrichs history and that of europe  friedrichs secret till almost the very end remained impenetrable though by degrees his movements excited much guessing in the gazetteer and diplomatic world everywhere military matters do seem to be getting brisk in prussia arsenals much astir troops are seen mustering marching plainly to a singular degree marching towards the austrian side towards silesia some note yes but also towards cleve certain detachments of troops are marchingdo not men see and the intrenchment at buderich in those parts that is getting forward withalthough privately there is not the least prospect of using it in these altered circumstances friedrich already guesses that if he could get silesia so invaluable on the one skirt of him he mill probably have to give up his bergjulich claims on the other i fancy he is getting ready to do so should the time come for such alternative but he labors at buderich all the same and improves the roads in that quarterwhich at least may help to keep an inquisitive public at bay these are seven busy weeks on friedrichs part and on the worlds constant realities of preparation on the one part industriously veiled on the other part such shadows guessings spyings spectral movements above ground and below diplomatic shadows fencing gazetteer shadows rumoringdreams of a world as if near awakening to something great all officers on furlough have been ordered to their posts writes bielfeld on those vague terms of his on arriving at berlin you notice a great agitation in all departments of the state the regiments are ordered to prepare their equipages and to hold themselves in readiness for marching there are magazines being formed at frankfurtonoder and at crossenhandy for silesia you would say there are considerable trains of artillery getting ready and the king has frequent conferences with his generals bielfeld i 165 berlin 30th november is the date he puts to it the authentic fact is by the middle of november troops to the extent of 30000 and more had got orders to be ready for marching in three weeks hence their public motions very visible ever since their actual purpose a mystery to all mortals except three  towards the end of november it becomes the prevailing guess that the business is immediate not prospective that silesia may be in the wind not julich and berg which infinitely quickens the shadowy rumorings and diplomatic fencings of mankind the french have their special ambassador here a marquis de beauvau observant military gentleman who came with the accession compliment some time ago and keeps his eyes well open but cannot see through millstones fleury is intensely desirous to know friedrichs secret but would fain keep his own if he yet have one and is himself quite tacit and reserved to fleurys marquis de beauvau friedrich is very gracious but in regard to secrets is for a reciprocal procedure could not voltaire go and try it is thought fleury had let fall some hint to that effect carried by a bird of the air sure enough voltaire does go is actually on visit to his royal friend six days with him at reinsberg perhaps near a fortnight in all 20 november2 december or so hanging about those berlin regions on the

obliquely there are always intermediates and channels small hint the slightest twinkle of fleurys eyelashes would be duly speeded to voltaire and set him going we shall see him expressly missioned

je ne vous quitterais pas  oeuvres de frederic xiv 167 oeuvres de voltaire c c  meaning perhaps in brief english v ah you are but a beautiful coquette you charm away our hearts and do not give your own wont tell me your secret at all f treacherous lothario it is you that quit me for a coquette your divine emilie and wont stay here and be of my academy but however friedrich looked hopingly on the french but could not give his secret except by degrees and with reciprocity some days hence he said to marquis de beauvau in the audience of leave a word which was remembered     view of friedrich behind the veil  as to friedrich himself since about the middle of november his plans seem to have been definitely shaped out in all points troops so many when to be on march and how no important detail uncertain since then november 17th he jots down a little note which is to go to vienna were the due hour come by a special ambassador one count gotter acquainted with the ground there and explain to her hungarian majesty what his exact demands are and what the exact services he will render of which important little paper readers shall hear again gotters demands are at first to be high our four duchies due by law so long these and even more considering the important services we propose this is to be his first wordbut it appears he is privately prepared to put up with two duchies if he can have them peaceably duchies of sagan and glogau which are not of the four at all but which lie nearest us and are far below the value of the four to austria especially this intricate point friedrich has already settled in his mind and indeed it is notably the habit of this young king to settle matters with himself in good time and in regard to all manner of points he will be found on the day of bargaining about them to have his own resolution formed and definitely fixedmuch to his advantage over conflicting parties who have theirs still flying loose  another thing of much concernment is to secure himself from danger of russian interference to this end he despatches major winterfeld to russia a man well known to himday of winterfelds departure is not given day of his arrival in petersburg is 19th december just coming russia at present is rather in a staggering condition hopeful for winterfelds object on the 28th of october last only eight days after the kaiser czarina anne of russia she with the big cheek once of courland had died audacious death as our poor friend had it venturing upon another crowned head there bieren her dear courlander once little better than a horsegroom now duke of courland quasihusband to the late big cheek and thereby sovereign of russia this long while past is left official head in russia poor little anton ulrich and his august spouse well enough known to us have indeed produced a czar iwan some months ago to the joy of mankind but czar iwan is in his cradle father and mothers function is little other than to rock the cradle of iwan bieren to be regent and autocrat over him and them in the interim to their chagrin to that of feldmarschall munnich and many others the upshot of which will be visible before long czarina annes death had seemed to friedrich the opportune removal of a dangerous neighbor known to be in the pay of austria here now are new mutually hostile parties springing up chance surely of a bargain with some of them he despatches winterfeld on this errandprobably the fittest man in prussia for it how soon and perfectly winterfeld succeeded and what winterfeld was and something of what a russia he found it we propose to mention by and by  these and all points of importance friedrich has settled with himself some time ago what his own private thoughts on the silesian adventure are readers will wish to know since they can at first hand hear friedrich himself whose veracity is unquestionable to such as know anything of him  this silesian project fulfilled all his the kings political viewssummed them all well up into one head it was a means of acquiriug reputation of increasing the power of the state and of terminating what concerned that longlitigated question of the bergjulich successioncan be sure of getting that at lowest intends to give that up if necessary  meanwhile before entirely determining the king weighed the risks there were in undertaking such a war and the advantages that were to be hoped from it on one side presented itself the potent house of austria not likely to want resources with so many vast provinces under it an emperors daughter attacked who would naturally find allies in the king of england in the dutch republic and so many princes of the empire who had signed the pragmatic sanction russia wasor had been and might again bein the pay of vienna saxony might have some clippings from bohemia thrown to it and so be gained over scanty harvest 1740 threatened difficulties as to provisioning of troops the risks were great one had to apprehend the vicissitudes of war a single battle lost might be decisive the king had no allies and his troops hitherto without experience would have to front old austrian soldiers grown gray in harness and trained to war by so many campaigns  on the other side were hopeful considerationsfour in number first weak condition of the austrian court treasury empty warapparatus broken in pieces inexperienced young princess to defend a disputed succession on those terms second there will be allies france and england always in rivalry both meddling in these matters king is sure to get either the one or the otherthird silesian war lies handy to us and is the only kind of offensive war that does country bordering on our frontier and with the oder running through it as a sure highroad for everything fourth what suddenly turned the balance or at least what kept it steady in that posturenews of the czarinas death arrives russia has ceased to count against us and become a manageable quantity on therefore  add to these reasons says the king with a candor which has not been well treated in the history books add to these reasons an army ready for acting funds supplies all found lying barrelled in the schloss at berlinand perhaps the desire of making oneself a name from which few of mortals able to achieve it are exempt in their young time all this was cause of the war which the king now entered upon oeuvres de frederic histoire de mon temps i 128  desire to make himself a name how shocking exclaim several historians candor of confession that he may have had some such desire how honest is what they do not exclaim as to the justice of his silesian claims or even to his own belief about their justice friedrich affords not the least light which can be new to readers here he speaks when business requires it of those known rights of his and with the air of a man who expects to be believed on his word but it is cursorily and in the business way only and there is not here or elsewhere the least pleadinga man you would say considerably indifferent to our belief on that head his eyes set on the practical merely just rights what are rights never so just which you cannot make valid the world is full of such if you have rights and can assert them into facts do it that is worth doing  we must add two notes two small absinthine drops bitter but wholesome administered by him to the old dessauer whose gloomy wonder over all this military whirl of prussian things and discontent that he lately the head authority has never once been spoken to on it have been great guessing at last that it was meant for austria a power rather dear to leopold he can suppress himself no longer but breaks out into cassandra prophesyings which have piqued the young king and provoke this return  1 reinsberg 24th november 1740i have received your letter and seen with what inquietude you view the approaching march of my troops i hope you will set your mind at ease on that score and wait with patience what i intend with them and you i have made all my dispositions and your serenity will learn time enough what my orders are without disquieting yourself about them as nothing has been forgotten or delayedfriedrich  old dessauer cut to the bone perceives he will have to quit that method and never resume it writes next how painful it is to an old general to see himself neglected as if good for nothing while his scholars are allowed to gather laurels friedrichs answer is of soothing character  2 berlin 2d december 1740you may be assured i honor your merits and capacity as a young officer ought to honor an old one who has given the world so many proofs of his talent dexteritat nor will i neglect your serenity on any occasion when you can help me by your good counsel and cooperation but it is a mere bagatelle this that i am now upon though next year it may become serious  for the rest saxony being a neighbor whose intentions one does not know i have privately purposed your serenity should keep an outlook that way in my absence plenty of employment coming for your serenity but as to this present expedition i reserve it for myself alone that the world may not think the king of prussia marches with a tutor to the fieldfriedrich orlich geschichte der schlesischen kriege berlin 1841 i 38 39  and therewith leopold eagerly complying has to rest satisfied and beware of too much freedom with this young king again  berlin december 2d is the date of that last note to the dessauer date also of voltaires adieu with the responseon which same day friday december 2d as i find from the old books his majesty quitting the reinsberg sojourn had arrived in berlin about 2 pm accompanied by prince august wilhelm betrothed at brunswick lately such a crowd on the streets as if they had never seen him before he continued at berlin or in the neighborhood thenceforth busy days these and berlin a much whispering city as regiment after regiment marches away king soon to follow as is thoughtwho himself sometimes deigns to take the regiments into highest own eyeshine hochsteigenen augenschein that is to review them say the reverential editors december 6thbut let us follow the strict sequence of phenomena at berlin     excellency botta has audience then excellency dickens and others december 6th the mystery is out  of course her hungarian majesty and her bartensteins and ministries heard enough of those prussian rumors interior military activities and enigmatic movements but they seem strangely supine on the matter indeed they seem strangely supine on such matters and lean at ease upon the seapowers upon pragmatic sanction and other laws of nature but at length even they become painfully interested as to friedrichs intentions and despatch an envoy to sift him a little an expert marchese di botta genoese by birth skilful in the russian and other intricacies who was here at berlin lately doing the accession compliment rather ill received at that time and is fit for the job perhaps botta will penetrate him that is becoming desirable in spite of the gay private theatricals at reinsberg and the berlin carnival balls he is so occupied with  england is not less interested and the diligent sir guy is doing his best but can make out nothing satisfactorymuch the reverse indeed and falls into angry black anticipations nobody here great or small says his excellency dares make any representation to this young prince against the measures he is pursuing though all are sensible of the confusion which must follow a prince who had the least regard to honor truth and justice could not act the part he is going to do alas no excellency dickens but it is plain his only view was to deceive us all and conceal for a while his ambitious and mischievous designs despatch 29th november3d december 1740 raumer p 58 never was such dissimulation exclaims the diplomatic world everywhere being angered at it as if it were a vice on the part of a king about to invade silesia dissimulation if that mean mendacity is not the name of the thing it is the art of wearing a polite cloak of darkness and the king is little disturbed what name they call it  botta did not get to berlin till december 1st had no audience till the 5thby which time it is becoming evident to excellency dickens and to everybody that silesia is the thing meant botta hints as much in that first audience december 5th terrible roads those silesian ones your majesty says botta as if historically merely but with a glance of the eye hm answers his majesty in the same tone the worst that comes of them is a little mudnext day dickens had express audience berlin tuesday 6th a smartish somewhat flurried colloquy with the king which well abridged may stand as follows  dickens indivisibility of the austrian monarchy sireking indivisibility what do you meandickens the maintenance of the pragmatic sanctionking do you intend to support it i hope not for such is not my intention there is for you  dickens england and holland will much wonder at the measures your majesty was taking at the moment when your majesty proposed to join with them and were making friendly proposals has been a deceitful man sir guy at least an impenetrablebut this latter is rather strong on your part what shall i write to england when i mentioned this says dickens the king grew red in the face eyes considerably flashing i should think  king you can have no instructions to ask that question and if you had i have an answer ready for you england has no right to inquire into my designs your great seaarmaments did i ask you any questions about them no i was and am silent on that head only wishing you good luck and that you may not get beaten by the spaniards dickens hastily draws in his rash horns again after a pass or two kings natural color returns  king austria as a power is necessary against the turks but in germany what need of austria being so superlative why should not say three electors united be able to oppose her monsieur i find it is your notion in england as well as theirs in france to bring other sovereigns under your tutorage and lead them about understand that i will not be led by either tush you are like the athenians who when philip of macedon was ready to invade them spent their time in haranguing  dickens berg and julich if we were to guarantee themking hm dont so much mind that rhine country difficulties theredutch always jealous of one but on the other frontier neither england nor holland could take umbragepoints clearly to silesia then your excellency dickens raumer from statepaper office pp 63 64  alas yes troops and military equipments are for days past evidently wending towards frankfurt towards crossen and even the newspapers now hint that something is on hand in that quarter nay this same day tuesday 6th december there has come out brief official announcement to all the foreign ministers at berlin excellency dickens among them that his royal majesty our most allgracious herr has taken the resolution to advance a body of troops into schlesienrather out of friendly views towards austria much business lying between us about schlesien not out of hostile views by any means as all excellencies shall assure their respective courts copy of the paper in heldengeschichte i 447 announcement which had thrown the excellency dickens into such a frame of mind before he got his audience today  saturday following which was december 10th marquis de beauvau had his audience of leave intending for paris shortly audience very gracious covertly hinting on both sides more than it said ending in these words on the kings side which have become famous adieu then m le marquis i believe i am going to play your game if the aces fall to me we will share je vais je crois jouer votre jeu si les as me viennent nous partagerons voltaire oeuvres siecle de louis xv c 6 xxviii 74  to botta all this while friedrich strove to be specially civil took him out to charlottenburg that same saturday with the queen and other guests but botta and all the world being now certain about silesia and that no amount of mud or other terror on the roads would be regarded bottas thoughts in this evening party are not of cheerful nature next day sunday december 11th he too gets his audience of leave and cannot help bursting out when the king plainly tells him what is now afoot and that the prussian ambassador has got instructions what to offer upon it at vienna sire you are going to ruin the house of austria cried botta and to plunge yourself into destruction vous abimer at the same timedepends on the queen said friedrich to accept the offers i have made her botta sank silent seemed to reflect but gathering himself again added with an ironical air and tone of voice they are fine troops those of yours sire ours have not the same splendor of appearance but they have looked the wolf in the face think i conjure you what you are getting into friedrich answered with vivacity a little nettled at the ironical tone of botta and his mixed sympathy and menace you find my troops are beautiful perhaps i shall convince you they are good too yes excellency botta goodish troops and very capable to look the wolf in the faceor perhaps in the tail too before all end botta urged and entreated that at least there should be some delay in executing this project but the king gave him to understand that it was now too late and that the rubicon was passed friedrichs own account oeuvres ii 57  the secret is now out therefore invasion of silesia certain and close at hand a day or two before marching may have been this very day when botta got his audience the king assembled his chief generals all things ready out in the frankfurtcrossen region yonder and spoke to them as follows briefly and to the point  gentlemen i am undertaking a war in which i have no allies but your valor and your goodwill my cause is just my resources are what we ourselves can do and the issue lies in fortune remember continually the glory which your ancestors acquired in the plains of warsaw at fehrbellin and in the expedition to preussen across the frische haf on ice that time your lot is in your own hands distinctions and rewards wait upon your fine actions which shall merit them  but what need have i to excite you to glory it is the one thing you keep before your eyes the sole object worthy of your labors we are going to front troops who under prince eugene had the highest reputation though prince eugene is gone we shall have to measure our strength against brave soldiers the greater will be the honor if we can conquer adieu go forth i will follow you straightway to the rendezvous of glory which awaits us oeuvres de frederic ii58     masked ball at berlin 12th13th december  on the evening of monday 12th there was as usual masked or halfmasked ball at the palace as usual but this time it has become mentionable in worldhistory bielfeld personally interested gives us a vivid glance into itwhich though pretending to be real and contemporaneous is unfortunately mythical only and done at a great interval of years dates and even slight circumstances of fact refusing to conformwhich however for the truth there is in it we will give as better than nothing bielfelds pretended date is berlin 15th december should have been 14thwrong by a day after ones best effort  berlin 15th december 1740 as for me dear sister i am like a shuttlecock whom the kings of prussia and of england hit with their rackets and knock to and fro the night before last i was at the palace evening party assemblee which is a sort of ball where you go in domino but without mask on the face the queen was there and all the court about eight oclock the king also made his appearance his majesty noticing m de gthat is de guidiken or guy dickens english minister addressed him led him into the embrasure of a window and talked alone with him for more than an hour uncertain probably apocryphal this i threw from time to time a stolen glance at this dialogue which appeared to me to be very lively a moment after being just dancing with madame the countess dethree asterisksi felt myself twitched by the domino and turning was much surprised to see that it was the king who took me aside and said are your boots oiled vos bottes sontelles graissies are you ready for a journey i replied sire they will always be so for your majestys servicewell then truchsess and you are for england the day after tomorrow you go speak to m de podewilsthis was said like a flash of lightning his majesty passed into another apartment and i i went to finish my minuet with the lady who had been not less astonished to see me disappear from her eyes in the middle of the dance than i was at what the king said to me bielfeld i 167 168 next morning i  the fact is next morning truchsess and i began preparation for the court of londonand we did there for many months afterwards strive our best to keep the britannic majesty in some kind of tune amid the prevailing discord of eventsfact interesting to some and the other fact
