43987921	the literary remains   of samuel taylor coleridge  collected and edited by  henry nelson coleridge esq m a     to  joseph henry green esq  member of the royal college of surgeons  the approved friend  of  coleridge  these volumes  are  gratefully inscribed      preface   mr coleridge by his will dated in september 1829 authorized his executor if he should think it expedient to publish any of the notes or writing made by him mr c in his books or any other of his manuscripts or writings or any letters which should thereafter be collected from or supplied by his friends or correspondents agreeably to this authority an arrangement was made under the superintendence of mr green for the collection of coleridges literary remains and at the same time the preparation for the press of such part of the materials as should consist of criticism and general literature was entrusted to the care of the present editor the volumes now offered to the public are the first results of that arrangement they must in any case stand in need of much indulgence from the ingenuous readermulta sunt condonanda in opere postumo but a short statement of the difficulties attending the compilation may serve to explain some apparent anomalies and to preclude some unnecessary censure  the materials were fragmentary in the extremesibylline leavesnotes of the lecturer memoranda of the investigator outpourings of the solitary and selfcommuning student the fear of the press was not in them numerous as they were too they came to light or were communicated at different times before and after the printing was commenced and the dates the occasions and the references in most instances remained to be discovered or conjectured to give to such materials method and continuity as far as might beto set them forth in the least disadvantageous manner which the circumstances would permitwas a delicate and perplexing task and the editor is painfully sensible that he could bring few qualifications for the undertaking but such as were involved in a many years intercourse with the author himself a patient study of his writings a reverential admiration of his genius and an affectionate desire to help in extending its beneficial influence  the contents of these volumes are drawn from a portion only of the manuscripts entrusted to the editor the remainder of the collection which under favourable circumstances he hopes may hereafter see the light is at least of equal value with what is now presented to the reader as a sample in perusing the following pages the reader will in a few instances meet with disquisitions of a transcendental character which as a general rule have been avoided the truth is that they were sometimes found so indissolubly intertwined with the more popular matter which preceded and followed as to make separation impracticable there are very many to whom no apology will be necessary in this respect and the editor only adverts to it for the purpose of obviating as far as may be the possible complaint of the more general reader but there is another point to which taught by past experience he attaches more importance and as to which therefore he ventures to put in a more express and particular caution in many of the books and papers which have been used in the compilation of these volumes passages from other writers noted down by mr coleridge as in some way remarkable were mixed up with his own comments on such passages or with his reflections on other subjects in a manner very embarrassing to the eye of a third person undertaking to select the original matter after the lapse of several years the editor need not say that he has not knowingly admitted any thing that was not genuine without an express declaration as in vol i p 1 and in another instance vol ii p 379 he has intimated his own suspicion but besides these it is possible that some cases of mistake in this respect may have occurred there may be one or two passagesthey cannot well be moreprinted in these volumes which belong to other writers and if such there be the editor can only plead in excuse that the work has been prepared by him amidst many distractions and hope that in this instance at least no ungenerous use will be made of such a circumstance to the disadvantage of the author and that persons of greater reading or more retentive memories than the editor who may discover any such passages will do him the favour to communicate the fact  the editors motive in publishing the few poems and fragments included in these volumes was to make a supplement to the collected edition of coleridges poetical works in these fragments the reader will see the germs of several passages in the already published poems of the author but which the editor has not thought it necessary to notice more particularly the fall of robespierre a joint composition has been so long in print in the french edition of coleridges poems that independently of such merit as it may possess it seemed natural to adopt it upon the present occasion and to declare the true state of the authorship  to those who have been kind enough to communicate books and manuscripts for the purpose of the present publication the editor and through him mr coleridges executor return their grateful thanks in most cases a specific acknowledgement has been made but above and independently of all others it is to mr and mrs gillman and to mr green himself that the public are indebted for the preservation and use of the principal part of the contents of these volumes the claims of those respected individuals on the gratitude of the friends and admirers of coleridge and his works are already well known and in due season those claims will receive additional confirmation  with these remarks sincerely conscious of his own inadequate execution of the task assigned to him yet confident withal of the general worth of the contents of the following pagesthe editor commits the reliques of a great man to the indulgent consideration of the public  lincolns inn august 11 1836     lenvoy  he was one who with long and large arm still collected precious armfulls in whatever direction he pressed forward yet still took up so much more than he could keep together that those who followed him gleaned more from his continual droppings than he himself brought homenay made stately cornricks therewith while the reaper himself was still seen only with a strutting armful of newlycut sheaves but i should misinform you grossly if i left you to infer that his collections were a heap of incoherent miscellanea no the very contrary their variety conjoined with the too great coherency the too great both desire and power of referring them in systematic nay genetic subordination

of my grateful attachment the following dramatic poem in which i have endeavoured to detail in an interesting form the fall of a man whose great bad actions have cast a disastrous lustre on his name in the execution of the work as intricacy of plot could not have been attempted without a gross violation of recent facts it has been my sole aim to imitate the impassioned and highly figurative language of the french orators and to develope the characters of the chief actors on a vast stage of horrors  yours fraternally  s t coleridge  jesus college september 22 1794    the fall of robespierre  an historic drama 1794 1  footnote 1 the origin and authorship of the fall of robespierre will be best explained by the following extract from a letter from mr southey to the editor  this is the history of the fall of robespierre it originated in sportive conversation at poor lovells and we agreed each to produce an act by the next evenings t c the first i the second and lovell the third s t c brought part of his i and lovell the whole of ours but ls was not in keeping and therefore i undertook to supply the third also by the following day by that time s t c had filled up his a dedication to mrs hannah more was concocted and the notable performance was offered for sale to a bookseller in bristol who was too wise to buy it your uncle took the mss with him to cambridge and there rewrote the first act at leisure and published it my portion i never saw from the time it was written till the whole was before the world it was written with newspapers before me as fast as newspaper could be put into blank verse i have no desire to claim it now or hereafter but neither am i ashamed of it and if you think proper to print the whole so be it  the fall of robespierre a

he reverted with strong compunction to a sentiment which he had expressed in earlier days upon prayer in one of his youthful poems speaking of god he had said    of whose allseeing eye   aught to demand were impotence of mind  this sentiment he now so utterly condemned that on the contrary he told me as his own peculiar opinion that the act of praying was the highest energy of which the human heart was capablepraying that is with the total concentration of the faculties and the great mass of worldly men and of learned men he pronounced absolutely incapable of praying  mr de quincey in

fellan unusual thing for himinto a long account of many passages of his past life lamenting some things condemning others but complaining withal though very gently of the way in which many of his most innocent acts had been cruelly misrepresented but i have no difficulty said he in forgiveness indeed i know not how to say with sincerity the clause in the lords prayer which asks forgiveness as we forgive i feel nothing answering to it in my heart neither do i find or reckon the most solemn faith in god as a real object the most arduous act of the reason and willo no my dear it is to pray to pray as god would have us this is what at times makes me turn cold to my soul believe me to pray with all your heart and strength with the reason and the will to believe vividly that god will listen to your voice through christ and verily do the thing he pleaseth thereuponthis is the last the greatest achievement of the christians warfare on earth teach us to pray o lord and then he burst into a

force of this objection but alas explosion has succeeded explosion so rapidly that novelty itself ceases to appear new and it is possible that now even a simple story wholly uninspired with politics

there are few families at present in the higher and middle classes of english society in which literary topics and the productions of the fine arts in some one or other of their various forms do not occasionally take their turn in contributing to the entertainment of the social board and the amusement of the circle at the fire side the acquisitions and attainments of the intellect ought indeed to hold a very inferior rank in our estimation opposed to moral worth or even to professional and specific skill prudence and industry but why should they be opposed when they may be made subservient merely by being subordinated it can rarely happen that a man of social disposition altogether a stranger to subjects of taste almost the only ones on which persons of both sexes can converse with a common interest should pass through the world without at times feeling dissatisfied with himself the best proof of this is to be found in the marked anxiety which men who have succeeded in life without the aid of these accomplishments shew in securing them to their children a young man of ingenuous mind will not wilfully deprive himself of any species of respect he will wish to feel himself on a level with the average of the society in which he lives though he may be ambitious of distinguishing himself only in his own immediate pursuit or occupation  under this conviction the following course of lectures was planned the several titles will best explain the particular subjects and purposes of each but the main objects proposed as the result of all are the two following  1 to convey in a form best fitted to render them impressive at the time and remembered afterwards rules and principles of sound judgment with a kind and degree of connected information such as the hearers cannot generally be supposed likely to form collect and arrange for themselves by their own unassisted studies it might be presumption to say that any important part of these lectures could not be derived from books but none i trust in supposing that the same information could not be so surely or conveniently acquired from such books as are of commonest occurrence or with that quantity of time and attention which can be reasonably expected or even wisely desired of men engaged in business and the active duties of the world  2 under a strong persuasion that little of real value is derived by persons in general from a wide and various reading but still more deeply convinced as to the actual mischief of unconnected and promiscuous reading and that it is sure in a greater or less degree to enervate even where it does not likewise inflate i hope to satisfy many an ingenuous mind seriously interested in its own development and cultivation how moderate a number of volumes if only they be judiciously chosen will suffice for the attainment of every wise and desirable purpose that is in addition to those which he studies for specific and professional purposes it is saying less than the truth to affirm that an excellent book and the remark holds almost equally good of a raphael as of a milton is like a well chosen and well tended fruit tree its fruits are not of one season only with the due and natural intervals we may recur to it year after year and it will supply the same nourishment and the same gratification if only we ourselves return to it with the same healthful appetite  the subjects of the lectures are indeed very different but not in the strict sense of the term diverse they are various rather than miscellaneous there is this bond of connexion common to them allthat the mental pleasure which they are calculated to excite is not dependent on accidents of fashion place or age or the events or the customs of the day but commensurate with the good sense taste and feeling to the cultivation of which they themselves so largely contribute as being all in kind though not all in the same degree productions of genius  what it would be arrogant to promise i may yet be permitted to hopethat the execution will prove correspondent and adequate to the plan assuredly my best efforts have not been wanting so to select and prepare the materials that at the conclusion of the lectures an attentive auditor who should consent to aid his future recollection by a few notes taken either during each lecture or soon after would rarely feel himself for the time to come excluded from taking an intelligent interest in any general conversation likely to occur in mixed society   syllabus of the course  i january 27 1818on the manners morals literature philosophy

writing prose a few easy rules for the attainment of a manly unaffected and pure language in our genuine mother tongue whether for the purpose of writing oratory or conversation     lecture i 1  general character of the gothic mind in the middle ages   mr coleridge began by treating of the races of mankind as descended from shem ham and japhet and therein of the early condition of man in his antique form he then dwelt on the preeminence of the greeks in art and philosophy and noticed the suitableness of polytheism to small insulated states in which patriotism acted as a substitute for religion in destroying or suspending self afterwards in consequence of the extension of the roman empire some universal or common spirit became necessary for the conservation of the vast body and this common spirit was in fact produced in christianity the causes of the decline of the roman empire were in operation long before the time of the actual overthrow that overthrow had been foreseen by many eminent romans especially by seneca in fact there was under the empire an italian and a german party in rome and in the end the latter prevailed  he then proceeded to describe the generic character of the northern nations and defined it as an independence of the whole in the freedom of the individual noticing their respect for women and their consequent chivalrous spirit in war and how evidently the participation in the general council laid the foundation of the representative form of government the only rational mode of preserving individual liberty in opposition to the licentious democracy of the ancient republics  he called our attention to the peculiarity of their art and showed how it entirely depended on a symbolical expression of the infinitewhich is not vastness nor immensity nor perfection but whatever cannot be circumscribed within the limits of actual sensuous being in the ancient art on the contrary every thing was finite and material accordingly sculpture was not attempted by the gothic races till the ancient specimens were discovered whilst painting and architecture were of native growth amongst them in the earliest specimens of the paintings of modern ages as in those of giotto and his associates in the cemetery at pisa this complexity variety and symbolical character are evident and are more fully developed in the mightier works of michel angelo and raffael the contemplation of the works of antique art excites a feeling of elevated beauty and exalted notions of the human self but the gothic architecture impresses the beholder with a sense of selfannihilation he becomes as it were a part of the work contemplated an endless complexity and variety are united into one whole the plan of which is not distinct from the execution a gothic cathedral is the petrefaction of our religion the only work of truly modern sculpture is the moses of michel angelo  the northern nations were prepared by their own previous religion for christianity they for the most part received it gladly and it took root as in a native soil the deference to woman characteristic of the gothic races combined itself with devotion in the idea of the virgin mother and gave rise to many beautiful associations  mr c remarked how gothic an instrument in origin and character the organ was  he also enlarged on the influence of female character on our education the first impressions of our childhood being derived from women amongst oriental nations he said the only distinction was between lord and slave with the antique greeks the will of every one conflicting with the will of all produced licentiousness with the modern descendants from the northern stocks both these extremes were shut out to reappear mixed and condensed into this principle or tempersubmission but with free choiceillustrated in chivalrous devotion to women as such in attachment to the sovereign c  footnote 1 from mr greens note taken at the delivery ed     lecture ii 1  general character op the gothic literature and art   in my last lecture i stated that the descendants of japhet and shem peopled europe and asia fulfilling in their distribution the prophecies of scripture while the descendants of ham passed into africa there also actually verifying the interdiction pronounced against them the keltic and teutonic nations occupied that part of europe which is now france britain germany sweden denmark c they were in general a hardy race possessing great fortitude and capable of great endurance the romans slowly conquered the more southerly portion of their tribes and succeeded only by their superior arts their policy and better discipline after a time when the gothsto use the name of the noblest and most historical of the teutonic tribeshad acquired some knowledge of these arts from mixing with their conquerors they invaded the roman territories the hardy habits the steady perseverance the better faith of the enduring goth rendered him too formidable an enemy for the corrupt roman who was more inclined to purchase the subjection of his enemy than to go through the suffering necessary to secure it the conquest of the romans gave to the goths the christian religion as it was then existing in italy and the light and graceful building of grecian or romangreek order became singularly combined with the massy architecture of the goths as wild and varied as the forest vegetation which it resembled the greek art is beautiful when i enter a greek church my eye is charmed and my mind elated i feel exalted and proud that i am a man but the gothic art is sublime on entering a cathedral i am filled with devotion and with awe i am lost to the actualities that surround me and my whole being expands into the infinite earth and air nature and art all swell up into eternity and the only sensible impression left is that i am nothing this religion while it tended to soften the manners of the northern tribes was at the same time highly congenial to their nature the goths are free from the stain of hero worship gazing on their rugged mountains surrounded by impassable forests accustomed to gloomy seasons they lived in the bosom of nature and worshipped an invisible and unknown deity firm in his faith domestic in his habits the life of the goth was simple and dignified yet tender and affectionate  the greeks were remarkable for complacency and completion they delighted in whatever pleased the eye to them it was not enough to have merely the idea of a divinity they must have it placed before them shaped in the most perfect symmetry and presented with the nicest judgment and if we look upon any greek production of art the beauty of its parts and the harmony of their union the complete and complacent effect of the whole are the striking characteristics it is the same in their poetry in homer you have a poem perfect in its form whether originally so or from the labour of after critics i know not his descriptions are pictures brought vividly before you and as far as the eye and understanding are concerned i am indeed gratified but if i wish my feelings to be affected if i wish my heart to be touched if i wish to melt into sentiment and tenderness i must turn to the heroic songs of the goths to the poetry of the middle ages the worship of statues in greece had in a civil sense its advantage and disadvantage advantage in promoting statuary and the arts disadvantage in bringing their gods too much on a level with human beings and thence depriving them of their dignity and gradually giving rise to scepticism and ridicule but no statue no artificial emblem could satisfy the northmans mind the dark wild imagery of nature which surrounded him and the freedom of his life gave his mind a tendency to the infinite so that he found rest in that which presented no end and derived satisfaction from that which was indistinct  we have few and uncertain vestiges of gothic literature till the time of theodoric who encouraged his subjects to write and who made a collection of their poems these consisted chiefly of heroic songs sung at the court for at that time this was the custom charlemagne in the beginning of the ninth century greatly encouraged letters and made a further collection of the poems of his time among which were several epic poems of great merit or rather in strictness there was a vast cycle of heroic poems or minstrelsies from and out of which separate poems were composed the form of poetry was however for the most part the metrical romance and heroic tale charlemagnes army or a large division of it was utterly destroyed in the pyrenees when returning from a successful attack on the arabs of navarre and arragon yet the name of roncesvalles became famous in the songs of the gothic poets the greeks and romans would not have done this they would not have recorded in heroic verse the death and defeat of their fellowcountrymen but the goths firm in their faith with a constancy not to be shaken celebrated those brave men who died for their religion and their country what though they had been defeated they died without fear as they had lived without reproach they left no stain on their names for they fell fighting for their god their liberty and their rights and the song that sang that days reverse animated them to future victory and certain vengeance  i must now turn to our great monarch alfred one of the most august characters that any age has ever produced and when i picture him after the toils of government and the dangers of battle seated by a solitary lamp translating the holy scriptures into the saxon tonguewhen i reflect on his moderation in success on his fortitude and perseverance in difficulty and defeat and on the wisdom and extensive nature of his legislation i am really at a loss which part of this great mans character most to admire yet above all i see the grandeur the freedom the mildness the domestic unity the universal character of the middle ages condensed into alfreds glorious institution of the trial by jury i gaze upon it as the immortal symbol of that agean age called indeed darkbut how could that age be considered dark which solved the difficult problem of universal liberty freed man from the shackles of tyranny and subjected his actions to the decision of twelve of his fellow countrymen the liberty of the greeks was a phenomenon a meteor which blazed for a short time and then sank into eternal darkness it was a combination of most opposite materials slavery and liberty such can neither be happy nor lasting the goths on the other hand said you shall be our emperor but we must be princes on our own estates and over them you shall have no power the vassals said to their prince we will serve you in your wars and defend your castle but we must have liberty in our own circle our cottage our cattle our proportion of land the cities said we acknowledge you for our emperor but we must have our walls and our strong holds and be governed by our own laws thus all combined yet all were separate all served yet all were free such a government could not exist in a dark age our ancestors may not indeed have been deep in the metaphysics of the schools they may not have shone in the fine arts but much knowledge of human nature much practical wisdom must have existed amongst them when this admirable constitution was formed and i believe it is a decided truth though certainly an awful lesson that nations are not the most happy at the time when literature and the arts flourish the most among them  the translations i had promised in my syllabus i shall defer to the end of the course when i shall give a single lecture of recitations illustrative of the different ages of poetry there is one northern tale i will relate as it is one from which shakspeare derived that strongly marked and extraordinary scene between richard iii and the lady anne it may not be equal to that in strength and genius but it is undoubtedly superior in decorum and delicacy  a knight had slain a prince the lord of a strong castle in combat he afterwards contrived to get into the castle where he obtained an interview with the princesss attendant whose life he had saved in some encounter he told her of his love for her mistress and won her to his interest she then slowly and gradually worked on her mistresss mind spoke of the beauty of his person the fire of his eyes the sweetness of his voice his valour in the field his gentleness in the court in short by watching her opportunities she at last filled the princesss soul with this one image she became restless sleep forsook her her curiosity to see this knight became strong but her maid still deferred the interview till at length she confessed she was in love with himthe knight is then introduced and the nuptials are quickly celebrated  in this age there was a tendency in writers to the droll and the grotesque and in the little dramas which at that time existed there were singular instances of these it was the disease of the age it is a remarkable fact that luther and melancthon the great religious reformers of that day should have strongly recommended for the education of children dramas which at present would be considered highly indecorous if not bordering on a deeper sin from one which they particularly recommended i will give a few extracts more i should not think it right to do the play opens with  adam and eve washing and dressing their children to appear before the lord who is coming from heaven to hear them repeat the lords prayer belief c in the next scene the lord appears seated like a schoolmaster with the children standing round when cain who is behind hand and a sad pickle comes running in with a bloody nose and his hat on adam says what with your hat on cain then goes up to shake hands with the almighty when adam says giving him a cuff ah would you give your left hand to the lord at length cain takes his place in the class and it becomes his turn to say the lords prayer at this time the devil a constant attendant at that time makes his appearance and getting behind cain whispers in his ear instead of the lords prayer cain gives it so changed by the transposition of the words that the meaning is reversed yet this is so artfully done by the author that it is exactly as an obstinate child would answer who knows his lesson yet does not choose to say it in the last scene horses in rich trappings and carriages covered with gold are introduced and the good children are to ride in them and be lord mayors lords c cain and the bad ones are to be made cobblers and tinkers and only to associate with such  this with numberless others was written by hans sachs our simple ancestors firm in their faith and pure in their morals were only amused by these pleasantries as they seemed to them and neither they nor the reformers feared their having any influence hostile to religion when i was many years back in the north of germany there were several innocent superstitions in practice among others at christmas presents used to be given to the children by the parents and they were delivered on christmas day by a person who personated and was supposed by the children to be christ early on christmas morning he called knocking loudly at the door and having received his instructions left presents for the good and a rod for the bad those who have since been in germany have found this custom relinquished it was considered profane and irrational yet they have not found the children better nor the mothers more careful of their offspring they have not found their devotion more fervent their faith more strong nor their morality more pure 2  footnote 1 from mr william

troubadoursboccacciopetrarchpulcchaucerspenser  the last lecture was allotted to an investigation into the origin and character of a species of poetry the least influenced of any by the literature of greece and romethat in which the portion contributed by the gothic conquerors the predilections and general tone or habit of thought and feeling brought by our remote ancestors with them from the forests of germany or the deep dells and rocky mountains of norway are the most prominent in the present lecture i must introduce you to a species of poetry which had its birthplace near the centre of roman glory and in which as might be anticipated the influences of the greek and roman muse are far more conspicuousas great indeed as the efforts of intentional imitation on the part of the poets themselves could render them but happily for us and for their own fame the intention of the writers as men is often at complete variance with the genius of the same men as poets to the force of their intention we owe their mythological ornaments and the greater definiteness of their imagery and their passion for the beautiful the voluptuous and the artificial we must in part attribute to the same intention but in part likewise to their natural dispositions and tastes for the same climate and many of the same circumstances were acting on them which had acted on the great classics whom they were endeavouring to imitate but the love of the marvellous the deeper sensibility the higher reverence for womanhood the characteristic spirit of sentiment and courtesythese were the heirlooms of nature which still regained the ascendant whenever the use of the living motherlanguage enabled the inspired poet to appear instead of the toilsome scholar  from this same union in which the soul if i may dare so express myself was gothic while the outward forms and a majority of the words themselves were the reliques of the roman arose the romance or romantic language in which the troubadours or lovesingers of provence sang and wrote and the different dialects of which have been modified into the modern italian spanish and portuguese while the language of the trouveurs trouveres or normanfrench poets forms the intermediate link between the romance or modified roman and the teutonic including the dutch danish swedish and the upper and lower german as being the modified gothic and as the northernmost extreme of the normanfrench or that part of the link in which it formed on the teutonic we must take the normanenglish minstrels and metrical romances from the greater predominance of the anglosaxon gothic in the derivation of the words i mean that the language of the english metrical romance is less romanized and has fewer words not originally of a northern origin than the same romances in the normanfrench which is the more striking because the former were for the most part translated from the latter the authors of which seem to have eminently merited their name of trouveres or inventors thus then we have a chain with two rings or staplesat the southern end there is the roman or latin at the northern end the keltic teutonic or gothic and the links beginning with the southern end are the romance including the provençal the italian spanish and portuguese with their different dialects then the normanfrench and lastly the english  my object in adverting to the italian poets is not so much for their own sakes in which point of view dante and ariosto alone would have required separate lectures but for the elucidation of the merits of our countrymen as to what extent we must consider them as fortunate imitators of their italian predecessors and in what points they have the higher claims of original genius of dante i am to speak elsewhere of boccaccio who has little interest as a metrical poet in any respect and none for my present purpose except perhaps as the reputed inventor or introducer of the octave stanza in his teseide it will be sufficient to say that we owe to him the subjects of numerous poems taken from his famous tales the happy art of narration and the still greater merit of a depth and fineness in the workings of the passions in which last excellence as likewise in the wild and imaginative character of the situations his almost neglected romances appear to me greatly to excel his far famed decameron to him too we owe the more doubtful merit of having introduced into the italian prose and by the authority of his name and the influence of his example more or less throughout europe the long interwoven periods and architectural structure which arose from the very nature of their language in the greek writers but which already in the latin orators and historians had betrayed a species of effort a foreign something which had been superinduced on the language instead of growing out of it and which was far too alien from that individualizing and confederating yet not blending character of the north to become permanent although its magnificence and stateliness were objects of admiration and occasional imitation this style diminished the control of the writer over the inner feelings of men and created too great a charm between the body and the life and hence especially it was abandoned by luther  but lastly to boccaccios sanction we must trace a large portion of the mythological pedantry and incongruous paganisms which for so long a period deformed the poetry even of the truest poets to such an extravagance did boccaccio himself carry this folly that in a romance of chivalry he has uniformly styled god the father jupiter our saviour apollo and the evil being pluto but for this there might be some excuse pleaded i dare make none for the gross and disgusting licentiousness the daring profaneness which rendered the decameron of boccaccio the parent of a hundred worse children fit to be classed among the enemies of the human race which poisons ariostofor that i may not speak oftener than necessary of so odious a subject i mention it here once for allwhich interposes a painful mixture in the humour of chaucer and which has once or twice seduced even our pureminded spenser into a grossness as heterogeneous from the spirit of his great poem as it was alien to the delicacy of his morals   petrarch  born at arezzo 1304died 1374  petrarch was the final blossom and

and lorenzo the magnificent his morgante has been attributed in part at least1 to the assistance of marsilius ficinus and by others the whole has been attributed to politian the first conjecture is utterly improbable the last is possible indeed on account of the licentiousness of the poem but there are no direct grounds for believing it the morgante maggiore 2 is the first proper romance although perhaps pulci had the teseide before him the story is taken from the fabulous history of turpin and if the author had any distinct object it seems to have been that of making himself merry with the absurdities of the old romancers the morgante sometimes makes you think of rabelais it contains the most remarkable guess or allusion upon the subject of america that can be found in any book published before the discovery 3 the well known passage in the tragic seneca is not to be compared with it the copia verborum of the mother florentine tongue and the easiness of his style afterwards brought to perfection by berni are the chief merits of pulci his chief demerit is his heartless spirit of jest and buffoonery by which sovereigns and their courtiers were flattered by the degradation of nature and the impossibilification of a pretended virtue  footnote 1 meaning the 25th canto ed  footnote 2 the morgante was printed in 1488 ed  footnote 3  the reference is of course to the following stanzas                  disse astarotte un error lungo e fioco                 per molti secol non ben conosciuto                 fa che si dice d ercol le colonne                 e che più

whom he is the best representative in english he had great powers of invention as in shakspeare his characters represent classes but in a different manner shakspeares characters are the representatives of the interior nature of humanity in which some element has become so predominant as to destroy the health of the mind whereas chaucers are rather representatives of classes of manners he is therefore more led to individualize in a mere personal sense observe chaucers love of nature and how happily the subject of his main work is chosen when you reflect that the company in the decameron have retired to a place of safety from the raging of a pestilence their mirth provokes a sense of their unfeelingness whereas in chaucer nothing of this sort occurs and the scheme of a party on a pilgrimage with different ends and occupations aptly allows of the greatest variety of expression in the tales    footnote 1 from mr greens note ed      spenser  born in london 1553died 1599  there is this difference among many others between shakspeare and spensershakspeare is never coloured by the customs of his age what appears of contemporary character in him is merely negative it is just not something else he has none of the fictitious realities of the classics none of the grotesquenesses of chivalry none of the allegory of the middle ages there is no sectarianism either of politics or religion no miser no witchno common witchno astrologynothing impermanent of however long duration but he stands like the yew tree in lorton vale which has known so many ages that it belongs to none in particular a living image of endless selfreproduction like the immortal tree of malabar in spenser the spirit of chivalry is entirely predominant although with a much greater infusion of the poets own individual self into it than is found in any other writer he has the wit of the southern with the deeper inwardness of the northern genius  no one can appreciate spenser without some reflection on the nature of allegorical writing the mere etymological meaning of the word allegoryto talk of one thing and thereby convey anotheris too wide the true sense is thisthe employment of one set of agents and images to convey in disguise a moral meaning with a likeness to the imagination but with a difference to the understandingthose agents and images being so combined as to form a homogeneous whole this distinguishes it from metaphor which is part of an allegory but allegory is not properly distinguishable from fable otherwise than as the first includes the second as a genus its species for in a fable there must be nothing but what is universally known and acknowledged but in an allegory there may be that which is new and not previously admitted the pictures of the great masters especially of the italian schools are genuine allegories amongst the classics the multitude of their gods either precluded allegory altogether or else made every thing allegory as in the hesiodic theogonia for you can scarcely distinguish between power and the personification of power the cupid and psyche of or found in apuleius is a phenomenon it is the platonic mode of accounting for the fall of man the battle of the soul 1 by prudentius is an early instance of christian allegory  narrative allegory is distinguished from mythology as reality from symbol it is in short the proper intermedium between person and personification where it is too strongly individualized it ceases to be allegory this is often felt in the pilgrims progress where the characters are real persons with nick names perhaps one of the most curious warnings against another attempt at narrative allegory on a great scale may be found in tassos account of what he himself intended in and by his jerusalem delivered  as characteristic of spenser i would call your particular attention in the first place to the indescribable sweetness and fluent projection of his verse very clearly distinguishable from the deeper and more inwoven harmonies of shakspeare and milton this stanza is a good instance of what i mean     yet she most faithfull ladie all this while   forsaken wofull solitarie mayd   far from all peoples preace as in exile   in wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd   to seeke her knight who subtily betrayd   through that late vision which th enchaunter wrought   had her abandond she of nought affrayd   through woods and wastnes wide him daily sought   yet wished tydinges none of him unto her brought  f qu b i c 3 st 3   2 combined with this sweetness and fluency the scientific construction of the metre of the faery queene is very noticeable one of spensers arts is that of alliteration and he uses it with great effect in doubling the impression of an image     in wildernesse and wastful deserts   through woods and wastnes wilde   they passe the bitter waves of acheron   where many soules sit wailing woefully   and come to fiery flood of phlegeton   whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry   and with sharp shrilling shrieks doth bootlesse cryc   he is particularly given to an alternate alliteration which is perhaps when well used a great secret in melody     a ramping lyon rushed suddenly   and sad to see her sorrowful constraint   and on the grasse her daintie limbes did layc   you cannot read a page of the faery queene if you read for that purpose without perceiving the intentional alliterativeness of the words and yet so skilfully is this managed that it never strikes any unwarned ear as artificial or other than the result of the necessary movement of the verse  3 spenser displays great skill in harmonizing his descriptions of external nature and actual incidents with the allegorical character and epic activity of the poem take these two beautiful passages as illustrations of what i mean     by this the northerne wagoner had set   his sevenfol teme behind the stedfast starre   that was in ocean waves yet never wet   but firme is fixt and sendeth light from farre   to all that in the wide deepe wandring arre   and chearefull chaunticlere with his note shrill   had warned once that phoebus fiery carre   in hast was climbing up the easterne hill   full envious that night so long his roome did fill    when those accursed messengers of hell   that feigning dreame and that faireforged spright   came c  b i c 2 st 1      at last the golden orientall gate   of greatest heaven gan to open fayre   and phoebus fresh as brydegrome to his mate   came dauncing forth shaking his deawie hayre   and hurld his glistring beams through gloomy ayre   which when the wakeful elfe perceivd streightway   he started up and did him selfe prepayre   in sunbright armes and battailons array   for with that pagan proud he combat will that day  ib c 5 st 2   observe also the exceeding vividness of spensers descriptions they are not in the true sense of the word picturesque but are composed of a wondrous series of images as in our dreams compare the following passage with any thing you may remember in pari materia in milton or shakspeare     his haughtie helmet horrid all with gold   both glorious brightnesse and great terrour bredd   for all the crest a dragon did enfold   with greedie pawes and over all did spredd   his golden winges his dreadfull hideous hedd   close couched on the bever seemd to throw   from flaming mouth bright sparkles fiery redd   that suddeine horrour to faint hartes did show   and scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his back full low    upon the top of all his loftie crest   a bounch of haires discolourd diversly   with sprinkled pearle and gold full richly drest   did shake and seemd to daunce for jollitie   like to an almond tree ymounted hye   on top of greene selinis all alone   with blossoms brave bedecked daintily   whose tender locks do tremble every one   at everie little breath that under heaven is blowne  ib c 7 st 312   4 you will take especial note of the marvellous independence and true imaginative absence of all particular space or time in the faery queene it is in the domains neither of history or geography it is ignorant of all artificial boundary all material obstacles it is truly in land of faery that is of mental space the poet has placed you in a dream a charmed sleep and you neither wish nor have the power to inquire where you are or how you got there it reminds me of some lines of my own     oh would to alla   the raven or the seamew were appointed   to bring me foodor rather that my soul   might draw in life from the universal air   it were a lot divine in some small skiff   along some oceans boundless solitude   to float for ever with a careless course   and think myself the only being alive  remorse act iv sc 3   indeed spenser himself in the conduct of his great poem may be represented under the same image his symbolizing purpose being his mariners compass     as pilot well expert in perilous wave   that to a stedfast starre his course hath bent   when foggy mistes or cloudy tempests have   the faithfull light of that faire lampe yblent   and coverd heaven with hideous dreriment   upon his card and compas firmes his eye   the maysters of his long experiment   and to them does the steddy helme apply   bidding his winged vessell fairely forward fly  b ii c 7 st 1  so the poet through the realms of allegory  5 you should note the quintessential character of christian chivalry in all his characters but more especially in his women the greeks except perhaps in homer seem to have had no way of making their women interesting but by unsexing them as in the instances of the tragic medea electra c contrast such characters with spensers una who exhibits no prominent feature has no particularization but produces the same feeling that a statue does when contemplated at a distance     from her fayre head her fillet she undight   and layd her stole aside her angels face   as the great eye of heaven shyned bright   and made a sunshine in the shady place   did never mortal eye behold such heavenly grace  b i c 3 st 4   6 in spenser we see the brightest and purest form of that nationality which was so common a characteristic of our elder poets there is nothing unamiable nothing contemptuous of others in it to glorify their countryto elevate england into a queen an empress of the heartthis was their passion and object and how dear and important an object it was or may be let spain in the recollection of her cid declare there is a great magic in national names what a damper to all interest is a list of native east indian merchants unknown names are nonconductors they stop all sympathy no one of our poets has touched this string more exquisitely than spenser especially in his chronicle of the british kings b ii c 10 and the marriage of the thames with the medway b iv c 11 in both which passages the mere names constitute half the pleasure we receive to the same feeling we must in particular attribute spensers sweet reference to ireland     ne thence the irishe rivers absent were   sith no lesse famous than the rest they be c  ib       and mulla mine whose waves i whilom taught to weep  ib    and there is a beautiful passage of the same sort in the colin clouts come home again     one day quoth he i sat as was my trade under the foot of mole     c   lastly the great and prevailing character of spensers mind is fancy under the conditions of imagination as an ever present but not always active power he has an imaginative fancy but he has not imagination in kind or degree as shakspeare and milton have the boldest effort of his powers in this way is the character of talus2 add to this a feminine tenderness and almost maidenly purity of feeling and above all a deep moral earnestness which produces a believing sympathy and acquiescence in the reader and you have a tolerably adequate view of spensers intellectual being  footnote 1 psychomachia ed  footnote 2 b 5 legend of artegall ed      lecture vii   ben jonson beaumont and fletcher and massinger  a contemporary is rather an ambiguous term when applied to authors it may simply mean that one man lived and wrote while another was yet alive however deeply the former may have been indebted to the latter as his model there have been instances in the literary world that might remind a botanist of a singular sort of parasite plant which rises above ground independent and unsupported an apparent original but trace its roots and you will find the fibres all terminating in the root of another plant at an unsuspected distance which perhaps from want of sun and genial soil and the loss of sap has scarcely been able to peep above the groundor the word may mean those whose compositions were contemporaneous in such a sense as to preclude all likelihood of the one having borrowed from the other in the latter sense i should call ben jonson a contemporary of shakspeare though he long survived him while i should prefer the phrase of immediate successors for beaumont and fletcher and massinger though they too were shakspeares contemporaries in the former sense    ben jonson 1 born 1574died 1637  ben jonson is original he is indeed the only one of the great dramatists of that day who was not either directly produced or very greatly modified by shakspeare in truth he differs from our great master in every thingin form and in substanceand betrays no tokens of his proximity he is not original in the same way as shakspeare is original but after a fashion of his own ben jonson is most truly original  the characters in his plays are in the strictest sense of the term abstractions some very prominent feature is taken from the whole man and that single feature or humour is made the basis upon which the entire character is built up ben jonsons dramatis personae are almost as fixed as the masks of the ancient actors you know from the first scenesometimes from the list of namesexactly what every one of them is to be he was a very accurately observing man but he cared only to observe what was external or open to and likely to impress the senses he individualizes not so much if at all by the exhibition of moral or intellectual differences as by the varieties and contrasts of manners modes of speech and tricks of temper as in such characters as puntarvolo bobadill c  i believe there is not one whim or affectation in common life noted in any memoir of that age which may not be found drawn and framed in some corner or other of ben jonsons dramas and they have this merit in common with hogarths prints that not a single circumstance is introduced in them which does not play upon and help to bring out the dominant humour or humours of the piece indeed i ought very particularly to call your attention to the extraordinary skill shown by ben jonson in contriving situations for the display of his characters in fact his care and anxiety in this matter led him to do what scarcely any of the dramatists of that age didthat is invent his plots it is not a first perusal that suffices for the full perception of the elaborate artifice of the plots of the alchemist and the silent womanthat of the former is absolute perfection for a necessary entanglement and an unexpected yet natural evolution  ben jonson exhibits a sterling english diction and he has with great skill contrived varieties of construction but his style is rarely sweet or harmonious in consequence of his labour at point and strength being so evident in all his works in verse or prose there is an extraordinary opulence of thought but it is the produce of an amassing power in the author and not of a growth from within indeed a large proportion of ben jonsons thoughts may be traced to classic or obscure modern writers by those who are learned and curious enough to follow the steps of this robust surly and observing dramatist  footnote 1 from mr greens note ed     beaumont born 1586died 1616  fletcher born 1576died 1625   mr weber to whose taste industry and appropriate erudition we owe i will not say the best for that would be saying little but a good edition of beaumont and fletcher has complimented the philaster which he himself describes as inferior to the maids tragedy by the same writers as but little below the noblest of shakspeares plays lear macbeth othello c and consequently implying the equality at least of the maids tragedyand an eminent living criticwho in the manly wit strong sterling sense and robust style of his original works had presented the best possible credentials of office as chargé daffaires of literature in generaland who by his edition of massingera work in which there was more for an editor to do and in which more was actually well done than in any similar work within my knowledgehas proved an especial right of authority in the appreciation of dramatic poetry and hath potentially a double voice with the public in his own right and in that of the critical synod where as princeps senatus he possesses it by his prerogativehas affirmed that shakspeares superiority to his contemporaries rests on his superior wit alone while in all the other and as i should deem higher excellencies of the drama character pathos depth of thought c he is equalled by beaumont and fletcher ben jonson and massinger 1  of wit i am engaged to treat in another lecture it is a genus of many species and at present i shall only say that the species which is predominant in shakspeare is so completely shakspearian and in its essence so interwoven with all his other characteristic excellencies that i am equally incapable of comprehending both how it can be detached from his other powers and how being disparate in kind from the wit of contemporary dramatists it can be compared with theirs in degree and againthe detachment and the practicability of the comparison being grantedi should i confess be rather inclined to concede the contraryand in the most common species of wit and in the ordinary application of the term to yield this particular palm to beaumont and fletcher whom here and hereafter i take as one poet with two namesleaving undivided what a rare love and still rarer congeniality have united at least i have never been able to distinguish the presence of fletcher during the life of beaumont nor the absence of beaumont during the survival of fletcher  but waiving or rather deferring this question i protest against the remainder of the position in toto and indeed whilst i can never i trust show myself blind to the various merits of jonson beaumont and fletcher and massinger or insensible to the greatness of the merits which they possess in common or to the specific excellencies which give to each of the three a worth of his owni confess that one main object of this lecture was to prove that shakspeares eminence is his own and not that of his ageeven as the pineapple the melon and the gourd may grow on the same bedyea the same circumstances of warmth and soil may be necessary to their full development yet do not account for the golden hue the ambrosial flavour the perfect shape of the pineapple or the tufted crown on its head would that those who seek to twist it off could but promise us in this instance to make it the germ of an equal successor  what had a grammatical and logical consistency for the earwhat could be put together and represented to the eyethese poets took from the ear and eye unchecked by any intuition of an inward impossibility just as a man might put together a quarter of an orange a quarter of an apple and the like of a lemon and a pomegranate and make it look like one round diversecoloured fruit but nature which works from within by evolution and assimilation according to a law cannot do so nor could shakspeare for he too worked in the spirit of nature by evolving the germ from within by the imaginative power according to an idea for as the power of seeing is to light so is an idea in mind to a law in nature they are correlatives which suppose each other  the plays of beaumont and fletcher are mere aggregations without unity in the shakspearian drama there is a vitality which grows and evolves itself from withina key note which guides and controls the harmonies throughout what is learit is storm and tempestthe thunder at first grumbling in the far horizon then gathering around us and at length bursting in fury over our headssucceeded by a breaking of the clouds for a while a last flash of lightning the closing in of night and the single hope of darkness and romeo and julietit is a spring day gusty and beautiful in the morn and closing like an april evening with the song of the nightingalewhilst macbeth is deep and earthycomposed to the subterranean music of a troubled conscience which converts every thing into the wild and fearful  doubtless from mere observation or from the occasional similarity of the writers own character more or less in beaumont and fletcher and other such writers will happen to be in correspondence with nature and still more in apparent compatibility with it but yet the false source is always discoverable first by the gross contradictions to nature in so many other parts and secondly by the want of the impression which shakspeare makes that the thing said not only might have been said but that nothing else could be substituted so as to excite the same sense of its exquisite propriety i have always thought the conduct and expressions of othello and iago in the last scene when iago is brought in prisoner a wonderful instance of shakspeares consummate judgment     oth i look down towards his feetbut thats a fable if that thou     best a devil i cannot kill thee    iago i bleed sir but not killd    oth i am not sorry neither   think what a volley of execrations and defiances beaumont and fletcher would have poured forth here  indeed massinger and ben jonson are both more perfect in their kind than beaumont and fletcher the former in the story and affecting incidents the latter in the exhibition of manners and peculiarities whims in language and vanities of appearance  there is however a diversity of the most dangerous kind here shakspeare shaped his characters out of the nature within but we cannot so safely say out of his own nature as an individual person no this latter is itself but a natura naturataan effect a product not a power it was shakspeares prerogative to have the universal which is potentially in each particular opened out to him the homo generalis not as an abstraction from observation of a variety of men but as the substance capable of endless modifications of which his own personal existence was but one and to use this one as the eye that beheld the other and as the tongue that could convey the discovery there is no greater or more common vice in dramatic writers than to draw out of themselves how ialone and in the selfsufficiency of my study as all men are apt to be proud in their dreamsshould like to be talking king shakspeare in composing had no i but the i representative in beaumont and fletcher you have descriptions of characters by the poet rather than the characters themselves we are told and impressively told of their being but we rarely or never feel that they actually are  beaumont and fletcher are the most lyrical of our dramatists i think their comedies the best part of their works although there are scenes of very deep tragic interest in some of their plays i particularly recommend monsieur thomas for good pure comic humor  there is occasionally considerable license in their dramas and this opens a subject much needing vindication and sound exposition but which is beset with such difficulties for a lecturer that i must pass it by only as far as shakspeare is concerned i own i can with less pain admit a fault in him than beg an excuse for it i will not therefore attempt to palliate the grossness that actually exists in his plays by the customs of his age or by the far greater coarseness of all his contemporaries excepting spenser who is himself not wholly blameless though nearly sofor i place shakspeares merit on being of no age but i would clear away what is in my judgment not his as that scene of the porter 2 in macbeth and many other such passages and abstract what is coarse in manners only and all that which from the frequency of our own vices we associate with his words if this were truly done little that could be justly reprehensible would remain compare the vile comments offensive and defensive on popes    lust thro some gentle strainers c  with the worst thing in shakspeare or even in beaumont and fletcher and then consider how unfair the attack is on our old dramatists especially because it is an attack that cannot be properly answered in that presence in which an answer would be most desirable from the painful nature of one part of the position but this very pain is almost a demonstration of its falsehood  footnote 1 see mr giffords introduction to his edition of massinger ed  footnote 2 act ii sc 3    massinger  born at salisbury 1584died 1640   with regard to massinger observe  1 the vein of satire on the times but this is not as in shakspeare where the natures evolve themselves according to their incidental disproportions from excess deficiency or mislocation of one or more of the component elements but is merely satire on what is attributed to them by others  2 his excellent metrea better model for dramatists in general to imitate than shakspeareseven if a dramatic taste existed in the frequenters of the stage and could be gratified in the present size and management or rather mismanagement of the two patent theatres i do not mean that massingers verse is superior to shakspeares or equal to it far from it but it is much more easily constructed and may be more successfully adopted by writers in the present day it is the nearest approach to the language of real life at all compatible with a fixed metre in massinger as in all our poets before dryden in order to make harmonious verse in the reading it is absolutely necessary that the meaning should be understoodwhen the meaning is once seen then the harmony is perfect whereas in pope and in most of the writers who followed in his school it is the mechanical metre which determines the sense  3 the impropriety and indecorum of demeanour in his favourite characters as in bertoldo in the maid of honour who is a swaggerer talking to his sovereign what no sovereign could endure and to gentlemen what no gentleman would answer without pulling his nose  4 shakspeares aguecheek osric c are displayed through others in the course of social intercourse by the mode of their performing some office in which they are employed but massingers sylli come forward to declare themselves fools ad arbitrium auctoris and so the diction always needs the subintelligitur the man looks as if he thought so and so expressed in the language of the satirist and not in that of the man himself     sylli you may madam   perhaps believe that i in this use art   to make you dote upon me by exposing   my more than most rare features to your view   but i as i have ever done deal simply   a mark of sweet simplicity ever noted   in the family of the syllis therefore lady   look not with too much contemplation on me   if you do you are in the suds  maid of honour act i sc 2   the author mixes his own feelings and judgments concerning the presumed fool but the man himself till mad fights up against them and betrays by his attempts to modify them that he is no fool at all but one gifted with activity and copiousness of thought image and expression which belong not to a fool but to a man of wit making himself merry with his own character  5 there is an utter want of preparation in the decisive acts of massingers characters as in camiola and aurelia in the maid of honour why because the dramatis personae were all planned each by itself whereas in shakspeare the play is syngenesia each character has indeed a life of its own and is an individuum of itself but yet an organ of the whole as the heart in the human body shakspeare was a great comparative anatomist  hence massinger and all indeed but shakspeare take a dislike to their own characters and spite themselves upon them by making them talk like fools or monsters as fulgentio in his visit to camiola act ii sc 2 hence too in massinger the continued flings at kings courtiers and all the favourites of fortune like one who had enough of intellect to see injustice in his own inferiority in the share of the good things of life but not genius enough to rise above it and forget himself beaumont and fletcher have the same vice in the opposite pole a servility of sentiment and a spirit of partizanship with the monarchical faction  6 from the want of a guiding point in massingers characters you never know what they are about in fact they have no character  7 note the faultiness of his soliloquies with connectives and arrangements that have no other motive but the fear lest the audience should not understand him  8 a play of massingers produces no one single effect whether arising from the spirit of the whole as in the as you like it or from any one indisputably prominent character as hamlet it is just which you like best gentlemen  9 the unnaturally irrational passions and strange whims of feeling which massinger delights to draw deprive the reader of all sound interest in the charactersas in mathias in the picture and in other instances  10 the comic scenes in massinger not only do not harmonize with the tragic not only interrupt the feeling but degrade the characters that are to form any part in the action of the piece so as to render them unfit for any tragic interest at least they do not concern or act upon or modify the principal characters as when a gentleman is insulted by a mere blackguardit is the same as if any other accident of nature had occurred a pig run under his legs or his horse thrown him there is no dramatic interest in it  i like massingers comedies better than his tragedies although where the situation requires it he often rises into the truly tragic and pathetic he excells in narration and for the most part displays his mere story with skill but he is not a poet of high imagination he is like a flemish painter in whose delineations objects appear as they do in nature have the same force and truth and produce the same effect upon the spectator but shakspeare is beyond thishe always by metaphors and figures involves in the thing considered a universe of past and possible experiences he mingles earth sea and air gives a soul to every thing and at the same time that he inspires human feelings adds a dignity in his images to human nature itself     full many a glorious morning have i seen   flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye   kissing with golden face the meadows green   gilding pale streams with heavenly alchymy c  33rd sonnet   notehave i not overrated giffords edition of massingernotif i have as but just is main reference to the restitution of the text but yes perhaps if i were talking of the notes these are more often wrong than right in the maid of honour act i sc 5 astutio describes fulgentio as a gentleman yet no lord gifford supposes a transposition of the press for no gentleman yet a lord but this would have no connection with what follows and we have only to recollect that lord means a lord of lands to see that the after lines are explanatory he is a man of high birth but no landed propertyas to the former he is a distant branch of the blood royalas to the latter his whole rent lies in a narrow compass the kings ear in the same scene the text stands     bert no they are useful   for your imitationi remember you c   and gifford condemns masons conjecture of initiation as void of meaning and harmony now my ear deceives me if initiation be not the right word in factimitation is utterly impertinent to all that follows bertoldo tells antonio that he had been initiated in the manners suited to the court by two or three sacred beauties and that a similar experience would be equally useful for his initiation into the camp not a word of his imitation besides i say the rhythm requires initiation and is lame as the verse now stands     lecture viii   don quixote  cervantes  born at madrid 1547shakspeare 1564 both put off mortality on the same day the 23rd of april 1616the one in the sixtyninth the other in the fiftysecond year of his life the resemblance in their physiognomies is striking but with a predominance of acuteness in cervantes and of reflection in shakspeare which is the specific difference between the spanish and english characters of mind  i the nature and eminence of symbolical writing  ii madness and its different sorts considered without pretension to medical science  to each of these or at least to my own notions respecting them i must devote a few words of explanation in order to render the after critique on don quixote the master work of cervantes and his countrys genius easily and throughout intelligible this is not the least valuable though it may most often be felt by us both as the heaviest and least entertaining portion of these critical disquisitions for without it i must have foregone one at least of the two appropriate objects of a lecture that of interesting you during its delivery and of leaving behind in your minds the germs of afterthought and the materials for future enjoyment to have been assured by several of my intelligent auditors that they have reperused hamlet or othello with increased satisfaction in consequence of the new points of view in which i had placed those charactersis the highest compliment i could receive or desire and should the address of this evening open out a new source of pleasure or enlarge the former in your perusal of don quixote it will compensate for the failure of any personal or temporary object  i the symbolical cannot perhaps be better defined in distinction from the allegorical than that it is always itself a part of that of the whole of which it is the representativehere comes a sailthat is a ship is a symbolical expression behold our lion when we speak of some gallant soldier is allegorical of most importance to our present subject is this point that the latter the allegory cannot be other than spoken consciouslywhereas in the former the symbol it is very possible that the general truth represented may be working unconsciously in the writers mind during the construction of the symboland it proves itself by being produced out of his own mindas the don quixote out of the perfectly sane mind of cervantes and not by outward observation or historically the advantage of symbolical writing over allegory is that it presumes no disjunction of faculties but simple predominance  ii madness may be divided as  1 hypochondriasis or the man is out of his senses  2 derangement of the understanding or the man is out of his wits  3 loss of reason  4 frenzy or derangement of the sensations  cervantess own preface to don quixote is a perfect model of the gentle every where intelligible irony in the best essays of the tatler and the spectator equally natural and easy cervantes is more spirited than addison whilst he blends with the terseness of swift an exquisite flow and music of style and above all contrasts with the latter by the sweet temper of a superior mind which saw the follies of mankind and was even at the moment suffering severely under hard mistreatment1 and yet seems every where to have but one thought as the undersong brethren with all your faults i love you stillor as a mother that chides the child she loves with one hand holds up the rod and with the other wipes off each tear as it drops  don quixote was neither fettered to the earth by want nor holden in its embraces by wealthof which with the temperance natural to his country as a spaniard he had both far too little and somewhat too much to be under any necessity of thinking about it his age too fifty may be well supposed to prevent his mind from being tempted out of itself by any of the lower passionswhile his habits as a very early riser and a keen sportsman were such as kept his spare body in serviceable subjection to his will and yet by the play of hope that accompanies pursuit not only permitted but assisted his fancy in shaping what it would nor must we omit his meagerness and entire featureliness face and frame which cervantes gives us at once it is said that his surname was quixada or quesada ceven in this trifle showing an exquisite judgmentjust once insinuating the association of lanternjaws into the readers mind yet not retaining it obtrusively like the names in old farces and in the pilgrims progressbut taking for the regular appellative one which had the no meaning of a proper name in real life and which yet was capable of recalling a number of very different but all pertinent recollections as old armour the precious metals hidden in the ore c don quixotes leanness and featureliness are happy exponents of the excess of the formative or imaginative in him contrasted with sanchos plump rotundity and recipiency of external impression  he has no knowledge of the sciences or scientific arts which give to the meanest portions of matter an intellectual interest and which enable the mind to decypher in the world of the senses the invisible agencythat alone of which the worlds phenomena are the effects and manifestationsand thus as in a mirror to contemplate its own reflex its life in the powers its imagination in the symbolic forms its moral instincts in the final causes and its reason in the laws of material nature butestranged from all the motives to observation from selfinterestthe persons that surround him too few and too familiar to enter into any connection with his thoughts or to require any adaptation of his conduct to their particular characters or relations to himselfhis judgment lies fallow with nothing to excite nothing to employ it yetand here is the point where genius even of the most perfect kind allotted but to few in the course of many ages does not preclude the necessity in part and in part counterbalance the craving by sanity of judgment without which genius either cannot be or cannot at least manifest itselfthe dependency of our nature asks for some confirmation from without though it be only from the shadows of other mens fictions  too uninformed and with too narrow a sphere of power and opportunity to rise into the scientific artist or to be himself a patron of art and with too deep a principle and too much innocence to become a mere projector don quixote has recourse to romances     his curiosity and extravagant fondness herein arrived at that pitch   that he sold many acres of arable land to purchase books of   knighterrantry and carried home all he could lay hands on of that   kind ci   the more remote these romances were from the language of common life the more akin on that very account were they to the shapeless dreams and strivings of his own minda mind which possessed not the highest order of genius which lives in an atmosphere of power over mankind but that minor kind which in its restlessness seeks for a vivid representative of its own wishes and substitutes the movements of that objective puppet for an exercise of actual power in and by itself the more wild and improbable these romances were the more were they akin to his will which had been in the habit of acting as an unlimited monarch over the creations of his fancy hence observe how the startling of the remaining common sense like a glimmering before its death in the notice of the impossibleimprobable of don belianis is dismissed by don quixote as impertinent     he had some doubt 2 as to the dreadful wounds which don belianis   gave and received for he imagined that notwithstanding the most   expert surgeons had cured him his face and whole body must still be   full of seams and scars nevertheless 3 he commended in his author   the concluding his book with a promise of that unfinishable adventure   c 1   hence also his first intention to turn author but who with such a restless struggle within him could content himself with writing in a remote village among apathists and ignorants during his colloquies with the village priest and the barber surgeon in which the fervour of critical controversy feeds the passion and gives reality to its objectwhat more natural than that the mental striving should become an eddymadness may perhaps be denned as the circling in a stream which should be progressive and adaptive don quixote grows at length to be a man out of his wits his understanding is deranged and hence without the least deviation from the truth of nature without losing the least trait of personal individuality he becomes a substantial living allegory or personification of the reason and the moral sense divested of the judgment and the understanding sancho is the converse he is the common sense without reason or imagination and cervantes not only shows the excellence and power of reason in don quixote but in both him and sancho the mischiefs resulting from a severance of the two main constituents of sound intellectual and moral action put him and his master together and they form a perfect intellect but they are separated and without cement and hence each having a need of the other for its own completeness each has at times a mastery over the other for the common sense although it may see the practical inapplicability of the dictates of the imagination or abstract reason yet cannot help submitting to them these two characters possess the world alternately and interchangeably the cheater and the cheated to impersonate them and to combine the permanent with the individual is one of the highest creations of genius and has been achieved by cervantes and shakspeare almost alone    observations on particular passages   b i c 1   but not altogether approving of his having broken it to pieces with so   much ease to secure himself from the like danger for the future he   made it over again fencing it with small bars of iron within in such   a manner that he rested satisfied of its strength and without   caring to make a fresh experiment on it he approved and looked upon   it as a most excellent helmet   his not trying his improved scullcap is an exquisite trait of human character founded on the oppugnancy of the soul in such a state to any disturbance by doubt of its own broodings even the long deliberation about his horses name is full of meaningfor in these daydreams the greater part of the history passes and is carried on in words which look forward to other words as what will be said of them   ib   near the place where he lived there dwelt a very comely country lass   with whom he had formerly been in love though as it is supposed she   never knew it nor troubled herself about it   the nascent love for the country lass but without any attempt at utterance or an opportunity of knowing her except as the hintthe greek transliterated oti estiof the inward imagination is happily conceived in both partsfirst as confirmative of the shrinking back of the mind on itself and its dread of having a cherished image destroyed by its own judgment and secondly as showing how necessarily love is the passion of novels novels are to love as fairy tales to dreams i never knew but two men of taste and feeling who could not understand why i was delighted with the arabian nights tales and they were likewise the only persons in my knowledge who scarcely remembered having ever dreamed magic and waritself a magicare the daydreams of childhood love is the daydream of youth and early manhood   c 2   scarcely had ruddy phoebus spread the golden tresses of his beauteous   hair over the face of the wide and spacious earth and scarcely had   the little painted birds with the sweet and mellifluous harmony of   their forked tongues saluted the approach of rosy aurora who   quitting the soft couch of her jealous husband disclosed herself to   mortals through the gates of the mauchegan horizon when the renowned   don quixote c   how happily already is the abstraction from the senses from observation and the consequent confusion of the judgment marked in this description the knight is describing objects immediate to his senses and sensations without borrowing a single trait from either would it be difficult to find parallel descriptions in drydens plays and in those of his successors  c 3 the host is here happily conceived as one who from his past life as a sharper was capable of entering into and humouring the knight and so perfectly in character that he precludes a considerable source of improbability in the future narrative by enforcing upon don quixote the necessity of taking money with him   c 3   ho there whoever thou art rash knight that approachest to touch   the arms of the most valorous adventurer that ever girded sword c   don quixotes high eulogiums on himselfthe most valorous adventurerbut it is not himself that he has before him but the idol of his imagination the imaginary being whom he is acting and this that it is entirely a third person excuses his heart from the otherwise inevitable charge of selfish vanity and so by madness itself he preserves our esteem and renders those actions natural by which he the first person deserves it  c 4 andres and his master the manner in which don quixote redressed this wrong is a picture of the true revolutionary passion in its first honest state while it is yet only a bewilderment of the understanding you have a benevolence limitless in its prayers which are in fact aspirations towards omnipotence but between it and beneficence the bridge of judgmentthat is of measurement of personal powerintervenes and must be passed otherwise you will be bruised by the leap into the chasm or be drowned in the revolutionary river and drag others with you to the same fate  c 4 merchants of toledo     when they were come so near as to be seen and heard don quixote   raised his voice and with arrogant air cried out let the whole   world stand if the whole world does not confess that there is not in   the whole world a damsel more beautiful than c   now mark the presumption which follows the selfcomplacency of the last act that was an honest attempt to redress a real wrong this is an arbitrary determination to enforce a brissotine or rousseaus ideal on all his fellow creatures     let the whole world stand     if there had been any experience in proof of the excellence of our   code where would be our superiority in this enlightened age     no the business is that without seeing her you believe confess   affirm swear and maintain it and if not i challenge you all to   battle 4   next see the persecution and fury excited by opposition however moderate the only words listened to are those that without their context and their conditionals and transformed into positive assertions might give some shadow of excuse for the violence shown this rich story ends to the compassion of the men in their senses in a sound ribroasting of the idealist by the muleteer the mob and happy for thee poor knight that the mob were against thee for had they been with thee by the change of the moon and of them thy head would have been off  c 5 first partthe idealist recollects the causes that had been accessary to the reverse and attempts to remove themtoo late he is beaten and disgraced  c 6 this chapter on don quixotes library proves that the author did not wish to destroy the romances but to cause them to be read as romancesthat is for their merits as poetry   c 7   among other things don quixote told him he should dispose himself to   go with him willinglyfor some time or other such an adventure might   present that an island might be won in the turn of a hand and he be   left governor thereof  at length the promises of the imaginative reason begin to act on the plump sensual honest common sense accomplicebut unhappily not in the same person and without the copula of the judgmentin hopes of the substantial good things of which the former contemplated only the glory and the colours   c 7   sancho panza went riding upon his ass like any patriarch with his   wallet and leathern bottle and with a vehement desire to find himself   governor of the island which his master had promised him   the first relief from regular labour is so pleasant to poor sancho   c 8   i no gentleman i swear by the great god thou liest as i am a   christian biscainer by land gentleman by sea gentleman for the   devil and thou liest look then if thou hast any thing else to say   this biscainer is an excellent image of the prejudices and bigotry provoked by the idealism of a speculator this story happily detects the trick which our imagination plays in the description of single combats only change the preconception of the magnificence of the combatants and all is gone   b ii c 2   be pleased my lord don quixote to bestow upon me the government of   that island c   sanchos eagerness for his government the nascent lust of actual democracy or isocracy   c 2   but tell me on your life have you ever seen a more valorous knight   than i upon the whole face of the known earth have you read in story   of any other who has or ever had more bravery in assailing more   breath in holding out more dexterity in wounding or more address in   giving a fallthe truth is answered sancho that i never read   any history at all for i can neither read nor write but what i dare   affirm is that i never served a bolder master c   this appeal to sancho and sanchos answer are exquisitely humorous it is impossible not to think of the french bulletins and proclamations remark the necessity under which we are of being sympathized with fly as high into abstraction as we may and how constantly the imagination is recalled to the ground of our common humanity and note a little further on the knights easy vaunting of his balsam and his quietly deferring the making and application of it   c 3 the speech before the goatherds     happy times and happy ages c 5   note the rhythm of this and the admirable beauty and wisdom of the thoughts in themselves but the total want of judgment in don quixotes addressing them to such an audience  b iii c 3 don quixotes balsam and the vomiting and consequent relief an excellent hit at panacea nostrums which cure the patient by his being himself cured of the medicine by revolting nature   c 4   peace and have patience the day will come c   the perpetual promises of the imagination   ib   your worship said sancho would make a better preacher than knight   errant   exactly so this is the true moral  c 6 the uncommon beauty of the description in the commencement of this chapter in truth the whole of it seems to put all nature in its heights and its humiliations before us  ib sanchos story of the goats     make account he carried them all over said don quixote and do   not be going and coming in this manner for at this rate you will not   have done carrying them over in a twelvemonth how many are passed   already said sancho c  observe the happy contrast between the allgeneralizing mind of the mad knight and sanchos allparticularizing memory how admirable a symbol of the dependence of all copula on the higher powers of the mind with the single exception of the succession in time and the accidental relations of space men of mere common sense have no theory or means of making one fact more important or prominent than the rest if they lose one link all is lost compare mrs quickly and the tapster 6 and note also sanchos good heart when his master is about to leave him don quixotes conduct upon discovering the fullinghammers proves he was meant to be in his senses nothing can be better conceived than his fit of passion at sanchos laughing and his sophism of selfjustification by the courage he had shown  sancho is by this time cured through experience as far as his own errors are concerned yet still is he lured on by the unconquerable awe of his masters superiority even when he is cheating him  c 8 the adventure of the galleyslaves i think this is the only passage of moment in which cervantes slips the mask of his hero and speaks for himself   c 9   don quixote desired to have it and bade him take the money and keep   it for himself sancho kissed his hands for the favour c

and constituents of humourrabelaisswiftsterne   i perhaps the most important of our intellectual operations are those of detecting the difference in similar and the identity in dissimilar things out of the latter operation it is that wit arises and it generically regarded consists in presenting thoughts or images in an unusual connection with each other for the purpose of exciting pleasure by the surprise this connection may be real and there is in fact a scientific wit though where the object consciously entertained is truth and not amusement we commonly give it some higher name but in wit popularly understood the connection may be and for the most part is apparent only and transitory and this connection may be by thoughts or by words or by images the first is our butlers especial eminence the second voltaires the third which we oftener call fancy constitutes the larger and more peculiar part of the wit of shakspeare you can scarcely turn to a single speech of falstaffs without finding instances of it nor does wit always cease to deserve the name by being transient or incapable of analysis i may add that the wit of thoughts belongs eminently to the italians that of words to the french and that of images to the english  ii where the laughable is its own end and neither inference nor moral is intended or where at least the writer would wish it so to appear there arises what we call drollery the pure unmixed ludicrous or laughable belongs exclusively to the understanding and must be presented under the form of the senses it lies within the spheres of the eye and the ear and hence is allied to the fancy it does not appertain to the reason or the moral sense and accordingly is alien to the imagination i think aristotle has already excellently defined the laughablegreek transliterated tho geloion as consisting of or depending on what is out of its proper time and place yet without danger or pain here thimproprietygreek transliterated tho ahtoponis the positive qualification the dangerlessnessgreek transliterated tho akindunonthe negative neither the understanding without an object of the senses as for example a mere notional error or idiocynor any external object unless attributed to the understanding can produce the poetically laughable nay even in ridiculous positions of the body laughed at by the vulgar there is a subtle personification always going on which acts on the perhaps unconscious mind of the spectator as a symbol of intellectual character and hence arises the imperfect and awkward effect of comic stories of animals because although the understanding is satisfied in them the senses are not hence too it is that the true ludicrous is its own end when serious satire commences or satire that is felt as serious however comically drest free and genuine laughter ceases it becomes sardonic this you experience in reading young and also not unfrequently in butler the true comic is the blossom of the nettle  iii when words or images are placed in unusual juxtaposition rather than connection and are so placed merely because the juxtaposition is unusualwe have the odd or the grotesque the occasional use of which in the minor ornaments of architecture is an interesting problem for a student in the psychology of the fine arts  iv in the simply laughable there is a mere disproportion between a definite act and a definite purpose or end or a disproportion of the end itself to the rank or circumstances of the definite person but humour is of more difficult description i must try to define it in the first place by its points of diversity from the former species humour does not like the different kinds of wit which is impersonal consist wholly in the understanding and the senses no combination of thoughts words or images will of itself constitute humour unless some peculiarity of individual temperament and character be indicated thereby as the cause of the same compare the comedies of congreve with the falstaff in henry iv or with sternes corporal trim uncle toby and mr shandy or with some of steeles charming papers in the tatler and you will feel the difference better than i can express it thus again to take an instance from the different works of the same writer in smolletts strap his lieutenant bowling his morgan the honest welshman and his matthew bramble we have exquisite humourwhile in his peregrine pickle we find an abundance of drollery which too often degenerates into mere oddity in short we feel that a number of things are put together to counterfeit humour but that there is no growth from within and this indeed is the origin of the word derived from the humoral pathology and excellently described by ben jonson     so in every human body   the choler melancholy phlegm and blood   by reason that they flow continually   in some one part and are not continent   receive the name of humours now thus far   it may by metaphor apply itself   unto the general disposition   as when some one peculiar quality   doth so possess a man that it doth draw   all his effects his spirits and his powers   in their confluctions all to run one way   this may be truly said to be a humour 1   hence we may explain the congeniality of humour with pathos so exquisite in sterne and smollett and hence also the tender feeling which we always have for and associate with the humours or hobbyhorses of a man first we respect a humourist because absence of interested motive is the groundwork of the character although the imagination of an interest may exist in the individual himself as if a remarkably simplehearted man should pride himself on his knowledge of the world and how well he can manage itand secondly there always is in a genuine humour an acknowledgement of the hollowness and farce of the world and its disproportion to the godlike within us and it follows immediately from this that whenever particular acts have reference to particular selfish motives the humourous bursts into the indignant and abhorring whilst all follies not selfish are pardoned or palliated the danger of this habit in respect of pure morality is strongly exemplified in sterne  this would be enough and indeed less than this has passed for a sufficient account of humour if we did not recollect that not every predominance of character even where not precluded by the moral sense as in criminal dispositions constitutes what we mean by a humourist or the presentation of its produce humour what then is it is it manifold or is there some one humorific point common to all that can be called humourousi am not prepared to answer this fully even if my time permitted but i think there isand that it consists in a certain reference to the general and the universal by which the finite great is brought into identity with the little or the little with the finite great so as to make both nothing in comparison with the infinite the little is made great and the great little in order to destroy both because all is equal in contrast with the infinite it is not without reason brother toby that learned men write dialogues on long noses2 i would suggest therefore that whenever a finite is contemplated in reference to the infinite whether consciously or unconsciously humour essentially arises in the highest humour at least there is always a reference to and a connection with some general power not finite in the form of some finite ridiculously disproportionate in our feelings to that of which it is nevertheless the representative or by which it is to be displayed humourous writers therefore as sterne in particular delight after much preparation to end in nothing or in a direct contradiction  that there is some truth in this definition or origination of humour is evident for you cannot conceive a humourous man who does not give some disproportionate generality or even a universality to his hobbyhorse as is the case with mr shandy or at least there is an absence of any interest but what arises from the humour itself as in my uncle toby and it is the idea of the soul of its undefined capacity and dignity that gives the sting to any absorption of it by any one pursuit and this not in respect of the humourist as a mere member of society for a particular however mistaken interest but as a man  the english humour is the most thoughtful the spanish the most etherialthe most idealof modern literature amongst the classic ancients there was little or no humour in the foregoing sense of the term socrates or plato under his name gives some notion of humour in the banquet when he argues that tragedy and comedy rest upon the same ground but humour properly took its rise in the middle ages and the devil the vice of the mysteries incorporates the modern humour in its elements it is a spirit measured by disproportionate finites the devil is not indeed perfectly humourous but that is only because he is the extreme of all humour  footnote 1 every man out of his

authentic account of him his buffoonery was not merely brutus rough stick which contained a rod of gold it was necessary as an amulet against the monks and bigots beyond a doubt he was among the deepest as well as boldest thinkers of his age never was a more plausible and seldom i am persuaded a less appropriate line than the thousand times quoted    rabelais laughing in his easy chair  of mr pope the caricature of his filth and zanyism proves how fully he both knew and felt the danger in which he stood i could write a treatise in proof and praise of the morality and moral elevation of rabelais work which would make the church stare and the conventicle groan and yet should be the truth and nothing but the truth i class rabelais with the creative minds of the world shakspeare dante cervantes c  all rabelais personages are phantasmagoric allegories but panurge above all he is throughout the greek transliterated panourgiathe wisdom that is the cunning of the human animalthe understanding as the faculty of means to purposes without ultimate ends in the most comprehensive sense and including art sensuous fancy and all the passions of the understanding it is impossible to read rabelais without an admiration mixed with wonder at the depth and extent of his learning his multifarious knowledge and original observation beyond what books could in that age have supplied him with   b iii c 9   how panurge asketh counsel of pantagruel whether he should marry yea   or no   note this incomparable chapter pantagruel stands for the reason as contradistinguished from the understanding and choice that is from panurge and the humour consists in the latter asking advice of the former on a subject in which the reason can only give the inevitable conclusion the syllogistic ergo from the premisses provided by the understanding itself which puts each case so as of necessity to predetermine the verdict thereon this chapter independently of the allegory is an exquisite satire on the spirit in which people commonly ask advice  footnote 1  no note remains of that part of this lecture which treated of rabelais this seems therefore a convenient place for the reception of some remarks written by mr c in mr gillmans copy of rabelais about the year 1825 see table talk vol i p 177 ed      swift 1  born in dublin 1667died 1745   in swifts writings there is a false misanthropy grounded upon an exclusive contemplation of the vices and follies of mankind and this misanthropic tone is also disfigured or brutalized by his obtrusion of physical dirt and coarseness i think gullivers travels the great work of swift in the voyages to lilliput and brobdingnag he displays the littleness and moral contemptibility of human nature in that to the houyhnhnms he represents the disgusting spectacle of man with the understanding only without the reason or the moral feeling and in his horse he gives the misanthropic ideal of manthat is a being virtuous from rule and duty but untouched by the principle of love  footnote 1  from mr greens note ed     sterne  born at clonmel 1713died 1768   with regard to sterne and the charge of licentiousness which presses so seriously upon his character as a writer i would remark that there is a sort of knowingness the wit of which depends1st on the modesty it gives pain to or 2dly on the innocence and innocent ignorance over which it triumphs or 3dly on a certain oscillation in the individuals own mind between the remaining good and the encroaching evil of his naturea sort of dallying with the devila fluxionary act of combining courage and cowardice as when a man snuffs a candle with his fingers for the first time or better still perhaps like that trembling daring with which a child touches a hot tea urn because it has been forbidden so that the mind has in its own white and black angel the same or similar amusement as may be supposed to take place between an old debauchee and a prudeshe feeling resentment on the one hand from a prudential anxiety to preserve appearances and have a character and on the other an inward sympathy with the enemy we have only to suppose society innocent and then ninetenths of this sort of wit would be like a stone that falls in snow making no sound because exciting no resistance the remainder rests on its being an offence against the good manners of human nature itself  this source unworthy as it is may doubtless be combined with wit drollery fancy and even humour and we have only to regret the misalliance but that the latter are quite distinct from the former may be made evident by abstracting in our imagination the morality of the characters of mr shandy my uncle toby and trim which are all antagonists to this spurious sort of wit from the rest of tristram shandy and by supposing instead of them the presence of two or three callous debauchees the result will be pure disgust sterne cannot be too severely censured for thus using the best dispositions of our nature as the panders and condiments for the basest  the excellencies of sterne consist  1 in bringing forward into distinct consciousness those minutiae of thought and feeling which appear trifles yet have an importance for the moment and which almost every man feels in one way or other thus is produced the novelty of an individual peculiarity together with the interest of a something that belongs to our common nature in short sterne seizes happily on those points in which every man is more or less a humourist and indeed to be a little more subtle the propensity to notice these things does itself constitute the humourist and the superadded power of so presenting them to men in general gives us the man of humour hence the difference of the man of humour the effect of whose portraits does not depend on the felt presence of himself as a humourist as in the instances of cervantes and shakspearenay of rabelais too and of the humourist the effect of whose works does very much depend on the sense of his own oddity as in sternes case and perhaps swifts though swift again would require a separate classification  2 in the traits of human nature which so easily assume a particular cast and colour from individual character hence this excellence and the pathos connected with it quickly pass into humour and form the ground of it see particularly the beautiful passage so well known of uncle tobys catching and liberating the fly     gosays he one day at dinner to an overgrown one which had   buzzed about his nose and tormented him cruelly all dinnertime and   which after infinite attempts he had caught at last as it flew by   himill not hurt thee says my uncle toby rising from his chair   and going across the room with the fly in his handill not hurt a   hair of thy headgo says he lifting up the sash and opening his   hand as he spoke to let it escapego poor devil get thee gone   why should i hurt thee this world is surely wide enough to hold both   thee and me vol ii ch 12   observe in this incident how individual character may be given by the mere delicacy of presentation and elevation in degree of a common good quality humanity which in itself would not be characteristic at all  3 in mr shandys characterthe essence of which is a craving for sympathy in exact proportion to the oddity and unsympathizability of what he proposesthis coupled with an instinctive desire to be at least disputed with or rather both in one to dispute and yet to agreeand holding as worst of allto acquiesce without either resistance or sympathy this is charmingly indeed profoundly conceived and is psychologically and ethically true of all mr shandies note too how the contrasts of character which are always either balanced or remedied increase the love between the brothers  4 no writer is so happy as sterne in the unexaggerated and truly natural representation of that species of slander which consists in gossiping about our neighbours as whetstones of our moral discrimination as if they were conscienceblocks which we used in our apprenticeship in order not to waste such precious materials as our own consciences in the trimming and shaping of ourselves by selfexamination     alas odayhad mrs shandy poor gentlewoman had but her wish in   going up to town just to lie in and come down again which they say   she begged and prayed for upon her bare knees

sermons are in existence and will be published hereafter ed    dante  born at florence 1265died 1321   as i remarked in a former lecture on a different subject for subjects the most diverse in literature have still their tangents the gothic character and its good and evil fruits appeared less in italy than in any other part of european christendom there was accordingly much less romance as that word is commonly understood or perhaps more truly stated there was romance instead of chivalry in italy an earlier imitation of and a more evident and intentional blending with the latin literature took place than elsewhere the operation of the feudal system too was incalculably weaker of that singular chain of independent interdependents the principle of which was a confederacy for the preservation of individual consistently with general freedom in short italy in the time of dante was an afterbirth of eldest greece a renewal or a reflex of the old italy under its kings and first roman consuls a network of free little republics with the same domestic feuds civil wars and party spiritthe same vices and virtues produced on a similarly narrow theatrethe existing state of things being as in all small democracies under the working and direction of certain individuals to whose will even the laws were swayedwhilst at the same time the singular spectacle was exhibited amidst all this confusion of the flourishing of commerce and the protection and encouragement of letters and arts never was the commercial spirit so well reconciled to the nobler principles of social polity as in florence it tended there to union and permanence and elevationnot as the overbalance of it in england is now doing to dislocation change and moral degradation the intensest patriotism reigned in these communities but confined and attached exclusively to the small locality of the patriots birth and residence whereas in the true gothic feudalism country was nothing but the preservation of personal independence but then on the other hand as a counterbalance to these disuniting elements there was in dantes italy as in greece a much greater uniformity of religion common to all than amongst the northern nations  upon these hints the history of the republican aeras of ancient greece and modern italy ought to be written there are three kinds or stages of historic narrative 1 that of the annalist or chronicler who deals merely in facts and events arranged in order of time having no principle of selection no plan of arrangement and whose work properly constitutes a supplement to the poetical writings of romance or heroic legends 2 that of the writer who takes his stand on some moral point and selects a series of events for the express purpose of illustrating it and in whose hands the narrative of the selected events is modified by the principle of selectionas thucydides whose object was to describe the evils of democratic and aristocratic partizanshipsor polybius whose design was to show the social benefits resulting from the triumph and grandeur of rome in public institutions and military disciplineor tacitus whose secret aim was to exhibit the pressure and corruptions of despotismin all which writers and others like them the groundobject of the historian colours with artificial lights the facts which he relates 3 and which in idea is the grandestthe most truly founded in philosophythere is the herodotean history which is not composed with reference to any particular causes but attempts to describe human nature itself on a great scale as a portion of the drama of providence the free will of man resisting the destiny of eventsfor the individuals often succeeding against it but for the race always yielding to it and in the resistance itself invariably affording means towards the completion of the ultimate result mitfords history is a good and useful work but in his zeal against democratic government mitford forgot or never saw that ancient greece was not nor ought ever to be considered a permanent thing but that it existed in the disposition of providence as a proclaimer of ideal truths and that everlasting proclamation being made that its functions were naturally at an end  however in the height of such a state of society in italy dante was born and flourished and was himself eminently a picture of the age in which he lived but of more importance even than this to a right understanding of dante is the consideration that the scholastic philosophy was then at its acme even in itself but more especially in italy where it never prevailed so exclusively as northward of the alps it is impossible to understand the genius of dante and difficult to understand his poem without some knowledge of the characters studies and writings of the schoolmen of the twelfth thirteenth and fourteenth centuries for dante was the living link between religion and philosophy he philosophized the religion and christianized the philosophy of italy and in this poetic union of religion and philosophy he became the ground of transition into the mixed platonism and aristotelianism of the schools under which by numerous minute articles of faith and ceremony christianity became a craft of hairsplitting and was ultimately degraded into a complete fetisch worship divorced from philosophy and made up of a faith without thought and a credulity directed by passion afterwards indeed philosophy revived under condition of defending this very superstition and in so doing it necessarily led the way to its subversion and that in exact proportion to the influence of the philosophic schools hence it did its work most completely in germany then in england next in france then in spain least of all in italy we must therefore take the poetry of dante as christianized but without the further gothic accession of proper chivalry it was at a somewhat later period that the importations from the east through the venetian commerce and the crusading armaments exercised a peculiarly strong influence on italy  in studying dante therefore we must consider carefully the differences produced first by allegory being substituted for polytheism and secondly and mainly by the opposition of christianity to the spirit of pagan greece which receiving the very names of its gods from egypt soon deprived them of all that was universal the greeks changed the ideas into finites and these finites into anthropomorphi or forms of men hence their religion their poetry nay their very pictures became statuesque with them the form was the end the reverse of this was the natural effect of christianity in which finites even the human form must in order to satisfy the mind be brought into connexion with and be in fact symbolical of the infinite and must be considered in some enduring however shadowy and indistinct point of view as the vehicle or representative of moral truth  hence resulted two great effects a combination of poetry with doctrine and by turning the mind inward on its own essence instead of letting it act only on its outward circumstances and communities a combination of poetry with sentiment and it is this inwardness or subjectivity which principally and most fundamentally distinguishes all the classic from all the modern poetry compare the passage in the iliad z vi 119236 in which diomed and glaucus change arms     greek transliterated cheiras tallilon labetin kai pistosanto    they took each other by the hand and pledged friendship   with the scene in ariosto orlando furioso c i st 2022 where

persona anco dolersi   e pur per selve oscure e calli obbliqui   insieme van senza sospetto aversi   and here you will observe that the reaction of ariostos own feelings on the image or act is more foregrounded to use a painters phrase than the image or act itself  the two different modes in which the imagination is acted on by the ancient and modern poetry may be illustrated by the parallel effects caused by the contemplation of the greek or romangreek architecture compared with the gothic in the pantheon the whole is perceived in a perceived harmony with the parts which compose it and generally you will remember that where the parts preserve any distinct individuality there simple beauty or beauty simply arises but where the parts melt undistinguished into the whole there majestic beauty or majesty is the result in york minster the parts the grotesques are in themselves very sharply distinct and separate and this distinction and separation of the parts is counterbalanced only by the multitude and variety of those parts by which the attention is bewilderedwhilst the whole or that there is a whole produced is altogether a feeling in which the several thousand distinct impressions lose themselves as in a universal solvent hence in a gothic cathedral as in a prospect from a mountains top there is indeed a unity an awful onenessbut it is because all distinction evades the eye and just such is the distinction between the antigone of sophocles and the hamlet of shakespeare  the divina commedia is a system of moral political and theological truths with arbitrary personal exemplifications which are not in my opinion allegorical i do not even feel convinced that the punishments in the inferno are strictly allegorical i rather take them to have been in dantes mind quasiallegorical or conceived in analogy to pure allegory  i have said that a combination of poetry with doctrines is one of the characteristics of the christian muse but i think dante has not succeeded in effecting this combination nearly so well as milton  this comparative failure of dante as also some other peculiarities of his mind in malam partem must be immediately attributed to the state of north italy in his time which is vividly represented in dantes life a state of intense democratical partizanship in which an exaggerated importance was attached to individuals and which whilst it afforded a vast field for the intellect opened also a boundless arena for the passions and in which envy jealousy hatred and other malignant feelings could and did assume the form of patriotism even to the individuals own conscience  all this common and as it were natural partizanship was aggravated arid coloured by the guelf and ghibelline factions and in part explanation of dantes adherence to the latter you must particularly remark that the pope had recently territorialized his authority to a great extent and that this increase of territorial power in the church was by no means the same beneficial movement for the citizens of free republics as the parallel advance in other countries was for those who groaned as vassals under the oppression of the circumjacent baronial castles 1  by way of preparation to a satisfactory perusal of the divina commedia i will now proceed to state what i consider to be dantes chief excellences as a poet and i begin with  i stylethe vividness logical connexion strength and energy of which cannot be surpassed in this i think dante superior to milton and his style is accordingly more imitable than miltons and does to this day exercise a greater influence on the literature of his country you cannot read dante without feeling a gush of manliness of thought within you dante was very sensible of his own excellence in this particular and speaks of poets as guardians of the vast armory of language which is the intermediate something between matter and spirit     or se tu quel virgilio e quella fonte   che spande di parlar sì largo fiume   risposi lui con vergognosa fronte   o degli altri poeti onore e lume   vagliami l lungo studio e l grande amore   che m han fatto cercar lo tuo volume   tu se lo mio maestro e l mio autore   tu se solo colui da cu io tolsi   lo bello stile che m ha fatto onore  inf c 1 v 79     and art thou then that virgil that wellspring   from which such copious floods of eloquence

thou and guide   thou he from whom i have alone derivd   that style which for its beauty into fame   exalts me  cary his translationtext ed   indeed there was a passion and a miracle of words in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries after the long slumber of language in barbarism which gave an almost romantic character a virtuous quality and power to what was read in a book independently of the thoughts or images contained in it this feeling is very often perceptible in dante  ii the images in dante are not only taken from obvious nature and are all intelligible to all but are ever conjoined with the universal feeling received from nature and therefore affect the general feelings of all men and in this respect dantes excellence is very great and may be contrasted with the idiosyncracies of some meritorious modern poets who attempt an eruditeness the result of particular feelings consider the simplicity i may say plainness of the following simile and how differently we should in all probability deal with it at the present day     quale i fioretti dal notturno gelo   chinati e chiusi poi che l sol gl imbianca   si drizzan tutti aperti in loro stelo   fal mi fec io di mia virtute

 cary 2   iii consider the wonderful profoundness of the whole third canto of the inferno and especially of the inscription over hell gate     per me si va c   which can only be explained by a meditation on the true nature of religion that isreason plus the understanding i say profoundness rather than sublimity for dante does not so much elevate your thoughts as send them down deeper in this canto all the images are distinct and even vividly distinct but there is a total impression of infinity the wholeness is not in vision or conception but in an inner feeling of totality and absolute being  iv in picturesqueness dante is beyond all other poets modern or ancient and more in the stern style of pindar than of any other michel angelo is said to have made a design for every page of the divina commedia as superexcellent in this respect i would note the conclusion of the third canto of the inferno     ed ecco verso noi venir per nave   un vecchio bianco per antico pelo

topographic reality of dantes journey through hell you should note and dwell on this as one of his great charms and which gives a striking peculiarity to his poetic power he thus takes the thousand delusive forms of a nature worse than chaos having no reality but from the passions which they excite and compels them into the service of the permanent observe the exceeding truth of these lines

the first is the pathos of passion the second that of affection and yet even in the first you seem to perceive that the lovers have sacrificed their passion to the cherishing of a deep and rememberable impression  vii as to going into the endless subtle beauties of dante that is impossible but i cannot help citing the first triplet of the 29th canto of the inferno    la molta gente e le

the 69th line and from the 106th to the end and in this comparison i should notice dantes occasional fault of becoming grotesque from being too graphic without imagination as in his lucifer compared with miltons satan indeed he is sometimes horrible rather than terriblefalling into the greek transliteration misaeton instead of the greek transliteration deinon of longinus3 in other words many of his images excite bodily disgust and not moral fear but here as in other cases you may perceive that the faults of great authors are generally excellencies carried to an excess  footnote 1 mr coleridge here notes i will if i can here make an historical movement and pay a proper compliment to mr hallam ed  footnote 2 mr coleridge here notes here to speak of mr carys translationed  footnote 3 de subl 1 ix     milton  born in london 1608died 1674   if we divide the period from the accession of elizabeth to the protectorate of cromwell into two unequal portions the first ending with the death of james i the other comprehending the reign of charles and the brief glories of the republic we are forcibly struck with a difference in the character of the illustrious actors by whom each period is rendered severally memorable or rather the difference in the characters of the great men in each period leads us to make this division  eminent as the intellectual powers were that were displayed in both yet in the number of great men in the various sorts of excellence and not merely in the variety but almost diversity of talents united in the same individual the age of charles falls short of its predecessor and the stars of the parliament keen as their radiance was in fulness and richness of lustre yield to the constellation at the court of elizabethwhich can only be paralleled by greece in her brightest moment when the titles of the poet the philosopher the historian the statesman and the general not seldom formed a garland round the same head as in the instances of our sidneys and raleighs but then on the other hand there was a vehemence of will an enthusiasm of principle a depth and an earnestness of spirit which the charms of individual fame and personal aggrandisement could not pacifyan aspiration after reality permanence and general goodin short a moral grandeur in the latter period with which the low intrigues machiavellic maxims and selfish and servile ambition of the former stand in painful contrast  the causes of this it belongs not to the present occasion to detail at length but a mere allusion to the quick succession of revolutions in religion breeding a political indifference in the mass of men to religion itself the enormous increase of the royal power in consequence of the humiliation of the nobility and the clergythe transference of the papal authority to the crownthe unfixed state of elizabeths own opinions whose inclinations were as popish as her interests were protestantthe controversial extravagance and practical imbecility of her successorwill help to explain the former period and the persecutions that had given a life and soulinterest to the disputes so imprudently fostered by jamesthe ardour of a conscious increase of power in the commons and the greater austerity of manners and maxims the natural product and most formidable weapon of religious disputation not merely in conjunction but in closest combination with newly awakened political and republican zeal these perhaps account for the character of the latter aera  in the close of the former period and during the bloom of the latter the poet milton was educated and formed and he survived the latter and all the fond hopes and aspirations which had been its life and so in evil days standing as the representative of the combined excellence of both periods he produced the paradise lost as by an afterthroe of nature there are some persons observes a divine a contemporary of miltons of whom the grace of god takes early hold and the good spirit inhabiting them carries them on in an even constancy through innocence into virtue their christianity bearing equal date with their manhood and reason and religion like warp and woof running together make up one web of a wise and exemplary life this he adds is a most happy case wherever it happens for besides that there is no sweeter or more lovely thing on earth than the early buds of piety which drew from our saviour signal affection to the beloved disciple it is better to have no wound than to experience the most sovereign balsam which if it work a cure yet usually leaves a scar behind although it was and is my intention to defer the consideration of miltons own character to the conclusion of this lecture yet i could not prevail on myself to approach the paradise lost without impressing on your minds the conditions under which such a work was in fact producible at all the original genius having been assumed as the immediate agent and efficient cause and these conditions i find in the character of the times and in his own character the age in which the foundations of his mind were laid was congenial to it as one golden era of profound erudition and individual geniusthat in which the superstructure was carried up was no less favourable to it by a sternness of discipline and a show of selfcontrol highly flattering to the imaginative dignity of an heir of fame and which won milton over from the dearloved delights of academic groves and cathedral aisles to the antiprelatic party it acted on him too no doubt and modified his studies by a characteristic controversial spirit his presentation of god is tinted with ita spirit not less busy indeed in political than in theological and ecclesiastical dispute but carrying on the former almost always more or less in the guise of the latter and so far as popes censure 1 of our poetthat he makes god the father a school divineis just we must attribute it to the character of his age from which the men of genius who escaped escaped by a worse disease the licentious indifference of a frenchified court  such was the nidus or soil which constituted in the strict sense of the word the circumstances of miltons mind in his mind itself there were purity and piety absolute an imagination to which neither the past nor the present were interesting except as far as they called forth and enlivened the great ideal in which and for which he lived a keen love of truth which after many weary pursuits found a harbour in a sublime listening to the still voice in his own spirit and as keen a love of his country which after a disappointment still more depressive expanded and soared into a love of man as a probationer of immortality these were these alone could be the conditions under which such a work as the paradise lost could be conceived and accomplished by a lifelong study milton had known     what was of use to know   what best to say could say to do had done   his actions to his words agreed his words   to his large heart gave utterance due his heart   containd of good wise fair the perfect shape   and he left the imperishable total as a bequest to the ages coming in the paradise lost 2  difficult as i shall find it to turn over these leaves without catching some passage which would tempt me to stop i propose to consider 1st the general plan and arrangement of the work 2ndly the subject with its difficulties and advantages 3rdly the poets object the spirit in the letter the greek transliterated enthumion en muthps the true schooldivinity and lastly the characteristic excellencies of the poem in what they consist and by what means they were produced  1 as to the plan and ordonnance of the poem  compare it with the iliad many of the books of which might change places without any injury to the thread of the story indeed i doubt the original existence of the iliad as one poem it seems more probable that it was put together about the time of the pisistratidae the iliadand more or less all epic poems the subjects of which are taken from historyhave no rounded conclusion they remain after all but single chapters from the volume of history although they are ornamental chapters consider the exquisite simplicity of the paradise lost it and it alone really possesses a beginning a middle and an end it has the totality of the poem as distinguished from the ab ovo birth and parentage or straight line of history  2 as to the subject  in homer the supposed importance of the subject as the first effort of confederated greece is an afterthought of the critics and the interest such as it is derived from the events themselves as distinguished from the manner of representing them is very languid to all but greeks it is a greek poem the superiority of the paradise lost is obvious in this respect that the interest transcends the limits of a nation but we do not generally dwell on this excellence of the paradise lost because it seems attributable to christianity itselfyet in fact the interest is wider than christendom and comprehends the jewish and mohammedan worldsnay still further inasmuch as it represents the origin of evil and the combat of evil and good it contains matter of deep interest to all mankind as forming the basis of all religion and the true occasion of all philosophy whatsoever  the fall of man is the subject satan is the cause mans blissful state the immediate object of his enmity and attack man is warned by an angel who gives him an account of all that was requisite to be known to make the warning at once intelligible and awful then the temptation ensues and the fall then the immediate sensible consequence then the consolation wherein an angel presents a vision of the history of men with the ultimate triumph of the redeemer nothing is touched in this vision but what is of general interest in religion any thing else would have been improper  the inferiority of klopstocks messiah is inexpressible i admit the prerogative of poetic feeling and poetic faith but i cannot suspend the judgment even for a moment a poem may in one sense be a dream but it must be a waking dream in milton you have a religious faith combined with the moral nature it is an efflux you go along with it in klopstock there is a wilfulness he makes things so and so the feigned speeches and events in the messiah shock us like falsehoods but nothing of that sort is felt in the paradise lost in which no particulars at least very few indeed are touched which can come into collision or juxtaposition with recorded matter  but notwithstanding the advantages in miltons subject there were concomitant insuperable difficulties and milton has exhibited marvellous skill in keeping most of them out of sight high poetry is the translation of reality into the ideal under the predicament of succession of time only the poet is an historian upon condition of moral power being the only force in the universe the very grandeur of his subject ministered a difficulty to milton the statement of a being of high intellect warring against the supreme being seems to contradict the idea of a supreme being milton precludes our feeling this as much as possible by keeping the peculiar attributes of divinity less in sight making them to a certain extent allegorical only again poetry implies the language of excitement yet how to reconcile such language with god hence milton confines the poetic passion in gods speeches to the language of scripture and once only allows the passio vera or quasihumana to appear in the passage where the father contemplates his own likeness in the son before the battle    go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might   ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels   that shake heavens basis bring forth all my war   my bow and thunder my almighty arms   gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh   pursue these sons of darkness drive them out   from all heavens bounds into the utter deep   there let them learn as likes them to despise   god and messiah his anointed king    b vi v 710  3 as to miltons object  it was to justify the ways of god to man the controversial spirit observable in many parts of the poem especially in gods speeches is immediately attributable to the great controversy of that age the origination of evil the arminians considered it a mere calamity the calvinists took away all human will milton asserted the will but declared for the enslavement of the will out of an act of the will itself there are three powers in us which distinguish us from the beasts that perish1 reason 2 the power of viewing universal truth and 3 the power of contracting universal truth into particulars religion is the will in the reason and love in the will  the character of satan is pride and sensual indulgence finding in self the sole motive of action it is the character so often seen in little on the political stage it exhibits all the restlessness temerity and cunning which have marked the mighty hunters of mankind from nimrod to napoleon the common fascination of men is that these great men as they are called must act from some great motive milton has carefully marked in his satan the intense selfishness the alcohol of egotism which would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven to place this lust of self in opposition to denial of self or duty and to show what exertions it would make and what pains endure to accomplish its end is miltons particular object in the character of satan but around this character he has thrown a singularity of daring a grandeur of sufferance and a ruined splendour which constitute the very height of poetic sublimity  lastly as to the execution  the language and versification of the paradise lost are peculiar in being so much more necessarily correspondent to each than those in any other poem or poet the connexion of the sentences and the position of the words are exquisitely artificial but the position is rather according to the logic of passion or universal logic than to the logic of grammar milton attempted to make the english language obey the logic of passion as perfectly as the greek and latin hence the occasional harshness in the construction  sublimity is the preeminent characteristic of the paradise lost it is not an arithmetical sublime like klopstocks whose rule always is to treat what we might think large as contemptibly small klopstock mistakes bigness for greatness there is a greatness arising from images of effort and daring and also from those of moral endurance in milton both are united the fallen angels are human passions invested with a dramatic reality  the apostrophe to light at the commencement of the third book is particularly beautiful as an intermediate link between hell and heaven and observe how the second and third book support the subjective character of the poem in all modern poetry in christendom there is an under consciousness of a sinful nature a fleeting away of external things the mind or subject greater than the object the reflective character predominant in the paradise lost the sublimest parts are the revelations of miltons own mind producing itself and evolving its own greatness and this is so truly so that when that which is merely entertaining for its objective beauty is introduced it at first seems a discord  in the description of paradise itself you have miltons sunny side as a man here his descriptive powers are exercised to the utmost and he draws deep upon his italian resources in the description of eve and throughout this part of the poem the poet is predominant over the theologian dress is the symbol of the fall but the mark of intellect and the metaphysics of dress are the hiding what is not symbolic and displaying by discrimination what is the love of adam and eve in paradise is of the highest meritnot phantomatic and yet removed from every thing degrading it is the sentiment of one rational being towards another made tender by a specific difference in that which is essentially the same in both it is a union of opposites a giving and receiving mutually of the permanent in either a completion of each in the other  milton is not a picturesque but a musical poet although he has this merit that the object chosen by him for any particular foreground always remains prominent to the end enriched but not incumbered by the opulence of descriptive details furnished by an exhaustless imagination i wish the paradise lost were more carefully read and studied than i can see any ground for believing it is especially those parts which from the habit of always looking for a story in poetry are scarcely read at allas for example adams vision of future events in the 11th and 12th books no one can rise from the perusal of this immortal poem without a deep sense of the grandeur and the purity of miltons soul or without feeling how susceptible of domestic enjoyments he really was notwithstanding the discomforts which actually resulted from an apparently unhappy choice in marriage he was as every truly great poet has ever been a good man but finding it impossible to realize his own aspirations either in religion or politics or society he gave up his heart to the living spirit and light within him and avenged himself on the world by enriching it with this record of his own transcendant ideal  footnote 1 table talk vol ii p 264   footnote 2 here mr c notes not perhaps here but towards or as the conclusion to chastise the fashionable notion that poetry is a relaxation or amusement one of the superfluous toys and luxuries of the intellect to contrast the permanence of poems with the transiency and fleeting moral effects of empires and what are called great events ed

  diffuse and the book of job a brief model p 69  these latter words deserve particular notice i do not doubt that milton intended his paradise lost as an epic of the first class and that the poetic dialogue of the book of job was his model for the general scheme of his paradise regained readers would not be disappointed in this latter poem if they proceeded to a perusal of it with a proper preconception of the kind of interest intended to be excited in that admirable work in its kind it is the most perfect poem extant though its kind may be inferior in interestbeing in its essence

partially true but partial truth is the worst mode of conveying falsehood    hayley p 75 the sincerest friends of milton may here agree with   johnson who speaks of his controversial merriment as   disgusting  the man who reads a work meant for immediate effect on one age with the notions and feelings of another may be a refined gentleman but must be a sorry critic he who possesses imagination enough to live with his forefathers and leaving comparative reflection for an after moment to give himself up during the first perusal to the feelings of a contemporary if not a partizan will i dare aver rarely find any part of miltons prose works disgusting  hayley p 104 hayley is speaking of the passage in miltons answer to icon basilice in which he accuses charles of taking his prayer in captivity from pamelas prayer in the 3rd book of sidneys arcadia the passage begins    but this king not content with that which although in a thing holy   is no holy theft to attribute to his own making other mens whole   prayers c symmons ed 1806 p 407  assuredly i regret that milton should have written this passage and yet the adoption of a prayer from a romance on such an occasion does not evince a delicate or deeply sincere mind we are the creatures of association there are some excellent moral and even serious lines in hudibras but what if a clergyman should adorn his sermon with a quotation from that poem would the abstract propriety of the verses leave him honourably acquitted the christian baptism of a line in virgil is so far from being a parallel that it is ridiculously inappropriatean absurdity as glaring as that of the bigotted puritans who objected to some of the noblest and most scriptural prayers ever dictated by wisdom and piety simply because the roman catholics had used them    hayley p 107 the ambition of milton c  i do not approve the so frequent use of this word relatively to milton indeed the fondness for ingrafting a good sense on the word ambition is not a christian impulse in general    hayley p 110 milton himself seems to have thought it allowable in   literary contention to vilify c the character of an opponent but   surely this doctrine is unworthy c  if ever it were allowable in this ease it was especially so but these general observations without meditation on the particular times and the genius of the times are most often as unjust as they are always superficial  hayley p 133 hayley is speaking of miltons panegyric on cromwells government    besides however milton might and did regret the immediate necessity   yet what alternative was there was it not better that cromwell should   usurp power to protect religious freedom at least than that the   presbyterians should usurp it to introduce a religious   persecutionextending the notion of spiritual concerns so far as to   leave no freedom even to a mans bedchamber  hayley p 250 hayleys conjectures on the origin of the paradise lost    if milton borrowed a hint from any writer it was more probably from   stradas prolusions in which the fall of the angels is pointed out as   the noblest subject for a christian poet1 the more dissimilar the   detailed images are the more likely it is that a great genius should   catch the general idea  hayl p 294 extracts from the adamo of andreini    lucifero che dal mio centre oscuro   mi chiama a

greek mythologiesrobinson crusoeuse of works of imagination in education  a confounding of god with nature and an incapacity of finding unity in the manifold and infinity in the individualthese are the origin of polytheism the most perfect instance of this kind of theism is that of early greece other nations seem to have either transcended or come short of the old hellenic standarda mythology in itself fundamentally allegorical and typical of the powers and functions of nature but subsequently mixed up with a deification of great men and heroworshipso that finally the original idea became inextricably combined with the form and attributes of some legendary individual in asia probably from the greater unity of the government and the still surviving influence of patriarchal tradition the idea of the unity of god in a distorted reflection of the mosaic scheme was much more generally preserved and accordingly all other super or ultrahuman beings could only be represented as ministers of or rebels against his will the asiatic genii and fairies are therefore always endowed with moral qualities and distinguishable as malignant or benevolent to man it is this uniform attribution of fixed moral qualities to the supernatural agents of eastern mythology that particularly separates them from the divinities of old greece  yet it is not altogether improbable that in the samothracian or cabeiric mysteries the link between the asiatic and greek popular schemes of mythology lay concealed of these mysteries there are conflicting accounts and perhaps there were variations of doctrine in the lapse of ages and intercourse with other systems but upon a review of all that is left to us on this subject in the writings of the ancients we may i think make out thus much of an interesting factthat cabiri impliedly at least meant socii complices having a hypostatic or fundamental union with or relation to each other that these mysterious divinities were ultimately at least divided into a higher and lower triad that the lower triad primi quia infimi consisted of the old titanic deities or powers of nature under the obscure names of axieros axiokersos and axiokersa representing symbolically different modifications of animal desire or material action such as hunger thirst and fire without consciousness that the higher triad ultimi quia superiores consisted of jupiter pallas or apollo or bacchus or mercury mystically called cadmilos and venus representing as before the greek transliterated nous or reason the greek logos or word or communicative power and the greek eros or lovethat the cadmilos or mercury the manifested communicated or sent appeared not only in his proper person as second of the higher triad but also as a mediator between the higher and lower triad and so there were seven divinities and indeed according to some authorities it might seem that the cadmilos acted once as a mediator of the higher and once of the lower triad and that so there were eight cabeiric divinities the lower or titanic powers being subdued chaos ceased and creation began in the reign of the divinities of mind and love but the chaotic gods still existed in the abyss and the notion of evoking them was the origin the idea of the greek necromancy  these mysteries like all the others were certainly in connection with either the phoenician or egyptian systems perhaps with both hence the old cabeiric powers were soon made to answer to the corresponding popular divinities and the lower triad was called by the uninitiated ceres vulcan or pluto and proserpine and the cadmilos became mercury it is not without ground that i direct your attention under these circumstances to the probable derivation of some portion of this most remarkable system from patriarchal tradition and to the connection of the cabeiri with the kabbala  the samothracian mysteries continued in celebrity till some time after the commencement of the christian era 2 but they gradually sank with the rest of the ancient system of mythology to which in fact they did not properly belong the peculiar doctrines however were preserved in the memories of the initiated and handed down by individuals no doubt they were propagated in europe and it is not improbable that paracelsus received many of his opinions from such persons and i think a connection may be traced between him and jacob behmen  the asiatic supernatural beings are all produced by imagining an excessive magnitude or an excessive smallness combined with great power and the broken associations which must have given rise to such conceptions are the sources of the interest which they inspire as exhibiting through the working of the imagination the idea of power in the will this is delightfully exemplified in the arabian nights entertainments and indeed more or less in other works of the same kind in all these there is the same activity of mind as in dreaming that isan exertion of the fancy in the combination and recombination of familiar objects so as to produce novel and wonderful imagery to this must be added that these tales cause no deep feeling of a moral kindwhether of religion or love but an impulse of motion is communicated to the mind without excitement and this is the reason of their being so generally read and admired  i think it not unlikely that the milesian tales contained the germs of many of those now in the arabian nights indeed it is scarcely possible to doubt that the greek empire must have left deep impression on the persian intellect so also many of the roman catholic legends are taken from apuleius in that exquisite story of cupid and psyche the allegory is of no injury to the dramatic vividness of the tale it is evidently a philosophic attempt to parry christianity with a quasiplatonic account of the fall and redemption of the soul  the charm of de foes works especially of robinson crusoe is founded on the same principle it always interests never agitates crusoe himself is merely a representative of humanity in general neither his intellectual nor his moral qualities set him above the middle degree of mankind his only prominent characteristic is the spirit of enterprise and wandering which is nevertheless a very common disposition you will observe that all that is wonderful in this tale is the result of external circumstancesof things

mankind are possessed by them robinson crusoe was not conscious of the master impulse even because it was his master and had taken as he says full possession of him when once the mind in despite of the remonstrating conscience has abandoned its free power to a haunting impulse or idea then whatever tends to give depth and vividness to this idea or indefinite imagination increases its despotism and in the same proportion renders the reason and free will ineffectual now fearful calamities sufferings horrors and hairbreadth escapes will have this effect far more than even sensual pleasure and prosperous incidents hence the evil consequences of sin in such cases instead of retracting or deterring the sinner goad him on to his destruction this is the moral of shakspeares macbeth and the true

must have been bound up with one of crusoes bibles otherwise i should be puzzled to know where he found all this history of the old gentleman not a word of it in the bible itself i am quite sure but to be serious de foe did not reflect that all these difficulties are attached to a mere fiction or at the best an allegory supported by a few popular phrases and figures of speech used incidentally or dramatically by the evangelistsand that the existence of a personal intelligent evil being the counterpart and antagonist of god is in direct contradiction to the most express declarations of holy writ shall there be evil in a city and the lord hath not done it amos iii 6 i make peace and create evil isa xlv 7 this is the deep mystery of the abyss of god    vol ii p 3   i have often heard persons of good judgment say  that there is no   such thing as a spirit appearing a ghost walking and the like c  i cannot conceive a better definition of body than spirit appearing or of a fleshandblood man than a rational spirit apparent but a spirit per se appearing is tantamount to a spirit appearing without its appearances and as for ghosts it is enough for a man of common sense to observe that a ghost and a shadow are concluded in the same definition that is visibility without tangibility    p 9   she was in a few words the stay of all my affairs the centre of all   my enterprises c  the stay of his affairs the centre of his interests the regulator of his schemes and movements whom it soothed his pride to submit to and in complying with whose wishes the conscious sensation of his acting will increased the impulse while it disguised the coercion of dutythe clinging dependent yet the strong supporterthe comforter the comfort and the souls living home this is de foes comprehensive character of the wife as she should be and to the honour of womanhood be it spoken there are few neighbourhoods in which one name at least might not be found for the portrait  the exquisite paragraphs in this and the next page in addition to others scattered though with a sparing hand through his novels afford sufficient proof that de foe was a firstrate master of periodic style but with sound judgment and the fine tact of genius he has avoided it as adverse to nay incompatible with the everyday matter of fact realness which forms the charm and the character of all his romances the robinson crusoe is like the vision of a happy nightmair such as a denizen of elysium might be supposed to have from a little excess in his nectar and ambrosia supper our imagination is kept in full play excited to the highest yet all the while we are touching or touched by common flesh and blood    p 67   the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome as   before c  how should it be otherwise they were idle and when we will not sow corn the devil will be sure to sow weeds nightshade henbane and devilsbit    p 82   that hardened villain was so far from denying it that he said it was   true and  him they would do it still before they had done with   them  observe when a man has once abandoned himself to wickedness he cannot stop and does not join the devils till he has become a devil himself rebelling against his conscience he becomes the slave of his own furious will  one excellence of de foe amongst many is his sacrifice of lesser interest to the greater because more universal had he as without any improbability he might have done given his robinson crusoe any of the turn for natural history which forms so striking and delightful a feature in the equally uneducated dampierhad he made him find out qualities and uses in the before to him unknown plants of the island discover for instance a substitute for hops or describe birds cmany delightful pages and incidents might have enriched the bookbut then crusoe would have ceased to be the universal representative the person for whom every reader could substitute himself but now nothing is done thought suffered or desired but what every man can imagine himself doing thinking feeling or wishing for even so very easy a problem as that of finding a substitute for ink is with exquisite judgment made to baffle crusoes inventive faculties and in what he does he arrives at no excellence he does not make basket work like will atkins the carpentering tailoring pottery c are all just what will answer his purposes and those are confined to needs that all men have and comforts that all men desire crusoe rises only to the point to which all men may be made to feel that they might and that they ought to rise in religionto resignation dependence on and thankful acknowledgement of the divine mercy and goodness  in the education of children love is first to be instilled and out of love obedience is to be educed then impulse and power should be given to the intellect and the ends of a moral being be exhibited for this object thus much is effected by works of imaginationthat they carry the mind out of self and show the possible of the good and the great in the human character the height whatever it may be of the imaginative standard will do no harm we are commanded to imitate one who is inimitable we should address ourselves to those faculties in a childs mind which are first awakened by nature and consequently first admit of cultivation that is to say the memory and the imagination the comparing power the judgment is not at that age active and ought not to be forcibly excited as is too frequently and mistakenly done in the modern systems of education which can only lead to selfish views debtor and creditor principles of virtue and an inflated sense of merit in the imagination of man exist the seeds of all moral and scientific improvement chemistry was first alchemy and out of astrology sprang astronomy in the childhood of those sciences the imagination opened a way and furnished materials on which the ratiocinative powers in a maturer state operated with success the imagination is the distinguishing characteristic of man as a progressive being and i repeat that it ought to be carefully guided and strengthened as the indispensable means and instrument of continued amelioration and refinement men of genius and goodness are generally restless in their minds in the present and this because they are by a law of their nature unremittingly regarding themselves in the future and contemplating the possible of moral and intellectual advance towards perfection thus we live by hope and faith thus we are for the most part able to realize what we will and thus we accomplish the end of our being the contemplation of futurity inspires humility of soul in our judgment of the present  i think the memory of children cannot in reason be too much stored with the objects and facts of natural history god opens the images of nature like the leaves of a book before the eyes of his creature manand teaches him all that is grand and beautiful in the foaming cataract the glassy lake and the floating mist  the common modern novel in which there is no imagination but a miserable struggle to excite and gratify mere curiosity ought in my judgment to be wholly forbidden to children novelreading of this sort is especially injurious to the growth of the imagination the judgment and the morals especially to the latter because it excites mere feelings without at the same time ministering an impulse to action women are good novelists but indifferent poets and this because they rarely or never thoroughly distinguish between fact and fiction in the jumble of the two lies the secret of the modern novel which is the medium aliquid between them having just so much of fiction as to obscure the fact and so much of fact as to render the fiction insipid the perusal of a fashionable ladys novel is to me very much like looking at the scenery and decorations of a theatre by broad daylight the source of the common fondness for novels of this sort rests in that dislike of vacancy and that love of sloth which are inherent in the human mind they afford excitement without producing reaction by reaction i mean an activity of the intellectual faculties which shows itself in consequent reasoning and observation and originates action and conduct according to a principle thus the act of thinking presents two sides for contemplationthat of external causality in which the train of thought may be considered as the result of outward impressions of accidental combinations of fancy or the associations of the memoryand on the other hand that of internal causality or of the energy of the will on the mind itself thought therefore might thus be regarded as passive or active and the same faculties may in a popular sense be expressed as perception or observation fancy or imagination memory or recollection  footnote 1 these notes were written by mr c in mr gillmans copy of robinson crusoe in the summer of 1830 the references in the text are to majors edition 1831 ed     lecture xii  dreamsapparitionsalchemistspersonality of the evil beingbodily identity   it is a general but as it appears to me a mistaken opinion that in our ordinary dreams we judge the objects to be real i say our ordinary dreamsbecause as to the nightmair the opinion is to a considerable extent just but the nightmair is not a mere dream but takes place when the waking state of the brain is recommencing and most often during a rapid alternation a twinkling as it were of sleeping and wakingwhile either from pressure on or from some derangement in the stomach or other digestive organs acting on the external skin which is still in sympathy with the stomach and bowels and benumbing it the sensations sent up to the brain by double touch that is when my own hand touches my side or breast are so faint as to be merely equivalent to the sensation given by single touch as when another persons hand touches me the mind therefore which at all times with and without our distinct consciousness seeks for and assumes some outward cause for every impression from without and which in sleep by aid of the imaginative faculty converts its judgments respecting the cause into a personal image as being the causethe mind i say in this case deceived by past experience attributes the painful sensation received to a correspondent agentan assassin for instance stabbing at the side or a goblin sitting on the breast add too that the impressions of the bed curtains room c received by the eyes in the halfmoments of their opening blend with and give vividness and appropriate distance to the dream image which returns when they close again and thus we unite the actual perceptions or their immediate reliques with the phantoms of the inward sense and in this manner so confound the halfwaking halfsleeping reasoning power that we actually do pass a positive judgment on the reality of what we see and hear though often accompanied by doubt and selfquestioning which as i have myself experienced will at times become strong enough even before we awake to convince us that it is what it isnamely the nightmair  in ordinary dreams we do not judge the objects to be realwe simply do not determine that they are unreal the sensations which they seem to produce are in truth the causes and occasions of the images of which there are two obvious proofs first that in dreams the strangest and most sudden metamorphoses do not create any sensation of surprise and the second that as to the most dreadful images which during the dream were accompanied with agonies of terror we merely awake or turn round on the other side and off fly both image and agony which would be impossible if the sensations were produced by the images this has always appeared to me an absolute demonstration of the true nature of ghosts and apparitionssuch i mean of the tribe as were not pure inventions fifty years ago and to this day in the ruder parts of great britain and ireland in almost every kitchen and in too many parlours it is nearly the same you might meet persons who would assure you in the most solemn manner so that you could not doubt their veracity at least that they had seen an apparition of such and such a personin many cases that the apparition had spoken to them and they would describe themselves as having been in an agony of terror they would tell you the story in perfect health now take the other class of facts in which real ghosts have appearedi mean where figures have been dressed up for the purpose of passing for apparitionsin every instance i have known or heard of and i have collected very many the consequence has been either sudden death or fits or idiocy or mania or a brain fever whence comes the difference evidently from thisthat in the one case the whole of the nervous system has been by slight internal causes gradually and all together brought into a certain state the sensation of which is extravagantly exaggerated during sleep and of which the images are the mere effects and exponents as the motions of the weathercock are of the windwhile in the other case the image rushing through the senses upon a nervous system wholly unprepared actually causes the sensation which is sometimes powerful enough to produce a total check and almost always a lesion or inflammation who has not witnessed the difference in shock when we have leaped down halfadozen steps intentionally and that of having missed a single stair how comparatively severe the latter is the fact really is as to apparitions that the terror produces the image instead of the contrary for in omnem actum perceptionis influit imaginatio as says wolfe  o strange is the selfpower of the imaginationwhen painful sensations have made it their interpreter or returning gladsomeness or convalescence has made its chilled and evanished figures and landscape bud blossom and live in scarlet green and snowy white like the firescreen inscribed with the nitrate and muriate of cobaltstrange is the power to represent the events and circumstances even to the anguish or the triumph of the quasicredent soul while the necessary conditions the only possible causes of such contingencies are known to be in fact quite hopelessyea when the pure mind would recoil from the evelengthened shadow of an approaching hope as from a crimeand yet the effect shall have place and substance and living energy and on a blue islet of ether in a whole sky of blackest cloudage shine like a firstling of creation  to return however to apparitions and by way of an amusing illustration of the nature and value of even contemporary testimony upon such subjects i will present you with a passage literally translated by my friend mr southey from the well known work of bernal dias one of the companions of cortes in the conquest of mexico    here it is that gomara says that francisco de morla rode forward on a   dappled grey horse before cortes and the cavalry came up and that   the apostle st iago or st peter was there i must say that all our   works and victories are by the hand of our lord jesus christ and that   in this battle there were for each of us so many indians that they   could have covered us with handfuls of earth if it had not been that   the great mercy of god helped us in every thing and it may be that he   of whom gomara speaks was the glorious santiago or san pedro and i   as a sinner was not worthy to see him but he whom i saw there and   knew was francisco de morla on a chestnut horse who came up with   cortes and it seems to me that now while i am writing this the whole   war is represented before these sinful eyes just in the manner as we   then went through it and though i as an unworthy sinner might not   deserve to see either of these glorious apostles there were in our   company above four hundred soldiers and cortes and many other   knights and it would have been talked of and testified and they   would have made a church when they peopled the town which would have   been called santiago de la vittoria or san pedro de la vittoria as   it is now called santa maria de la vittoria and if it was as gomara   says bad christians must we have been when our lord god sent us his   holy apostles not to acknowledge his great mercy and venerate his   church daily and would to god it had been as the chronicler   saysbut till i read his chronicle i never heard such a thing from   any of the conquerors who were there  now what if the odd accident of such a man as bernal dias writing a history had not taken place gomaras account the account of a contemporary which yet must have been read by scores who were present would have remained uncontradicted i remember the story of a man whom the devil met and talked with but left at a particular lanethe man followed him with his eyes and when the devil got to the turning or bend of the lane he vanished the devil was upon this occasion drest in a blue coat plush waistcoat leather breeches and boots and talked and looked just like a common man except as to a particular lock of hair which he had and how do you know then that it was the devilhow do i know replied the fellowwhy if it had not been the devil being drest as he was and looking as he did why should i have been sore stricken with fright when i first saw him and why should i be in such a tremble all the while he talked and moreover he had a particular sort of a kind of a lock and when i groaned and said upon every question he asked me lord have mercy upon me or christ have mercy upon me it was plain enough that he did not like it and so he left methe man was quite sober when he related this story but as it happened to him on his return from market it is probable that he was then muddled as for myself i was actually seen in newgate in the winter of 1798the person who saw me there said he had asked my name of mr a b a known acquaintance of mine who told him that it was young coleridge who had married the eldest miss will you go to newgate sir said my friend for i assure you that mr c is now in germany very willingly replied the other and away they went to newgate and sent for a b coleridge cried he in newgate god forbid i said young col  who married the eldest miss  the names were something similar and yet this person had himself really seen me at one of my lectures  i remember upon the occasion of my inhaling the nitrous oxide at the royal institution about five minutes afterwards a gentleman came from the other side of the theatre and said to mewas it not ravishingly delightful sirit was highly pleasurable no doubtwas it not very like sweet musici cannot say i perceived any analogy to itdid you not say it was very like mrs billington singing by your earno sir i said that while i was breathing the gas there was a singing in my ears  to return however to dreams i not only believe for the reasons given but have more than once actually experienced that the most fearful forms when produced simply by association instead of causing fear operate no other effect than the same would do if they had passed through my mind as thoughts while i was composing a faery tale the whole depending on the wise and gracious law in our nature that the actual bodily sensations called forth according to the law of association by thoughts and images of the mind never greatly transcend the limits of pleasurable feeling in a tolerably healthy frame unless where an act of the judgment supervenes and interprets them as purporting instant danger to ourselves  1 there have been very strange and incredible stories told of and by the alchemists perhaps in some of them there may have been a specific form of mania originating in the constant intension of the mind on an imaginary end associated with an immense variety of means all of them substances not familiar to men in general and in forms strange and unlike to those of ordinary nature sometimes it seems as if the alchemists wrote like the pythagoreans on music imagining a metaphysical and inaudible music as the basis of the audible it is clear that by sulphur they meant the solar rays or light and by mercury the principle of ponderability so that their theory was the same with that of the heraclitic physics or the modern german naturphilosophie which deduces all things from light and gravitation each being bipolar gravitationnorth and south or attraction and repulsion lighteast and west or contraction and dilation and gold being the tetrad or interpenetration of both as water was the dyad of light and iron the dyad of gravitation  it is probably unjust to accuse the alchemists generally of dabbling with attempts at magic in the common sense of the term the supposed exercise of magical power always involved some moral guilt directly or indirectly as in stealing a piece of meat to lay on warts touching humours with the hand of an executed person c rites of this sort and other practices of sorcery have always been regarded with trembling abhorrence by all nations even the most ignorant as by the africans the hudsons bay people and others the alchemists were no doubt often considered as dealers in art magic and many of them were not unwilling that such a belief should be prevalent and the more earnest among them evidently looked at their association of substances fumigations and other chemical operations as merely ceremonial and seem therefore to have had a deeper meaning that of evoking a latent power it would be profitable to make a collection of all the cases of cures by magical charms and incantations much useful information might probably be derived from it for it is to be observed that such rites are the form in which medical knowledge would be preserved amongst a barbarous and ignorant people  footnote 1 from mr greens note ed    note 1 june 1827  the apocryphal book of tobit consists of a very

them as such in the gospel instances and secondly that the evangelist who has recorded the most of these incidents himself speaks of one of these possessed persons as a lunatic greek transliterated

from spiritual causes and not only or principally from physical ailments may readily be admitted is not our will itself a spiritual power is it not the spirit of the man the mind of a rational and responsible being that is of a freeagent is a spirit though it does not follow that all spirits are minds who shall dare determine what spiritual influences may not arise out of the collective evil wills of wicked men even the bestial life sinless in animals and their nature may when awakened in the man and by his own act admitted into his will become a spiritual influence he receives a nature into his will which by this very act becomes a corrupt will and vice versa this will becomes his nature and thus a corrupt nature this may be conceded and this is all that the recorded words of our saviour absolutely require in order to receive an appropriate sense but this is altogether different from making spirits to be devils and devils selfconscious individuals  footnote 1  written in a

designing to hale down others from god also the   old dragon mentioned in the revelation with his tail drew down the   third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth  how much is it to be regretted that so enlightened and able a divine as smith had not philosophically and scripturally enucleated this so difficult yet important questionrespecting the personal existence of the evil principle that is whether as greek transliterated to theion of paganism is greek o theos in christianity so the greek to ponaeron is to be greek o ponaerosand whether this is an express doctrine of christ and not merely a jewish dogma left undisturbed to fade away under the increasing light of the gospel instead of assuming the former and confirming the position by a verse from a poetic tissue of visual symbolsa verse alien from the subject and by which the apocalypt enigmatized the neronian persecutions and the apostacy through fear occasioned by it in a large number of converts    ib p 463   when we say the devil is continually busy with us i mean not only   some apostate spirit as one particular being but that spirit of   apostacy which is lodged in all mens natures and this may seem   particularly to be aimed at in this place if we observe the   contextas the scripture speaks of christ not only as a particular   person but as a divine principle in holy souls indeed the devil is   not only the name of one particular thing but a nature  may i not venture to suspect that this was smiths own belief and judgment and that his conversion of the satan that is circuitor or minister of police what our sterne calls the accusing angel in the prologue to job into the devil was a mere condescension to the prevailing prejudice here however he speaks like himself and like a true religious philosopher who felt that the personality of evil spirits is a trifling question compared with the personality of the evil principle this is indeed most momentous  footnote 1 written in a copy of select discourses by john smith of queens college cambridge 1660 and communicated by the rev edward coleridge ed    note on a passage in the life of henry earl of morland  20th june 1827   the defect of this and all similar theories that i am acquainted with or rather let me say the desideratum is the neglect of a previous definition of the term body what do you mean by it the immediate grounds of a mans size visibility tangibility cbut these are in a continual flux even as a column of smoke the material particles of carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen lime phosphorus sulphur soda iron

simultaneously the result to the particles is precisely the same in both and of both therefore we must say with holy paulthou fool that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be c

more than the exterior or phenomenal organism appears to us dissolved when it lieth in apparent inactivity during our sleep  sound reasoning this to the best of my judgment as far as it goes but how are we to explain the reaction of this fluxional body on the animal in each moment the particles by the informing force of the living principle constitute an organ not only of motion and sense but of consciousness the organ plays on the organist how is this conceivable the solution requires a depth stillness and subtlety of spirit not only for its discovery but even for the understanding of it when discovered and in the most appropriate words enunciated i can merely give a hint the particles themselves must have an interior and gravitative being and the multeity must be a removable or at least suspensible accident     lecture xiii on poesy or art   man communicates by articulation of sounds and paramountly by the memory in the ear nature by the impression of bounds and surfaces on the eye and through the eye it gives significance and appropriation and thus the conditions of memory or the capability of being remembered to sounds smells c now art used collectively for painting sculpture architecture and music is the mediatress between and reconciler of nature and man it is therefore the power of humanizing nature of infusing the thoughts and passions of man into every thing which is the object of his contemplation colour form motion and sound are the elements which it combines and it stamps them into unity in the mould of a moral idea  the primary art is writingprimary if we regard the purpose abstracted from the different modes of realizing it those steps of progression of which the instances are still visible in the lower degrees of civilization first there is mere gesticulation then rosaries or wampun then picturelanguage then hieroglyphics and finally alphabetic letters these all consist of a translation of man into nature of a substitution of the visible for the audible  the so called music of savage tribes as little deserves the name of art for the understanding as the ear warrants it for music its lowest state is a mere expression of passion by sounds which the passion itself necessitatesthe highest amounts to no more than a voluntary reproduction of these sounds in the absence of the occasioning causes so as to give the pleasure of contrastfor example by the various outcries of battle in the song of security and triumph poetry also is purely human for all its materials are from the mind and all its products are for the mind but it is the apotheosis of the former state in which by excitement of the associative power passion itself imitates order and the order resulting produces a pleasurable passion and thus it elevates the mind by making its feelings the object of its reflexion so likewise whilst it recalls the sights and sounds that had accompanied the occasions of the original passions poetry impregnates them with an interest not their own by means of the passions and yet tempers the passion by the calming power which all distinct images exert on the human soul in this way poetry is the preparation for art inasmuch as it avails itself of the forms of nature to recall to express and to modify the thoughts and feelings of the mind still however poetry can only act through the intervention of articulate speech which is so peculiarly human that in all languages it constitutes the ordinary phrase by which man and nature are contradistinguished it is the original force of the word brute and even mute and dumb do not convey the absence of sound but the absence of articulated sounds  as soon as the human mind is intelligibly addressed by an outward image exclusively of articulate speech so soon does art commence but please to observe that i have laid particular stress on the words human mindmeaning to exclude thereby all results common to man and all other sentient creatures and consequently confining myself to the effect produced by the congruity of the animal impression with the reflective powers of the mind so that not the thing presented but that which is represented by the thing shall be the source of the pleasure in this sense nature itself is to a religious observer the art of god and for the same cause art itself might be defined as of a middle quality between a thought and a thing or as i said before the union and reconciliation of that which is nature with that which is exclusively human it is the figured language of thought and is distinguished from nature by the unity of all the parts in one thought or idea hence nature itself would give us the impression of a work of art if we could see the thought which is present at once in the whole and in every part and a work of art will he just in proportion as it adequately conveys the thought and rich in proportion to the variety of parts which it holds in unity  if therefore the term mute be taken as opposed not to sound but to articulate speech the old definition of painting will in fact be the true and best definition of the fine arts in general that is muta poesis mute poesy and so of course poesy and as all languages perfect themselves by a gradual process of desynonymizing words originally equivalent i have cherished the wish to use the word poesy as the generic or common term and to distinguish that species of poesy which is not muta poesis by its usual name poetry while of all the other species which collectively form the fine arts there would remain this as the common definitionthat they all like poetry are to express intellectual purposes thoughts conceptions and sentiments which have their origin in the human mindnot however as poetry does by means of articulate speech but as nature or the divine art does by form colour magnitude proportion or by sound that is silently or musically  well it may be saidbut who has ever thought otherwise we all know that art is the imitatress of nature and doubtless the truths which i hope to convey would be barren truisms if all men meant the same by the words imitate and nature but it would be flattering mankind at large to presume that such is the fact first to imitate the impression on the wax is not an imitation but a copy of the seal the seal itself is an imitation but further in order to form a philosophic conception we must seek for the kind as the heat in ice invisible light c whilst for practical purposes we must have reference to the degree it is sufficient that philosophically we understand that in all imitation two elements must coexist and not only coexist but must be perceived as coexisting these two constituent elements are likeness and unlikeness or sameness and difference and in all genuine creations of art there must be a union of these disparates the artist may take his point of view where he pleases provided that the desired effect be perceptibly producedthat there be likeness in the difference difference in the likeness and a reconcilement of both in one if there be likeness to nature without any check of difference the result is disgusting and the more complete the delusion the more loathsome the effect why are such simulations of nature as waxwork figures of men and women so disagreeable because not finding the motion and the life which we expected we are shocked as by a falsehood every circumstance of detail which before induced us to be interested making the distance from truth more palpable you set out with a supposed reality and are disappointed and disgusted with the deception whilst in respect to a work of genuine imitation you begin with an acknowledged total difference and then every touch of nature gives you the pleasure of an approximation to truth the fundamental principle of all this is undoubtedly the horror of falsehood and the love of truth inherent in the human breast the greek tragic dance rested on these principles and i can deeply sympathize in imagination with the greeks in this favourite part of their theatrical exhibitions when i call to mind the pleasure i felt in beholding the combat of the horatii and curiatii most exquisitely danced in italy to the music of cimarosa  secondly as to nature we must imitate nature yes but what in natureall and every thing no the beautiful in nature and what then is the beautiful what is beauty it is in the abstract the unity of the manifold the coalescence of the diverse in the concrete it is the union of the shapely formosum with the vital in the dead organic it depends on regularity of form the first and lowest species of which is the triangle with all its modifications as in crystals architecture c in the living organic it is not mere regularity of form which would produce a sense of formality neither is it subservient to any thing beside itself it may be present in a disagreeable object in which the proportion of the parts constitutes a whole it does not arise from association as the agreeable does but sometimes lies in the rupture of association it is not different to different individuals and nations as has been said nor is it connected with the ideas of the good or the fit or the useful the sense of beauty is intuitive and beauty itself is all that inspires pleasure without and aloof from and even contrarily to interest  if the artist copies the mere nature the natura naturata what idle rivalry if he proceeds only from a given form which is supposed to answer to the notion of beauty what an emptiness what an unreality there always is in his productions as in ciprianis pictures believe me you must master the essence the natura naturans which presupposes a bond between nature in the higher sense and the soul of man  the wisdom in nature is distinguished from that in man by the coinstantaneity of the plan and the execution the thought and the product are one or are given at once but there is no reflex act and hence there is no moral responsibility in man there is reflexion freedom and choice he is therefore the head of the visible creation in the objects of nature are presented as in a mirror all the possible elements steps and processes of intellect antecedent to consciousness and therefore to the full development of the intelligential act and mans mind is the very focus of all the rays of intellect which are scattered throughout the images of nature now so to place these images totalized and fitted to the limits of the human mind as to elicit from and to superinduce upon the forms themselves the moral reflexions to which they approximate to make the external internal the internal external to make nature thought and thought naturethis is the mystery of genius in the fine arts dare i add that the genius must act on the feeling that body is but a striving to become mindthat it is mind in its essence  in every work of art there is a reconcilement of the external with the internal the conscious is so impressed on the unconscious as to appear in it as compare mere letters inscribed on a tomb with figures themselves constituting the tomb he who combines the two is the man of genius and for that reason he must partake of both hence there is in genius itself an unconscious activity nay that is the genius in the man of genius and this is the true exposition of the rule that the artist must first eloign himself from nature in order to return to her with full effect why this because if he were to begin by mere painful copying he would produce masks only not forms breathing life he must out of his own mind create forms according to the severe laws of the intellect in order to generate in himself that coordination of freedom and law that involution of obedience in the prescript and of the prescript in the impulse to obey which assimilates him to nature and enables him to understand her he merely absents himself for a season from her that his own spirit which has the same ground with nature may learn her unspoken language in its main radicals before he approaches to her endless compositions of them yes not to acquire cold notionslifeless technical rulesbut living and lifeproducing ideas which shall contain their own evidence the certainty that they are essentially one with the germinal causes in naturehis consciousness being the focus and mirror of bothfor this does the artist for a time abandon the external real in order to return to it with a complete sympathy with its internal and actual for of all we see hear feel and touch the substance is and must be in ourselves and therefore there is no alternative in reason between the dreary and thank heaven almost impossible belief that every thing around us is but a phantom or that the life which is in us is in them likewise and that to know is to resemble when we speak of objects out of ourselves even as within ourselves to learn is according to plato only to recollectthe only effective answer to which that i have been fortunate to meet with is that which pope has consecrated for future use in the line    and coxcombs vanquish berkeley with a grin  the artist must imitate that which is within the thing that which is active through form and figure and discourses to us by symbolsthe naturgeist or spirit of nature as we unconsciously imitate those whom we love for so only can he hope to produce any work truly natural in the object and truly human in the effect the idea which puts the form together cannot itself be the form it is above form and is its essence the universal in the individual or the individuality itselfthe glance and the exponent of the indwelling power  each thing that lives has its moment of selfexposition and so has each period of each thing if we remove the disturbing forces of accident to do this is the business of ideal art whether in images of childhood youth or age in man or in woman hence a good portrait is the abstract of the personal it is not the likeness for actual comparison but for recollection this explains why the likeness of a very good portrait is not always recognized because some persons never abstract and amongst these are especially to be numbered the near relations and friends of the subject in consequence of the constant pressure and check exercised on their minds by the actual presence of the original and each thing that only appears to live has also its possible position of relation to life as nature herself testifies who where she cannot be prophecies her being in the crystallized metal or the inhaling plant  the charm the indispensable requisite of sculpture is unity of effect but painting rests in a material remoter from nature and its compass is therefore greater light and shade give external as well internal being even with all its accidents whilst sculpture is confined to the latter and here i may observe that the subjects chosen for works of art whether in sculpture or painting should be such as really are capable of being expressed and conveyed within the limits of those arts moreover they ought to be such as will affect the spectator by their truth their beauty or their sublimity and therefore they may be addressed to the judgment the senses or the reason the peculiarity of the impression which they may make may be derived either from colour and form or from proportion and fitness or from the excitement of the moral feelings or all these maybe combined such works as do combine these sources of effect must have the preference in dignity  imitation of the antique may be too exclusive and may produce an injurious effect on modern sculpture1st generally because such an imitation cannot fail to have a tendency to keep the attention fixed on externals rather than on the thought within2ndly because accordingly it leads the artist to rest satisfied with that which is always imperfect namely bodily form and circumscribes his views of mental expression to the ideas of power and grandeur only3rdly because it induces an effort to combine together two incongruous things that is to say modern feelings in antique forms4thly because it speaks in a language as it were learned and dead the tones of which being unfamiliar leave the common spectator cold and unimpressedand lastly because it necessarily causes a neglect of thoughts emotions and images of profounder interest and more exalted dignity as motherly sisterly and brotherly love piety devotion the divine become humanthe virgin the apostle the christ the artists principle in the statue of a great man should be the illustration of departed merit and i cannot but think that a skilful adoption of modern habiliments would in many instances give a variety and force of effect which a bigotted adherence to greek or roman costume precludes it is i believe from artists finding greek models unfit for several important modern purposes that we see so many allegorical figures on monuments and elsewhere painting was as it were a new art and being unshackled by old models it chose its own subjects and took an eagles flight and a new field seems opened for modern sculpture in the symbolical expression of the ends of life as in guys monument chantreys children in worcester cathedral c  architecture exhibits the greatest extent of the difference from nature which may exist in works of art it involves all the powers of design and is sculpture and painting inclusively it shews the greatness of man and should at the same time teach him humility  music is the most entirely human of the fine arts and has the fewest analoga in nature its first delightfulness is simple accordance with the ear but it is an associated thing and recalls the deep emotions of the past with an intellectual sense of proportion every human feeling is greater and larger than the exciting causea proof i think that man is designed for a higher state of existence and this is deeply implied in music in which there is always something more and beyond the immediate expression  with regard to works in all the branches of the fine arts i may remark that the pleasure arising from novelty must of course be allowed its due place and weight this pleasure consists in the identity of two opposite elements that is to saysameness and variety if in the midst of the variety there be not some fixed object for the attention the unceasing succession of the variety will prevent the mind from observing the difference of the individual objects and the only thing remaining will be the succession which will then produce precisely the same effect as sameness this we experience when we let the trees or hedges pass before the fixed eye during a rapid movement in a carriage or on the other hand when we suffer a file of soldiers or ranks of men in procession to go on before us without resting the eye on any one in particular in order to derive pleasure from the occupation of the mind the principle of unity must always be present so that in the midst of the multeity the centripetal force be never suspended nor the sense be fatigued by the predominance of the centrifugal force this unity in multeity i have elsewhere stated as the principle of beauty it is equally the source of pleasure in variety and in fact a higher term including both what is the seclusive or distinguishing term between them  remember that there is a difference between form as proceeding and shape as superinducedthe latter is either the death or the imprisonment of the thingthe former is its selfwitnessing and selfeffected sphere of agency art would or should be the abridgment of nature now the fulness of nature is without character as water is purest when without taste smell or colour but this is the highest the apex onlyit is not the whole the object of art is to give the whole ad hominem hence each step of nature hath its ideal and hence the possibility of a climax up to the perfect form of a harmonized chaos  to the idea of life victory or strife is necessary as virtue consists not simply in the absence of vices but in the overcoming of them so it is in beauty the sight of what is subordinated and conquered heightens the strength and the pleasure and this should be exhibited by the artist either inclusively in his figure or else out of it and beside it to act by way of supplement and contrast and with a view to this remark the seeming identity of body and mind in infants and thence the loveliness of the former the commencing separation in boyhood and the struggle of equilibrium in youth thence onward the body is first simply indifferent then demanding the translucency of the mind not to be worse than indifferent and finally all that presents the body as body becoming almost of an excremental nature     lecture xiv  on style   i have i believe formerly observed with regard to the character of the governments of the east that their tendency was despotic that is towards unity whilst that of the greek governments on the other hand leaned to the manifold and the popular the unity in them being purely ideal namely of all as an identification of the whole in the northern or gothic nations the aim and purpose of the government were the preservation of the rights and interests of the individual in conjunction with those of the whole the individual interest was sacred in the character and tendency of the greek and gothic languages there is precisely the same relative difference in greek the sentences are long and the structure architectural so that each part or clause is insignificant when compared with the whole the result is every thing the steps and processes nothing but in the gothic and generally in what we call the modern languages the structure is short simple and complete in each part and the connexion of the parts with the sum total of the discourse is maintained by the sequency of the logic or the community of feelings excited between the writer and his readers as an instance equally delightful and complete of what may be called the gothic structure as contradistinguished from that of the greeks let me cite a part of our famous chaucers character of a parish

16 reprove  footnote prologue to canterbury tales  such change as really took place in the style of our literature after chaucers time is with difficulty perceptible on account of the dearth of writers during the civil wars of the 15th century but the transition was not very great and accordingly we find in latimer and our other venerable authors about the time of edward vi as in luther the general characteristics of the earliest mannerthat is every part popular and the discourse addressed to all degrees of intellectthe sentences short the tone vehement and the connexion of the whole produced by honesty and singleness of purpose intensity of passion and pervading importance of the subject  another and a very different species of style is that which was derived from and founded on the admiration and cultivation of the classical writers and which was more exclusively addressed to the learned class in society i have previously mentioned boccaccio as the original italian introducer of this manner and the great models of it in english are hooker bacon milton and taylor although it may be traced in many other authors of that age in all these the language is dignified but plain genuine english although elevated and brightened by superiority of intellect in the writer individual words themselves are always used by them in their precise meaning without either affectation or slipslop the letters and state papers of sir francis walsingham are remarkable for excellence in style of this description in jeremy taylor the sentences are often extremely long and yet are generally so perspicuous in consequence of their logical structure that they require no reperusal to be understood and it is for the most part the same in milton and hooker  take the following sentence as a specimen of the sort of style to which i have been alluding    concerning faith the principal object whereof is that eternal verity   which hath discovered the treasures of hidden wisdom in christ   concerning hope the highest object whereof is that everlasting   goodness which in christ doth quicken the dead concerning charity   the final object whereof is that incomprehensible beauty which shineth   in the countenance of christ the son of the living god concerning   these virtues the first of which beginning here with a weak   apprehension of things not seen endeth with the intuitive vision of   god in the world to come the second beginning here with a trembling   expectation of things far removed and as yet but only heard of   endeth with real and actual fruition of that which no tongue can   express the third beginning here with a weak inclination of heart   towards him unto whom we are not able to approach endeth with endless   union the mystery whereof is higher than the reach of the thoughts of   men concerning that faith hope and charity without which there can   be no salvation was there ever any mention made saving only in that   law which god himself hath from heaven revealed there is not in the   world a syllable muttered with certain truth concerning any of these   three more than hath been supernaturally received from the mouth of   the eternal god    eccles pol i s 11  the unity in these writers is produced by the unity of the subject and the perpetual growth and evolution of the thoughts one generating and explaining and justifying the place of another not as it is in seneca where the thoughts striking as they are are merely strung together like beads without any causation or progression the words are selected because they are the most appropriate regard being had to the dignity of the total impression and no merely big phrases are used where plain ones would have sufficed even in the most learned of their works  there is some truth in a remark which i believe was made by sir joshua reynolds that the greatest man is he who forms the taste of a nation and that the next greatest is he who corrupts it the true classical style of hooker and his fellows was easily open to corruption and sir thomas brown it was who though a writer of great genius first effectually injured the literary taste of the nation by his introduction of learned words merely because they were learned it would be difficult to describe brown adequately exuberant in conception and conceit dignified hyperlatinistic a quiet and sublime enthusiast yet a fantast a humourist a brain with a twist egotistic like montaigne yet with a feeling heart and an active curiosity which however too often degenerates into a hunting after oddities in his hydriotaphia and indeed almost all his works the entireness of his mental action is very observable he metamorphoses every thing be it what it may into the subject under consideration but sir thomas brown with all his faults had a genuine idiom and it is the existence of an individual idiom in each that makes the principal writers before the restoration the great patterns or integers of english style in them the precise intended meaning of a word can never be mistaken whereas in the later writers as especially in pope the use of words is for the most part purely arbitrary so that the context will rarely show the true specific sense but only that something of the sort is designed a perusal of the authorities cited by johnson in his dictionary under any leading word will give you a lively sense of this declension in etymological truth of expression in the writers after the restoration or perhaps strictly after the middle of the reign of charles ii  the general characteristic of the style of our literature down to the period which i have just mentioned was gravity and in milton and some other writers of his day there are perceptible traces of the sternness of republicanism soon after the restoration a material change took place and the cause of royalism was graced sometimes disgraced by every shade of lightness of manner a free and easy style was considered as a test of loyalty or at all events as a badge of the cavalier party you may detect it occasionally even in barrow who is however in general remarkable for dignity and logical sequency of expression but in lestrange collyer and the writers of that class this easy manner was carried out to the utmost extreme of slang and ribaldry yet still the works even of these last authors have considerable merit in one point of view their language is level to the understandings of all men it is an actual transcript of the colloquialism of the day and is accordingly full of life and reality roger norths life of his brother the lord keeper is the most valuable specimen of this class of our literature it is delightful and much beyond any other of the writings of his contemporaries  from the common opinion that the english style attained its greatest perfection in and about queen anns reign i altogether dissent not only because it is in one species alone in which it can be pretended that the writers of that age excelled their predecessors but also because the specimens themselves are not equal upon sound principles of judgment to much that had been produced before the classical structure of hookerthe impetuous thoughtagglomerating flood of taylorto these there is no pretence of a parallel and for mere ease and grace is cowley inferior to addison being as he is so much more thoughtful and full of fancy cowley with the omission of a quaintness here and there is probably the best model of style for modern imitation in general taylors periods have been frequently attempted by his admirers you may perhaps just catch the turn of a simile or single image but to write in the real manner of jeremy taylor would require as mighty a mind as his many parts of algernon sidneys treatises afford excellent exemplars of a good modern practical style and dryden in his prose works is a still better model if you add a stricter and purer grammar it is indeed worthy of remark that all our great poets have been good prose writers as chaucer spenser milton and this probably arose from their just sense of metre for a true poet will never confound verse and prose whereas it is almost characteristic of indifferent prose writers that they should be constantly slipping into scraps of metre swifts style is in its line perfect the manner is a complete expression of the matter the terms appropriate and the artifice concealed it is simplicity in the true sense of the word  after the revolution the spirit of the nation became much more commercial than it had been before a learned body or clerisy as such gradually disappeared and literature in general began to be addressed to the common miscellaneous public that public had become accustomed to and required a strong stimulus and to meet the requisitions of the public taste a style was produced which by combining triteness of thought with singularity and excess of manner of expression was calculated at once to soothe ignorance and to flatter vanity the thought was carefully kept down to the immediate apprehension of the commonest understanding and the dress was as anxiously arranged for the purpose of making the thought appear something very profound the essence of this style consisted in a mock antithesis that is an opposition of mere sounds in a rage for personification the abstract made animate farfetched metaphors strange phrases metrical scraps in every thing in short but genuine prose style is of course nothing else but the art of conveying the meaning appropriately and with perspicuity whatever that meaning may be and one criterion of style is that it shall not be translateable without injury to the meaning johnsons style has pleased many from the very fault of being perpetually translateable he creates an impression of cleverness by never saying any thing in a common way the best specimen of this manner is in junius because his antithesis is less merely verbal than johnsons gibbons manner is the worst of all it has every fault of which this peculiar style is capable tacitus is an example of it in latin in coming from cicero you feel the falsetto immediately  in order to form a good style the primary rule and condition is not to attempt to express ourselves in language before we thoroughly know our own meaningwhen a man perfectly understands himself appropriate diction will generally be at his command either in writing or speaking in such cases the thoughts and the words are associated in the next place preciseness in the use of terms is required and the test is whether you can translate the phrase adequately into simpler terms regard being had to the feeling of the whole passage try this upon shakspeare or milton and see if you can substitute other simpler words in any given passage without a violation of the meaning or tone the source of bad writing is the desire to be something more than a man of sensethe straining to be thought a genius and it is just the same in speech making if men would only say what they have to say in plain terms how much more eloquent they would be another rule is to avoid converting mere abstractions into persons i believe you will very rarely find in any great writer before the revolution the possessive case of an inanimate noun used in prose instead of the dependent case as the watchs hand for the hand of the watch the possessive or saxon genitive was confined to persons or at least to animated subjects and i cannot conclude this lecture without insisting on the importance of accuracy of style as being near akin to veracity and truthful habits of mind he who thinks loosely will write loosely and perhaps there is some moral inconvenience in the common forms of our grammars which give children so many obscure terms for material distinctions let me also exhort you to careful examination of what you read if it be worth any perusal at all such examination will be a safeguard from fanaticism the universal origin of which is in the contemplation of phenomena without investigation into their causes     notes on sir thomas browns religio medici 1802 1   strong feeling and an active intellect conjoined lead almost necessarily in the first stage of philosophising to spinosism sir t brown was a spinosist without knowing it  if i have not quite all the faith that the author of the religio medici possessed i have all the inclination to it it gives me pleasure to believe  the postscript at the very end of the book is well worth reading sir k digbys observations however are those of a pedant in his own system and opinion he ought to have considered the r m in a dramatic and not in a metaphysical view as a sweet exhibition of character and passion and not as an expression or investigation of positive truth the r m is a fine portrait of a handsome man in his best clothes it is much of what he was at all times a good deal of what he was only in his best moments i have never read a book in which i felt greater similarity to my own make of mindactive in inquiry and yet with an appetite to believein short an affectionate visionary but then i should tell a different tale of my own heart for i would not only endeavour to tell the truth which i doubt not sir t b has done but likewise to tell the whole truth which most assuredly he has not done however it is a most delicious book his own character was a fine mixture of humourist genius and pedant a library was a living world to him and every book a man absolute flesh and blood and the gravity with which he records contradictory opinions is exquisite    part 1 sect 9   now contrarily i bless myself and am thankful that i lived not in   the days of miracles that i never saw christ nor his disciples c  so say i    s 15   i could never content my contemplation with those general pieces of   wonder the flux and reflux of the sea the increase of nile the   conversion of the needle to the north and have studied to match and   parallel those in the more obvious and neglected pieces of nature   which without further travel i can do in the cosmography of myself we   carry with us the wonders we seek without us there is all africa and   her prodigies in us we are that bold and adventurous piece of nature   which he that studies wisely learns in a compendium what others   labour at in a divided piece and endless volume  this is the true characteristic of genius our destiny and instinct is to unriddle the world and he is the man of genius who feels this instinct fresh and strong in his nature who perceiving the riddle and the mystery of all things even the commonest needs no strange and outoftheway tales or images to stimulate him into wonder and a deep interest    s 16 17   all this is very fine philosophy and the best and most ingenious   defence of revelation moreover i do hold and believe that a toad is   a comely animal but nevertheless a toad is called ugly by almost all   men and it is the business of a philosopher to explain the reason of   this  s 19 this is exceedingly striking had sir t b lived nowadays he would probably have been a very ingenious and bold infidel in his real opinions though the kindness of his nature would have kept him aloof from vulgar prating obtrusive infidelity  s 35 an excellent burlesque on parts of the schoolmen though i believe an unintentional one  s 36 truly sublimeand in sir t bs very best manner  s 39 this is a most admirable passage yesthe history of a man for the nine months preceding his birth would probably be far more interesting and contain events of greater moment than all the three score and ten years that follow it    s 48   this is made good by experience which can from the ashes of a plant   revive the plant and from its cinders recall it into its stalks and   leaves again  stuff this was i believe some lying boast of paracelsus which the good sir t b has swallowed for a fact    part ii s 2   i give no alms to satisfy the hunger of my brother but to fulfil and   accomplish the will and command of my god  we ought not to relieve a poor man merely because our own feelings impel us but because these feelings are just and proper feelings my feelings might impel me to revenge with the same force with which they urge me to charity i must therefore have some rule by which i may judge my feelingsand this rule is gods will    s 5 6   i never yet cast a true affection on a woman but i have loved my   friend as i do virtue my soul my god  we cannot love a friend as a woman but we may love a woman as a friend friendship satisfies the highest parts of our nature but a wife who is capable of friendship satisfies all the great business of real unostentatious virtue isnot to eradicate any genuine instinct or appetite of human nature butto establish a concord and unity betwixt all parts of our nature to give a feeling and a passion to our purer intellect and to intellectualize our feelings and passions this a happy marriage blest with children effectuates in the highest degree of which our nature is capable and is therefore chosen by st paul as the symbol of the union of the church with christ that is of the souls of all good men with god i scarcely distinguish said once a good old man the wife of my old age from the wife of my youth for when we were both young and she was beautiful for once that i caressed her with a meaner passion i caressed her a thousand times with loveand these caresses still remain to us besides there is another reason why friendship is of somewhat less value than love which includes friendship it is thiswe may love many persons all very dearly but we cannot love many persons all equally dearly there will be differences there will be gradations but our nature imperiously asks a summit a restingplace it is with the affections in love as with the reason in religion we cannot diffuse and equalize we must have a supreme a one the highest what is more common than to say of a man in love he idolizes her he makes a god of her now in order that a person should continue to love another better than all others it seems necessary that this feeling should be reciprocal for if it be not so sympathy is broken off in the very highest point a we will say by way of illustration loves b above all others in the best and fullest sense of the word love but b loves c above all others either therefore a does not sympathize with b in this most important feeling and then his love must necessarily be incomplete and accompanied with a craving after something that is not and yet might be or he does sympathize with b in loving c above all othersand then of course he loves c better than b now it is selfishness at least it seems so to me to desire that your friend should love you better than all othersbut not to wish that a wife should    s 6   another misery there is in affection that whom we truly love like   ourselves we forget their looks nor can our memory retain the idea   of their faces and it is no wonder for they are ourselves and our   affection makes their looks our own  a thought i have often had and once expressed it in almost the same language the fact is certain but the explanation here given is very unsatisfactory for why do we never have an image of our own facesan image of fancy i mean    s 7   i can hold there is no such thing as injury that if there be there   is no such injury as revenge and no such revenge as the contempt of   an injury that to hate another is to malign himself and that the   truest way to love another is to despise ourselves  i thank god that i can with a full and unfeigning heart utter amen to this passage    s 10   in brief there can be nothing truly alone and by itself which is   not truly one and such is only god  reciprocity is that which alone gives stability to love it is not mere selfishness that impels all kind natures to desire that there should be some one human being to whom they are most dear it is because they wish some one being to exist who shall be the resting place and summit of their love and this in human nature is not possible unless the two affections coincide the reason is that the object of the highest love will not otherwise be the same in both parties    s 11   i thank god for my happy dreams c  i am quite different from sir t b in this for all or almost all the painful and fearful thoughts that i know are in my dreamsso much so that when i am wounded by a friend or receive an unpleasant letter it throws me into a state very nearly resembling that of a dream    s 13   statists that labour to contrive a commonwealth without any poverty   take away the object of our charity not only not understanding the   commonwealth of a christian but forgetting the prophecies of christ  o for shame for shame is there no fit object of charity but abject poverty and what sort of a charity must that be which wishes misery in order that it may have the credit of relieving a small part of itpulling down the comfortable cottages of independent industry to build almshouses out of the ruins  this book paints certain parts of my moral and intellectual being the best parts no doubt better than any other book i have ever met withand the style is throughout delicious  footnote 1 communicated by mr wordsworth ed    notes on junius 1807    stat nominis umbra   as he never dropped the mask so he too often used the poisoned dagger of an assassin    dedication to the english nation  the whole of this dedication reads like a string of aphorisms arranged in chapters and classified by a resemblance of subject or a cento of points    ib   if an honest and i may truly affirm a laborious zeal for the public   service has given me any weight in your esteem let me exhort and   conjure you never to suffer an invasion of your political   constitution however minute the instance may appear to pass by   without a determined persevering resistance  a longer sentence and proportionately inelegant    ib   if you reflect that in the changes of administration which have marked   and disgraced the present reign although your warmest patriots have   in their turn been invested with the lawful and unlawful authority of   the crown and though other reliefs or improvements have been held   forth to the people yet that no one man in office has ever promoted   or encouraged a bill for shortening the duration of parliaments but   that whoever was minister the opposition to this measure ever since   the septennial act passed has been constant and uniform on the part   of government  long and as usual inelegant junius cannot manage a long sentence it has all the ins and outs of a snappish figuredance    preface  an excellent preface and the sentences not so snipt as in the dedication the paragraph near the conclusion beginning with some opinion may now be expected c and ending with relation between guilt and punishment deserves to be quoted as a masterpiece of rhetorical ratiocination in a series of questions that permit no answer or as junius says carry their own answer along with them the great art of junius is never to say too much and to avoid with equal anxiety a commonplace manner and matter that is not commonplace if ever he deviates into any originality of thought he takes care that it shall be such as excites surprise for its acuteness rather than admiration for its profundity he takes care say rather that nature took care for him it is impossible to detract from the merit of these letters they are suited to their purpose and perfect in their kind they impel to action not thought had they been profound or subtle in thought or majestic and sweeping in composition they would have been adapted for the closet of a sidney or for a house of lords such as it was in the time of lord bacon but they are plain and sensible whenever the author is in the right and whether right or wrong always shrewd and epigrammatic and fitted for the coffeehouse the exchange the lobby of the house of commons and to be read aloud at a public meeting when connected dropping the forms of connection desultory without abruptness or appearance of disconnection epigrammatic and antithetical to excess sententious and personal regardless of right or wrong yet wellskilled to act the part of an honest warmhearted man and even when he is in the right saying the truth but never proving it much less attempting to bottom itthis is the character of juniusand on this character and in the mould of these writings must every man cast himself who would wish in factious times to be the important and long remembered agent of a faction i believe that i could do all that junius has done and surpass him by doing many things which he has not done for exampleby an occasional induction of startling facts in the manner of tom paine and lively illustrations and witty applications of good stories and appropriate anecdotes in the manner of horne tooke i believe i could do it if it were in my nature to aim at this sort of excellence or to be enamoured of the fame and immediate influence which would be its consequence and reward but it is not in my nature i not only love truth but i have a passion for the legitimate investigation of truth the love of truth conjoined with a keen delight in a strict and skillful yet impassioned argumentation is my masterpassion and to it are subordinated even the love of liberty and all my public feelingsand to it whatever i labour under of vanity ambition and all my inward impulses  letter i  from this letter all the faults and excellencies of junius may be exemplified the moral and political aphorisms are just and sensible the irony in which his personal satire is conveyed is fine yet always intelligible but it approaches too nearly to the nature of a sneer the sentences are cautiously constructed without the forms of connection the he and it everywhere substituted for the who and which the sentences are short laboriously balanced and the antitheses stand the test of analysis much better than johnsons these are all excellencies in their kindwhere is the defect in thisthere is too much of each and there is a defect of many things the presence of which would have been not only valuable for their own sakes but for the relief and variety which they would have given it is observable too that every letter adds to the faults of these letters while it weakens the effect of their beauties  l iii a capital letter addressed to a private person and intended as a sharp reproof for intrusion its short sentences its witty perversions and deductions its questions and omissions of connectives all in their proper places are dramatically good    l v   for my own part i willingly leave it to the public to determine   whether your vindication of your friend has been as able and judicious   as it was certainly well intended and you i think may be satisfied   with the warm acknowledgements he already owes you for making him the   principal figure in a piece in which but for your amicable   assistance he might have passed without particular notice or   distinction  a long sentence and as usual inelegant and cumbrous this letter is a faultless composition with exception of the one long sentence    l vii   these are the gloomy companions of a disturbed imagination the   melancholy madness of poetry without the inspiration  the rhyme is a fault fancy had been better though but for the rhyme imagination is the fitter word    ib   such a question might perhaps discompose the gravity of his muscles   but i believe it would little affect the tranquillity of his   conscience  a false antithesis a mere verbal balance there are far far too many of these however with these few exceptions this letter is a blameless composition junius may be safely studied as a model for letters where he truly writes letters those to the duke of grafton and others are small pamphlets in the form of letters    l viii   to do justice to your graces humanity you felt for mac quick as you   ought to do and if you had been contented to assist him indirectly   without a notorious denial of justice or openly insulting the sense   of the nation you might have satisfied every duty of political   friendship without committing the honour of your sovereign or   hazarding the reputation of his government  an inelegant cluster of withouts junius asks questions incomparably wellbut ne quid nimis  l ix perhaps the fair way of considering these letters would be as a kind of satirical poems the short and for ever balanced sentences constitute a true metre and the connection is that of satiric poetry a witty logic an association of thoughts by amusing semblances of cause and effect the sophistry of which the reader has an interest in not stopping to detect for it flatters his love of mischief and makes the sport  l xii one of juniuss arts and which gives me a high notion of his genius as a poet and satirist is thishe takes for granted the existence of a character that never did and never can exist and then employs his wit and surprises and amuses his readers with analyzing its incompatibilities  l xiv continual sneer continual irony all excellent if it were not for the allbut a countenance with a malignant smile in statuary fixure on it becomes at length an object of aversion however beautiful the face and however beautiful the smile we are relieved in some measure from this by frequent just and well expressed moral aphorisms but then the preceding and following irony gives them the appearance of proceeding from the head not from the heart this objection would be less felt when the letters were first published at considerable intervals but junius wrote for posterity  l xxiii sneer and irony continued with such gross violation of good sense as to be perfectly nonsense the man who can address another on his most detestable vices in a strain of cold continual irony is himself a wretch    l xxxv   to honour them with a determined predilection and confidence in   exclusion of your english subjects who placed your family and in   spite of treachery and rebellion have supported it upon the throne   is a mistake too gross even for the unsuspecting generosity of youth  the words upon the throne stand unfortunately for the harmonious effect of the balance of placed and supported  this address to the king is almost faultless in composition and has been evidently tormented with the file but it has fewer beauties than any other long letter of junius and it is utterly undramatic there is nothing in the style the transitions or the sentiments which represents the passions of a man emboldening himself to address his sovereign personally like a presbyterians prayer you may substitute almost every where the third for the second person without injury the newspaper his closet and his own person were alone present to the authors intention and imagination this makes the composition vapid it possesses an isocratic correctness when it should have had the force and drama of an oration of demosthenes from this however the paragraph beginning with the words as to the scotch and also the last two paragraphs must be honourably excepted they are perhaps the finest passages in the whole collection   notes on barclays argenis 1803 1  heaven forbid that this work should not exist in its present form and language yet i cannot avoid the wish that it had during the reign of james i been moulded into an heroic poem in english octave stanza or epic blank versewhich however at that time had not been invented and which alas still remains the sole property of the inventor as if the muses had given him an unevadible patent for it of dramatic blank verse we have many and various specimensfor example shakspeares as compared with massingers both excellent in their kindof lyric and of what may be called orphic or philosophic blank verse perfect models may be found in wordsworth of colloquial blank verse there are excellent though not perfect examples in cowperbut of epic blank verse since milton there is not one  it absolutely distresses me when i reflect that this work admired as it has been by great men of all ages and lately i hear by the poet cowper should be only not unknown to general readers it has been translated into english two or three timeshow i know not wretchedly i doubt not it affords matter for thought that the last translation or rather in all probability miserable and faithless abridgment of some former one was given under another name what a mournful proof of the incelebrity of this great and amazing work among both the public and the people for as wordsworth the greater of the two great men of this ageat least except davy and him i have known read of heard of no othersfor as wordsworth did me the honour of once observing to me the people and the public are two distinct classes and as things go the former is likely to retain a better taste the less it is acted out by the latter yet telemachus is in every mouth in every schoolboys and schoolgirls hand it is awful to say of a work like the argenis the style and latinity of which judged not according to classical pedantry which pronounces every sentence right which can be found in any book prior to boetius however vicious the age or affected the author and every sentence wrong however natural and beautiful which has been of the authors own combinationbut according to the universal logic of thought as modified by feeling is equal to that of tacitus in energy and genuine conciseness and is as perspicuous as that of livy whilst it is free from the affectations obscurities and lust to surprise of the former and seems a sort of antithesis to the slowness and prolixity of the latterthis remark does not however impeach even the classicality of the language which when the freedom and originality the easy motion and perfect command of the thoughts are considered is truly wonderfulof such a work it is awful to say that it would have been well if it had been written in english or italian verse yet the event seems to justify the notion alas it is now too late what modern work even of the size of the paradise lostmuch less of the faery queenewould be read in the present day or even bought or be likely to be bought unless it were an instructive work as the phrase is like roscoes quartos of leo x or entertaining like boswells three of dr johnsons conversations it may be fairly objectedwhat work of surpassing merit has given the proofcertainly none yet still there are ominous facts sufficient i fear to afford a certain prophecy of its reception if such were produced  footnote 1

extract of a letter sent with the volume 1 1807  chapman i have sent in order that you might read the odyssey the iliad is fine but less equal in the translation as well as less interesting in itself what is stupidly said of shakspeare is really true and appropriate of chapman mighty faults counterpoised by mighty beauties excepting his quaint epithets which he affects to render literally from the greek a language above all others blest in the happy marriage of sweet words and which in our language are mere printers compound epithetssuch as quaffed divine joyintheheartofmaninfusing wine the undermarked is to be one word because one sweet mellifluous word expresses it in homerexcepting this it has no look no air of a translation it is as truly an original poem as the faery queeneit will give you small idea of homer though a far truer one than popes epigrams or cowpers cumbersome most antihomeric miltonism for chapman writes and feels as a poetas homer might have written had he lived in england in the reign of queen elizabeth in short it is an exquisite poem in spite of its frequent and perverse quaintnesses and harshnesses which are however amply repaid by almost unexampled sweetness and beauty of language all over spirit and feeling in the main it is an english heroic poem the tale of which is borrowed from the greek the dedication to the iliad is a noble copy of verses especially those sublime lines beginning     otis wondrous much   though nothing prisde that the right vertuous touch   of a well written soule to vertue moves   nor haue we soules to purpose if their loves   of fitting objects be not so inflamd   how much then were this kingdomes maine soule maimd   to want this great inflamer of all powers   that move in humane soules all realmes but yours   are

other speedy opportunity i should have begged your acceptance of the volume in a somewhat handsomer coat but as it is it will better represent the senderto quote from myself    a man disherited in form and face   by nature and mishap of outward grace 2   chapman in his moral heroic verse as in this dedication and the prefatory sonnets to his odyssey stands above ben jonson there is more dignity more lustre and equal strength but not midway quite between him and the sonnets of milton i do not know whether i give him the higher praise in that he reminds me of ben jonson with a sense of his superior excellence or that he brings milton to memory notwithstanding his inferiority his moral poems are not quite out of books like jonsons nor yet do the sentiments so wholly grow up out of his own natural habit and grandeur of thought as in milton the sentiments have been attracted to him by a natural affinity of his intellect and so combinedbut jonson has taken them by individual and successive acts of choice 3  all this and the preceding is well felt and vigorously though harshly expressed respecting sublime poetry in genere but in reading homer i look about me and ask how does all this apply here for surely never was there plainer writing there are a thousand charms of sun and moonbeam ripple and wave and stormy billow but all on the surface had chapman read proclus and porphyryand did he really believe themor even that they believed themselves they felt the immense power of a bible a shaster a koran there was none in greece or rome and they tried therefore by subtle allegorical accommodations to conjure the poem of homer into the greek transliterated biblon theoparadoton of greek faith 4  chapmans identification of his fate with homers and his complete forgetfulness of the distinction between christianity and idolatry under the general feeling of some religion is very interesting it is amusing to observe how familiar chapmans fancy has become with homer his life and its circumstances though the very existence of any such individual at l east with regard to the iliad and the hymns is more than problematic n b the rude engraving in the page was designed by no vulgar hand it is full of spirit and passion 5  i am so dull that neither in the original nor in any translation could i ever find any wit or wise purpose in this poem the whole humour seems to lie in the names the frogs and mice are not frogs or mice but men and yet they do nothing that conveys any satire in the greek there is much beauty of language but the joke is very flat this is always the case in rude agestheir serious vein is inimitabletheir comic low and low indeed the psychological cause is easily stated and copiously exemplifiable  footnote 1 communicated through mr

strive to feel as they now feel not as they once felt so will it be with the disputes between good men of the present day and if you have no other reason to doubt your opponents goodness than the

the attempts as those of baxter though no more were required than i believe in god through christ prove only the mildness of the proposers temper but as a rule would be either equal to nothing at least exclude only the two or three in a century that make it a matter of religion to declare themselves atheists or else be just as fruitful a rule for a persecutor as the most complete set of articles that could be framed by a spanish inquisition for to believe must mean to believe arightand god must mean the true godand christ the christ in the sense and with the attributes understood by christians who are truly christians an established church with a liturgy is the sufficient solution of the problem de jure magistratus articles of faith are in this point of view superfluous for is it

the earlier part of this volume is interesting as materials for medical history the state of medical science in the reign of charles i was almost incredibly low    fragment of an essay on taste 1810  the same arguments that decide the question whether taste has any fixed principles may probably lead to a determination of what those principles are first then what is taste in its metaphorical sense or which will be the easiest mode of arriving at the same solution what is there in the primary sense of the word which may give to its metaphorical meaning an import different from that of sight or hearing on the one hand and of touch or smell on the other and this question seems the more natural because in correct language we confine beauty the main subject of taste to objects of sight and combinations of sounds and never except sportively or by abuse of words speak of a beautiful flavour or a beautiful scent  now the analysis of our senses in the commonest books of anthropology has drawn our attention to the distinction between the perfectly organic and the mixed sensesthe first presenting objects as distinct from the perceptionthe last as blending the perception with the sense of the object our eyes and earsi am not now considering what is or is not the case really but only that of which we are regularly conscious as appearances our eyes most often appear to us perfect organs of the sentient principle and wholly in action and our hearing so much more so than the three other senses and in all the ordinary exertions of that sense perhaps equally so with the sight that all languages place them in one class and express their different modifications by nearly the same metaphors the three remaining senses appear in part passive and combine with the perception of the outward object a distinct sense of our own life taste therefore as opposed to vision and sound will teach us to expect in its metaphorical use a certain reference of any given object to our own being and not merely a distinct notion of the object as in itself or in its independent properties from the sense of touch on the other hand it is distinguishable by adding to this reference to our vital being some degree of enjoyment or the contrarysome perceptible impulse from pleasure or pain to complacency or dislike the sense of smell indeed might perhaps have furnished a metaphor of the same import with that of taste but the latter was naturally chosen by the majority of civilized nations on account of the greater frequency importance and dignity of its employment or exertion in human nature  by taste therefore as applied to the fine arts we must be supposed to mean an intellectual perception of any object blended with a distinct reference to our own sensibility of pain or pleasure or vice versa a sense of enjoyment or dislike coinstantaneously combined with and appearing to proceed from some intellectual perception of the objectintellectual perception i say for otherwise it would be a definition of taste in its primary rather than in its metaphorical sense briefly taste is a metaphor taken from one of our mixed senses and applied to objects of the more purely organic senses and of our moral sense when we would imply the coexistence of immediate personal dislike or complacency in this definition of taste therefore is involved the definition of fine arts namely as being such the chief and discriminative purpose of which it is to gratify the tastethat is not merely to connect but to combine and unite a sense of immediate pleasure in ourselves with the perception of external arrangement  the great question therefore whether taste in any one of the fine arts has any fixed principle or ideal will find its solution in the ascertainment of two factsfirst whether in every determination of the taste concerning any work of the fine arts the individual does not with or even against the approbation of his general judgment involuntarily claim that all other minds ought to think and feel the same whether the common expressions i dare say i may be wrong but that is my particular tasteare uttered as an offering of courtesy as a sacrifice to the undoubted fact of our individual fallibility or are spoken with perfect sincerity not only of the reason but of the whole feeling with the same entireness of mind and heart with which we concede a right to every person to differ from another in his preference of bodily tastes and flavours if we should find ourselves compelled to deny this and to admit that notwithstanding the consciousness of our liability to error and in spite of all those many individual experiences which may have strengthened the consciousness each man does at the moment so far legislate for all men as to believe of necessity that he is either right or wrong and that if it be right for him it is universally rightwe must then proceed to ascertainsecondly whether the source of these phenomena is at all to be found in those parts of our nature in which each intellect is representative of alland whether wholly or partially no person of common reflection demands even in feeling that what tastes pleasant to him ought to produce the same effect on all living beings but every man does and must expect and demand the universal acquiescence of all intelligent beings in every conviction of his understanding     fragment of an essay on beauty 1818  the only necessary but this the absolutely necessary prerequisite to a full insight into the grounds of the beauty in the objects of sight isthe directing of the attention to the action of those thoughts in our own mind which are not consciously distinguished every man may understand this if he will but recall the state of his feelings in endeavouring to recollect a name which he is quite sure that he remembers though he cannot force it back into consciousness this region of unconscious thoughts oftentimes the more working the more indistinct they are may in reference to this subject be conceived as forming an ascending scale from the most universal associations of motion with the functions and passions of lifeas when on passing out of a crowded city into the fields on a day in june we describe the grass and kingcups as nodding their heads and dancing in the breezeup to the half perceived yet not fixable resemblance of a form to some particular object of a diverse class which resemblance we need only increase but a little to destroy or at least injure its beautyenhancing effect and to make it a fantastic intrusion of the accidental and the arbitrary and consequently a disturbance of the beautiful this might be abundantly exemplified and illustrated from the paintings of salvator rosa  i am now using the term beauty in its most comprehensive sense as including expression and artistic interestthat is i consider not only the living balance but likewise all the accompaniments that even by disturbing are necessary to the renewal and continuance of the balance and in this sense i proceed to show that the beautiful in the object may be referred to two elementslines and colours the first belonging to the shapely forma formalis formosus and in this to the law and the reason and the second to the lively the free the spontaneous and the selfjustifying as to lines the rectilineal are in themselves the lifeless the determined ab extra but still in immediate union with the cycloidal which are expressive of function the curve line is a modification of the force from without by the force from within or the spontaneous these are not arbitrary symbols but the language of nature universal and intuitive by virtue of the law by which man is impelled to explain visible motions by imaginary causative powers analogous to his own acts as the dryads hamadryads naiads c  the better way of applying these principles will be by a brief and rapid sketch of the history of the fine artsin which it will be found that the beautiful in nature has been appropriated to the works of man just in proportion as the state of the mind in the artists themselves approached to the subjective beauty determine what predominance in the minds of the men is preventive of the living balance of excited faculties and you will discover the exact counterpart in the outward products egypt is an illustration of this shapeliness is intellect without freedom but colours are significant the introduction of the arch is not less an epoch in the fine than in the useful arts  order is beautiful arrangement without any purpose ad extratherefore there is a beauty of order or order may be contemplated exclusively as beauty  the form given in every empirical intuitionthe stuff that is the quality of the stuff determines the agreeable but when a thing excites us to receive it in such and such a mould so that its exact correspondence to that mould is what occupies the mindthis is taste or the sense of beauty whether dishes full of painted wood or exquisite viands were laid out on a table in the same arrangement would be indifferent to the taste as in ladies patterns but surely the one is far more agreeable than the other hence observe the disinterestedness of all taste and hence also a sensual perfection with intellect is occasionally possible without moral feeling so it may be in music and painting but not in poetry how far it is a real preference of the refined to the gross pleasures is another question upon the supposition that pleasure in some form or other is that alone which determines men to the objects of the formerwhether experience does not show that if the latter were equally in our power occasioned no more trouble to enjoy and caused no more exhaustion of the power of enjoying them by the enjoyment itself we should in real practice prefer the grosser pleasure it is not therefore any excellence in the quality of the refined pleasures themselves but the advantages and facilities in the means of enjoying them that give them the preeminence  this is of course on the supposition of the absence of all moral feeling suppose its presence and then there will accrue an excellence even to the quality of the pleasures themselves not only however of the refined but also of the grosser kindsinasmuch as a larger sweep of thoughts will be associated with each enjoyment and with each thought will be associated a number of sensations and so consequently each pleasure will become more the pleasure of the whole being this is one of the earthly rewards of our being what we ought to be but which would be annihilated if we attempted to be it for the sake of this increased enjoyment indeed it is a contradiction to suppose it yet this is the common argumentum in circulo in which the eudsemonists flee and pursue      poems and poetical

french decade  i have nothing to say in defence of the french revolutionists as far as they are personally concerned in this substitution of every tenth for the seventh day as a day of rest it was not only a senseless outrage on an ancient observance around which a thousand good and gentle feelings had clustered it not only tended to weaken the bond of brotherhood between france and the other members of christendom but it was dishonest and robbed the labourer of fifteen days of restorative and humanizing repose in every year and extended the wrong to all the friends and fellow labourers of man in the brute creation yet when i hear protestants and even those of the lutheran persuasion and members of the church of england inveigh against this change as a blasphemous contempt of the fourth commandment i pause and before i can assent to the verdict of condemnation i must prepare my mind to include in the same sentence at least as far as theory goes the names of several among the most revered reformers of christianity without referring to luther i will begin with master frith a founder and martyr of the church of england having witnessed his faith amid the flames in the year 1533 this meek and enlightened no less than zealous and orthodox divine in his declaration of baptism thus expresses himself    our forefathers which were in the beginning of the church did   abrogate the sabbath to the intent that men might have an example of   christian liberty howbeit because it was necessary that a day should   be reserved in which the people should come together to hear the word   of god they ordained instead of the sabbath which was saturday the   next following which is sunday and although they might have kept the   saturday with the jew as a thing indifferent yet they did much better   some three years after the martyrdom of frith in 1536 being the 27th of henry viii suffered master tindal in the same glorious cause and this illustrious martyr and translator of the word of life likewise in his answer to sir thomas more hath similarly resolved this point    as for the sabbath we be lords of the sabbath and may yet change it   into monday or any other day as we see need or we may make every   tenth day holy day only if we see cause why neither was there any   cause to change it from the saturday save only to put a difference   between us and the jews neither need we any holy day at all if the   people might be taught without it  this great man believed that if christian nations should ever become christians indeed there would every day be so many hours taken from the labour for the perishable body to the service of the souls and the understandings of mankind both masters and servants as to supersede the necessity of a particular day at present our sunday may be considered as so much holy land rescued from the sea of oppression and vain luxury and embanked against the fury of their billows    ride and tie  on a scheme of perfect retribution in

statesmen who survey with jealous dread all plans for the education of the lower orders may be thought to proceed on the system of antagonist muscles and in the belief that the closer a nation shuts

young virgin disguised himself and assisted at the eleusinian rites and at this time he together with his beloved and divers other young ladies of that city was surprized and carried off by pirates who supposing him to be what he appeared lodged him with his mistress in the dead of the night when the robbers were all asleep he arose and cut their throats thence making hasty way back to athens he bargained with the parents that he would restore to them their daughter and all her companions if they would consent to her marriage with him they did so and this marriage proving remarkably happy it became the custom to invoke the name of hymen at all nuptials    egotism  it is hard and uncandid to censure the great reformers in philosophy and religion for their egotism and boastfulness it is scarcely possible for a man to meet with continued personal abuse on account of his superior talents without associating more and more the sense of the value of his discoveries or detections with his own person the necessity of repelling unjust contempt forces the most modest man into a feeling of pride and selfconsciousness how can a tall man help thinking of his size when dwarfs are constantly on tiptoe beside himparacelsus was a braggart and a quack so was cardan but it was their merits and not their follies which drew upon them that torrent of detraction and calumny which compelled them so frequently to think and write concerning themselves that at length it became a habit to do so wolff too though not a boaster was yet persecuted into a habit of egotism both in his prefaces and in his ordinary conversation and the same holds good of the founder of the brunonian system and of his great namesake giordano bruno the more decorous manners of the present age have attached a disproportionate opprobrium to this foible and many therefore abstain with cautious prudence from all displays of what they feel nay some do actually flatter themselves that they abhor all egotism and never betray it either in their writings or discourse but watch these men narrowly and in the greater number of cases you will find their thoughts feelings and mode of expression saturated with the passion of contempt which is the concentrated vinegar of egotism  your very humble men in company if they produce any thing are in that thing of the most exquisite irritability and vanity  when a man is attempting to describe another persons character he may be right or he may be wrong but in one thing he will always succeed that is in describing himself if for example he expresses simple approbation he praises from a consciousness of possessing similar qualitiesif he approves with admiration it is from a consciousness of deficiency a ay he is a sober man b ah sir what a blessing is

following a bull consists in a mental juxtaposition of incongruous images or thoughts with the sensation but without the sense of connection the psychological conditions of the possibility of a bull

violent motive may revolutionize a mans opinions and professions but more frequently his honesty dies away imperceptibly from evening into twilight and from twilight into utter darkness he turns hypocrite so gradually and by such tiny atoms of motion that by the time he has arrived at a given point he forgets his own hypocrisy in the imperceptible degrees of his conversion the difference between such a man and a bolder liar is merely that between the hour hand and that which tells the seconds on a watch of the former you can see only the past motion of the latter both the past motion and the present moving yet there is perhaps more hope of the latter rogue for he has lied to mankind only and not to himselfthe former lies to his own heart as well as to the public    inward blindness  talk to a blind manhe knows he wants the sense of sight and willingly makes the proper allowances but there are certain internal senses which a man may want and yet be wholly ignorant that he wants them it is most unpleasant to converse with such persons on subjects of taste philosophy or religion of course there is no reasoning with them for they do not possess the facts on which the reasoning must be grounded nothing is possible but a naked dissent which implies a sort of unsocial contempt or what a man of kind dispositions is very likely to fall into a heartless tacit acquiescence which borders too nearly on duplicity    the vices of slaves no excuse for slavery  it often happens that the slave himself has neither the power nor the wish to be free he is then brutified but this apathy is the dire effect of slavery and so far from being a justifying cause that it contains the grounds of its bitterest condemnation the carlovingian race bred up the merovingi as beasts and then assigned their unworthiness as the satisfactory reason for their dethronement alas the human being is more easily weaned from the habit of commanding than from that of abject obedience the slave loses his soul when he loses his master even as the dog that has lost himself in the street howls and whines till he has found the house again where he had been kicked and cudgelled and half starved to boot as we however or our ancestors must have inoculated our fellowcreature with this wasting disease of the soul it becomes our duty to cure him and though we cannot immediately make him free yet we can and ought to put him in the way of becoming so at some future time if not in his own person yet in that of his children the french you will say are not capable of freedom grant thisbut does this fact justify the ungrateful traitor whose every measure has been to make them still more incapable of it    circulation of the blood  the ancients attributed to the blood the same motion of ascent and descent which really takes place in the sap of trees servetus discovered the minor circulation from the heart to the lungs do not the following passages of giordano bruno published in 1591 seem to imply more i put the question pauperis forma with unfeigned diffidence    de immenso et innumerabili lib vi cap 8    ut in nostro corpore sanguis per totum circumcursat et recursat sic   in toto mundo astro tellure    quare non aliter quam nostro in corpore sanguis hinc meat hinc   remeat neque ad inferiora fluit vi majore ad supera a pedibus quam   deinde recedat  and still more plainly in the ninth chapter of the same book    quid esset quodam ni gyro naturae cuncta redirent ortus ad proprios   rursum si sorbeat omnes pontus aquas totum non restituatque perenni   ordine qua possit rerum consistere vita tanquam si totus concurrat   sanguis in unam in qua consistat partem nec prima revisat ordia et   antiquos cursus non inde resumat  it is affirmed in the supplement to the scotch encyclopædia britannica that des cartes was the first who in defiance of aristotle and the schools attributed infinity to the universe the very title of brunos poem proves that this honour belongs to him  feyjoo lays claim to a knowledge of the circulation of the blood for francisco de la reyna a farrier who published a work upon his own art at burgos in 1564 the passage which he quotes is perfectly clear    por manera que la sangre anda en torno y en rueda por todos los   miembros excluye toda duda  whether reyna himself claimed any discovery feyjoo does not mentionbut these words seem to refer to some preceding demonstration of the fact i am inclined to think that this like many other things was known before it was discovered just as the preventive powers of the vaccine disease the existence of adipocire in graves and certain principles in grammar and in population upon which bulky books have been written and great reputations raised in our days    periturae parcere chartae  what scholar but must at times have a feeling of splenetic regret when he looks at the list of novels in two three or four volumes each published monthly by messrs lane c and then reflects that there are valuable works of cudworth prepared by himself for the press yet still unpublished by the university which possesses them and which ought to glory in the name of their great author and that there is extant in manuscript a folio volume of unprinted sermons by jeremy taylor surely surely the patronage of our many literary societies might be employed more beneficially to the literature and to the actual literati of the country if they would publish the valuable manuscripts that lurk in our different public libraries and make it worth the while of men of learning to correct and annotate the copies instead of but it is treading on hot embers    to have and to be  the distinction is marked in a beautiful sentiment of a german poet hast thou any thing share it with

   statistics  we all remember burkes curious assertion that there were 80000 incorrigible jacobins in england mr colquhoun is equally precise in the number of beggars prostitutes and thieves in the city of london mercetinus who wrote under lewis xv seems to have afforded the precedent he assures his readers that by an accurate calculation there were 50000 incorrigible atheists in the city of paris atheism then may have been a cocause of the french revolution but it should not be burthened on it as its monsterchild    magnanimity  the following ode was written by giordano bruno under prospect of that martyrdom which he soon after suffered at rome for atheism that is as is proved by all his works for a lofty and enlightened piety which was of course unintelligible to bigots and dangerous to an apostate hierarchy if the human mind be as it assuredly is the sublimest object which nature affords to our contemplation these lines which portray the human mind under the action of its most elevated affections have a fair claim to the praise of sublimity the work from which they are extracted is exceedingly rare as are indeed all the works of the nolan philosopher and i have never seen them quoted    daedaleas vacuis plumas nectere humeris   concupiant alii aut vi suspendi nubium   alis ventorumve appetant remigium   aut orbitae flammantis raptari alveo

sapio et sub numine     id vere plus quam satis est  the conclusion alludes to a charge of impenetrable obscurity in which bruno shares one and the same fate with plato aristotle kant and in truth with every great discoverer and benefactor of the human race excepting only when the discoveries have been capable of being rendered palpable to the outward senses and have therefore come under the cognizance of our sober judicious critics the men of sound common sense that is of those snails in intellect who wear their eyes at the tips of their feelers and cannot even see unless they at the same time touch when these fingerphilosophers affirm that plato bruno c must have been out of their senses the just and proper retort isgentlemen it is still worse with you you have lost your reason  by the by addison in the spectator has grossly misrepresented the design and tendency of brunos bestia triomphante the object of which was to show of all the theologies and theogonies which have been conceived for the mere purpose of solving problems in the material universe that as they originate in fancy so they all end in delusion and act to the hindrance or prevention of sound knowledge and actual discovery but the principal and most important truth taught in this allegory is that in the concerns of morality all pretended knowledge of the will of heaven which is not revealed to man through his conscience that all commands which do not consist in the unconditional obedience of the will to the pure reason without tampering with consequences which are in gods power not in ours in short that all motives of hope and fear from invisible powers which are not immediately derived from and absolutely coincident with the reverence due to the supreme reason of the universe are all alike dangerous superstitions the worship founded on them whether offered by the catholic to st francis or by the poor african to his fetish differ in form only not in substance herein bruno speaks not only as a philosopher but as an enlightened christianthe evangelists and apostles every where representing their moral precepts not as doctrines then first revealed but as truths implanted in the hearts of men which their vices only could have obscured    negros and narcissuses  there are certain tribes of negros who take for the deity of the day the first thing they see or meet with in the morning many of our fine ladies and some of our very fine gentlemen are followers of the same sect though by aid of the lookingglass they secure a constancy as to the object of their devotion    an anecdote  we here in england received a very high character of lord  during his stay abroad not unlikely sir replied the traveller a dead dog at a distance is said to smell like musk    the pharos at alexandria  certain full and highlywrought dissuasives from sensual indulgencies in the works of theologians as well as of satirists and storywriters may not unaptly remind one of the pharos the many lights of which appeared at a distance as one and this as a polar star so as more often to occasion wrecks than prevent them  at the base of the pharos the name of the reigning monarch was engraved on a composition which the artist well knew would last no longer than the kings life under this and cut deep in the marble itself was his own name and dedication sostratos of gyndos son of dexiteles to the gods protectors of sailorsso will it be with the georgium sidus the ferdinandia c cflatterys plaister of paris will crumble away and under it we shall read the names of herschel piozzi and their compeers    sense and common sense  i have noticed two main evils in philosophizing the first is the absurdity of demanding proof for the very facts which constitute the nature of him who demands ita proof for those primary and unceasing revelations of selfconsciousness which every possible proof must presuppose reasoning for instance pro and con concerning the existence of the power of reasoning other truths may be ascertained but these are certainty itself all at least which we mean by the word and are the measure of every thing else which we deem certain the second evil is that of mistaking for such facts mere general prejudices and those opinions that having been habitually taken for granted are dignified with the name of common sense of these the first is the more injurious to the reputation the latter more detrimental to the progress of philosophy in the affairs of common life we very properly appeal to common sense but it is absurd to reject the results of the microscope from the negative testimony of the naked eye knives are sufficient for the table and the marketbut for the purposes of science we must dissect with the lancet  as an instance of the latter evil take that truly powerful and active intellect sir thomas brown who though he had written a large volume in detection of vulgar errors yet peremptorily pronounces the motion of the earth round the sun and consequently the whole of the copernican system unworthy of any serious confutation as being manifestly repugnant to common sense which said common sense like a millers scales used to weigh gold or gasses may and often does become very gross though unfortunately not very uncommon nonsense and as for the former which may be called logica praepostera i have read in metaphysical essays of no small fame arguments drawn ab extra in proof and disproof of personal identity which ingenious as they may be were clearly anticipated by the little old womans appeal to her little dog for the solution of the very same doubts occasioned by her petticoats having been cut round about    if it is not me hell bark and hell rail but if i be i hell wag   his little tail    toleration  i dare confess that mr lockes treatise on toleration appeared to me far from being a full and satisfactory answer to the subtle and ofttimes plausible arguments of bellarmin and other romanists on the whole i was more pleased with the celebrated w penns tracts on the same subject the following extract from his excellent letter to the king of poland appeals to the heart rather than to the head to the christian rather than to the philosopher and besides overlooks the ostensible object of religious penalties which is not so much to convert the heretic as to prevent the spread of heresy the thoughts however are so just in themselves and expressed with so much life and simplicity that it well deserves a place in these omniana    now o prince give a poor christian leave to expostulate with thee   did christ jesus or his holy followers endeavour by precept or   example to set up their religion with a carnal sword called he any   troops of men or angels to defend him did he encourage peter to   dispute his right with the sword but did he not say put it up or   did he countenance his overzealous disciples when they would have   had fire from heaven to destroy those that were not of their mind no   but did not christ rebuke them saying ye know not what spirit ye   are of and if it was neither christs spirit nor their own spirit   that would have fire from heavenoh what is that spirit that would   kindle fire on earth to destroy such as peaceably dissent upon the   account of conscience    o king when did the true religion persecute when did the true church   offer violence for religion were not her weapons prayers tears and   patience did not jesus conquer by these weapons and vanquish cruelty   by suffering can clubs and staves and swords and prisons and   banishments reach the soul convert the heart or convince the   understanding of man when did violence ever make a true convert or   bodily punishment a sincere christian this maketh void the end of   christs coming yea it robbeth gods spirit of its office which is   to convince the world that is the sword by which the ancient   christians overcame  the theory of persecution seems to rest on the following assumptions 1 a duty implies a right we have a right to do whatever it is our duty to do 2 it is the duty and consequently the right of the supreme power in a state to promote the greatest possible sum of wellbeing in that state 3 this is impossible without morality 4 but morality can neither be produced or preserved in a people at large without true religion 5 relative to the duties of the legislature or governors that is the true religion which they conscientiously believe to be so 6 as there can be but one true religion at the same time this one it is their duty and right to authorize and protect 7 but the established religion cannot be protected and secured except by the imposition of restraints or the influence of penalties on those who profess and propagate hostility to it 8 true religion consisting of precepts counsels commandments doctrines and historical narratives cannot be effectually proved or defended but by a comprehensive view of the whole as a system now this cannot be hoped for from the mass of mankind but it may be attacked and the faith of ignorant men subverted by particular objections by the statement of difficulties without any counterstatement of the greater difficulties which would result from the rejection of the former and by all the other stratagems used in the desultory warfare of sectaries and infidels this is however manifestly dishonest and dangerous and there must exist therefore a power in the state to prevent suppress and punish it 9 the advocates of toleration have never been able to agree among themselves concerning the limits to their own claims have never established any clear rules as to what shall and what shall not be admitted under the name of religion and conscience treason and the grossest indecencies not only may be but have been called by these names as among the earlier anabaptists 10 and last it is a petitio principii or begging the question to take for granted that a state has no power except in case of overt acts it is its duty to prevent a present evil as much at least as to punish the perpetrators of it besides preaching and publishing are overt acts nor has it yet been proved though often asserted that a christian sovereign has nothing to do with the eternal happiness or misery of the fellow creatures entrusted to his charge    hint for a new species of history    the very knowledge of the opinions and customs of so considerable a   part of mankind as the jews now are and especially have been   heretofore is valuable both for pleasure and use it is a very good   piece of history and that of the best kind namely of human nature   and of that part of it which is most different from us and commonly   the least known to us and indeed the principal advantage which is   to be made by the wiser sort of men of most writings is rather to see   what men think and are than to be informed of the natures and truth   of things to observe what thoughts and passions have occupied mens   minds what opinions and manners they are of in this view it becomes   of no mean importance to notice and record the strangest ignorance   the most putid fables impertinent trifling ridiculous disputes and   more ridiculous pugnacity in the defence and retention of the subjects   disputed   publishers preface to the reader in lightfoots works vol i  in the thick volume of title pages and chapters of contents composed of large and small works correspondent to each proposed by a certain omnipregnant nihiliparturient genius of my acquaintance not the least promising isa history of the morals and as connected therewith of the manners of the english nation from the conquest to the present time from the chapter of contents it appears that my friend is a steady believer in the uninterrupted progression of his fellow countrymen that there has been a constant growth of wealth and wellbeing among us and with these an increase of knowledge and with increasing knowledge an increase and diffusion of practical goodness the degrees of acceleration indeed have been different at different periods the moral being has sometimes crawled sometimes strolled sometimes walked sometimes run but it has at all times been moving onward if in any one point it has gone backward it has been only in order to leap forward in some other the work was to commence with a numeration table or catalogue of those virtues or qualities which make a man happy in himself and which conduce to the happiness of those about him in a greater or lesser sphere of agency the degree and the frequency in which each of these virtues manifested themselves in the successive reigns from william the conqueror inclusively were to be illustrated by apposite quotations from the works of contemporary writers not only of historians and chroniclers but of the poets romance writers and theologians not omitting the correspondence between literary men the laws and regulations civil and ecclesiastical and whatever records the industry of antiquarians has brought to light in their provincial municipal and monastic historiestall tomes and huge undegenerate sons of anak which look down from a dizzy height on the dwarfish progeny of contemporary wit and can find no associates in size at a less distance than two centuries and in arranging which the puzzled librarian must commit an anachronism in order to avoid an anatopism  such of these illustrations as most amused or impressed me when i heard them for alas even his very title pages and contents my friend composes only in air i shall probably attempt to preserve in different parts of these omniana at present i shall cite one article only which i found wafered on a blank leaf of his memorandum book superscribed flattering news for anno domini 2000 whenever it shall institute a comparison between itself and the 17th and 18th centuries it consists of an extract say rather an exsection from the kingston mercantile advertiser from saturday august the 15th to tuesday august 18th 1801 this paper which contained at least twenty more advertisements of the very same kind was found by accident among the wrappingpapers in the trunk of an officer just returned from the west india station they stand here exactly as in the original from which they are reprinted    kingston july 30 1801    ran away about three weeks ago from a penn near halfway tree a   negro wench named nancy of the chamba country strong made an ulcer   on her left leg marked d c diamond between she is supposed to be   harboured by her husband dublin who has the direction of a wherry   working between this town and port royal and is the property of mr   fishley of that place the said negro man having concealed a boy in   his wherry before half a joe will be paid to any person apprehending   the above described wench and delivering to mr archibald m lea   east end and if found secreted by any person the law will be put in   force     kingston august 13 1801    strayed on monday evening last a negro boy of the moco country named   joe the property of mr thomas williams planter in st johns who   had sent him to town under the charge of a negro man with a cart for   provisions the said boy is perhaps from 15 to 18 years of age   about twelve months in the country no mark speaks little english   but can tell his owners name had on a long oznaburg frock it is   supposed he might have gone out to vend some pears and lemongrass   and have lost himself in the street one pistole will be paid to any   person apprehending and bringing him to this office     kingston july 1 1801    forty shillings reward    strayed on friday evening last and was seen going up west street the   following morning a small bay horse the left ear lapped flat rump   much scored from the saddle on his back and marked on the near side   f m with a diamond between whoever will take up the said horse and   deliver him to w balantine butcher back of west street will   receive the above reward    kingston july 4 1801    strayed on sunday morning last from the subscribers house in east   street a bright dun hemule the mane lately cropped a large chafe   slightly skinned over on the near buttock and otherwise chafed from   the action of the harness in his recent breaking half a joe will be   paid to any person taking up and bringing this mule to the   subscribers house or to the store in harbour street john walsh     kingston july 2 1801    ten pounds reward    ran away    about two years ago from the subscriber a negro woman named    dorah    purchased from alexander mkean esq she is about 20 years of age   and 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high has a mark on one of her shoulders   about the size of a quarter dollar occasioned she says by the yaws   of a coal black complexion very artful and most probably passes   about the country with false papers and under another name if that is   not the case it must be presumed she is harboured about green pond   where she has a mother and other connexions  what a history horses and negros negros and horses it makes me tremble at my own nature surely every religious and conscientious briton is equally a debtor in gratitude to thomas clarkson and his fellow labourers with every african for on the soul of every individual among us did a portion of guilt rest as long as the slave trade remained legal  a few years back the public was satiated with accounts of the happy condition of the slaves in our colonies and the great encouragements and facilities afforded to such of them as by industry and foresight laboured to better their situation with what truth this is stated as the general tone of feeling among our planters and their agents may be conjectured from the following sentences which made part of what in england we call the leading paragraph of the same newspaper    strange as it may appear we are assured as a fact that a number of   slaves in this town have purchased lots of land and are absolutely in   possession of the fee simple of lands and tenements neither is it   uncommon for the men slaves to purchase or manumize their wives and   vice versa the wives their husbands to account for this we need   only look to the depredations daily committed and the impositions   practised to the distress of the community and ruin of the fair   trader negro yards too under such direction will necessarily prove   the asylum of runaways from the country     text sparring  when i hear as who now can travel twenty miles in a stage coach without the probability of hearing an ignorant religionist quote an unconnected sentence of half a dozen words from any part of the old or new testament and resting on the literal sense of these words the eternal misery of all who reject nay even of all those countless myriads who have never had the opportunity of accepting this and sundry other articles of faith conjured up by the same textual magic i ask myself what idea these persons form of the bible that they should use it in a way in which they themselves use no other book they deem the whole written by inspiration well but is the very essence of rational discourse that is connection and dependency done away because the discourse is infallibly rational the mysteries which these spiritual lynxes detect in the simplest texts remind me of the 500 nondescripts each as large as his own black cat which dr katterfelto by aid of his solar microscope discovered in a drop of transparent water  but to a contemporary who has not thrown his lot in the same helmet with them these fanatics think it a crime to listen let them then or far rather let those who are in danger of infection from them attend to the golden aphorisms of the old and orthodox divines sentences in scripture says dr donne like hairs in horses tails concur in one root of beauty and strength but being plucked out one by one serve only for springes and snares  the second i transcribe from the preface to lightfoots works inspired writings are an inestimable treasure to mankind for so many sentences so many truths but then the true sense of them must be known otherwise so many sentences so many authorized falsehoods    pelagianism  our modern latitudinarians will find it difficult to suppose that anything could have been said in the defence of pelagianism equally absurd with the facts and arguments which have been adduced in favour of original sin sin being taken as guilt that is observes a socinian wit the crime of being born but in the comment of rabbi akibah on ecclesiastes xii 1 we have a story of a mother who must have been a most determined believer in the uninheritability of sin for having a sickly and deformed child and resolved that it should not be thought to have been punished for any fault of its parents or ancestors and yet having nothing else for which to blame the child she seriously and earnestly accused it before the judge of having kicked her unmercifully during her pregnancy  i am firmly persuaded that no doctrine was ever widely diffused among various nations through successive ages and under different religions such as is the doctrine of original sin and redemption those fundamental articles of every known religion professing to be revealed which is not founded either in the nature of things or in the necessities of our nature in the language of the schools it carries with it presumptive evidence that it is either objectively or subjectively true and the more strange and contradictory such a doctrine may appear to the understanding or discursive faculty the stronger is the presumption in its favour for whatever satirists may say and sciolists imagine the human mind has no predilection for absurdity i do not however mean that such a doctrine shall be always the best possible representation of the truth on which it is founded for the same body casts strangely different shadows in different places and different degrees of light but that it always does shadow out some such truth and derive its influence over our faith from our obscure perception of that truth yea even where the person himself attributes his belief of it to the miracles with which it was announced by the founder of his religion    the soul and its organs of sense  it is a strong presumptive proof against materialism that there does not exist a language on earth from the rudest to the most refined in which a materialist can talk for five minutes together without involving some contradiction in terms to his own system objection will not this apply equally to the astronomer newton no doubt talked of the suns rising and setting just like other men what should we think of the coxcomb who should have objected to him that he contradicted his own system answerno it does not apply equally say rather it is utterly inapplicable to the astronomer and natural philosopher for his philosophic and his ordinary language speak of two quite different things both of which are equally true in his ordinary language he refers to a fact of appearance to a phenomenon common and necessary to all persons in a given situation in his scientific language he determines that one position or figure which being supposed the appearance in question would be the necessary result and all appearances in all situations maybe demonstrably foretold let a body be suspended in the air and strongly illuminated what figure is here a triangle but what here a trapeziumand so on the same question put to twenty men in twenty different positions and distances would receive twenty different answers each would be a true answer but what is that one figure which being so placed all these facts of appearance must result according to the law of perspectiveay this is a different question this is a new subject the words which answer this would be absurd if used in reply to the former 1  thus the language of the scripture on natural objects is as strictly philosophical as that of the newtonian system perhaps more so for it is not only equally true but it is universal among mankind and unchangeable it describes facts of appearance and what other language would have been consistent with the divine wisdom the inspired writers must have borrowed their terminology either from the crude and mistaken philosophy of their own times and so have sanctified and perpetuated falsehood unintelligible meantime to all but one in ten thousand or they must have anticipated the terminology of the true system without any revelation of the system itself and so have become unintelligible to all men or lastly they must have revealed the system itself and thus have left nothing for the exercise developement or reward of the human understanding instead of teaching that moral knowledge and enforcing those social and civic virtues out of which the arts and sciences will spring up in due time and of their own accord but nothing of this applies to the materialist he refers to the very same facts of which the common language of mankind speaks and these too are facts that have their sole and entire being in our own consciousness facts as to which esse and conscire are identical now whatever is common to all languages in all climates at all times and in all stages of civilization must be the exponent and consequent of the common consciousness of man as man whatever contradicts this universal language therefore contradicts the universal consciousness and the facts in question subsisting exclusively in consciousness whatever contradicts the consciousness contradicts the fact  i have been seduced into a dry discussion where i had intended only a few amusing facts in proof that the mind makes the sense far more than the senses make the mind if i have life and health and leisure i purpose to compile from the works memoirs and transactions of the different philosophical societies in europe from magazines and the rich store of medical and psychological publications furnished by the english french and german press all the essays and cases that relate to the human faculties under unusual circumstances for pathology is the crucible of physiology excluding such only as are not intelligible without the symbols or terminology of science these i would arrange under the different senses and powers as the eye the ear the touch c the imitative power voluntary and automatic the imagination or shaping and modifying power the fancy or the aggregative and associative power the understanding or the regulative substantiating and realizing power the speculative reason vis theoretica et scientifica or the power  by which we produce or aim to produce unity necessity and a  universality in all our knowledge by means of principles 2a priori the will or practical reason the faculty of choice willkühr and distinct both from the moral will and the choice the sensation of volition which i have found reason to include under the head of single and double touch  thence i propose to make a new arrangement of madness whether as defect or as excess of any of these senses or faculties and thus by appropriate cases to shew the difference between 1 a man having lost his reason but not his senses or  understandingthat is when he sees things as other men see  themadapts means to ends as other men would adapt them and not

excess of sensation as  overpowers and suspends all which is frenzy or raving madness  a diseased state of an organ of sense or of the inner organs connected with it will perpetually tamper with the understanding and unless there be an energetic and watchful counteraction of the judgment of which i have known more than one instance in which the comparing and reflecting judgment has obstinately

passing through temple sowerby in westmorland some ten years back i was shewn a man perfectly blind and blind from his infancy fowell was his name this mans chief amusement was fishing on the wild and uneven banks of the river eden and up the different streams and tarns among the mountains he had an intimate friend likewise stone blind a dexterous card player who knows every gate and stile far and near throughout the country these two often coursed together and the people here as every where fond of the marvellous affirm that they were the best beaters up of game in the whole country the every way amiable and estimable john gough of kendal is not only an excellent mathematician but an infallible botanist and zoologist he has frequently at the first feel corrected the mistakes of the most experienced sportsman with regard to the birds or vermin which they had killed when it chanced to be a variety or rare species so completely resembling the common one that it required great steadiness of observation to detect the difference even after it had been pointed out as to plants and flowers the rapidity of his touch appears fully equal to that of sight and the accuracy greater good heavens it needs only to look at him why his face sees all over it is all one eye i almost envied him for the purity and excellence of his own nature never broken in upon by those evil looks or features which are looks become fixtures with which low cunning habitual cupidity presumptuous sciolism and hearthardening vanity coarsen the human faceit is the mere stamp the undisturbed ectypon of his own soul add to this that he is a quaker with all the blest negatives without any of the silly and factious positives of that sect which with all its bogs and hollows is still the prime sunshine spot of christendom in the eye of the true philosopher when i was in germany in the year 1798 i read at hanover and met with two respectable persons one a clergyman the other a physician who confirmed to me the account of the upperstall master at hanover written by himself and countersigned by all his medical attendants as far as i recollect he had fallen from his horse on his head and in consequence of the blow lost both his sight and hearing for nearly three years and continued for the greater part of this period in a state of nervous fever his understanding however remained unimpaired and unaffected and his entire consciousness as to outward impressions being confined to the sense of touch he at length became capable of reading any book if printed as most german books are on coarse paper with his fingers in much the same manner in which the pianoforte is played and latterly with an almost incredible rapidity likewise by placing his hand with the fingers all extended at a small distance from the lips of any person that spoke slowly and distinctly to him he learned to recognize each letter by its different effects on his nerves and thus spelt the words as they were uttered it was particularly noticed both by himself from his sensations and by his medical attendants from observation that the letter r if pronounced full and strong and recurring once or more in the same word produced a small spasm or twitch in his hand and fingers at the end of three years he recovered both his health and senses and with the necessity soon lost the power which he had thus acquired  footnote 1 see church and state appendix p 231 ed  footnote 2 this phrase a priori is in common most grossly misunderstood and an absurdity burthened on it which it does not deserve by knowledge a priori we do not mean that we can know any thing previously to experience which would be a contradiction in terms but having once known it by occasion of experience that is something acting upon us from without we then know that it must have preexisted or the experience itself would have been impossible by experience only i know that i have eyes but then my reason convinces me that i must have had eyes in order to the experience     sir george etherege etc  often and often had i read gays beggars opera and always delighted with its poignant wit and original satire and if not without noticing its immorality yet without any offence from it some years ago i for the first time saw it represented in one of the london theatres and such were the horror and disgust with which it impressed me so grossly did it outrage all the best feelings of my nature that even the angelic voice and perfect science of mrs billington lost half their charms or rather increased my aversion to the piece by an additional sense of incongruity then i learned the immense difference between reading and seeing a playand no wonder indeed for who has not passed over with his eye a hundred passages without offence which he yet could not have even read aloud or have heard so read by another person without an inward strugglein mere passive silent reading the thoughts remain mere thoughts and these too not our ownphantoms with no attribute of place no sense of appropriation that flit over the consciousness as shadows over the grass or young corn in an april day but even the sound of our own or anothers voice takes them out of that lifeless twilight realm of thought which is the confine the intermundium as it were of existence and nonexistence merely that the thoughts have become audible by blending with them a sense of outness gives them a sort of reality what thenwhen by every contrivance of scenery appropriate dresses according and auxiliary looks and gestures and the variety of persons on the stage realities are employed to carry the imitation of reality as near as possible to perfect delusion  if a manly modesty shrinks from uttering an indecent phrase before a wife or sister in a private room what must be the effect when a repetition of such treasons for all gross and libidinous allusions are emphatically treasons against the very foundations of human society against all its endearing charities and all the mother virtues is hazarded before a mixed multitude in a public theatre when every innocent woman must blush at once with pain at the thoughts she rejects and with indignant shame at those which the foul hearts of others may attribute to her  thus too with regard to the comedies of wycherly vanburgh and etherege i used to please myself with the flattering comparison of the manners universal at present among all classes above the lowest with those of our ancestors even of the highest ranks but if for a moment i think of those comedies as having been acted i lose all sense of comparison in the shame that human nature could at any time have endured such outrages to its dignity and if conjugal affection and the sweet name of sister were too weak that yet filial piety the gratitude for a mothers holy love should not have risen and hissed into infancy these traitors to their own natural gifts who lampooned the noblest passions of humanity in order to pander for its lowest appetites  as far however as one bad thing can be palliated by comparison with a worse this may be said in extenuation of these writers that the mischief which they can do even on the stage is trifling compared with that stile of writing which began in the pesthouse of french literature and has of late been imported by the littles of the age which consists in a perpetual tampering with the morals without offending the decencies and yet the admirers of these publications nay the authors themselves have the assurance to complain of shakspeare for i will not refer to one yet far deeper blasphemyshakspeare whose most objectionable passages are but grossnesses against lust and these written in a gross age while three fourths of their whole works are delicacies for its support and sustenance lastly that i may leave the reader in better humour with the name at the head of this article i shall quote one scene from ethereges love in a tub which for exquisite genuine original humour is worth all the rest of his plays though two or three of his witty contemporaries were thrown in among them as a make weight the scene might be entitled the

clearness of conviction of this with a clarkson and bells perseverance what might not be done how awful a duty does not hope become what a nurse yea mother of all other the fairest virtues we despair of others goodness and thence are ourselves bad o let me live to show the errors of the most of those who have hitherto attempted this workhow they have too often put the intellectual and the moral yea the moral and the religious faculties at strife with each other and how they ought to act with an equal eye to all to feel that all is involved in the perfection of each this is the fundamental position   footnote 1 although the misery on the earth is great indeed yet the foundation of it rests after deduction of the partly bearable partly removable and partly imaginary evil of the natural world entirely and alone on the moral dealings of men ed     selflove in religion  the unselfishness of selflove in the hopes and fears of religion consistsfirstin the previous necessity of a moral energy in order so far to subjugate the sensual which is indeed and properly the selfish part of our nature as to believe in a state after death on the grounds of the christian religionsecondlyin the abstract and as it were unindividual nature of the idea self or soul when conceived apart from our present living body and the world of the senses in my religious meditations of hope and fear the reflection that this course of action will purchase heaven for me for my soul involves a thought of and for all men who pursue the same course in worldly blessings such as those promised in the old law each man might make up to himself his own favourite scheme of happiness i will be strictly just and observe all the laws and ceremonies of my religion that god may grant me such a woman for my wife or wealth and honour with which i will purchase such and such an estate c but the reward of heaven admits no daydreams its hopes and its fears are too vast to endure an outline i will endeavour to abstain from vice and force myself to do such and such acts of duty in order that i may make myself capable of that freedom of moral being without which heaven would be no heaven to me now this very thought tends to annihilate self for what is a self not distinguished from any other self but like an individual circle in geometry uncoloured and the representative of all other circles the circle is differenced indeed from a triangle or square so is a virtuous soul from a vicious soul a soul in bliss from a soul in misery but no wise distinguished from other souls under the same predicament that selfishness which includes of necessity the selves of all my fellowcreatures is assuredly a social and generous principle i speak as before observed of the objective or reflex selffor as to the subjective self it is merely synonymous with consciousness and obtains equally whether i think of me or of himin both cases it is i thinking  still however i freely admit that there neither is nor can be any such selfoblivion in these hopes and fears when practically reflected on as often takes place in love and acts of loving kindness and the habit of which constitutes a sweet and loving nature and this leads me to the third and most important reflection namely that the souls infinite capacity of pain and of joy through an infinite duration does really on the most highflying notions of love and justice make my own soul and the most anxious care for the character of its future fate an object of emphatic duty what can be the object of human virtue but the happiness of sentient still more of moral beings but an infinite duration of faculties infinite in progression even of one soul is so vast so boundless an idea that we are unable to distinguish it from the idea of the whole race of mankind if to seek the temporal welfare of all mankind be disinterested virtue much more must the eternal welfare of my own soul be sofor the temporal welfare of all mankind is included within a finite space and finite number and my imagination makes it easy by sympathies and visions of outward resemblance but myself in eternity as the object of my contemplation differs unimaginably from my present self do but try to think of yourself in eternal miseryyou will find that you are stricken with horror for it even as for a third person conceive it in hazard thereof and you will feel commiseration for it and pray for it with an anguish of sympathy very different from the outcry of an immediate selfsuffering  blessed be god that which makes us capable of vicious selfinterestedness capacitates us also for disinterestedness that i am capable of preferring a smaller advantage of my own to a far greater good of another manthis the power of comparing the notions of him and me objectively enables me likewise to preferat least furnishes the condition of my preferringa greater good of another to a lesser good of my ownnay a pleasure of his or external advantage to an equal one of my own and thus too that i am capable of loving my neighbour as myself empowers me to love myself as my neighbournot only as much but in the same way and with the very same feeling  this is the great privilege of pure religion by diverting selflove to our self under those relations in which alone it is worthy of our anxiety it annihilates self as a notion of diversity extremes meet these reflections supply a forcible and i believe quite new argument against the purgatory both of the romanists and of the modern millennarians and final salvationists their motives do indeed destroy the essence of virtue  the doctors of selflove are misled by a wrong use of the wordswe love ourselves now this is impossible for a finite and created being in the absolute meaning of self and in its secondary and figurative meaning self signifies only a less degree of distance a narrowness of moral view and a determination of value by measurement hence the body is in this sense our self because the sensations have been habitually appropriated to it in too great a proportion but this is not a necessity of our nature there is a state possible even in this life in which we may truly say my self lovesfreely constituting its secondary or objective love in what it wills to love commands what it wills and wills what it commands the difference between selflove and self that loves consists in the objects of the former as given to it according to the law of the senses while the latter determines the objects according to the law in the spirit the first loves because it must the second because it ought and the result of the first is not in any objective imaginable comprehensible action but in that action by which it abandoned its power of true agency and willed its own fall this is indeed a mystery how can it be otherwisefor if the will be unconditional it must be inexplicable the understanding of a thing being an insight into its conditions and causes but whatever is in the will is the will and must therefore be equally inexplicable  in a word the difference of an unselfish from a selfish love even in this life consists in this that the latter depends on our transferring our present passion or appetite or rather on our dilating and stretching it out in imagination as the covetous man doeswhile in the former we carry ourselves forward under a very different state from the present as the young man who restrains his appetites in respect of his future self as a tranquil and healthy old man this last requires as great an effort of disinterestedness as if not a greater than to give up a present enjoyment to another person who is present to us the alienation from distance in time and from diversity of circumstance is greater in the one case than in the other and let it be remembered that a christian may exert all the virtues and virtuous charities of humanity in any state yea in the pangs of a wounded conscience he may feel for the future periods of his own lost

longer experience and superior wisdom bordering on revelation especially to jews and christians who are in the lifelong habit of attaching to patriarchs an intimacy with the supreme being take it on

act of the will  love however sudden as when we fall in love at first sight which is perhaps always the case of love in its highest sense is yet an act of the will and that too one of its primary and therefore ineffable acts this is most important for if it be not true either love itself is all a romantic hum a mere connection of desire with a form appropriated to excite and gratify it or the mere repetition of a daydreamor if it be granted that love has a real distinct and excellent being i know not how we could attach blame and immorality to inconstancy when confined to the affections and a sense of preference either therefore we must brutalize our notions with pope    lust thro some certain strainers well refind   is gentle love and charms all womankind  or we must dissolve and thaw away all bonds of morality by the irresistible shocks of an irresistible sensibility with sterne    wedded union  the wellspring of all sensible communion is the natural delight and need which undepraved man hath to transfuse from himself into others and to receive from others into himself those things wherein the excellency of his kind doth most consist and the eminence of love or marriage

four things1 an understanding proportionate to thine that is a recipiency at least of thine2 natural sensibility and lively sympathy in general3 steadiness in attaching and retaining sensibility to its proper objects in its proper proportions4 mutual liking including person and all the thousand obscure sympathies that determine conjugal liking that is love and desire to a rather than to b this seems very obvious and almost trivial and yet all unhappy marriages arise from the not honestly putting and sincerely answering each of these four questions any one of them negatived marriage is imperfect and in hazard of discontent    difference between hobbes and spinosa  in the most similar and nearest points there is a difference but for the most part there is an absolute contrast between hobbes and spinosa thus hobbes makes a state of war the natural state of man from the essential and ever continuing nature of man as not a moral but only a frightenable beingspinosa makes the same state a necessity of man out of society because he must then be an undeveloped man and his moral being dormant and so on through the whole     the end may justify the means  whatever act is necessary

spread wide and utter forth the joy arisen and in innumerable finite glories interpret all they can of infinite bliss    definition of miracle  a phaenomenon in no connection with any other phaenomenon as its immediate cause is a miracle and what is believed to have been such is miraculous for the person so believing when it is strange and surprising that is with out any analogy in our former experienceit is called a miracle the kind defines the thingthe circumstances the word  to stretch out my arm is a miracle unless the materialists should be more cunning than they have proved themselves hitherto to reanimate a dead man by an act of the will no intermediate agency employed not only is but is called a miracle a scripture miracle therefore must be so defined as to express not only its miracular essence but likewise the condition of its appearing miraculous add therefore to the preceding the words praeter omnem prior em experientiam  it might be defined likewise an effect not having its cause in any thing congenerous that thought calls up thought is no more miraculous than that a billiard ball moves a billiard ball but that a billiard ball should excite a thought that is be perceived is a miracle and were it strange would be called such for take the converse that a thought should call up a billiard ball yet where is the difference but that the one is a common experience the other never yet experienced  it is not strictly accurate to affirm that every thing would appear a miracle if we were wholly uninfluenced by custom and saw things as they arefor then the very ground of all miracles would probably vanish namely the heterogeneity of spirit and matter for the quid ulterius of wonder we should have the ne plus ultra of adoration  againthe word miracle has an objective a subjective and a popular meaningas objectivethe essence of a miracle consists in the heterogeneity of the consequent and its causative antecedentas subjectivein the assumption of the heterogeneity add the wonder and surprise excited when the consequent is out of the course of experience and we know the popular sense and ordinary use of the word    death and grounds of belief in a future state  it is an important thought that death judged of by corporeal analogies certainly implies discerption or dissolution of parts but pain and pleasure do not nay they seem inconceivable except under the idea of concentration therefore the influence of the body on the soul will not prove the common destiny of both i feel myself not the slave of nature nature used here as the mundus sensibilis in the sense in which animals are not only my thoughts and affections extend to objects transnatural as truth virtue god not only do my powers extend vastly beyond all those which i could have derived from the instruments and organs with which nature has furnished me but i can do what nature per se cannot i ingraft i raise heavy bodies above the clouds and guide my course over ocean and through air i alone am lord of fire and light other creatures are but their almsfolk and of all the so called elements water earth air and all their compounds to speak in the everenduring language of the senses to which nothing can be revealed but as compact or fluid or aerial i not merely subserve myself of them but i employ them ergo there is in me or rather i am a præternatural that is a supersensuous thing but what is not nature why should it perish with nature why lose the faculty of vision because my spectacles are broken  now to this it will be objected and very forcibly toothat the soul or self is acted upon by nature through the body and water or caloric diffused through or collected in the brain will derange the faculties of the soul by deranging the organization of the brain the sword cannot touch the soul but by rending the flesh it will rend the feelings therefore the violence of nature may in destroying the body mediately destroy the soul it is to this objection that my first sentence applies and is an important and i believe a new and the only satisfactory reply i have ever heard  the one great and binding ground of the belief of god and a hereafter is the law of conscience but as the aptitudes and beauty and grandeur of the world are a sweet and beneficent inducement to this belief a constant fuel to our faith so here we seek these arguments not as dissatisfied with the one main ground not as of little faith but because believing it to be it is natural we should expect to find traces of it and as a noble way of employing and developing and enlarging the faculties of the soul and this not by way of motive but of assimilation producing virtue  2d april 1811    hatred of injustice  it is the mark of a noble nature to be more shocked with the unjust condemnation of a bad man than of a virtuous one as in the instance of strafford for in such cases the love of justice and the hatred of the contrary are felt more nakedly and constitute a strong passion per se not only unaided by but in conquest of the softer selfrepaying sympathies a wise foresight too inspires jealousy that so may principles be most easily overthrown this is the virtue of a wise man which a mob never possesses even as a mob never perhaps has the malignant finis ultimus which is the vice of a man    religion  amongst the great truths are these  i that religion has no speculative dogmas that all is practical all appealing to the will and therefore all imperative i am the lord thy god thou shall have none other gods but me  ii that therefore miracles are not the proofs but the necessary results of revelation they are not the key of the arch and roof of evidence though they may be a compacting stone in it which gives while it receives strength hence to make the intellectual faith a fair analogon or unison of the vital faith it ought to be stamped in the mind by all the evidences duly coordinated and not designed by single penstrokes beginning either here or there  iii that according to no i christ is not described primarily and characteristically as a teacher but as a doer a light indeed but an effective light the sun which causes what it shows as well as shows what it first causes  iv that a certain degree of morality is presupposed in the reception of christianity it is the substratum of the moral interest which substantiates the evidence of miracles the instance of a profligate suddenly converted if properly sifted will be found but an apparent exception  v that the being of a god and the immortality of man are every where assumed by christ  vi that socinianism is not a religion but a theory and that too a very pernicious or a very unsatisfactory theory perniciousfor it excludes all our deep and awful ideas of the perfect holiness of god his justice and his mercy and thereby makes the voice of conscience a delusion as having no correspondent in the character of the legislator regarding god as merely a goodnatured pleasuregiver so happiness be produced indifferent as to the meansunsatisfactory for it promises forgiveness without any solution of the difficulty of the compatibility of this with the justice of god in no way explains the fallen condition of man nor offers any means for his regeneration if you will be good you will be happy it says that may be but my will is weak i sink in the struggle  vii that socinianism never did and never can subsist as a general religion for   1 it neither states the disease on account of which the human being   hungers for revelation nor prepares any remedy in general nor   ministers any hope to the individual   2 in order to make itself endurable on scriptural grounds it must so   weaken the texts and authority of scripture as to leave in scripture   no binding ground of proof of any thing   3 take a pious jew one of the maccabees and compare his faith and   its grounds with priestleys and then for what did christ come  viii that socinianism involves the shocking thought that man will not and ought not to be expected to do his duty as man unless he first makes a bargain with his maker and his maker with him give me the individual me a positive proof that i shall be in a state of pleasure after my death if i do so and so and then i will do it not else and the proof asked is not one dependent on or flowing from his moral nature and moral feelings but wholly extramoral namely by his outward senses the subjugation of which to faith that is the passive to the actional and selfcreated belief is the great object of all religion  ix that socinianism involves the dreadful reflection that it can establish its probability its certainty being wholly out of the question and impossible priestley himself declaring that his own continuance as a christian depended on a contingency only on the destruction of all the arguments furnished for our permanent and essential distinction from brutes that it must prove that we have no grounds to obey but on the contrary that in wisdom we ought to reject and declare utterly null all the commands of conscience and all that is implied in those commands reckless of the confusion introduced into our notions of means and ends by the denial of truth goodness justice mercy and the other fundamental ideas in the idea of god and all this in order to conduct us to a mahomets bridge of a knifes edge or the breadth of a spear to salvation and should we discover any new documents or should an acuter logician make plain the sophistry of the deductions drawn from the present documents and surely a man who has passed from orthodoxy to the loosest arminianism and thence to arianism and thence to direct humanism has no right from his experience to deny the probability of thisthen to fall off into the hopeless abyss of atheism for the present life we know is governed by fixed laws which the atheist acknowledges as well as the theist and if there be no spiritual world and no spiritual life in a spiritual world what possible bearing can the admission or rejection of this hypothesis have on our practice or feelings  lastly the mosaic dispensation was a scheme of national education the christian is a worldreligion and the former was susceptible of evidence and probabilities which do not and cannot apply to the latter a savage people forced as it were into a school of circumstances and gradually in the course of generations taught the unity of god first and for centuries merely as a practical abstinence from the worship of any otherhow can the principles of such a system apply to christianity which goes into all nations and to all men the most enlightened even by preference  writing several years later than the date of the preceding paragraphs i commend the modern unitarians for their candour in giving up the possible worshipability of christ if not very goda proof that truth will ultimately prevail the arians then existing against whom waterland wrote were not converted but in the next generation the arguments made their way this is fame versus reputation     the apostles creed   is it not probable from what is found in the writings of cyril eusebius cyprian marcellus of ancyra and others that our present apostles creed is not the very symbolum fidei which was not to be written but was always repeated at baptism for this latter certainly contained the doctrine of the eternal generation of the logos and therefore it seems likely that the present apostles creed was an introductory and as it were alphabetical creed for young catechumens in their first elementation is it to be believed that the symbolum fidei contained nothing but the mere history of jesus without any of the peculiar doctrines or that if it did not contain something more the great and vehement defenders of the trinity would speak of it so magnificently as they do even preferring its authority to that of the scripturesbesides does not austin positively say that our present apostles creed was gathered out of the scriptures whereas the symbolum fidei was elder than the gospels and probably contained only the three doctrines of the trinity the redemption and the unity of the church may it not have happened when baptism was administered so early and at last even to infants that the old symbolum fidei became gradually inusitatum as being appropriated to adult proselytes from judaism or paganism this seems to me even more than probable for in proportion to the majority of born over converted christians must the creed of instruction have been more frequent than that of doctrinal profession     a good heart   there is in abbts essays an attempt to determine the true sense of this phrase at least to unfold auseinandersetzen what is meant and felt by it i was much pleased with the remarks i remember and with the counterposition of tom jones and sir charles grandisori might not luther and calvin serve but it is made less noticeable in these last by its coexistence with and sometimes real more often apparent subordination to fixed conscious principles and is thus less naturally characteristic parson adams contrasted with dr harrison in fieldings amelia would do then there is the suppression of the good heart and the substitution of principles or motives for the good heart as in laud and the whole race of conscientious persecutors such principles constitute the virtues of the inquisition a good heart contrasts with the pharisaic righteousness this last contemplation of the pharisees the dogmatists and the rigorists in toto genere serves to reconcile me to the fewness of the men who act on fixed principles for unless there exist intellectual power to determine aright what are the principia jam fixa et formata and unless there be the wisdom of love preceding the love of wisdom and unless to this be added a graciousness of nature a loving kindnessthese rigorists are but bigots often to errors and active yea remorseless in preventing or staying the rise and progress of truth and even when bigotted adherents to true principles yet they render truth unamiable and forbid little children to come thereunto as human nature now is it is well perhaps that the number should be few seeing that of the few the greater part are prematurities  the number of those who act from good hearted impulses a kindly and cheerful mood and the play of minute sympathies continuous in their discontinuity like the sandthread of the hourglass and from their minuteness and transiency not calculated to stiffen or inflate the individual and thus remaining unendangered by egotism and its unhandsome vizard contempt is far larger and though these temperamental provirtues will too often fail and are not built to stand the storms of strong temptation yet on the whole they carry on the benignant scheme of social nature like the other instincts that rule the animal creation but of all the most numerous are the men who have ever more their own dearliest beloved self as the only or main goal or butt of their endeavours straight and steady before their eyes and whose whole inner world turns on the great axis of selfinterest these form the majority if not of mankind yet of those by whom the business of life is carried on and most expedient it is that so it should be nor can we imagine any thing better contrived for the advantage of society for these are the most industrious orderly and circumspect portion of society and the actions governed by this principle with the results are the only materials on which either the statesman or individuals can safely calculate  there is indeed another sort a class they can scarcely be called who are below selfinterest who live under the mastery of their senses and appetites and whose selfishness is an animal instinct a goad a tergo not an attraction a re prospecta or so to speak from a projected self in fact such individuals cannot so properly be said to have a self as to be machines for the self of nature and are as little capable of loving themselves as of loving their neighbours such there are nay if we were to count only without weighing the aggregate of such persons might possibly form a larger number than the class preceding but they may safely be taken up into the latter for the main ends of society as being or sure to become its materials and tools their folly is the stuff in which the sound sense of the worldlywise is at once manifested and remunerated their idleness of thought with the passions appetites likings and fancies which are its natural growth though weeds give direction and employment to the industry of the other the accidents of inheritance by birth of accumulation of property in partial masses are thus counteractedand the aneurisms in the circulating system prevented or rendered fewer and less obstinatewhilst animal want the sure general result of idleness and its accompanying vices tames at length the selfish host into the laborious slaves and mechanic implements of the selfinterested thus without public spirit nay by the predominance of the opposite quality the latter are the public benefactors and giving steadfastness and compactness to the whole lay in the ground of the canvass on which minds of finer texture may impress beauty and harmony  lastly there is in the heart of all men a working principlecall it ambition or vanity or desire of distinction the inseparable adjunct of our individuality and personal nature and flowing from the same source as languagethe instinct and necessity in each man of declaring his particular existence and thus of singling or singularizing himself in some this principle is far stronger than in others while in others its comparative dimness may pass for its nonexistence but in thoughts at least and secret fancies there is in all men idiocy of course excepted a wish to remain the same and yet to be something else and something more or to exhibit what they are or imagine they might be somewhere else and to other spectators now though this desire of distinction when it is disproportionate to the powers and qualities by which the individual is indeed distinguished or when it is the governing passion or taken as the rule of conduct is but a knavish sprite yet as an attendant and subaltern spirit it has its good purposes and beneficial effects and is not seldom    sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door  though selfish in its origin it yet tends to elevate the individual from selfishness into selflove under a softer and perhaps better form than that of selfinterest the form of selfrespect whatever other objects the man may be pursuing and with whatever other inclinations he is still by this principle impelled and almost compelled to pass out of himself in imagination and to survey himself at a sufficient distance in order to judge what figure he is likely to make in the eyes of his fellow men but in thus taking his station as at the apex of a triangle while the self is at one angle of the base he makes it possible at least that the image of his neighbour may appear at the other whether by spontaneous association or placed there for the purposes of comparison and so both be contemplated at equal distance but this is the first step towards disinterestedness and though it should never be reached the advantage of the appearance is soon learnt and the necessity of avoiding the appearance of the contrary but appearances cannot be long sustained without some touch of the reality at all events there results a control over our actions some good may be produced and many a poisonous or offensive fruit will be prevented courtesy urbanity gallantry munificence the outward influence of the law shall i call it or rather fashion of honourthese are the handsome hypocrisies that spring from the desire of distinction i ask not the genius of a machiavel a tacitus or a swiftit needs only a worldly experience and an observing mind to convince a man of forty that there is no medium between the creed of misanthropy and that of the gospel  a pagan might be as orthodox as paul on the doctrine of works firstset aside the large portion of them that have their source in the constitutional temperamentthe merit of which if any belongs to nature not to the individual agent and of the remaining number of good works nine are derived from vices for one that has its origin in virtue i have often in looking at the waterworks and complex machinery of our manufactories indulged a humorous mood by fancying that the hammers cogs flywheels c were each actuated by some appetite or passionhate rage revenge vanity cupidity c while the general result was most benignant and the machine taken as a whole the product of power knowledge and benevolence such a machine does the moral world the world of human nature appearand to those who seem ever more to place the comparison and the alternative between hell and earth and quite overlook the opposition between earth and heaven i recommend this meditation      evidences of christianity 1   i miraclesas precluding the contrary evidence of no miracles  ii the material of christianity its existence and history  iii the doctrines of christianity and the correspondence of human nature to those doctrinesillustrated    1st historicallyas the actual production of a new world and the   dependence of the fate of the planet upon it    2nd individuallyfrom its appeal for its truth to an asserted   factwhich whether it be real or not every man possessing reason   has an equal power of ascertaining within himselfnamely a will   which has more or less lost its freedom though not the consciousness   that it ought to be and may become freethe conviction that this   cannot be achieved without the operation of a principle connatural   with itselfthe evident rationality of an entire confidence in that   principle being the condition and means of its operationthe   experience in his own nature of the truth of the process described by   scripture as far as he can place himself within the process aided by   the confident assurances of others as to the effects experienced by   them and which he is striving to arrive at all these form a   practical christian add however a gradual opening out of the   intellect to more and more clear perceptions of the strict coincidence   of the doctrines of christianity with the truths evolved by the mind   from reflections on its own nature to such a man one main test of the   objectivity the entity the objective truth of his faith is its   accompaniment by an increase of insight into the moral beauty and   necessity of the process which it comprises and the dependence of   that proof on the causes asserted believe and if thy belief be   right that insight which gradually transmutes faith into knowledge   will be the reward of that belief the christian to whom after a   long profession of christianity the mysteries remain as much   mysteries as before is in the same state as a schoolboy with regard   to his arithmetic to whom the facit at the end of the examples in   his cyphering book is the whole ground for his assuming that such and   such figures amount to so and so    3rd in the above i include the increasing discoveries in the   correspondence of the history the doctrines and the promises of   christianity with the past present and probable future of human   nature and in this state a fair comparison of the religion as a   divine philosophy with all other religions which have pretended to   revelations and all other systems of philosophy both with regard to   the totality of its truth and its identification with the manifest   march of affairs  i should conclude that if we suppose a man to have convinced himself that not only the doctrines of christianity which may be conceived independently of history or time as the trinity spiritual influences c are coincident with the truths which his reason thus strengthened has evolved from its own sources but that the historical dogmas namely of the incarnation of the creative logos and his becoming a personal agent are themselves founded in philosophical necessity then it seems irrational that such a man should reject the belief of the actual appearance of a religion strictly correspondent therewith at a given time recorded even as much as that he should reject caesars account of his wars in gaul after he has convinced himself a priori of their probability  as the result of these convictions he will not scruple to receive the particular miracles recorded inasmuch as it would be miraculous that an incarnate god should not work what must to mere men appear as miracles inasmuch as it is strictly accordant with the ends and benevolent nature of such a being to commence the elevation of man above his mere senses by attracting and enforcing attention first through an appeal to those senses but with equal reason will he expect that no other or greater force should be laid on these miracles as such that they should not be spoken of as good in themselves much less as the adequate and ultimate proof of that religion and likewise he will receive additional satisfaction should he find these miracles so wrought and on such occasions as to give them a personal value as symbols of important truths when their miraculousness was no longer needful or efficacious  footnote 1 dictated to and communicated by dr brabant of devizes ed      confessio fidei  nov 3 1816  i   i i believe that i am a freeagent inasmuch as and so far as i have a will which

me his perfections but as all language presupposes in the intelligent hearer or reader those primary notions which it symbolizes as well as the power of making those combinations of these primary notions which it represents and excites us to combineeven so i believe that the notion of god is essential to the human mind that it is called forth into distinct consciousness principally by the conscience and auxiliarly by the manifest adaptation of means to ends in the outward creation it is therefore evident to my reason that the existence of god is absolutely and necessarily insusceptible of a scientific demonstration and that scripture has so represented it for it commands us to believe in one god i am the lord thy god thou shalt have none other gods but me now all commandment necessarily relates to the will whereas all scientific demonstration is independent of the will and is apodictic or demonstrative only as far as it is compulsory on the mind volentem nolentem  iii my conscience forbids me to propose to myself the pains and pleasures of this life as the primary motive or ultimate end of my actionson the contrary it makes me perceive an utter disproportionateness and heterogeneity between the acts of the spirit as virtue and vice and the things of the sense such as all earthly rewards and punishments must be its hopes and fears therefore refer me to a different and spiritual state of being and i believe in the life to come not through arguments acquired by my understanding or discursive faculty but chiefly and effectively because so to believe is my duty and in obedience to the commands of my conscience here ends the first table of my creed which would have been my creed had i been born with adam and which therefore constitutes what may in this sense be called natural religion that is the religion of all finite rational beings the second table contains the creed of revealed religion my belief as a christian  iv i believe and hold it as the fundamental article of christianity that i am a fallen creature that i am of myself capable of moral evil but not of myself capable of moral good and that an evil ground existed in my will previously to any given act or assignable moment of time in my consciousness i am born a child of wrath this fearful mystery i pretend not to understand i cannot even conceive the possibility of itbut i know that it is so my conscience the sole fountain of certainty commands me to believe it and would itself be a contradiction were it not soand what is real must be possible  v i receive with full and grateful faith the assurance of revelation that the word which is from all eternity with god and is god assumed our human nature in order to redeem me and all mankind from this our connate corruption my reason convinces me that no other mode of redemption is conceivable and as did socrates would have yearned after the redeemer though it would not dare expect so wonderful an act of divine love except only as an effort of my mind to conceive the utmost of the infinite greatness of that love  vi i believe that this assumption of humanity by the son of god was revealed and realized to vis by the word made flesh and manifested to us in christ jesus and that his miraculous birth his agony his crucifixion death resurrection and ascension were all both symbols of our redemption greek transliterated phainomena ton noumenon and necessary parts of the awful process  vii i believe in the descent and sending of the holy spirit by whose free grace obtained for me by the merits of my redeemer i can alone be sanctified and restored from my natural inheritance of sin and condemnation be a child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of god  corollary  the trinity of persons in the unity of the god would have been a necessary idea of my speculative reason deduced from the necessary postulate of an intelligent creator whose ideas being anterior to the things must be more actual than those things even as those things are more actual than our images derived from them and who as intelligent must have had coeternally an adequate idea of himself in and through which he created all things both in heaven and earth but this would only have been a speculative idea like those of circles and other mathematical figures to which we are not authorized by the practical reason to attribute reality solely in consequence of our redemption does the trinity become a doctrine the belief of which as real is commanded by our conscience but to christians it is commanded and it is false candour in a christian believing in original sin and redemption therefrom to admit that any man denying the divinity of christ can be a christian the true language of a christian which reconciles humility with truth would begod and not man is the judge of man which of the two is the christian he will determine but this is evident that if the theanthropist is a christian the psilanthropist cannot be so and vice versa suppose that two tribes used the same written characters but attached different and opposite meanings to them so that niger for instance was used by one tribe to convey the notion black by the other whitecould they without absurdity be said to have the same language even so in the instance of the crucifixion the same image is present to the theanthropist and to the psilanthropist or socinianbut to the latter it represents a mere man a good man indeed and divinely inspired but still a mere man even as moses or paul dying in attestation of the truth of his preaching and in order by his resurrection to give a proof of his mission and inclusively of the resurrection of all mento the former it represents god incarnate taking upon himself the sins of the world and himself thereby redeeming us and giving us life everlasting not merely teaching it the same difference that exists between god and man between giving and the declaration of a gift exists between the trinitarian and the unitarian this might be proved in a few moments if we would only conceive a greek or roman to whom two persons relate their belief each calling christ by a different name it would be impossible for the greek even to guess that they both meant the same person or referred to the same facts   end of volume 1
