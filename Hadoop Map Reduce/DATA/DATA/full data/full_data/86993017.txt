86993017	the celebrity  by winston churchill     volume 1     chapter i  i was about to say that i had known the celebrity from the time he wore kilts but i see i shall have to amend that because he was not a celebrity then nor indeed did he achieve fame until some time after i had left new york for the west in the old days to my commonplace and unobserving mind he gave no evidences of genius whatsoever he never read me any of his manuscripts which i can safely say he would have done had he written any at that time and therefore my lack of detection of his promise may in some degree be pardoned but he had then none of the oddities and mannerisms which i hold to be inseparable from genius and which struck my attention in after days when i came in contact with the celebrity hence i am constrained to the belief that his eccentricity must have arrived with his genius and both after the age of twentyfive far be it from me to question the talents of one upon whose head has been set the laurel of fame  when i knew him he was a young man without frills or foibles with an excellent head for business he was starting in to practise law in a downtown office with the intention of becoming a great corporation lawyer he used to drop into my chambers once in a while to smoke and was firstrate company when i gave a dinner there was generally a cover laid for him i liked the man for his own sake and even had he promised to turn out a celebrity it would have had no weight with me i look upon notoriety with the same indifference as on the buttons on a mans shirtfront or the crest on his notepaper  when i went west he fell out of my life i probably should not have given him another thought had i not caught sight of his name in old capitals on a daintily covered volume in a bookstand i had little time or inclination for reading fiction my days were busy ones and my nights were spent with law books but i bought the volume out of curiosity wondering the while whether he could have written it i was soon set at rest for the dedication was to a young woman of whom i had often heard him speak the volume was a collection of short stories on these i did not feel myself competent to sit in judgment for my personal taste in fiction if i could be said to have had any took another turn the stories dealt mainly with the affairs of aristocratic young men and aristocratic young women and were differentiated to fit situations only met with in that society which does not have to send descriptions of its functions to the newspapers the stories did not seem to me to touch life they were plainly intended to have a bracing moral effect and perhaps had this result for the people at whom they were aimed they left with me the impression of a welldelivered stereopticon lecture with characters about as lifelike as the shadows on the screen and whisking on and off at the mercy of the operator their charm to me lay in the manner of the telling the style which i am forced to admit was delightful  but the book i had bought was a success a great success if the newspapers and the reports of the sales were to be trusted i read the criticisms out of curiosity more than any other prompting and no two of them were alike they veered from extreme negative to extreme positive i have to confess that it gratified me not a little to find the negatives for the most part of my poor way of thinking the positives on the other hand declared the gifted young author to have found a manner of treatment of social life entirely new other critics still insisted it was social ridicule but if this were so the satire was too delicate for ordinary detection  however with the dainty volume my quondam friend sprang into fame at the same time he cast off the chrysalis of a commonplace existence he at once became the hero of the young women of the country from portland maine to portland oregon many of whom wrote him letters and asked him for his photograph he was asked to tell what he really meant by the vague endings of this or that story and then i began to hear rumors that his head was turning these i discredited of course if true i thought it but another proof of the undermining influence of feminine flattery which few men and fewer young men can stand but i watched his career with interest  he published other books of a high moral tone and unapproachable principle which i read carefully for some ray of human weakness for some stroke of nature untrammelled by the calling code of polite society but in vain     chapter ii  it was by a mere accident that i went west some years ago and settled in an active and thriving town near one of the great lakes the air and bustle and smack of life about the place attracted me and i rented an office and continued to read law from force of habit i suppose my experience in the service of one of the most prominent of new york lawyers stood me in good stead and gradually in addition to a heterogeneous business of mines and lumber i began to pick up a few clients but in all probability i should be still pegging away at mines and lumber and drawing up occasional leases and contracts had it not been for mr farquhar fenelon cooke of philadelphia although it has been specifically written that promotion to a young man comes neither from the east nor the west nor yet from the south mr cooke arrived from the east and in the nick of time for me  i was indebted to farrar for mr cookes acquaintance and this obligation i have since in vain endeavored to repay farrars profession was forestry a graduate of an eastern college he had gone abroad to study and had roughed it with the skilled woodsmen of the black forest mr cooke whom he represented had large tracts of land in these parts and farrar likewise received an income from the state whose legislature had at last opened its eyes to the timber depredations and had begun to buy up reserves we had rooms in the same elizabethan building at the corner of main and superior streets but it was more than a year before i got farther than a nod with him farrars nod in itself was a repulsion and once you had seen it you mentally scored him from the list of your possible friends besides this freezing exterior he possessed a cutting and cynical tongue and had but little confidence in the human race these qualities did not tend to render him popular in a western town if indeed they would have recommended him anywhere and i confess to have thought him a surly enough fellow being guided by general opinion and superficial observation afterwards the town got to know him and if it did not precisely like him it respected him which perhaps is better and he gained at least a few warmfriends among whom i deem it an honor to be mentioned  farrars contempt for consequences finally brought him an unsoughtfor reputation admiration for him was born the day he pushed omeara out of his office and down a flight of stairs because he had undertaken to suggest that which should be done with the timber in jackson county by this summary proceeding farrar lost the support of a faction omeara being a power in the state and chairman of the forestry board besides but he got rid of interference from that day forth  oddly enough my friendship with farrar was an indirect result of the incident i have just related a few mornings after i was seated in my office trying to concentrate my mind on page twenty of volume ten of the records when i was surprised by omeara himself accompanied by two gentlemen whom i remembered to have seen on various witness stands omeara was handsomely dressed and his necktie made but a faint pretence of concealing the gorgeous diamond in his shirtfront but his face wore an aggrieved air and his left hand was neatly bound in black and tucked into his coat he sank comfortably into my wicker chair which creaked a protest and produced two yellowspotted cigars chewing the end of one with much apparent relish and pushing the other at me his two friends remained respectfully standing i guessed at what was coming and braced myself by refusing the cigarnot a great piece of selfdenial by the way but a case meant much to me then and i did seriously regret that omeara was not a possible client at any rate my sympathy with farrar in the late episode put him out of the question  omeara cleared his throat and began gingerly to undo the handkerchief on his hand then he brought his fist down on the table so that the ink started from the stand and his cheeks shook with the effort  ill make him pay for this he shouted with an oath  the other gentlemen nodded their approval while i put the inkstand in a place of safety  youre a pretty bright young man mr crocker he went on a look of cunning coming into his little eyes but i guess you aint had too many cases to object to a big one  did you come here to tell me that i asked  he looked me over queerly and evidently decided that i meant no effrontery  i came here to get your opinion he said holding up a swollen hand but i want to tell you first that i ought to get ten thousand not a cent less that scoundrelly young upstart  if you want my opinion i replied trying to speak slowly it is that mr farrar ought to get ten thousand dollars and i think that would be only a moderate reward  i did not feel equal to pushing him into the street as farrar had done and i have now but a vague notion of what he said and how he got there but i remember that half an hour afterwards a man congratulated me openly in the bank  that night i found a new friend although at the time i thought farrars visit to me the accomplishment of a perfunctory courtesy to a man who had refused to take a case against him it was very characteristic of farrar not to mention this until he rose to go about halfpast eight he sauntered in upon me placing his hat precisely on the rack and we talked until ten which is to say that i talked and he commented his observations were apt if a trifle caustic and it is needless to add that i found them entertaining as he was leaving he held out his hand  i hear that omeara called on you today he said diffidently  yes i answered smiling i was sorry not to have been able to take his case  i sat up for an hour or more trying to arrive at some conclusion about farrar but at length i gave it up his visit had in it something impulsive which i could not reconcile with his manner he surely owed me nothing for refusing a case against him and must have known that my motives for so doing were not personal but if i did not understand him i liked him decidedly from that night forward and i hoped that his advances had sprung from some other motive than politeness and indeed we gradually drifted into a quasifriendship it became his habit as he went out in the morning to drop into my room for a match and i returned the compliment by borrowing his coal oil when mine was out at such times we would sit or more frequently stand discussing the affairs of the town and of the nation for politics was an easy and attractive subject to us both it was only in a general way that we touched upon each others concerns this being dangerous ground with farrar who was ever ready to close up at anything resembling a confidence as for me i hope i am not curious but i own to having had a curiosity about farrars philadelphia patron to whom farrar made but slight allusions his very namefarquhar fenelon cookehad an odd sound which somehow betokened an odd man and there was more than one bit of gossip afloat in the town of which he was the subject notwithstanding the fact that he had never honored it with a visit the gossip was the natural result of mr cookes large properties in the vicinity it has never been my habit however to press a friend on such matters and i could easily understand and respect farrars reluctance to talk of one from whom he received an income  i had occasion in the may of that year to make a somewhat long business trip to chicago and on my return much to my surprise i found farrar awaiting me in the railroad station he smiled his wonted fraction by way of greeting stopped to buy a newspaper and finally leading me to his buggy turned and drove out of town i was completely mystified at such an unusual proceeding  whats this for i asked  i shant bother you long he said i simply wanted the chance to talk to you before you got to your office i have a philadelphia client a mr cooke of whom you may have heard me speak since you have been away the railroad has brought suit against him the row is about the lands west of the washita on copper rise its the devil if he loses for the ground is worth the dollar bills to cover it i telegraphed and he got here yesterday he wants a lawyer and i mentioned you  there came over me then in a flash a comprehension of farrar which i had failed to grasp before but i was quite overcome at his suggestion  isnt it rather a big deal to risk me on i said better go to chicago and get parks hes an expert in that sort of thing i am afraid my expostulation was weak  i merely spoke of you replied farrar coollyand he has gone around to your office he knows about parks and if he wants him hell probably take him it all depends upon how you strike cooke whether you get the case or not i have never told you about him he added with some hesitation hes a trifle queer but a good fellow at the bottom i should hate to see him lose his land  how is the railroad mixed up in it i asked  i dont know much about law but it would seem as if they had a pretty strong case he answered he went on to tell me what he knew of the matter in his clean pithy sentences often brutally cynical as though he had not a spark of interest in any of it mr cookes claim to the land came from a maternal greatuncle long since deceased who had been a settler in these regions the railroad answered that they had bought the land with other properties from the man also deceased to whom the old gentleman was alleged to have sold it incidentally i learned something of mr cookes maternal ancestry  we drove back to the office with some concern on my part at the prospect of so large a case sunning himself on the board steps i saw for the first time mr farquhar fenelon cooke he was dressed out in broad gaiters and bright tweeds like an english tourist and his face might have belonged to dagon idol of the philistines a silver snaffle on a heavy leather watch guard which connected the pockets of his corduroy waistcoat together with a huge gold stirrup in his ascot tie sufficiently proclaimed his tastes but i found myself continually returning to the countenance and i still think i could have modelled a better face out of putty the mouth was rather small thicktipped and put in at an odd angle the brown eyes were large and from their habit of looking up at one lent to the round face an incongruous solemnity but withal there was a perceptible acumen about the man which was puzzling in the extreme  how are you old man said he hardly waiting for farrar to introduce me well i hope it was pure cordiality nothing more he seemed to bubble over with it  i said i was well and invited him inside  no he said i like the look of the town we can talk business here  and talk business he did straight and to the point so fast and indistinctly that at times i could scarcely follow him i answered his rapid questions briefly and as best i knew how he wanted to know what chance he had to win the suit and i told him there might be other factors involved beside those of which he had spoken plainly also that the character of his greatuncle was in question an intimation which he did not appear to resent but that there was no denying the fact that the railroad had a strong thing of it and a good lawyer into the bargain  and dont you consider yourself a good lawyer he cut in  i pointed out that the railroad lawyer was a man of twice my age experience and reputation  without more ado and before either farrar or myself had time to resist he had hooked an arm into each of us and we were all three marching down the street in the direction of his hotel if this was agony for me i could see that it was keener agony for farrar and although mr farquhar fenelon cooke had been in town but a scant twentyfour hours it seemed as if he knew more of its inhabitants than both of us put together certain it is that he was less particular with his acquaintances he hailed the most astonishing people with an easy air of freedom now releasing my arm now farrars to salute he always saluted he stopped to converse with a dozen men we had never seen many of whom smelled strongly of the stable and he invariably introduced farrar as the forester of his estate and me as his lawyer in the great quarrel with the railroad until i began to wish i had never heard of blackstone and finally he steered us into the spacious bar of the lake house  the next morning the three of us were off early for a look at the contested property it was a twentymile drive and the last eight miles wound down the boiling washita still high with the melting snows of the pine lands and even here the snows yet slept in the deeper hollows unconscious of the budding green of the slopes how heartily i wished mr farquhar fenelon cooke back in philadelphia by his eternal accounts of his germantown stables and of the blue ribbons of his hackneys he killed all sense of pleasure of the scene and set up an irritation that was wellnigh unbearable at length we crossed the river climbed the foothills and paused on the ridge below us lay the quaint inn and scattered cottages of asquith and beyond them the limitless and foamflecked expanse of lake and on our right lifting from the shore by easy slopes for a mile at stretch farrar pointed out the timbered lands of copper rise spread before us like a map but the appreciation of beauty formed no part of mr cookes compositionthat is beauty as farrar and i knew it  if you win that case old man he cried striking me a great whack between the shoulderblades charge any fee you like ill pay it and ill make such a countryplace out of this as was never seen west of new york state and call it mohair after my old trotter ill put a palace on that clearing with the stables just over the knoll theyll beat the germantown stables a whole lap and that strip of level he continued pointing to a thinly timbered bit will hold a mile track nicely  farrar and i gasped it was as if we had tumbled into the washita  it will take money mr cooke said farrar and you havent won the suit yet  damn the money said mr cooke and we knew he meant it  over the episodes of that interminable morning it will be better to pass lightly it was spent by farrar and me in misery it was spent by mr farquhar fenelon cooke in an ecstasy of enjoyment driving over and laying out mohair and i must admit he evinced a surprising genius in his planning although according to farrar he broke every sacred precept of landscape gardening again and again he displayed the enthusiasm of a pioneer and the energy of a napoleon and if he were too ignorant to accord to nature a word of praise he had the grace and intelligence to compliment farrar on the superb condition of the forests and on the judgment shown in laying out the roads which were so well chosen that even in this season they were well drained and dry that day too my views were materially broadened and i received an insight into the methods and possibilities of my friends profession sufficient to instil a deeper respect both for it and for him the crowded spots had been skilfully thinned of the older trees to give the younger ones a chance and the harmony of the whole had been carefully worked out now we drove under dark pines and hemlocks and then into a lighter relief of birches and wild cherries or a copse of young beeches and i learned that the estate had not only been paying the taxes and its portion of farrars salary but also a considerable amount into mr cookes pocket the while it was being improved  mr cooke made his permanent quarters at the lake house and soon became one of the bestknown characters about town he seemed to enjoy his popularity and i am convinced that he would have been popular in spite of his nowfamous quarrel with the railroad his easy command of profanity his generous use of money his predilection for sporting characters of whom he was king his ready geniality and goodfellowship alike with the clerk of the lake house or the mayor not to mention his own undeniable personality all combined to make him a favorite he had his own especial table in the diningroom called all the waiters by their first names and they fought for the privilege of attending him he likewise called the barkeepers by their first names and had his own particular corner of the bar where none dared intrude and where he could almost invariably be found when not in my office from this corner he dealt out cigars to the deserving held stake moneys decided all bets and refereed all differences his name appeared in the personal column of one of the local papers on the average of twice a week or in lieu thereof one of his choicest stories in the notes about town column  the case was to come up early in july and i spent most of my time to the detriment of other affairs in preparing for it i was greatly hampered in my work by my client who filled my office with his tobaccosmoke and that of his friends and he took it very much for granted that he was going to win the suit fortune had always played into his hands he said and i had no little difficulty in convincing him that matters had passed from his hands into mine in this i believe i was never entirely successful i soon found too that he had no ideas whatever on the value of discretion and it was only by repeated threats of absolute failure that i prevented our secret tactics from becoming the property of his sporting fraternity and of the town  the more i worked on the case the clearer it became to me that mr farquhar fenelon cookes greatuncle had been either a consummate scoundrel or a lunatic and that our only hope of winning must be based on proving him one or the other it did not matter much which for my expectations at best were small when i had at length settled to this conclusion i confided it as delicately as possible to my client who was sitting at the time with his feet cocked up on the office table reading a pink newspaper  whichll be the easier to prove he asked without looking up  it would be more charitable to prove he had been out of his mind i replied and perhaps easier  charity be damned said this remarkable man im after the property  so i decided on insanity i hunted up and subpoenaed whitehaired witnesses for miles around many of them shook their heads when they spoke of mr cookes greatuncle and some knew more of his private transactions than i could have wished and i trembled lest my own witnesses should be turned against me i learned more of mr cookes greatuncle than i knew of mr cooke himself and to the credit of my client be it said that none of his relatives traits were apparent in him with the possible exception of insanity and that defect if it existed in the grandnephew took in him a milder and less criminal turn the old rascal indeed had so cleverly worded his deed of sale as to obtain payment without transfer it was a trifle easier to avoid being specific in that country in his day than it is now and the document was in my opinion sufficiently vague to admit of a double meaning the original sale had been made to a man now dead whom the railroad had bought out the copper rise property was mentioned among the other lands in the will in favor of mr farquhar fenelon cooke and the latter had gone ahead improving them and increasing their output in spite of the repeated threats of the railroad to bring suit and it was not until its present attorney had come in and investigated the title that the railroad had resorted to the law i mention here by the way that my client was the sole heir  but as the time of the sessions drew near the outlook for me was anything but bright it is true that my witnesses were quite willing to depose that his actions were queer and out of the common but these witnesses were for the most part venerable farmers and backwoodsmen expert testimony was deplorably lacking in this extremity it was mr farquhar fenelon cooke himself who came unwittingly to my rescue he had bought a horsehe could never be in a place long without onewhich was chiefly remarkable he said for picking up his hind feet as well as his front ones however he may have differed from the ordinary run of horses he was shortly attacked by one of the thousand ills to which every horse is subject i will not pretend to say what it was i found mr cooke one morning at his usual place in the lake house bar holding forth with more than common vehemence and profanity on the subject of veterinary surgeons he declared there was not a veterinary surgeon in the whole town fit to hold a certificate and his listeners nodded an extreme approval to this sentiment a grizzled old fellow who kept a stock farm back in the country chanced to be there and managed to get a word in on the subject during one of my clients rare pauses  yes he said thats so there aint one of em now fit to travel with young doctor vane who was here some fifteen years gone by he werent no horsedoctor but he could fix up a foundered horse in a night as good as new if your uncle was livin hed back me on that mr cooke  here was my chance i took the old man aside and two or three glasses of old crow launched him into reminiscence  where is doctor vane now i asked finally  over to minneapolis sir with more rich patients nor he can take care of wasnt my darter over there last month and seen him and demned if he didnt pull up his carriage and talk to her heres luck to him  i might have heard much more of the stockraiser had i stayed but i fear i left him somewhat abruptly in my haste to find farrar only three days remained before the case was to come up farrar readily agreed to go to minneapolis and was off on the first train that afternoon i would have asked mr cooke to go had i dared trust him such was my anxiety to have him out of the way if only for a time i did not tell him about the doctor he sat up very late with me that night on the lake house porch to give me a rubbing down as he expressed it as he might have admonished some favorite jockey before a sweepstake take it easy old man he would say repeatedly and dont give things the bit before youre sure of their wind  days passed and not a word from farrar the case opened with mr cookes friends on the front benches the excitement it caused has rarely been equalled in that section but i believe this was due less to its sensational features than to mr cooke who had an abnormal though unconscious talent for selfadvertisement it became manifest early that we were losing our testimony as i had feared was not strong enough although they said we were making a good fight of it i was racked with anxiety about farrar at last when i had all but given up hope i received a telegram from him dated at detroit saying he would arrive with the doctor that evening this was friday the fourth day of the trial  the doctor turned out to be a large man well groomed and well fed with a twinkle in his eye he had gone to narragansett pier for the summer whither farrar had followed him on being introduced mr cooke at once invited him out to have a drink  did you know my uncle asked my client  yes said the doctor i should say i did  poor old duffer said mr cooke with due solemnity i understand he was a maniac  well said the doctor while we listened with a breathless interest he wasnt exactly a maniac but i think i can safely say he was a lunatic  then heres to insanity said the irrepressible his glass swung in midair when a thought struck him and he put it down again and looked hard at the doctor  will you swear to it he demanded  i would swear to it before saint peter said the doctor fervently  he swore to it before a jury which was more to the point and we won our case it did not even go to the court of appeals i suppose the railroad thought it cheaper to drop it since no right of way was involved and the decision was scarcely announced before mr farquhar fenelon cooke had begun work on his new country place mohair  i have oftentimes been led to consider the relevancy of this chapter and have finally decided to insert it i concluded that the actual narrative of how mr cooke came to establish his countryplace near asquith would be interesting and likewise throw some light on that gentlemans character and i ask the readers forbearance for the necessary personal history involved had it not been for mr cookes friendship for me i should not have written these pages     chapter iii  events are consequential or inconsequential irrespective of their size the wars of troy were fought for a woman and charles viii of france bumped his head against a stone doorway and died because he did not stoop low enough and to descend from history down to my own poor chronicle mr cookes railroad case my first experience at the bar of any gravity or magnitude had tied to it a string of consequences then far beyond my guessing the suit was my steppingstone not only to a larger and more remunerative practice but also i believe to the position of district attorney which i attained shortly afterwards  mr cooke had laid out mohair as ruthlessly as napoleon planned the new paris though not i regret to say with a like genius fortunately farrar interposed and saved the grounds but there was no guardian angel to do a like turn for the house mr langdon willis of philadelphia was the architect who had nominal charge of the building he had regularly submitted some dozen plans for mr cookes approval which were as regularly rejected my client believed in common with a great many other people that architects should be driven and not followed and was plainly resolved to make this house the logical development of many cherished ideas it is not strange therefore that the edifice was completed by a chicago contractor who had less selfrespect than mr willis the latter having abruptly refused to have his name tacked on to the work  mohair was finished and ready for occupation in july two years after the suit i drove out one day before mr cookes arrival to look it over the grounds where farrar had had matters pretty much his own way to my mind rivalled the best private parks in the east the stables were filled with a score or so of mr cookes best horses brought hither in his private cars and the trotters were exercising on the track the middle of june found farrar and myself at the asquith inn it was farrars custom to go to asquith in the summer being near the forest properties in his charge and since asquith was but five miles from the countyseat it was convenient for me and gave me the advantages of the lake breezes and a comparative rest which i should not have had in town at that time asquith was a small community of summer residents from cincinnati chicago st louis and other western cities most of whom owned cottages and the grounds around them they were a quiet lot that long association had made clannish and they had a happy faculty so rare in summer resorts of discrimination between an amusement and a nuisance hence a great many diversions which are accounted pleasurable elsewhere are at asquith set down at their true value it was therefore rather with resentment than otherwise that the approaching arrival of mr cooke and the guests he was likely to have at mohair were looked upon  i had not been long at asquith before i discovered that farrar was acting in a peculiar manner though i was longer in finding out what the matter was i saw much less of him than in town once in a while in the evenings after ten he would run across me on the porch of the inn or drift into my rooms even after three years of more or less intimacy between us farrar still wore his exterior of pessimism and indifference the shell with which he chose to hide a naturally warm and affectionate disposition in the diningroom we sat together at the end of a large table set aside for bachelors and small families of two or three and it seemed as though we had all the humorists and storytellers in that place and farrar as a source of amusement proved equal to the best of them he would wait until a story was well under way and then annihilate the point of it with a cutting cynicism and set the table in a roar of laughter among others who were seated here was a mr trevor of cincinnati one of the pioneers of asquith mr trevor was a trifle bombastic with a tendency towards gesticulation an art which he had learned in no less a school than the ohio state senate he was a selfmade mana fact which he took good care should not escape oneand had amassed his money i believe in the drygoods business he always wore a long shiny coat a low turneddown collar and a black tie all of which united to give him the general appearance of a professional pallbearer  but mr trevor possessed a daughter who amply made up for his shortcomings she was the only one who could meet farrar on his own ground and rarely a meal passed that they did not have a tilt they filled up the holes of the conversation with running commentaries giving a dig at the luckless narrator and a sideslap at each other until one would have given his oath they were sworn enemies at least i in the innocence of my heart thought so until i was forcibly enlightened i had taken rather a prejudice to miss trevor i could find no better reason than her antagonism to farrar i was revolving this very thing in my mind one day as i was paddling back to the inn after a look at my clients new pier and boathouses when i descried farrars catboat some distance out the lake was glass and the sail hung lifeless it was near lunchtime and charity prompted me to head for the boat and give it a tow homeward as i drew near farrar himself emerged from behind the sail and asked me with a great show of nonchalance what i wanted  to tow you back for lunch of course i answered used to his ways  he threw me a line which i made fast to the stern and then he disappeared again i thought this somewhat strange but as the boat was a light one i towed it in and hitched it to the wharf when to my great astonishment there disembarked not farrar but miss trevor she leaped lightly ashore and was gone before i could catch my breath while farrar let down the sail and offered me a cigarette i had learned a lesson in appearances  it could not have been very long after this that i was looking over my batch of new york papers which arrived weekly when my eye was arrested by a name i read the paragraph which announced the fact that my friend the celebrity was about to sail for europe in search of color for his next novel this was already contracted for at a large price and was to be of a more serious nature than any of his former work an interview was published in which the celebrity had declared that a new novel was to appear in a short time i do not know what impelled me but i began at once to search through the other papers and found almost identically the same notice in all of them  by one of those odd coincidents which sometimes start one to thinking the celebrity was the subject of a lively discussion when i reached the table that evening i had my quota of information concerning his european trip but i did not commit myself when appealed to for an opinion i had once known the man which however i did not think it worth while to mention and i did not feel justified in criticising him in public besides what i knew of him was excellent and entirely apart from the literary merit or demerit of his work the others however were within their right when they censured or praised him and they did both farrar in particular surprised me by the violence of his attacks while miss trevor took up the celebritys defence with equal ardor her motives were beyond me now the celebritys works spoke for themselves she said and she could not and would not believe such injurious reports of one who wrote as he did  the next day i went over to the countyseat and got back to asquith after dark i dined alone and afterwards i was strolling up and down one end of the long veranda when i caught sight of a lonely figure in a corner with chair tilted back and feet on the rail a gleam of a cigar lighted up the face and i saw that it was farrar i sat down beside him and we talked commonplaces for a while farrars being almost monosyllabic while now and again feminine voices and feminine laughter reached our ears from the far end of the porch they seemed to go through farrar like a knife and he smoked furiously his lips tightly compressed the while i had a dozen conjectures none of which i dared voice so i waited in patience  crocker said he at length theres a man here from boston charles wrexell allen came this morning you know boston have you ever heard of him  allen i repeated reflecting no charles wrexell  it is charles wrexell i think said farrar as though the matter were trivial however we can go into the register and make sure  what about him i asked not feeling inclined to stir  the celebrity  oh nothing an arrival is rather an occurrence though you can hear him down there now he added tossing his head towards the other end of the porch with the women around him  in fact i did catch the deeper sound of a mans voice among the lighter tones and the voice had a ring to it which was not wholly unfamiliar although i could not place it  i threw farrar a bait  he must make friends easily i said  with the womenyes he replied so scathingly that i was forced to laugh in spite of myself  let us go in and look at the register i suggested you may have his name wrong  we went in accordingly sure enough in bold heavy characters was the name charles wrexell allen written out in full that handwriting was one in a thousand i made sure i had seen it before and yet i did not know it and the more i puzzled over it the more confused i became i turned to farrar  i have had a poor cigar passed off on me and deceive me for a while that is precisely the case here i think i should recognize your man if i were to see him  well said farrar heres your chance  the company outside were moving in two or three of the older ladies came first carrying their wraps then a troop of girls among whom was miss trevor and lastly a man farrar and i had walked to the door while the women turned into the drawingroom so that we were brought face to face with him suddenly at sight of me he halted abruptly as though he had struck the edge of a door changed color and held out his hand tentatively then he withdrew it again for i made no sign of recognition  it was the celebrity  i felt a shock of disgust as i passed out masquerading it must be admitted is not pleasant to the taste and the whole farce as it flashed through my mindhis advertised trip his turning up here under an assumed name had an ill savor perhaps some of the things they said of him might be true after all  who the devil is he said farrar dropping for once his indifference he looked as if he knew you  i evaded  he may have taken me for some one else i answered with all the coolness i could muster i have never met any one of his name his voice and handwriting however are very much like those of a man i used to know  farrar was very poor company that evening and left me early i went to my rooms and had taken down a volume of carlyle who can generally command my attention when there came a knock at the door  come in i replied with an instinctive sense of prophecy  this was fulfilled at once by the appearance of the celebrity he was attiredfor the details of his dress forced themselves upon me vividlyin a roughspun suit of knickerbockers a coloredshirt having a large and prominent gold stud red and brown stockings of a diamond pattern and heavy walkingboots and he entered with an air of assurance that was maddening  my dear crocker he exclaimed you have no idea how delighted i am to see you here  i rose first placing a bookmark in carlyle and assured him that i was surprised to see him here  surprised to see me he returned far from being damped by my manner in fact i am a little surprised to see myself here  he sank back on the windowseat and clasped his hands behind his head  but first let me thank you for respecting my incognito he said  i tried hard to keep my temper marvelling at the ready way he had chosen to turn my action  and now he continued i suppose you want to know why i came out here he easily supplied the lack of cordial solicitation on my part  yes i should like to know i said  thus having aroused my curiosity he took his time about appeasing it after the custom of his kind he produced a gold cigarette case offered me a cigarette which i refused took one himself and blew the smoke in rings toward the ceiling then raising himself on his elbow he drew his features together in such a way as to lead me to believe he was about to impart some valuable information  crocker said he its the very deuce to be famous isnt it  i suppose it is i replied curtly wondering what he was driving at i have never tried it  an ordinary man such as you cant conceive of the torture a fellow in my position is obliged to go through the year round but especially in the summer when one wishes to go off on a rest you know what i mean of course  i am afraid i do not i answered in a vain endeavor to embarrass him  youre thicker than when i used to know you then he returned with candor to tell the truth crocker i often wish i were back at the law and had never written a line i am paying the penalty of fame wherever i go i am hounded to death by the people who have read my books and they want to dine and wine me for the sake of showing me off at their houses i am heartily sick and tired of it all you would be if you had to go through it i could stand a winter but the worst comes in the summer when one meets the women who fire all sorts of sociopsychological questions at one for solution and who have suggestions for stories he shuddered  and what has all this to do with your coming here i cut in strangling a smile  he twisted his cigarette at an acute angle with his face and looked at me out of the corner of his eye  ill try to be a little plainer he went on sighing as one unused to deal with people who require crosses on their ts ive been worried almost out of my mind with attentionnothing but attention the whole time i cant go on the street but what im stared at and pointed out so i thought of a scheme to relieve it for a time it was becoming unbearable i determined to assume a name and go to some quiet little place for the summer west if possible where i was not likely to be recognized and have three months of rest  he paused but i offered no comment  well the more i thought of it the better i liked the idea i met a western man at the club and asked him about western resorts quiet ones have you heard of asquith says he no said i describe it he did and it was just the place quaint restful and retired of course i put him off the track but i did not count on striking you my man boxed up and we were off in twentyfour hours and here i am  now all this was very fine but not at all in keeping with the celebritys character as i had come to conceive it the idea that adulation ever cloyed on him was ludicrous in itself in fact i thought the whole story fishy and came very near to saying so  you wont tell anyone who i am will you he asked anxiously  he even misinterpreted my silences  certainly not i replied it is no concern of mine you might come here as emil zola or ralph waldo emerson and it would make no difference to me  he looked at me dubiously even suspiciously  thats a good chap said he and was gone leaving me to reflect on the ways of genius  and the longer i reflected the more positive i became that there existed a more potent reason for the celebritys disguise than ennui as actions speak louder than words so does a mans character often give the lie to his tongue     chapter iv  a lion in an asss skin is still a lion in spite of his disguise conversely the same might be said of an ass in a lions skin the celebrity ran after women with the same readiness and helplessness that a dog will chase chickens or that a stream will run down hill women differ from chickens however in the fact that they find pleasure in being chased by a certain kind of a man the celebrity was this kind of a man from the moment his valet deposited his luggage in his rooms charles wrexell allen became the social hero of asquith it is by straws we are enabled to tell which way the wind is blowing and i first noticed his partiality for miss trevor from the absence of the lively conflicts she was wont to have with farrar these ceased entirely after the celebritys arrival it was the latter who now commanded the conversation at our table  i was truly sorry for farrar for i knew the man the depth of his nature and the scope of the shock he carried it off altogether too well and both the studied lightness of his actions and the increased carelessness of his manner made me fear that what before was feigned might turn to a real bitterness  for farrars sake if the celebrity had been content with women in general all would have been well but he was unable to generalize in one sense and to particularize in another and it was plain that he wished to monopolize miss trevor while still retaining a hold upon the others for my sake had he been content with women alone i should have had no cause to complain but it seemed that i had an attraction for him second only to women which i could not account for and i began to be cursed with a great deal of his company since he was absolutely impervious to hints and would not take no for an answer i was helpless when he had no engagement he would thrust himself on me he seemed to know by intuitionfor i am very sure i never told himwhat my amusement was to be the mornings i did not go to the countyseat and he would invariably turn up properly equipped as i was making my way with judge short to the tennis court or carrying my oars to the water it was in vain that i resorted to subterfuge that i went to bed early intending to be away before the celebritys rising hour i found he had no particular rising hour no matter how early i came down i would find him on the veranda smoking cigarettes or otherwise his man would be there with a message to say that his master would shortly join me if i would kindly wait and at last i began to realize in my harassed soul that all elusion was futile and to take such holidays as i could get when he was off with a girl in a spirit of thankfulness  much of this persecution i might have put up with indeed had i not heard in one way or another that he was doing me the honor of calling me his intimate this i could not stand and i soberly resolved to leave asquith and go back to town which i should indeed have done if deliverance had not arrived from an unexpected quarter  one morning i had been driven to the precarious refuge afforded by the steps of the inn after rejecting offers from the celebrity to join him in a variety of amusements but even here i was not free from interruption for he was seated on a horseblock below me playing with a fox terrier judge short had gone to town and farrar was off for a three days cruise up the lake i was bitterly regretting i had not gone with him when the distant notes of a coach horn reached my ear and i descried a fourinhand winding its way up the inn road from the direction of mohair  that must be your friend cooke remarked the celebrity looking up  there could be no doubt of it with little difficulty i recognized on the box the familiar figure of my first important client and beside him was a lady whom i supposed to be mrs farquhar fenelon cooke although i had had no previous knowledge that such a person existed the horses were on a brisk trot and mr cooke seemed to be getting the best out of them for the benefit of the sprinkling of people on the inn porch indeed i could not but admire the dexterous turn of the wrist which served mr cooke to swing his leaders into the circle and up the hill while the liveried guard leaned far out in anticipation of a stumble mr cooke hailed me with a beaming smile and a flourish of the whip as he drew up and descended from the box  maria he exclaimed giving me a hearty grip this is the man that won mohair my wife crocker  i was somewhat annoyed at this effusiveness before the celebrity but i looked up and caught mrs cookes eye it was the calm eye of a general  i am glad of the opportunity to thank you mr crocker she said simply and i liked her from that moment  mr cooke at once began a tirade against the residents of asquith for permitting a sandy and generally disgraceful condition of the roads so roundly did he vituperate the inn management in particular and with such a loud flow of words that i trembled lest he should be heard on the veranda the celebrity stood by the block in an amazement which gave me a wicked pleasure and it was some minutes before i had the chance to introduce him  mr cookes idea of an introduction however was no mere wordformula it was fraught with a deeper and a bibulous meaning he presented the celebrity to his wife and then invited both of us to go inside with him by one of those neat and cordial paraphrases in which he was skilled i preferred to remain with mrs cooke and it was with a gleam of hope at a possible deliverance from my late persecution that i watched the two disappear together through the hall and into the smokingroom  how do you like mohair i asked mrs cooke  do you mean the house or the park she laughed and then seeing my embarrassment she went on oh the house is just like everything else fenelon meddles with outside its a mixture of all the styles and inside a hash of all the nationalities from siamese to spanish fenelon hangs the oriental tinsels he has collected on pieces of black baronial oak and the coatofarms he had designed by our philadelphia jewellers is stamped on the diningroom chairs and even worked into the fire screens  there was nothing paltry in her criticism of her husband nothing she would not have said to his face she was a woman who made you feel this for sincerity was written all over her i could not help wondering why she gave mr cooke line in the matter of household decoration unless it was that he considered mohair his own private hobby and that she humored him mrs cooke was not without tact and i have no doubt she perceived my reluctance to talk about her husband and respected it  we drove down to bring you back to luncheon she said  i thanked her and accepted she was curious to hear about asquith and its people and i told her all i knew  i should like to meet some of them she explained for we intend having a cotillon at mohaira kind of housewarming you know a party of mr cookes friends is coming out for it in his car and he thought something of inviting the people of asquith up for a dance  i had my doubts concerning the wisdom of an entertainment the success of which depended on the fusion of a party of mr cookes friends and a company from asquith but i held my peace she shot a question at me suddenly  who is this mr allen  he registers from boston and only came a fortnight ago i replied vaguely  he doesnt look quite right as though he had been set down on the wrong planet you know said mrs cooke her finger on her temple what is he like  well i answered at first with uncertainty then with inspiration he would do splendidly to lead your cotillon if you think of having one  so you do not dance mr crocker  i was somewhat set back by her perspicuity  no i do not said i  i thought not she said laughing it must have been my expression which prompted her next remark  i was not making fun of you she said more soberly i do not like mr allen any better than you do and i have only seen him once  but i have not said i did not like him i objected  of course not said mrs cooke quizzically  at that moment to my relief i discerned the celebrity and mr cooke in the hallway  here they come now she went on i do wish fenelon would keep his hands off the people he meets i can feel he is going to make an intimate of that man mark my words mr crocker  i not only marked them i prayed for their fulfilment  there was that in mr cooke which for want of a better name i will call instinct as he came down the steps his arm linked in that of the celebrity his attitude towards his wife was both apologetic and defiant he had at once the air of a child caught with a forbidden toy and that of a stripling of twentyone who flaunts a cigar in his fathers face  maria he said mr allen has consented to come back with us for lunch  we drove back to mohair mr cooke and the celebrity on the box mrs cooke and i behind except to visit the boathouses i had not been to mohair since the day of its completion and now the full beauty of the approach struck me for the first time we swung by the lodge the keeper holding open the iron gate as we passed and into the wide driveway hewn as it were out of the virgin forest the sandy soil had been strengthened by a deep roadbed of clay imported from the interior which was spread in turn with a fine gravel which crunched under the heavy wheels from the lodge to the house a full mile branches had been pruned to let the sunshine sift through in splotches but the wild nature of the place had been skilfully retained we curved hither and thither under the giant trees until suddenly as a whip straightens in the snapping one of the ancient tribes of the forest might have sent an arrow down the leafy gallery into the open and at the far end we caught sight of the palace framed in the vista it was a triumph for farrar and i wished that the palace had been more worthy  the celebrity did not stint his praises of mohair coming up the drive but so lavish were his comments on the house that they won for him a lasting place in mr cookes affections and encouraged my client to pull up his horses in a favorable spot and expand on the beauties of the mansion  taking it altogether said he complacently it is rather a neat box and i let myself loose on it i had all these ideas i gathered knocking about the world and i gave them to willis of philadelphia to put together for me but hes honest enough not to claim the house take for instance that minaret business on the west i picked that up from a mosque in algiers the oriel just this side is whole cloth from haddon hall and the galleried porch next it from a florentine villa the conical capped tower i got from a french chateau and some of the features on the south from a buddhist temple in japan only a little blending and grouping was necessary and willis calls himself an architect and wasnt equal to it now he added get the effect did you ever see another house like it  magnificent exclaimed the celebrity  and then my client continued warming under this generous appreciation theres something very smart about those colors theyre my racing colors of course the granites a little off but it isnt prominent willis kicked hard when it came to painting the oriel yellow but an architect always takes it for granted he knows it all and a  fenelon said mrs cooke luncheon is waiting  mrs cooke dominated at luncheon and retired and it is certain that both mr cooke and the celebrity breathed more freely when she had gone if her criticisms on the exterior of the house were just those on the interior were more so not only did i find the coatofarms set forth on the chairs firescreens and other prominent articles but it was even cut into the swinging door of the butlers pantry the motto i am afraid my client never took the trouble to have translated and i am inclined to think his jewellers put up a little joke on him when they chose it be sober and boast not  i observed that mrs cooke when she chose could exert the subduing effect on her husband of a soft pedal on a piano and during luncheon she kept the soft pedal on and the celebrity being in some degree a kindred spirit was also held in check but his wife had no sooner left the room when mr cooke began on the subject uppermost in his mind i had suspected that his trip to asquith that morning was for a purpose at which mrs cooke had hinted but she with a womans tact had aimed to accomplish by degrees that which her husband would carry by storm  youve been at asquith sometime crocker mr cooke began long enough to know the people  i know some of them i said guardedly but the rush was not to be stemmed  how many do you think you can muster for that entertainment of mine fifty i ought to have fifty at least suppose you pick out fifty and send me up the names i want good lively ones you understand that will stir things up  i am afraid there are not fifty of that kind there i replied  his face fell but brightened again instantly he appealed to the celebrity  how about it old man said he  the celebrity answered with becoming modesty that the asquithians were benighted they had never had any one to show them how to enjoy life but there was hope for them  thats it exclaimed my client slapping his thigh and turning triumphantly to me he continued youre all right crocker and know enough to win a damned big suit but youre not the man to steer a delicate thing of this kind  this is how to my infinite relief the celebrity came to engineer the matter of the housewarming and to him it was much more congenial he accepted the task cheerfully and went about it in such a manner as to leave no doubt in my mind as to its ultimate success he was a master hand at just such problems and this one had a double attraction it pleased him to be thought the arbiter of such a worthy cause while he acquired a prominence at asquith which satisfied in some part a craving which he found inseparable from incognito  his tactics were worthy of a skilled diplomatist before we left mohair that day he had exacted as a condition that mr cooke should not appear at the inn or in its vicinity until after the entertainment to this my client readily pledged himself with that absolute freedom from suspicion which formed one of the most admirable traits of his character the celebrity being intuitively quick where women were concerned had surmised that mrs cooke did not like him but as her interests in the affair of the cotillon coincided with those of mr cooke she was available as a means to an end the celebrity deemed her from a social standpoint decidedly the better part of the mohair establishment and he contrived by a system of manoeuvres i failed to grasp to throw her forward while he kept mr cooke in the background  he had much to contend with above all an antecedent prejudice against the cookes in reality a prejudice against the world the flesh and the devil natural to any quiet community and of which mohair and its appurtenances were taken as the outward and visible signs older people came to asquith for simplicity and rest and the younger ones were brought there for these things nearly all had sufficient wealth to seek if they chose gayety and ostentation at the eastern resorts but asquithians held gayety and ostentation at a discount and maintained there was gayety enough at home  if any one were fitted to overcome this prejudice it was mrs cooke her tastes and manners were as simple as her gowns the celebrity by arts unknown induced mrs judge short and two other ladies to call at mohair on a certain afternoon when mr cooke was trying a trotter on the track the three returned wondering and charmed with mrs cooke they were sure she had had no hand in the furnishing of that atrocious house their example was followed by others at a time when the master of mohair was superintending in person the docking of some twoyearolds and equally invisible these ladies likewise came back to sing mrs cookes praises mrs cooke returned the calls she took tea on the inn veranda and drove mrs short around mohair in her victoria mr cooke being seen only on rare and fleeting occasions there gradually got abroad a most curious misconception of that gentlemans character while over his personality floated a mist of legend which the celebrity took good care not to dispel farrar who despised nonsense was ironical and noncommittal when appealed to and certainly i betrayed none of my clients attributes hence it came that asquith before the housewarming knew as little about farquhar fenelon cooke the man as the nineteenth century knows about william shakespeare and was every whit as curious like shakespeare mr cooke was judged by his works and from these he was generally conceded to be an illiterate and indifferent person of barbarous tastes and a mania for horses he was further described as ungentlemanly by a brace of spinsters who had been within earshot on the veranda the morning he had abused the asquith roads but their evidence was not looked upon as damning that mr cooke would appear at the cotillon never entered any ones head  thus it was for a fortnight mr cooke maintained a most rigid seclusion would that he had discovered in the shroud of mystery the cloak of fame     volume 2     chapter v  it was small wonder said the knowing at asquith that mr charles wrexell allen should be attracted by irene trevor with the lake breezes of the north the red and the tan came into her cheeks those boon companions of the open who are best won by the waterwinds perhaps they brought too the spring to the step and the light under the long lashes when she flashed a look across the table little by little it became plain that miss trevor was gaining ground with the celebrity to the neglect of the other young women at asquith and when it was announced that he was to lead the cotillon with her the fact was regarded as significant even at asquith such things were talked about mr allen became a topic and a matter of conjecture he was i believe generally regarded as a good match his unimpeachable manservant argued worldly possessions of which other indications were not lacking while his crest was cited as a material sign of family yet when miss brewster one of the brace of spinsters who hailed from brookline and purported to be an uptodate edition of the boston blue book questioned the celebrity on this vital point after the searching manner warranted by the gravity of the subject he was unable to acquit himself satisfactorily when this conversation was repeated in detail within the hearing of the father of the young woman in question and undoubtedly for his benefit mr trevor threw shame to the winds and scandalized the misses brewster then and there by proclaiming his father to have been a country storekeeper in the eyes of mr farquhar fenelon cooke the apotheosis of the celebrity was complete the people of asquith were not only willing to attend the housewarming but had been worked up to the pitch of eagerness the celebrity as a matter of course was master of ceremonies he originated the figures and arranged the couples of which there were twelve from asquith and ten additional young women these ten were assigned to the ten young men whom mr cooke expected in his private car and whose appearances heights and temperaments the celebrity obtained from mr cooke carefully noted and compared with those of the young women be it said in passing that mrs cooke had nothing to do with any of it but exhibited an almost criminal indifference mr cooke had even chosen the favors charity forbids that i should say what they were  owing to the frequent consultations which these preparations made necessary the celebrity was much in the company of my client which he came greatly to prefer to mine and i therefore abandoned my determination to leave asquith i was settling down delightedly to my old easy and unmolested existence when farrar and i received an invitation which amounted to a summons to go to mohair and make ourselves generally useful so we packed up and went we made an odd party before the arrival of the ten particularly when the celebrity dropped in for lunch or dinner he could not be induced to remain permanently at mohair because miss trevor was at asquith but he appropriated a hempstead cart from the mohair stables and made the trip sometimes twice in a day the fact that mrs cooke treated him with unqualified disapproval did not dampen his spirits or lessen the frequency of his visits nor indeed did it seem to create any breach between husband and wife mr cooke took it for granted that his friends should not please his wife and mrs cooke remarked to farrar and me that her husband was old enough to know better and too old to be taught she loved him devotedly and showed it in a hundred ways but she was absolutely incapable of dissimulation  thanks to mrs cooke our visit to mohair was a pleasant one we were able in many ways to help in the arrangements especially farrar who had charge of decorating the grounds we saw but little of mr cooke and the celebrity  the arrival of the ten was an event of importance and occurred the day of the dance i shall treat the ten as a whole because they did not materially differ from one another in dress or habits or ambition or general usefulness on this earth it is true that mr cooke had been able to make delicate distinctions between them for the aid of the celebrity but such distinctions were beyond me and the power to make them lay only in a long and careful study of the species which i could not afford to give likewise the life of any one of the ten was the life of all and might be truthfully represented by a single year since each year was exactly like the preceding the ordinary year as is wellknown begins on the first of january but theirs was not the ordinary year nor the church year nor the fiscal year theirs began in the fall with the new york horse show and i am of the opinion though open to correction that they dated from the first horse show instead of from the birth of christ it is certain that they were much better versed in the history of the association than in that of the union in the biography of excelsior rather than that of lincoln the dog show was another event to which they looked forward when they migrated to new york and put up at the country places of their friends but why go farther  the ten made themselves very much at home at mohair one of them told the celebrity he reminded him very much of a man he had met in new york and who had written a book or something of that sort which made the celebrity wince the afternoon was spent in one of the stable lofts where mr cooke had set up a mysterious lshaped box in one arm of which a badger was placed by a groom while my clients sarah a terrier was sent into the other arm to invite the badger out his objections exceeded the highest hopes he dug his claws into the wood and devoted himself to sarahs countenance with unremitting industry this occupation was found so absorbing that it was with difficulty the ten were induced to abandon it and dress for an early dinner and only did so after the second peremptory message from mrs cooke  its always this way said mr cooke regretfully as he watched sarah licking the accessible furrows in her face i never started in on anything worth doing yet that maria did not stop it  farrar and i were not available for the dance and after dinner we looked about for a quiet spot in which to weather it and where we could be within reach if needed such a place as this was the florentine galleried porch which ran along outside the upper windows of the ballroom these were flung open for the night was warm at one end of the room the musicians imported from minneapolis by mr cooke were striking the first discordant notes of the tuning while at the other the celebrity and my client in scarlet huntingcoats were gravely instructing the ten likewise in scarlet huntingcoats as to their conduct and functions we were reviewing these interesting proceedings when mrs cooke came hurrying towards us she held a letter in her hand  you know said she that mr cooke is forgetful particularly when his mind is occupied with important matters as it has been for some time here is a letter from my niece miss thorn which he has carried in his pocket since monday we expected her two weeks ago and had given her up but it seems she was to leave philadelphia on wednesday and will be at that forlorn little station of asquith at halfpast nine tonight i want you two to go over and meet her  we expressed our readiness and in ten minutes were in the station wagon rolling rapidly down the long drive for it was then after nine we passed on the way the van of the guests from asquith as we reached the lodge we heard the whistle and we backed up against one side of the platform as the train pulled up at the other  farrar and i are not imaginative we did not picture to ourselves any particular type for the girl we were going to meet we were simply doing our best to get to the station before the train we jumped from the wagon and were watching the people file out of the car and i noticed that more than one paused to look back over their shoulders as they reached the door then came a maid with handbag and shawls and after her a tall young lady she stood for a moment holding her skirt above the grimy steps with something of the stately pose which richter has given his queen louise on the stairway and the light of the reflector fell full upon her she looked around expectantly and recognizing mrs cookes maid who had stepped forward to relieve hers of the shawls miss thorn greeted her with a smile which greatly prepossessed us in her favor  how do you do jennie she said did any one else come  yes miss marian replied jennie abashed but pleasedthese gentlemen  farrar and i introduced ourselves awkwardly enough and we both tried to explain at once how it was that neither mr nor mrs cooke was there to meet her of course we made an absolute failure of it she scanned our faces with a puzzled expression for a while and then broke into a laugh  i think i understand she said they are having the housewarming  shes firstrate at guessing said farrar to me as we fled precipitately to see that the trunks were hoisted into the basket neither of us had much presence of mind as we climbed into the wagon and what was even stranger could not account for the lack of it miss thorn was seated in the corner in spite of the darkness i could see that she was laughing at us still  i feel very badly that i should have taken you away from the dance we heard her say  we dont dance i answered clumsily and we were glad to come  yes we were glad to come farrar chimed in  then we relapsed into a discomfited silence and wished we were anywhere else but miss thorn relieved the situation by laughing aloud and with such a hearty enjoyment that instead of getting angry and more mortified we began to laugh ourselves and instantly felt better after that we got along famously she had at once the air of good fellowship and the dignity of a woman and she seemed to understand farrar and me perfectly not once did she take us over our heads though she might have done so with ease and we knew this and were thankful we began to tell her about mohair and the cotillon and of our point of observation from the florentine galleried porch and she insisted she would join us there by the time we reached the house we were thanking our stars she had come mrs cooke came out under the portcochere to welcome her  unfortunately there is no one to dance with you marian she said but if i had not by chance gone through your uncles pockets there would have been no one to meet you  i think i had never felt my deficiency in dancing until that moment but miss thorn took her aunts hand affectionately in hers  my dear aunt maria said she i would not dance tonight if there were twenty to choose from i should like nothing better than to look on with these two we are the best of friends already she added turning towards us are we not  we are indeed we hastened to assure her  mrs cooke smiled  you should have been a man marian she said as they went upstairs together  we made our way to the galleried porch and sat down there being a lull in the figures just then we each took out a cigar and lighted a match and then looked across at the other we solemnly blew our matches out  perhaps she doesnt like smoke said farrar voicing the sentiment  perhaps not said i  silence  i wonder how she will get along with the ten i queried  better than with us he answered in his usual strain theyre trained  or with allen i added irresistibly  women are all alike said farrar  at this juncture miss thorn herself appeared at the end of the gallery her shoulders wrapped in a gray cape trimmed with fur she stood regarding us with some amusement as we rose to receive her  light your cigars and be sensible said she or i shall go in  we obeyed the three of us turned to the window to watch the figure the music of which was just beginning mr cooke with the air of an english squire at his own hunt ball was strutting contentedly up and down one end of the room now pausing to exchange a few hearty words with some presbyterian matron from asquith now to congratulate mr trevor on the appearance of his daughter lined against the opposite wall were the celebrity and his ten redcoated followers just rising for the figure it was very plain that miss trevor was radiantly happy she was easily the handsomest girl in the room and i could not help philosophizing when i saw her looking up into the celebritys eyes upon the seeming inconsistency of nature who has armed and warned woman against all but her most dangerous enemy  and then a curious thing happened the celebrity as if moved by a sudden uncontrollable impulse raised his eyes until they rested on the window in which we were although his dancing was perfect he lost the step without apparent cause his expression changed and for the moment he seemed to be utterly confused but only for the moment in a trice he had caught the time again and swept miss trevor rapidly down the room and out of sight i looked instinctively at the girl beside me she had thrown her head forward and in the streaming light i saw that her lips were parted in a smile  i resolved upon a stroke  mr allen i remarked leads admirably  mr allen she exclaimed turning on me  yes it is mr allen who is leading i repeated  an expression of perplexity spread over her face but she said nothing my curiosity was aroused to a high pitch and questions were rising to my lips which i repressed with difficulty for miss thorn had displayed purposely or not a reticence which my short acquaintance with her compelled me to respect and besides i was bound by a promise not to betray the celebritys secret i was however convinced from what had occurred that she had met the celebrity in the east and perhaps known him  had she fallen in love with him as was the common fate of all young women he met i changed my opinion on this subject a dozen times now i was sure as i looked at her that she was far too sensible again a doubt would cross my mind as the celebrity himself would cross my view the girl on his arm reduced to adoration i followed him narrowly when in sight miss thorn was watching him too her eyes half closed as though in thought but beyond the fact that he threw himself into the dance with a somewhat increased fervor perhaps his manner betokened no uneasiness and not even by a glance did he betray any disturbing influence from above  thus we stood silently until the figure was finished when miss thorn seated herself in one of the wicker chairs behind us  doesnt it make you wish to dance said farrar to her it is hard luck you should be doomed to spend the evening with two such useless fellows as we are  she did not catch his remark at first as was natural in a person preoccupied then she bit her lips to repress a smile  i assure you mr farrar she said with force i have never in my life wished to dance as little as i do now  but a voice interrupted her and the scarlet coat of the celebrity was thrust into the light between us farrar excused himself abruptly and disappeared  never wished to dance less cried the celebrity upon my word miss thorn thats too bad i came up to ask you to reconsider your determination as one of the girls from asquith is leaving and there is an extra man  you are very kind said miss thorn quietly but i prefer to remain here  my surmise then was correct she had evidently met the celebrity and there was that in his manner of addressing her without any formal greeting which seemed to point to a close acquaintance  you know mr allen then miss thorn said i  what can you mean she exclaimed wheeling on me this is not mr allen  hang you crocker the celebrity put in impatiently miss thorn knows who i am as well as you do  i confess it is a little puzzling said she perhaps it is because i am tired from travelling and my brain refuses to work but why in the name of all that is strange do you call him mr allen  the celebrity threw himself into the chair beside her and asked permission to light a cigarette  i am going to ask you the favor of respecting my incognito miss thorn as crocker has done he said crocker knew me in the east too i had not counted upon finding him at asquith  miss thorn straightened herself and made a gesture of impatience  an incognito she cried but you have taken another mans name and you already had his face and figure  i jumped  that is so he calmly returned the name was ready to hand and so i took it i dont imagine it will make any difference to him its only a whim of mine and with me theres no accounting for a whim i make it a point to gratify every one that strikes me i confess to being eccentric you know  you must get an enormous amount of gratification out of this she said dryly what if the other man should happen along  scarcely at asquith  i have known stranger things to occur said she  the celebrity smiled and smoked  ill wager now he went on that you little thought to find me here incognito but it is delicious i assure you to lead once more a commonplace and unmolested existence  delightful said miss thorn  people never consider an author apart from his work you know and i confess i had a desire to find out how i would get along and there comes a time when a man wishes he had never written a book and a longing to be sought after for his own sake and to be judged on his own merits and then it is a great relief to feel that one is not at the beck and call of any one and every one wherever one goes and to know that one is free to choose ones own companions and do as one wishes  the sentiment is good miss thorn agreed very good but doesnt it seem a little odd mr crocker she continued appealing to me that a man should take the pains to advertise a trip to europe in order to gratify a whim of this sort  it is indeed incomprehensible to me i replied with a kind of grim pleasure but you must remember that i have always led a commonplace existence  although the celebrity was almost impervious to sarcasm he was now beginning to exhibit visible signs of uneasiness the consciousness dawning upon him that his eccentricity was not receiving the ovation it merited it was with a palpable relief that he heard the first warning notes of the figure  am i to understand that you wish me to do my part in concealing your identity asked miss thorn cutting him short as he was expressing pleasure at her arrival  if you will be so kind he answered and departed with a bow there was a mischievous mirth in her eye as she took her place in the window below in the ballroom sat miss trevor surrounded by men and i saw her face lighting at the celebritys approach  who is that beautiful girl he is dancing with said miss thorn  i told her  have you read his books she asked after a pause  some of them  so have i  the celebrity was not mentioned again that evening     chapter vi  as an endeavor to unite mohair and asquith the cotillon had proved a dismal failure they were as the clay and the brass the next morning asquith was split into factions and rent by civil strife and the porch of the inn was covered by little knots of women all trying to talk at once their faces told an ominous tale not a man was to be seen the minneapolis st paul and chicago papers all of which had previously contained elaborate illustrated accounts of mr cookes palatial park and residence came out that morning bristling with headlines about the ball incidentally holding up the residents of a quiet and retiring little community in a light that scandalized them beyond measure and mr charles wrexell allen treasurer of the widely known miles standish bicycle company was said to have led the cotillon in a manner that left nothing to be desired  so it was this gentleman whom the celebrity was personating a queer whim indeed  after that i doubt if the court of charles the second was regarded by the puritans with a greater abhorrence than was mohair by the good ladies of asquith mr cooke and his ten friends were branded as profligates whose very scarlet coats bore witness that they were of the devil mr cooke himself who particularly savored of brimstone would much better have remained behind the arras for he was denounced with such energy and bitterness that those who might have attempted his defence were silent and their very silence told against them mr cooke had indeed outdone himself in hospitality he had posted punchbowls in every available corner and so industriously did he devote himself to the duties of host as he conceived them that as many as four of the patriarchs of asquith and pillars of the church had returned home more or less insensible while others were quite incoherent the odds being overwhelming the master of mohair had at length fallen a victim to his own good cheer he took post with judge short at the foot of the stair where in spite of the protests of the celebrity and of other welldisposed persons the two favored the parting guests with an occasional impromptu song and waved genial goodbyes to the ladies and when mrs short attempted to walk by with her head in the air as though the judge were in an adjoining county he so far forgot his judicial dignity as to chuck her under the chin an act which was applauded with much boyish delight by mr cooke and a remark which it is just as well not to repeat the judge desired to spend the night at mohair but was afterwards taken home by main force and the next day his meals were brought up to him it is small wonder that mrs short was looked upon as the head of the outraged party the ten were only spoken of in whispers three of them had been unable to come to time when the last figure was called whereupon their partners were whisked off the scene without so much as being allowed to pay their respects to the hostess besides these offences there were other minor barbarisms too numerous to mention  although mrs shorts party was allpowerful at asquith there were some who for various reasons refused to agree in the condemnation of mr cooke judge short and the other gentlemen in his position were of course restricted but mr trevor came out boldly in the face of severe criticism and declared that his daughter should accept any invitation from mrs cooke that she chose and paid but little attention to the coolness resulting therefrom he was fast getting a reputation for oddity and the celebrity tried to conciliate both parties and succeeded though none but he could have done it at first he was eyed with suspicion and disgust as he drove off to mohair in his hempstead cart and was called many hard names but he had a way about him which won them in the end  a few days later i ran over to mohair and found my client with the colored sunday supplement of a chicago newspaper spread out before him eyeing the page with something akin to childish delight i discovered that it was a picture of his own hunt ball and as a bit of color it was marvellous the scarlet coats being very much in evidence  there old man he exclaimed what do you think of that something of a sendoff eh and he pointed to a rather stout and important gentleman in the foreground thats me he said proudly and they wouldnt do that for farquhar fenelon cooke in philadelphia  a prophet is without honor in his own country i remarked  i dont set up for a prophet said mr cooke but i did predict that i would start a ripple here didnt i  i did not deny this  how do i stand over there he inquired designating asquith by a twist of the head i hear theyre acting all over the road that they think im the very devil  well your stock has dropped some i admit i answered they didnt take kindly to your getting the judge drunk you know  they oughtnt to complain about that said my client and besides he wasnt drunk enough to amount to anything  however that may be said i you have the credit for leading him astray but there is a split in your favor  im glad to know that he said brightening then i wont have to import any more  any more what i asked  people from the east to keep things moving of course what i have here and those left me at the inn ought to be enough to run through the summer with dont you think so  i thought so and was moving off when he called me back  is the judge locked up old man he demanded  hes under rather close surveillance i replied smiling  crocker he said confidentially see if you cant smuggle him over here some day soon the judge always holds good cards and plays a number one hand  i promised and escaped on the veranda i came upon miss thorn surrounded by some of her uncles guests i imagine that she was bored for she looked it  mr crocker she called out youre just the man i have been wishing to see  the others naturally took this for a dismissal and she was not long in coming to her point when we were alone  what is it you know about this queer but gifted genius who is here so mysteriously she asked  nothing whatever i confessed i knew him before he thought of becoming a genius  retrogression is always painful she said but tell me something about him then  i told her all i knew being that narrated in these pages now said i if you will pardon a curiosity on my part from what you said the other evening i inferred that he closely resembles the man whose name it pleased him to assume and that man i learn from the newspapers is mr charles wrexell allen of the miles standish bicycle company  miss thorn made a comic gesture of despair  why he chose mr allens name she said is absolutely beyond my guessing unless there is some purpose behind the choice which i do not for an instant believe it was a foolish thing to do and one very apt to lead to difficulties i can understand the rest he has a reputation for eccentricity which he feels he must keep up and this notion of assuming a name evidently appealed to him as an inspiration  but why did he come out here i asked can you tell me that  miss thorn flushed slightly and ignored the question  i met the celebrity as you call him she said for the first time last winter and i saw him frequently during the season of course i had heard not a little about him and his peculiarities his name seems to have gone the length and breadth of the land and like most girls i had read his books and confess i enjoyed them it is not too much to say she added archly that i made a sort of archangel out of the author  i can understand that said i  but that did not last she continued hastily i see i have got beside my story i saw a great deal of him in new york he came to call and i believe i danced with him once or twice and then my aunt mrs rivers bought a place near epsom in massachusetts and had a house party there in may and the celebrity was invited  i smiled  oh i assure you it was a mere chance said miss thorn i mention this that i may tell you the astonishing part of it all epsom is one of those smoky manufacturing towns one sees in new england and the miles standish bicycle is made there the day after we all arrived at my aunts a man came up the drive on a wheel whom i greeted in a friendly way and got a decidedly uncertain bow in return  i thought it rather a strange shift from a marked cordiality and spoke of the circumstance to my aunt who was highly amused why my dear said she that was mr allen of the bicycle company i was nearly deceived myself  and is the resemblance so close as that i exclaimed  so close believe me they are as like as two ices from a mould of course when they are together one can distinguish the celebrity from the bicycle man the celebritys chin is a little more square and his nose straighter and there are other little differences i believe mr allen has a slight scar on his forehead but the likeness was remarkable nevertheless and it grew to be a standing joke with us they actually dressed ludicrously alike the celebrity became so sensitive about it that he went back to new york before the party broke up we grew to be quite fond of the bicycle man  she paused and shifted her chair which had rocked close to mine  and can you account for his coming to asquith i asked innocently  she was plainly embarrassed  i suppose i might account for it mr crocker she replied then she added with something of an impulse after all it is foolish of me not to tell you you probably know the celebrity well enough to have learned that he takes idiotic fancies to young women  not always idiotic i protested  you mean that the young women are not always idiotic i suppose no not always but nearly always i imagine he got the idea of coming to asquith she went on with a change of manner because i chanced to mention that i was coming out here on a visit  oh i remarked and there words failed me  her mouth was twitching with merriment  i am afraid you will have to solve the rest of it for yourself mr crocker said she that is all of my contribution my uncle tells me you are the best lawyer in the country and i am surprised that you are so slow in getting at motives  and i did attempt to solve it on my way back to asquith the conclusion i settled to everything weighed was this that the celebrity had become infatuated with miss thorn i was far from blaming him for that and had followed her first to epsom and now to asquith and he had chosen to come west incognito partly through the conceit which he admitted and gloried in and partly because he believed his prominence sufficient to obtain for him an unpleasant notoriety if he continued long enough to track the same young lady about the country hence he had taken the trouble to advertise a trip abroad to account for his absence undoubtedly his previous conquests had been made more easily for my second talk with miss thorn had put my mind at rest as to her having fallen a victim to his fascinations her arrival at mohair being delayed the celebrity had come nearly a month too soon and in the interval that tendency of which he was the dupe still led him by the nose he must needs make violent love to the most attractive girl on the groundmiss trevor now that one still more attractive had arrived i was curious to see how he would steer between the two for i made no doubt that matters had progressed rather far with miss trevor and in this i was not mistaken  but his choice of the name of charles wrexell allen bothered me considerably i finally decided that he had taken it because convenient and because he believed asquith to be more remote from the east than the sandwich islands  reaching the inn grounds i climbed the hillside to a favorite haunt of mine a huge boulder having a sloping back covered with soft turf hence i could watch indifferently both lake and sky presently however i was aroused by voices at the foot of the rock and peering over the edge i discovered a kind of sewingcircle gathered there the foliage hid me completely i perceived the celebrity perched upon the low branch of an appletree and miss trevor below him with two other girls doing fancywork i shall not attempt to defend the morality of my action but i could not get away without discovery and the knowledge that i had heard a part of their conversation might prove disquieting to them  the celebrity had just published a book under the title of the sybarites which was being everywhere discussed and asquith where summer reading was general came in for its share of the debate why it was called the sybarites i have never discovered i did not read the book because i was sick and tired of the author and his nonsense but i imbibed in spite of myself something of the story and its moral from hearing it talked about the celebrity himself had listened to arguments on the subject with great serenity and was nothing loth to give his opinion when appealed to i realized at once that the sybarites was the present topic  yes it is rather an uncommon book he was saying languidly but there is no use writing a story unless it is uncommon  dear how i should like to meet the author exclaimed a voice he must be a charming man and so young too i believe you said you knew him mr allen  an old acquaintance he answered and i am always reminding him that his work is overestimated  how can you say he is overestimated said a voice  you men are all jealous of him said another  is he handsome i have heard he is  he would scarcely be called so said the celebrity doubtfully  he is girls miss trevor interposed i have seen his photograph  what does he look like irene they chorused men are no judges  he is tall and dark and broadshouldered miss trevor enumerated as though counting her stitches and he has a very firm chin and a straight nose and  perfect they cried i had an idea he was just like that i should go wild about him does he talk as well as he writes mr allen  that is admitting that he writes well  admitting they shouted scornfully and dont you admit it  some people like his writing i have to confess said the celebrity with becoming calmness certainly his personality could not sell an edition of thirty thousand in a month i think the sybarites the best of his works  upon my word mr allen i am disgusted with you said the second voice i have not found a man yet who would speak a good word for him but i did not think it of you  a womans tongue like a firearm is a dangerous weapon and often strikes where it is least expected i saw with a wicked delight that the shot had told for the celebrity blushed to the roots of his hair while miss trevor dropped three or four stitches  i do not see how you can expect men to like the sybarites she said with some heat very few men realize or care to realize what a small chance the average woman has i know marriage isnt a necessary goal but most women as well as most men look forward to it at some time of life and as a rule a woman is forced to take her choice of the two or three men that offer themselves no matter what they are i admire a man who takes up the cudgels for women as he has done  of course we admire him they cried as soon as miss trevor had stopped for breath  and can you expect a man to like a book which admits that women are the more constant she went on  why irene you are quite rabid on the subject said the second voice i did not say i expected it i only said i had hoped to find mr allen at least broad enough to agree with the book  doesnt mr allen remind you a little of desmond asked the first voice evidently anxious to avoid trouble  do you know whom he took for desmond mr allen i have an idea it was himself  mr allen had now recovered some of his composure  if so it was done unconsciously he said i suppose an author must put his best thoughts in the mouth of his hero  but it is like him she insisted  yes he holds the same views  which you do not agree with  i have not said i did not agree with them he replied taking up his own defence the point is not that men are more inconstant than women but that women have more excuse for inconstancy if i remember correctly desmond in a letter to rosamond says inconstancy in a woman because of the present social conditions is often pardonable in a man nothing is more despicable i think that is so i believe that a man should stick by the woman to whom he has given his word as closely as he sticks by his friends  ah exclaimed the aggressive second voice that is all very well but how about the woman to whom he has not given his word unfortunately the present social conditions allow a man to go pretty far without a definite statement  at this i could not refrain from looking at miss trevor she was bending over her knitting and had broken her thread  it is presumption for a man to speak without some foundation said the celebrity and wrong unless he is sure of himself   but you must admit the second voice continued that a man has no right to amuse himself with a woman and give her every reason to believe he is going to marry her save the only manly and substantial one and yet that is something which happens every day what do you think of a man who deserts a woman under those conditions  he is a detestable dog of course declared the celebrity  and the cock in the inn yard was silent  i should love to be able to quote from a book at will said the quieting voice for the sake of putting an end to an argument which bid fair to become disagreeable how do you manage to do it  it was simply a passage that stuck in my mind he answered modestly when i read a book i pick them up just as a roller picks up a sod here and there as it moves over the lawn  i should think you might write mr allen you have such an original way of putting things  i have thought of it returned the celebrity and i may some fine day  wherewith he thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered off with equanimity undisturbed apparently unaware of the impression he had left behind him and the fifth reader story popped into my head of good king william or king frederick i forgot which who had a royal fancy for laying aside the gayeties of the court and straying incognito among his plainer subjects but whose princely origin was invariably detected in spite of any disguise his majesty could invent     chapter vii  i experienced a great surprise a few mornings afterwards i had risen quite early and found the celebritys man superintending the hoisting of luggage on top of a van  is your master leaving i asked  hes off to mohair now sir said the valet with a salute  at that instant the celebrity himself appeared  yes old chap im off to mohair he explained theres more sport in a day up there than you get here in a season beastly slow place this unless one is a deacon or a doctor of divinity why dont you come up crocker cooke would like nothing better he has told me so a dozen times  he is very good i replied i could not resist the temptation to add i had an idea asquith rather suited your purposes just now  i dont quite understand he said jumping at the other half of my meaning  oh nothing but you told me when you came here if i am not mistaken that you chose asquith because of those very qualities for which you now condemn it  magna est vis consuetudinis he laughed i thought i could stand the life but i cant i am tired of their sects and synods and sermons by the way said he pulling at my sleeve what a deuced pretty girl that miss thorn is isnt she rollins wheres the cart well goodbye crocker see you soon  he drove rapidly off as the clock struck six and an uneasy glance he gave the upper windows did not escape me when farrar appeared i told him what had happened  good riddance he replied sententiously  we sat in silence until the bell rang looking at the morning sun on the lake i was a little anxious to learn the state of farrars feelings in regard to miss trevor and how this new twist in affairs had affected them but i might as well have expected one of king louiss carp to whisper secrets of the old regime the young lady came to the breakfasttable looking so fresh and in such high spirits that i made sure she had not heard of the celebritys ignoble escape as the meal proceeded it was easy to mark that her eye now and again fell across his empty chair and glanced inquiringly towards the door i made up my mind that i would not be the bearer of evil news and so did farrar so we kept up a vapid smalltalk with mr trevor on the condition of trade in the west miss trevor however in some way came to suspect that we could account for that vacant seat at last she fixed her eye inquiringly on me and i trembled  mr crocker she began and paused then she added with a fair unconcern do you happen to know where mr allen is this morning  he has gone over to mohair i believe i replied weakly  to mohair she exclaimed putting down her cup why he promised to go canoeing at ten  probably he will be back by then i ventured not finding it in my heart to tell her the cruel truth but i kept my eyes on my plate they say a lie has short legs mine had for my black friend simpson was at that instant taking off the fruit and overheard my remark  mr allen done gone for good he put in done give me five dollars last night why sah he added scratching his head you was on de poch dis mornin when his trunks was took away  it was certainly no time to quibble then  his trunks miss trevor exclaimed  yes he has left us and gone to mohair i said bag and baggage that is the flat truth of it  i suppose there is some general rule for calculating beforehand how a young woman is going to act when news of this sort is broken i had no notion of what miss trevor would do i believe farrar thought she would faint for he laid his napkin on the table she did nothing of the kind but said simply  how unreliable men are  i fell to guessing what her feelings were for the life of me i could not tell from her face i was sorry for miss trevor in spite of the fact that she had neglected to ask my advice before falling in love with the celebrity i asked her to go canoeing with me she refused kindly but very firmly  it is needless to say that the celebrity did not come back to the inn and as far as i could see the desertion was designed coldblooded and complete miss trevor remained out of sight during the day of his departure and at dinner we noticed traces of a storm about hera storm which had come and gone there was an involuntary hush as she entered the diningroom for asquith had been buzzing that afternoon over the episode and i admired the manner in which she bore her inspection already rumors of the cause of mr allens departure were in active circulation and i was astonished to learn that he had been seen that day seated upon indian rock with miss thorn herself this piece of news gave me a feeling of insecurity about people and about women in particular that i had never before experienced after holding the celebrity up to such unmeasured ridicule as she had done ridicule not without a seasoning of contempt it was difficult to believe miss thorn so inconsistent as to go alone with him to indian rock and she was not ignorant of miss trevors experience but the fact was attested by trustworthy persons  i have often wondered what prompted me to ask miss trevor again to go canoeing to do myself justice it was no wish of mine to meddle with or pry into her affairs neither did i flatter myself that my poor company would be any consolation for that she had lost i shall not try to analyze my motive suffice it to record that she accepted this second invitation and i did my best to amuse her by relating a few of my experiences at the bar and i told that memorable story of farrar throwing omeara into the street we were getting along famously when we descried another canoe passing us at some distance and we both recognized the celebrity at the paddle by the flannel jacket of his college boat club and miss thorn sat in the bow  do you know anything about that man miss trevor i asked abruptly  she grew scarlet but replied  i know that he is a fraud  anything else  i cant say that i do that is nothing but what he has told me  if you will forgive my curiosity i said what has he told you  he says he is the author of the sybarites she answered her lip curling but of course i do not believe that now  but that happens to be true i said smiling  she clapped her hands  i promised him i wouldnt tell she cried but the minute i get back to the inn i shall publish it  no dont do that just yet said i  why not of course i shall  i had no definite reason only a vague hope that we should get some better sort of enjoyment out of the disclosure before the summer was over  you see i said he is always getting into scrapes he is that kind of a man and it is my humble opinion that he has put his head into a noose this time for sure mr allen of the miles standish bicycle company whose name he has borrowed for the occasion is enough like him in appearance to be his twin brother  he has borrowed another mans name she exclaimed why thats stealing  no merely kleptomania i replied he wouldnt be the other man if he could but it has struck me that the real mr allen might turn up here or some friend of his and stir things a bit my advice to you is to keep quiet and we may have a comedy worth seeing  well she remarked after she had got over a little of her astonishment it would be great fun to tell but i wont if you say so  i came to have a real liking for miss trevor farrar used to smile when i spoke of this and i never could induce him to go out with us in the canoe which we did frequentlyin fact every day i was at asquith except of course sundays and we grew to understand each other very well she looked upon me in the same light as did my other friendsthat of a counselloratlawand i fell unconsciously into the role of her adviser in which capacity i was the recipient of many confidences i would have got in no other way that is in no other way save one and in that i had no desire to go even had it been possible miss trevor was only nineteen and in her eyes i was at least sixty  see here miss trevor i said to her one day after we had become more or less intimate of course its none of my business but you didnt feel very badly after the celebrity went away did you  her reply was frank and rather staggering  yes i did i was engaged to him you know  engaged to him i had no idea he ever got that far i exclaimed  miss trevor laughed merrily  it was my fault she said i pinned him down and he had to propose there was no way out of it i dont mind telling you  i did not know whether to be flattered or aggrieved by this avowal  you know she went on her tone half apologetic the day after he came he told me who he was and i wanted to stop the people we passed and inform them of the lion i was walking with and i was quite carried away by the honor of his attentions any girl would have been you know  i suppose so i assented  and i had heard and read so much of him and i doted on his stories and all that his heroes are divine you must admit and mr crocker she concluded with a charming naivety i just made up my mind i would have him  woman proposes and man disposes i laughed he escaped in spite of you  she looked at me queerly  only a jest i said hurriedly your escape is the one to be thankful for you might have married him like the young woman in the sybarites you remember do you not that the hero of that book sacrifices himself for the lady who adores him but whom he has ceased to adore  yes i remember she laughed i believe i know that book by heart  think of the countless girls he must have relieved of their affections before their eyes were opened i continued with mock gravity think of the charred trail he has left behind him a man of that sort ought to be put under heavy bonds not to break any more hearts but a kleptomaniac isnt responsible you understand and it isnt worth while to bear any malice  oh i dont bear any malice now she said i did at first naturally but it all seems very ridiculous now i have had time to think it over i believe mr crocker that i never really cared for him  simply an idol shattered this time i suggested and not a heart broken  yes thats it said she  i am glad to hear it said i much pleased that she had taken such a sensible view but you are engaged to him  i was  you have broken the engagement then  no ihavent she said  then he has broken it  she did not appear to resent this catechism  thats the strange part of it said miss trevor he hasnt even thought it necessary  it is clear then that you are still engaged to him said i smiling at her blank face  i suppose i am she cried isnt it awful what shall i do mr crocker you are so sensible and have had so much experience  i beg your pardon i remarked grimly  oh you know what i mean not that kind of experience of course but breach of promise cases and that sort of thing i have a photograph of him with something written over it  something compromising i inquired  yes you would probably call it so she answered reddening but there is no need of my repeating it and then i have a lot of other things if i write to break off the engagement i shall lose dignity and it will appear as though i had regrets i dont wish him to think that of all things what shall i do  do nothing i said  what do you mean  just that do not break the engagement and keep the photograph and other articles for evidence if he makes any overtures dont consider them for an instant and i think miss trevor you will succeed sooner or later in making him very uncomfortable were he any one else i shouldnt advise such a course but you wont lose any dignity and selfrespect by it as no one will be likely to hear of it he cant be taken seriously and plainly he has never taken any one else so he hasnt even gone to the trouble to notify you that he does not intend marrying you  i saw from her expression that my suggestion was favorably entertained  what a joke it would be she cried delightedly  and a decided act of charity i added to the next young woman on his list     chapter viii  the humor of my proposition appealed more strongly to miss trevor than i had looked for and from that time forward she became her old self again for even after she had conquered her love for the celebrity the mortification of having been jilted by him remained now she had come to look upon the matter in its true proportions and her anticipation of a possible chance of teaching him a lesson was a pleasure to behold our table in the diningroom became again the abode of scintillating wit and caustic repartee farrar bracing up to his old standard and the demand for seats in the vicinity rose to an animated competition mr charles wrexell allens chair was finally awarded to a nephew of judge short who could turn a story to perfection  so life at the inn settled down again to what it had been before the celebrity came to disturb it  i had my own reasons for staying away from mohair more than once as i drove over to the countyseat in my buggy i had met the celebrity on a tall tandem cart with one of mr cookes highsteppers in the lead and miss thorn in the low seat i had forgotten to mention that my friend was something of a whip at such times i would bow very civilly and pass on not without a twinge i confess and as the result of one of these meetings i had to retrace several miles of my road for a brief i had forgotten after that i took another road several miles longer for the sight of miss thorn with him seriously disturbed my peace of mind but at length the day came as i had feared when circumstances forced me to go to my clients place one morning miss trevor and i were about stepping into the canoe for our customary excursion when one of mr cookes footmen arrived with a note for each of us they were from mrs cooke and requested the pleasure of our company that day for luncheon if you were i would you go miss trevor asked doubtfully  of course i replied  but the consequences may be unpleasant  dont let them i said of what use is tact to a woman if not for just such occasions  my invitation had this characteristic note tacked on the end of it  dear crocker where are you where is the judge f f c  i corralled the judge and we started off across the fields in no very mild state of fear of that gentlemans wife whose vigilance was seldom relaxed and thus we came by a circuitous route to mohair the judge occupied by his own guilty thoughts and i by others not less disturbing my client welcomed the judge with that warmth of manner which grappled so many of his friends to his heart and they disappeared together into the ethiopian cardroom which was filled with the assegais and exclamation point shields mr cooke had had made at the sawmill at beaverton  i learned from one of the lordsinwaiting loafing about the hall that mrs cooke was out on the golf links chaperoning some of the asquith young women whose mothers had not seen fit to ostracize mohair mr cookes ten friends were with them but this discreet and dignified servant could not reveal the whereabouts of miss thorn and of mr allen both of whom i was decidedly anxious to avoid i was much disgusted therefore to come upon the celebrity in the smokingroom writing rapidly with sheets of manuscript piled beside him and he was quite goodnatured over my intrusion  no said he dont go its only a short story i promised for a christmas number they offered me fifteen cents a word and promised to put my name on the cover in red so i couldnt very well refuse its no inspiration though i tell you that he rose and pressed a bell behind him and ordered whiskeys and ginger ales as if he were in a hotel sit down crocker he said waving me to a morocco chair why dont you come over to see us oftener  ive been quite busy i said  this remark seemed to please him immensely  what a sly old chap you are said he really i shall have to go back to the inn and watch you  what the deuce do you mean i demanded  he looked me over in wellbred astonishment and replied  hang me crocker if i can make you out you seem to know the world pretty well and yet when a fellow twits you on a little flirtation you act as though you were going to black his eyes  a little flirtation i repeated aghast  oh well he said smiling we wont quarrel over a definition call it anything you like  dont you think this a little uncalled for i asked beginning to lose my temper  bless you no not among friends not among such friends as we are  i didnt know we were such devilish good friends i retorted warmly  oh yes we are devilish good friends he answered with assurance known each other from boyhood and all that and i say old chap he added you neednt be jealous of me you know i got out of that long ago and im after something else now  for a space i was speechless then the ludicrous side of the matter struck me and i laughed in spite of myself better after all to deal with a fool according to his folly the celebrity glanced at the door and drew his chair closer to mine  crocker he said confidentially im glad you came here today there is a thing or two i wished to consult you about  professional i asked trying to head him off  no he replied amateurbeastly amateur a bungle if i ever made one the truth is i executed rather a faux pas over there at asquith tell me said he diving desperately at the root of it how does miss trevor feel about my getting out i meant to let her down easier pon my word i did  this is a way rascals have of judging other men by themselves  well said i it was rather a blow of course  of course he assented  and all the more unexpected i went on from a man who has written reams on constancy  i flatter myself that this nearly struck home for he was plainly annoyed  oh bother that said he how many gowns believe in their own sermons how many lawyers believe in their own arguments  unhappily not as many as might  i dont object to telling you old chap he continued that i went in a little deeper than i intended a good deal deeper in fact miss trevor is a deuced fine girl and all that but absolutely impossible i forgot myself and i confess i was pretty close to caught  i congratulate you i said gravely  thats the point of it i dont know that im out of the woods yet i wanted to see you and find out how she was acting  my first impulse was to keep him in hot water fortunately i thought twice  i dont know anything about miss trevors feelings i began  naturally not he interrupted with a smile  but i have a notion that if she ever fancied you she doesnt care a straw for you today  doesnt she now he replied somewhat regretfully here was one of the knots in his character i never could untie  understand that is simply my guess i said you must have discovered that it is never possible to be sure of a womans feelings  found that out long ago he replied with conviction and added then you think i need not anticipate any trouble from her  i have told you what i think i answered you know better than i what the situation is  he still lingered  does she appear to be inahin good spirits  i had work to keep my face straight  capital i said i never saw her happier  this seemed to satisfy him  downcast at first happy now he remarked thoughtfully yes she got over it im much obliged to you crocker  i left him to finish his short story and walked out across the circle of smooth lawn towards the golf links and there i met mrs cooke and her niece coming in together the warm red of her costume became miss thorn wonderfully and set off the glossy black of her hair and her skin was glowing from the exercise an involuntary feeling of admiration for this tall athletic young woman swept over me and i halted in my steps for no other reason i believe than that i might look upon her the longer  what man i thought resentfully would not travel a thousand miles to be near her  it is mr crocker said mrs cooke i had given up all hope of ever seeing you again why have you been such a stranger  as if you didnt know aunt maria miss thorn put in gayly  oh yes i know returned her aunt and i have not been foolish enough to invite the bar without the magnet and yet mr crocker she went on playfully i had imagined that you were the one man in a hundred who did not need an inducement  miss thorn began digging up the turf with her lofter it was a painful moment for me  you might at least have tried me mrs cooke i said  miss thorn looked up quickly from the ground her eyes searchingly upon my face and mrs cooke seemed surprised  we are glad you came at any rate she answered  and at luncheon my seat was next to miss thorns while the celebrity was placed at the right of miss trevor i observed that his face went blank from time to time at some quip of hers even a dull woman may be sharp under such circumstances and miss trevor had wits to spare and i marked that she never allowed her talk with him to drift into deep water when there was danger of this she would draw the entire table into their conversation by some adroit remark or create a laugh at his expense as for me i held a discreet if uncomfortable silence save for the few words which passed between miss thorn and me once or twice i caught her covert glance on me but i felt and strongly that there could be no friendship between us now and i did not care to dissimulate merely for the sake of appearances besides i was not a little put out over the senseless piece of gossip which had gone abroad concerning me  it had been arranged as part of the days programme that mr cooke was to drive those who wished to go over the rise in his new brake but the table was not graced by our hosts presence mrs cooke apologizing for him explaining that he had disappeared quite mysteriously it turned out that he and the judge had been served with luncheon in the ethiopian cardroom and neither threats nor fair words could draw him away the judge had not held such cards for years and it was in vain that i talked to him of consequences the ten decided to remain and watch a game which was pronounced little short of phenomenal and my client gave orders for the smaller brake and requested the celebrity to drive and this he was nothing loth to do for the edification as well as the assurance of the party mr allen explained while we were waiting under the porte cochere how he had driven the windsor coach down piccadilly at the height of the season with a certain member of parliament and noted whip on the box seat  and to do him justice he could drive he won the instant respect of mr cookes coachman by his manner of taking up the lines and clinched it when he dropped a careless remark concerning the off wheeler and after the critical inspection of the horses which is proper he climbed up on the box there was much hesitation among the ladies as to who should take the seat of honor mrs cooke declining it was pressed upon miss thorn but she somewhat to my surprise declined also and it was finally filled by a young woman from asquith  as we drove off i found myself alone with mrs cookes niece on the seat behind  the day was cool and snappy for august and the rise all green with a lavish nature now we plunged into a deep shade with the boughs lacing each other overhead and crossed dainty rustic bridges over the cold troutstreams the boards giving back the clatter of our horses feet or anon we shot into a clearing with a colored glimpse of the lake and its curving shore far below us i had always loved that piece of country since the first look i had of it from the asquith road and the sight of it rarely failed to set my blood atingle with pleasure but today i scarcely saw it i wondered what whim had impelled miss thorn to get into this seat she paid but little attention to me during the first part of the drive though a mere look in my direction seemed to afford her amusement and at last half way up the rise where the road takes to an embankment i got a decided jar  mr allen she cried to the celebrity you must stop here do you remember how long we tarried over this bit on friday  he tightened the lines and threw a meaning glance backward  i was tempted to say  you and mr allen should know these roads rather well miss thorn  every inch of them she replied  we must have gone a mile farther when she turned upon me  it is your duty to be entertaining mr crocker what in the world are you thinking of with your brow all puckered up forbidding as an owl  i was thinking how some people change i answered with a readiness which surprised me  strange she said i had the same thing in mind i hear decidedly queer tales of you canoeing every day that business does not prevent and whole evenings spent at the dark end of a veranda  what rubbish i exclaimed not knowing whether to be angered or amused  come sir she said with mock sternness answer the charge guilty or not guilty  first let me make a countercharge said i you have given me the right not long ago a certain young lady came to mohair and found there a young author of note with whom she had had some previous acquaintance she did not hesitate to intimate her views on the character of this celebrity and her views were not favorable  i paused there was some satisfaction in seeing miss thorn biting her lip  well  not at all favorable mind you i went on and the young ladys general appearance was such as to lead one to suppose her the sincerest of persons now i am at a loss to account for a discrepancy between her words and her actions  while i talked miss thorns face had been gradually turning from mine until now i saw only the dainty knot at the back of her head her shoulders were quivering with laughter but presently her face came back all gravity save a suspicious gleam of mirth in the eyes  it does seem inconsistent mr crocker i grant you that no doubt it is so but let me ask you something did you ever yet know a woman who was not inconsistent  i did not realize i had been sidetracked until i came to think over this conversation afterwards  i am not sure i replied perhaps i merely hoped that one such existed  she dropped her eyes  then dont be surprised at my failing said she no doubt i criticised the celebrity severely i cannot recall what i said but it is upon the better side of a character that we must learn to look did it ever strike you that the celebrity had some exceedingly fine qualities  no it did not i answered positively  nevertheless he has she went on in all apparent seriousness he drives almost as well as uncle farquhar dances well and is a capital paddle  you were speaking of qualities not accomplishments i said a horrible suspicion that she was having a little fun at my expense crossed my mind  very good then you must admit that he is generous to a fault amiable and persevering else he would never have attained the position he enjoys and his affection for you mr crocker is really touching considering how little he gets in return  come miss thorn i said severely this is ridiculous i dont like him and never shall i liked him once before he took to writing drivel but he must have been made over since then and what is more with all respect to your opinion i dont believe he likes me  miss thorn straightened up with dignity and said  you do him an injustice but perhaps you will learn to appreciate him before he leaves mohair  that is not likely i repliednot at all pleasantly i fear and again i thought i observed in her the same desire to laugh she had before exhibited  and all the way back her talk was of nothing except the celebrity i tried every method short of absolute rudeness to change the subject and went from silence to taciturnity and back again to silence she discussed his books and his mannerisms even the growth of his popularity she repeated anecdotes of him from naples to st petersburg from tokio to cape town and when we finally stopped under the porte cochere i had scarcely the civility left to say goodbye  i held out my hand to help her to the ground but she paused on the second step  mr crocker she observed archly i believe you once told me you had not known many girls in your life  true i said why do you ask  i wished to be sure of it she replied  and jumping down without my assistance she laughed and disappeared into the house     volume 3     chapter ix  that evening i lighted a cigar and went down to sit on the outermost pile of the asquith dock to commune with myself to say that i was disappointed in miss thorn would be to set a mild value on my feelings i was angry even aggressive over her defence of the celebrity i had gone over to mohair that day with a hope that some good reason was at the bottom of her tolerance for him and had come back without any hope she not only tolerated him but wonderful to be said plainly liked him had she not praised him and defended him and become indignant when i spoke my mind about him and i would have taken my oath two weeks before that nothing short of hypnotic influence could have changed her by her own confession she had come to asquith with her eyes opened and what was more seen another girl wrecked on the same reef  farrar followed me out presently and i had an impulse to submit the problem as it stood to him but it was a long story and i did not believe that if he were in my boots he would have consulted me again i sometimes thought farrar yearned for confidences though it was impossible for him to confide and he wore an inviting air tonight then as everybody knows there is that about twilight and an afterdinner cigar which leads to communication they are excellent solvents my friend seated himself on the pile next to mine and said  it strikes me you have been behaving rather queer lately crocker  this was clearly an invitation from farrar and i melted  i admit said i that i am a good deal perplexed over the contradictions of the human mind  oh is that all he replied dryly i supposed it was worse narrower i mean didnt know you ever bothered yourself with abstract philosophy  see here farrar said i what is your opinion of miss thorn  he stopped kicking his feet against the pile and looked up  miss thorn  yes miss thorn i repeated with emphasis i knew he had in mind that abominable twaddle about the canoe excursions  why to tell the truth said he i never had any opinion of miss thorn  you mean you never formed any i suppose i returned with some tartness  yes that is it how darned precise you are getting crocker one would think you were going to write a rhetoric what put miss thorn into your head  i have been coaching beside her this afternoon  oh said farrar  do you remember the night she came i asked and we sat with her on the florentine porch and charles wrexell recognized her and came up  yes he replied with awakened interest and i meant to ask you about that  miss thorn had met him in the east and i gathered from what she told me that he has followed her out here  shouldnt wonder said farrar dont much blame him do you is that what troubles you he asked in surprise  not precisely i answered vaguely but from what she has said then and since she made it pretty clear that she hadnt any use for him saw through him you know  pity her if she didnt but what did she say  i repeated the conversations i had had with miss thorn without revealing mr allens identity with the celebrated author  that is rather severe he assented  he decamped for mohair as you know and since that time she has gone back on every word of it she is with him morning and evening and to crown all stood up for him through thick and thin today and praised him what do you think of that  what i should have expected in a woman said he nonchalantly  they arent all alike i retorted  he shook out his pipe and getting down from his high seat laid his hand on my knee  i thought so once old fellow he whispered and went off down the dock  this was the nearest farrar ever came to a confidence  i have now to chronicle a curious friendship which had its beginning at this time the friendships of the other sex are quickly made and sometimes as quickly dissolved this one interested me more than i care to own the next morning judge short looking somewhat dejected after the overnight conference he had had with his wife was innocently and somewhat ostentatiously engaged in tossing quoits with me in front of the inn when miss thorn drove up in a basket cart she gave me a bow which proved that she bore no illwill for that which i had said about her hero then miss trevor appeared and away they went together this was the commencement soon the acquaintance became an intimacy and their lives a series of visits to each other although this new state of affairs did not seem to decrease the number of miss thorns teteatetes with the celebrity it put a stop to the canoe expeditions i had been in the habit of taking with miss trevor which i thought just as well under the circumstances more than once miss thorn partook of the inn fare at our table and when this happened i would make my escape before the coffee for such was the nature of my feelings regarding the celebrity that i could not bring myself into cordial relations with one who professed to admire him i realize how ridiculous such a sentiment must appear but it existed nevertheless and most strongly  i tried hard to throw miss thorn out of my thoughts and very nearly succeeded i took to spending more and more of my time at the countyseat where i remained for days at a stretch inventing business when there was none and in the meanwhile i lost all respect for myself as a sensible man and cursed the day the celebrity came into the state it seemed strange that this acquaintance of my early days should have come back into my life transformed to make it more or less miserable the countyseat being several miles inland and lying in the midst of hills could get intolerably hot in september at last i was driven out in spite of myself and i arrived at asquith cross and dusty as simpson was brushing me off miss trevor came up the path looking cool and pretty in a summer gown and her face expressed sympathy i have never denied that sympathy was a good thing  oh mr crocker she cried i am so glad you are back again we have missed you dreadfully and you look tired poor man quite worn out it is a shame you have to go over to that hot place to work  i agreed with her  and i never have any one to take me canoeing any more  lets go now i suggested before dinner  so we went it was a keen pleasure to be on the lake again after the sultry courtrooms and offices and the wind and exercise quickly brought back my appetite and spirits i paddled hither and thither stopping now and then to lie under the pines at the mouth of some stream while miss trevor talked she was almost a child in her eagerness to amuse me with the happenings since my departure this was always her manner with me in curious contrast to her habit of fencing and playing with words when in company presently she burst out  mr crocker why is it that you avoid miss thorn i was talking of you to her only today and she says you go miles out of your way to get out of speaking to her that you seemed to like her quite well at first she couldnt understand the change  did she say that i exclaimed  indeed she did and i have noticed it too i saw you leave before coffee more than once when she was here i dont believe you know what a fine girl she is  why then does she accept and return the attentions of the celebrity i inquired with a touch of acidity she knows what he is as well if not better than you or i i own i cant understand it i said the subject getting ahead of me i believe she is in love with him  miss trevor began to laugh quietly at first and as her merriment increased heartily  shouldnt we be getting back i asked looking at my watch it lacks but half an hour of dinner  please dont be angry mr crocker she pleaded i really couldnt help laughing  i was unaware i had said anything funny miss trevor i replied  of course you didnt she said more soberly that is you didnt intend to but the very notion of miss thorn in love with the celebrity is funny  evidence is stronger than argument said i and now she has even convicted herself  i started to paddle homeward rather furiously and my companion said nothing until we came in sight of the inn as the canoe glided into the smooth surface behind the breakwater she broke the silence  i heard you went fishing the other day said she  yes  and the judge told me about a big bass you hooked and how you played him longer than was necessary for the mere fun of the thing  yes  perhaps you will find in the feeling that prompted you to do that a clue to the character of our sex     chapter x  mr cooke had had a sloop yacht built at far harbor the completion of which had been delayed and which was but just delivered she was painted white with brass fittings and under her stern in big black letters was the word maria intended as a surprise and delicate conjugal compliment to mrs cooke the maria had a cabin which was finished in hard wood and yellow plush and accommodations for keeping things cold this last mr cooke had insisted upon  the skipper mr cooke had hired at far harbor was a godfearing man with a luke warm interest in his new billet and employer and had only been prevailed upon to take charge of the yacht for the month after the offer of an emolument equal to half a years sea pay of an ensign in the navy his son and helper was to receive a sum proportionally exorbitant this worthy man sighted mohair on a sunday morning and at nine oclock dropped his anchor with a salute which caused mr cooke to say unpleasant things in his sleep after making things shipshape and hoisting the jack both father and son rowed ashore to the little church at asquith  now the butler at mohair was a servant who had learned from long experience to anticipate every wish and whim of his master and from the moment he descried the white sails of the yacht out of the windows of the butlers pantry his duty was clear as daylight such was the comprehension and despatch with which he gave his commands that the captain returned from divine worship to find the maria in profane hands her immaculate deck littered with straw and sawdust and covered to the coamings with bottles and cases this decided the captain he packed his kit in high dudgeon and took the first train back to far harbor leaving the yacht to her fate  this sudden and inconsiderate departure was a severe blow to mr cooke who was so constituted that he cared but little about anything until there was danger of not getting it my client had planned a trip to bear island for the following tuesday which was to last a week the party to bring tents with them and rough it with the maria as headquarters it was out of the question to send to far harbor for another skipper if indeed one could be found at that late period and as luck would have it six of mr cookes ten guests had left but a day or so since and among them had been the only yachtowner none of the four that remained could do more than haul aft and belay a sheet but the celebrity who chanced along as mr cooke was ruefully gazing at the graceful lines of the maria from the wharf and cursing the fate that kept him ashore with a stiff wind blowing proposed a way out of the difficulty he the celebrity would gladly sail the maria over to bear island provided another man could be found to relieve him occasionally at the wheel and the like he had noticed that farrar was a capable hand in a boat and suggested that he be sent for  this suggestion mr cooke thought so well of that he hurried over to asquith to consult farrar at once and incidentally to consult me we can hardly be blamed for receiving his overtures with a moderate enthusiasm in fact we were of one mind not to go when the subject was first broached but my client had a persuasive way about him that was irresistible and the mere mention of the favors he had conferred upon both of us at different periods of our lives was sufficient we consented  thus it came to pass that tuesday morning found the party assembled on the wharf at mohair the four and the celebrity as well as mr cooke having produced yachting suits from their inexhaustible wardrobes mr trevor and his daughter mrs cooke and miss thorn and farrar and myself completed the party we were to adhere strictly to primeval principles the ladies were not permitted a maid while the celebrity was forced to leave his manservant and mr cooke his chef i had however thrust into my pocket the minneapolis papers which had been handed me by the clerk on their arrival at the inn which happened just as i was leaving quod bene notandum  thereby hangs a tale  for the northern lakes the day was rather dead a little wind lay in the southeast scarcely enough to break the water with the sky an intense blue but the maria was hardly cast and under way before it became painfully apparent that the celebrity was much better fitted to lead a cotillon than to sail a boat he gave his orders nevertheless in a firm seamanlike fashion though with no great pertinence and thus managed to establish the confidence of mr cooke farrar after setting things to rights joined mrs cooke and me over the cabin  how about hoisting the spinnaker mate the celebrity shouted after him  farrar did not deign to answer his eye was on the wind and the boom which had been acting uneasily finally decided to gybe and swept majestically over carrying two of the four in front of it and all but dropped them into the water  a common occurrence in a light breeze we heard the celebrity reassure mr cooke and miss thorn  the maria has vindicated her sex remarked farrar  we laughed  why dont you sail mr farrar asked mrs cooke  he cant do any harm in this breeze farrar replied it isnt strong enough to get anywhere with  he was right the boom gybed twenty times that morning and the celebrity offered an equal number of apologies mr cooke and the four vanished and from the uproarious laughter which arose from the cabin transoms i judged they were telling stories while miss thorn spent the time profitably in learning how to conn a yacht at one when we had luncheon mohair was still in the distance at two it began to cloud over the wind fell flat and an ominous black bank came up from the south without more ado farrar calling on me to give him a hand eased down the halliards and began to close reef the mainsail  hold on said the celebrity who told you to do that  i am very sure you didnt farrar returned as he hauled out a reef earing  here a few drops of rain on the deck warned the ladies to retire to the cabin  take the helm until i get my mackintosh will you farrar said the celebrity and be careful what you do  farrar took the helm and hauled in the sheet while the celebrity mr cooke and the guests donned their rainclothes the water ahead was now like blue velvet and the rain pelting the maria was heeling to the squall by the time the celebrity appeared at the cabin door enveloped in an ample waterproof a rubber cover on his yachting cap a fool despises a danger he has never experienced and our author with a remark about a spanking breeze made a motion to take the wheel but farrar the flannel of his shirt clinging to the muscular outline of his shoulders gave him a push which sent him sprawling against the lee refrigerator well miss thorn was not there to see  you will have to answer for this he cried as he scrambled to his feet and clutched the weather washboard with one hand while he shook the other in farrars face  crocker said farrar to me coolly keep that idiot out of the way for a while or well all be drowned tie him up if necessary  i was relieved from this somewhat unpleasant task mr cooke with his back to the rain sat an amused witness to the mutiny as blissfully ignorant as the celebrity of the character of a lake squall  i appeal to you as the owner of this yacht mr cooke the celebrity shouted whether as the person delegated by you to take charge of it i am to suffer indignity and insult i have sailed larger yachts than this time and again on the coast at here he swallowed a portion of a wave and was mercifully prevented from being specific  but mr cooke was looking a trifle bewildered it was hardly possible for him to cling to the refrigerator much less quell a mutiny one who has sailed the lakes well knows how rapidly they can be lashed to fury by a storm and the wind was now spinning the tops of the waves into a blinding spray although the maria proved a stiff boat and a seaworthy she was not altogether without motion and the set expression on farrars face would have told me had i not known it that our situation at that moment was no joke repeatedly as she was held up to it a precocious roller would sweep from bow to stern until we without coats were wet and shivering  the close and crowded cabin of a small yacht is not an attractive place in rough weather and one by one the four emerged and distributed themselves about the deck wherever they could obtain a hold some of them began to act peculiarly upon mr cookes unwillingness or inability to interfere in his behalf the celebrity had assumed an aggrieved demeanor but soon the motion of the maria became more and more pronounced and the difficulty of maintaining his decorum likewise increased the ruddy color left his face which grew pale with effort i will do him the justice to say that the effort was heroic he whistled popular airs and snatches of the grand opera he relieved mr cooke of his glasses of which mr cooke had neglected to relieve himself and scanned the sea line busily but the inevitable deferred is frequently more violent than the inevitable taken gracefully and the confusion which at length overtook the celebrity was utter as his humiliation was complete we laid him beside mr cooke in the cockpit  the rain presently ceased and the wind hauled as is often the case to the northwest which began to clear while bear island rose from the northern horizon both farrar and i were surprised to see miss trevor come out she hooked back the cabin doors and surveyed the prostrate forms with amusement  we asked her about those inside  mrs cooke has really been very ill she said and miss thorn is doing all she can for her my father and i were more fortunate but you will both catch your deaths she exclaimed noticing our condition tell me where i can find your coats  i suppose it is natural for a man to enjoy being looked after in this way it was certainly a new sensation to farrar and myself we assured her we were drying out and did not need the coats but nevertheless she went back into the cabin and found them  miss thorn says you should both be whipped she remarked  when we had put on our coats miss trevor sat down and began to talk  i once heard of a man she began complacently a man that was buried alive and who contrived to dig himself up and then read his own epitaph it did not please him but he was wise and amended his life i have often thought how much it might help some people if they could read their own epitaphs  farrar was very quick at this sort of thing and now that the steering had become easier was only too glad to join her in worrying the celebrity but he if he were conscious gave no sign of it  they ought to be buried so that they could not dig themselves up he said the epitaphs would only strengthen their belief that they had lived in an unappreciative age  one i happen to have in mind however lives in an appreciative age most appreciative  and women are often epitaphmakers  you are hard on the sex mr farrar she answered but perhaps justly so and yet there are some women i know of who would not write an epitaph to his taste  farrar looked at her curiously  i beg your pardon he said  do not imagine i am touchy on the subject she replied quickly some of us are fortunate enough to have had our eyes opened  i thought the celebrity stirred uneasily  have you read the sybarites she asked  farrar was puzzled  no said he sententiously and i dont want to  i know the average man thinks it a disgrace to have read it and you may not believe me when i say that it is a strong story of its kind with a strong moral there are men who might read that book and be a great deal better for it and if they took the moral to heart it would prove every bit as effectual as their own epitaphs  he was not quite sure of her drift but he perceived that she was still making fun of mr allen  and the moral he inquired  well she said the best i can do is to give you a synopsis of the story and then you can judge of its fitness the hero is called victor desmond he is a young man of a sterling though undeveloped character who has been hampered by an indulgent parent with a large fortune desmond is a butterfly and sips life after the approved manner of his kindnow from bohemian glass now from vessels of gold and silver he chats with stage lights in their dressingrooms and attends a ball in the bowery or a supper at sherrys with a ready versatility the book apart from its intention really gives the middle classes an excellent idea of what is called highlife  it is some time before desmond discovers that he possesses the gift of parisa deliberation proving his lack of conceitthat wherever he goes he unwittingly breaks a heart and sometimes two or three this discovery is naturally so painful that he comes home to his chambers and throws himself on a lounge before his fire in a fit of selfdeprecation and reflects on a misspent and foolish life this mind you is where his character starts to develop and he makes a heroic resolve not to cut off his nose or to grow a beard nor get married but henceforth to live a life of usefulness and seclusion which was certainly considerate and furthermore if by any accident he ever again involved the affections of another girl he would marry her be she as ugly as sin or as poor as poverty then the heroine comes in her name is rosamond which sounds well and may be euphoniously coupled with desmond and with the single exception of a boardingschool girl she is the only young woman he ever thought of twice in order to save her and himself he goes away but the temptation to write to her overpowers him and of course she answers his letter this brings on a correspondence his letters take the form of confessions and are the fruits of much philosophical reflection inconstancy in woman he says because of the present social conditions is often pardonable in a man nothing is more despicable this is his cardinal principle and he sticks to it nobly for though he tires of rosamond who is quite attractive however he marries her and lives a life of selfdenial there are men who might take that story to heart  i was amused that she should give the passage quoted by the celebrity himself her double meaning was naturally lost on farrar but he enjoyed the thing hugely nevertheless as more or less applicable to mr allen i made sure that gentleman was sensible of what was being said though he scarcely moved a muscle and miss trevor with a mirthful glance at me that was not without a tinge of triumph jumped lightly to the deck and went in to see the invalids  we were now working up into the lee of the island whose tall pines stood clean and black against the red glow of the evening sky mr cooke began to give evidences of life and finally got up and overhauled one of the icechests for a restorative farrar put into the little cove where we dropped anchor and soon had the chief sufferers ashore and a delicate supper in the preparation of which miss thorn showed her ability as a cook soon restored them for my part i much preferred miss thorns dishes to those of the mohair chef and so did farrar and the four surprising as it may seem made themselves generally useful about the camp in pitching the tents under farrars supervision but the celebrity remained apart and silent     chapter xi  our first night in the bear island camp passed without incident and we all slept profoundly tired out by the labors of the day before after breakfast the four set out to explore with troutrods and shotguns bear island is with the exception of the cove into which we had put as nearly round as an island can be and perhaps three miles in diameter it has two clear brooks which owing to the comparative inaccessibility of the place still contain trout and grayling though there are few spots where a fly can be cast on account of the dense underbrush the woods contain partridge or ruffed grouse and other game in smaller quantities i believe my client entertained some notion of establishing a preserve here  the insults which had been heaped upon the celebrity on the yacht seemed to have raised rather than lowered him in miss thorns esteem for these two ensconced themselves among the pines above the camp with an edition de luxe of one of his works which she had brought along they were soon absorbed in one of those famous short stories of his with the ending left open to discussion mr cooke was indisposed he had not yet recovered from the shaking up his system had sustained and he took to a canvas easy chair he had brought with him and placed a decanter of scotch and a tumbler of ice at his side the efficacy of this remedy was assured and he demanded the bunch of newspapers he spied protruding from my pocket  the rest of us were engaged in various occupations mr trevor relating experiences of steamboat days on the ohio to mrs cooke miss trevor buried in a serial in the century and farrar and i taking an inventory of fishingtackle when we were startled by aloud and profane ejaculation mr cooke had hastily put down his glass and was staring at the newspaper before him with eyes as large as afterdinner coffeecups  come here he shouted over at us come here crocker he repeated seeing we were slow to move for gods sake come here  in obedience to this emphatic summons i crossed the stream and drew near to mr cooke who was busily pouring out another glass of whiskey to tide him over this strange excitement but as mr cooke was easily excited and on such occasions always drank whiskey to quiet his nerves i thought nothing of it he was sitting bolt upright and held out the paper to me with a shaking hand while he pointed to some headlines on the first page and this is what i read              treasurer takes a trip         charles wrexell allen of the miles standish       bicycle company gets off with 100000 dollars               detectives baffled          the absconder a back bay social leader  half way down the column was a picture of mr allen a cut made from a photograph and allowing for the crudities of newspaper reproduction it was a striking likeness of the celebrity underneath was a short description mr allen was five feet eleven the celebritys height had a straight nose square chin dark hair and eyes broad shoulders was dressed elaborately in brief tallied in every particular with the celebrity with the exception of the slight scar which allen was thought to have on his forehead  the situation and all its ludicrous possibilities came over me with a jump it was too good to be true had mr charles wrexell allen arrived at asquith and created a sensation with the man who stole his name i should have been amply satisfied but that mr allen had been obliging enough to abscond with a large sum of money was beyond dreaming  i glanced at the rest of it a history of the wellestablished company followed with all that mr allen had done for it the picture by the way had been obtained from the st paul agent of the bicycle after doing due credit to the treasurers abilities as a hustler there followed a summary of his character hitherto without reproach but his tastes were expensive ones mr allens tendency to extravagance had been noticed by the members of the miles standish company and some of the older directors had on occasions remonstrated with him but he had been too valuable a man to let go and it seems as treasurer he was trusted implicitly he was said to have more clothes than any man in boston  i am used to thinking quickly and by the time i had read this i had an idea  what in hell do you make of that crocker cried my client eyeing me closely and repeating the question again and again as was his wont when agitated  it is certainly plain enough i replied but i should like to talk to you before you decide to hand him over to the authorities  i thought i knew mr cooke and i was not mistaken  authorities he roared damn the authorities theres my yacht and theres the canadian border and he pointed to the north  the others were pressing around us by this time and had caught the significant words which mr cooke had uttered i imagine that if my client had stopped to think twice which of course is a preposterous condition he would have confided his discovery only to farrar and to me it was now out of the question to keep it from the rest of the party and mr trevor got the headlines over my shoulder i handed him the sheet  read it mr trevor said mrs cooke  mr trevor in a somewhat unsteady voice read the headlines and began the column and they followed breathless with astonishment and agitation once or twice the senator paused to frown upon the celebrity with a terrible sternness thus directing all other eyes to him his demeanor was a study in itself it may be surmised from what i have said of him that there was a strain of the actor in his composition and i am prepared to make an affidavit that secure in the knowledge that he had witnesses present to attest his identity he hugely enjoyed the sensation he was creating that he looked forward with a profound pleasure to the stir which the disclosure that he was the author of the sybarites would make his face wore a beatific smile  as mr trevor continued his voice became firmer and his manner more majestic it was a task distinctly to his taste and one might have thought he was reading the sentence of a hastings i was standing next to his daughter the look of astonishment perhaps of horror which i had seen on her face when her father first began to read had now faded into something akin to wickedness did she wink i cant say never before having had a young woman wink at me but the next moment her vinaigrette was rolling down the bank towards the brook and i was after it i heard her close behind me she must have read my intentions by a kind of mental telepathy  are you going to do it she whispered  of course i answered to miss such a chance would be a downright sin  there was a little awe in her laugh  miss thorn is the only obstacle i added and mr cooke is our hope i think he will go by me  dont let miss thorn worry you she said as we climbed back  what do you mean i demanded but she only shook her head we were at the top again and mr trevor was reading an appended despatch from buffalo stating that mr allen had been recognized there in the latter part of june walking up and down the platform of the station in a smokingjacket and that he had climbed on the chicago limited as it pulled out this may have caused the celebrity to feel a trifle uncomfortable  ha exclaimed mr trevor as he put down the paper mr cooke do you happen to have any handcuffs on the maria  but my client was pouring out a stiff helping from the decanter which he still held in his hand then he approached the celebrity  dont let it worry you old man said he with intense earnestness dont let it worry you youre my guest and ill see you safe out of it or bust  fenelon said mrs cooke gravely do you realize what you are saying  youre a clever one allen my client continued and he backed away the better to look him over you had nerve to stay as long as you did  the celebrity laughed confidently  cooke he replied i appreciate your generosityi really do i know no offence is meant the mistake is in fact most pardonable  in mr cooke amazement and admiration were clamoring for utterance  damn me he sputtered if youre not the coolest embezzler i ever saw  the celebrity laughed again then he surveyed the circle  my friends he said this is certainly a most amazing coincidence one which i assure you surprises me no less than it does you you have no doubt remarked that i have my peculiarities we all have  i flatter thyself i am not entirely unknown and the annoyances imposed upon me by a certain fame i have achieved had become such that some months ago i began to crave the pleasures of the life of a private man i determined to go to some sequestered resort where my face was unfamiliar the possibility of being recognized at asquith did not occur to me fortunately i was and a singular chance led me to take the name of the man who has committed this crime and who has the misfortune to resemble me i suppose that now he added impressively i shall have to tell you who i am  he paused until these words should have gained their full effect then he held up the edition de luxe from which he and miss thorn had been reading  you may have heard mrs cooke said he addressing himself to our hostess you may perhaps have heard of the author of this book  mrs cooke was a calm woman and she read the name on the cover  yes she said i have and you claim to be he  ask my friend crocker here he answered carelessly no doubt exulting that the scene was going off so dramatically i should indeed be in a tight box he went on if there were not friends of mine here to help me out  they turned to me  i am afraid i cannot i said with what soberness i could  what says he with a start what you deny me  miss trevor had her tongue in her cheek i bowed  i am powerless to speak mr allen i replied  during this colloquy my client stood between us looking from one to the other i well knew that his way of thinking would be with my testimony and that the gilt name on the edition de luxe had done little towards convincing him of mr allens innocence to his mind there was nothing horrible or incongruous in the idea that a wellknown author should be a defaulter it was perfectly possible he shoved the glass of scotch towards the celebrity with a smile  take this old man he kindly insisted and youll feel better whats the use of bucking when youre saddled with a thing like that and he pointed to the paper besides they havent caught you yet by a damned sight  the celebrity waved aside the proffered tumbler  this is an infamous charge and you know it crocker he cried if you dont you ought to as a lawyer this isnt any time to have fun with a fellow  my dear sir i said i have charged you with nothing whatever  he turned his back on me in complete disgust and he came face to face with miss trevor  miss trevor too knows something of me he said  you forget mr allen she answered sweetly you forget that i have given you my promise not to reveal what i know  the celebrity chafed for this was as damaging a statement as could well be uttered against him but miss thorn was his trump card and she now came forward  this is ridiculous mr crocker simply ridiculous said she  i agree with you most heartily miss thorn i replied  nonsense exclaimed miss thorn and she drew her lips together pure nonsense  nonsense or not marian mr cooke interposed we are wasting valuable time the police are already on the scent ill bet my hat  fenelon mrs cooke remonstrated  and do you mean to say in soberness uncle fenelon that you believe the author of the sybarites to be a defaulter said miss thorn  it is indeed hard to believe mr allen a criminal mr trevor broke in for the first time i think it only right that he should be allowed to clear himself before he is put to further inconvenience and perhaps injustice by any action we may take in the matter  mr cooke sniffed suspiciously at the word action  what action do you mean he demanded  well replied mr trevor with some hesitation before we take any steps that is notify the police  notify the police cried my client his face red with a generous anger i have never yet turned a guest over to the police he said proudly and wont not if i know it im not that kind  who shall criticise mr cookes code of morality  fenelon said his wife you must remember you have never yet entertained a guest of a larcenous character no embezzlers up to the present marian she continued turning to miss thorn you spoke as if you might be able to throw some light upon this matter do you know whether this gentleman is charles wrexell allen or whether he is the author in short do you know who he is  the celebrity lighted a cigarette miss thorn said indignantly upon my word aunt maria i thought that you at least would know better than to credit this silly accusation he has been a guest at your house and i am astonished that you should doubt his word  mrs cooke looked at her niece perplexedly  you must remember marian she said gently that i know nothing about him where he came from or who he is nor does any one at asquith except perhaps miss trevor by her own confession and you do not seem inclined to tell what you know if indeed you know anything  upon this miss thorn became more indignant still and mrs cooke went on gentlemen as a rule do not assume names especially other peoples they are usually proud of their own mr allen appears among us from the clouds as it were and in due time we learn from a newspaper that he has committed a defalcation and furthermore the paper contains a portrait and an accurate description which put the thing beyond doubt i ask you is it reasonable for him to state coolly after all this that he is another man that he is a wellknown author its an absurdity i was not born yesterday my dear  it is most reasonable under the circumstances replied miss thorn warmly extraordinary of course its extraordinary and too long to explain to a prejudiced audience who cant be expected to comprehend the character of a genius to understand the yearning of a famous man for a little quiet  mrs cooke looked grave  marian you forget yourself she said  oh i am tired of it aunt maria cried miss thorn if he takes my advice he will refuse to discuss it farther  she did not seem to be aware that she had put forth no argument whatever save a womans argument and i was intensely surprised that her indignation should have got the better of her in this way having always supposed her clearheaded in the extreme a few words from her such as i supposed she would have spoken had set the celebrity right with all except mr cooke to me it was a clear proof that the celebrity had turned her head and her mind with it  the silence was broken by an uncontrollable burst of laughter from miss trevor she was quickly frowned down by her father who reminded her that this was not a comedy  and mr allen he said if you have anything to say or any evidence to bring forward now is the time to do it  he appeared to forget that i was the district attorney  the celebrity had seated himself on the trunk of a tree and was blowing out the smoke in clouds he was inclined to take miss thorns advice for he made a gesture of weariness with his cigarette in the use of which he was singularly eloquent  tell me mr trevor said he why i should sit before you as a tribunal why i should take the trouble to clear myself of a senseless charge my respect for you inclines me to the belief that you are laboring under a momentary excitement for when you reflect that i am a prominent not to say famous author you will realize how absurd it is that i should be an embezzler and why i decline to lower myself by an explanation  mr trevor picked up the paper and struck it  do you refuse to say anything in the face of such evidence as that he cried  it is not a matter for refusal mr trevor it is simply that i cannot admit the possibility of having committed the crime  well sir said the senator his black necktie working out of place as his anger got the better of him i am to believe then because you claim to be the author of a few society novels that you are infallible let me tell you that the president of the united states himself is liable to impeachment and bound to disprove any charge he may be accused of what in halifax do i care for your divinerightofauthors theory ill continue to think you guilty until you are shown to be innocent  suddenly the full significance of the celebritys tactics struck mr cooke and he reached out and caught hold of mr trevors coattails hold on old man said he allen isnt going to be ass enough to own up to it dont you see wed all be jugged and fined for assisting a criminal over the border its out of consideration for us  mr trevor looked sternly over his shoulder at mr cooke  do you mean to say sir seriously he asked that for the sake of a misplaced friendship for this man and a misplaced sense of honor you are bound to shield a guest though a criminal that you intend to assist him to escape from justice i insist for my own protection and that of my daughter as well as for that of the others present that since he refuses to speak we must presume him guilty and turn him over  mr trevor turned to mrs cooke as if relying on her support  fenelon said she i have never sought to influence your actions when your friends were concerned and i shall not begin now all i ask of you is to consider the consequences of your intention  these words from mrs cooke had much more weight with my client than mr trevors blustering demands  maria my dear he said with a deferential urbanity mr allen is my guest and a gentleman when a gentleman gives his word that he is not a criminal it is sufficient  the force of this for some reason did not overwhelm his wife and her lip curled a little half in contempt half in risibility  pshaw fenelon said she what a fraud you are why is it you wish to get mr allen over the border then a question which might well have staggered a worthier intellect  why my dear answered my client i wish to save mr allen the inconvenience not to say the humiliation of being brought east in custody and strapped with a pair of handcuffs let him take a shooting trip to the great northwest until the real criminal is caught  well fenelon replied mrs cooke unable to repress a smile one might as well try to argue with a turnstile or a weathervane i wash my hands of it  but mr trevor who was both a selfmade man and a western politician was far from being satisfied he turned to me with a sweep of the arm he had doubtless learned in the ohio state senate  mr crocker he cried are you as attorney of this district going to aid and abet in the escape of a fugitive from justice  mr trevor said i i will take the course in this matter which seems fit to me and without advice from any one  he wheeled on farrar repeated the question and got a like answer  brought to bay for a time he glared savagely around him while groping for further arguments  but at this point the four appeared on the scene much the worse for thickets and clamoring for luncheon they had five small fish between them which they wanted miss thorn to cook     chapter xii  the four received mr cookes plan for the celebritys escape to canada with enthusiastic acclamation and as the one thing lacking to make the bear island trip a complete success the celebrity was hailed with the reverence due to the man who puts up the ringmoney in a prizefight he was accorded too a certain amount of respect as a defaulter which the four would have denied him as an author for i am inclined to the belief that the discovery of his literary profession would have lowered him rather than otherwise in their eyes my client was naturally anxious to get under way at once for the canadian border but was overruled in this by his henchmen who demanded something to eat we sat down to an impromptu meal which was an odd affair indeed mrs cooke maintained her usual serenity but said little while miss trevor and i had many a mirthful encounter at the thought of the turn matters had taken  at the other end of the cloth were mr cooke and the four in wonderful spirits and unimpaired appetite and in their midst sat the celebrity likewise in wonderful spirits his behavior now and again elicited a loud grunt of disapproval from mr trevor who was plying his knife and fork in a manner emblematic of his state of mind mr allen was laughing and joking airily with mr cooke and the guests denying but not resenting their accusations with all the sang froid of a hardened criminal he did not care particularly to go to canada he said why should he when he was innocent but if mr cooke insisted he would enjoy seeing that part of the lake and the canadian side  afterwards i perceived miss thorn down by the brookside washing dishes her sleeves were drawn back to the elbow and a dainty white apron covered her blue skirt while the wind from the lake had disentangled errant wisps of her hair i stood on the brink above secure as i thought from observation when she chanced to look up and spied me  mr crocker she called would you like to make yourself useful  i was decidedly embarrassed her manner was as frank and unconstrained as though i had not been shunning her for weeks past  if such a thing is possible i replied  do you know a dishcloth when you see one  i was doubtful but i procured the cloth from miss trevor and returned there was an air about miss thorn that was new to me  what an uncompromising man you are mr crocker she said to me once a person is unfortunate enough to come under the ban of your disapproval you have nothing whatever to do with them now it seems that i have given you offence in some way is it not so  you magnify my importance i said  no temporizing mr crocker she went on as though she meant to be obeyed sit down there and lets have it out i like you too well to quarrel with you  there was no resisting such a command and i threw myself on the pebbles at her feet  i thought we were going to be great friends she said you and mr farrar were so kind to me on the night of my arrival and we had such fun watching the dance together  i confess i thought so too but you expressed opinions then that i shared you have since changed your mind for some unaccountable reason  she paused in her polishing a shining dish in her hand and looked down at me with something between a laugh and a frown  i suppose you have never regretted speaking hastily she said  many a time i returned warming but if i ever thought a judgment measured and distilled it was your judgment of the celebrity  does the study of law eliminate humanity she asked with a mock curtsey the deliberate sentences are sometimes the unjust ones and men who are hung by weighed wisdom are often the innocent  that is all very well in cases of doubt but here you have the evidences of wrongdoing directly before you  three dishes were taken up dried and put down before she answered me i threw pebbles into the brook and wished i had held my tongue  what evidence inquired she well said i i must finish i suppose i had a notion you knew of what i inferred first let me say that i have no desire to prejudice you against a person whom you admire  impossible  something in her tone made me look up  very good then i answered i for one can have no use for a man who devotes himself to a girl long enough to win her affections and then deserts her with as little compunction as a dog does a rat it has shaken and that is how your celebrity treated miss trevor  but miss trevor has recovered i believe said miss thorn  i began to feel a deep but helpless insecurity  happily yes i assented  thanks to an excellent physician  a smile twitched the corners of her mouth as though she enjoyed my discomfiture i remarked for the fiftieth time how strong her face was with its generous lines and clearly moulded features and a suspicion entered my soul  at any rate i said with a laugh the celebrity has got himself into no end of a predicament now he may go back to new york in custody  i thought you incapable of resentment mr crocker how mean of you to deny him  it can do no harm i answered a little lesson in the dangers of incognito may be salutary i wish it were a little lesson in the dangers of something else  the color mounted to her face as she resumed her occupation  i am afraid you are a very wicked man she said  before i could reply there came a scuffling sound from the bank above us and the snapping of branches and twigs it was mr cooke his descent the personal conduction of which he lost halfway down was irregular and spasmodic and a rude concussion at the bottom knocked off a choice bit of profanity which was balanced on the tip of his tongue  tobogganing is a little out of season said his niece laughing heartily  mr cooke brushed himself off picked up the glasses which he had dropped in his flight and pushed them into my hands then he pointed lakeward with bulging eyes  crocker old man he said in a loud whisper they tell me that is an asquith catboat  i followed his finger and saw for the first time a sailboat headed for the island then about two miles off shore i raised the glasses  yes i said the scimitar  thats what farrar said cried he  and what about it i asked  what about it he ejaculated why its a detective come for allen i knew sure as hell if they got as far as asquith they wouldnt stop there and thats the fastest sailboat he could hire there isnt it  i replied that it was he seized me by the shoulder and began dragging me up the bank  what are you going to do i cried shaking myself loose  weve got to get on the maria and run for it he panted there is no time to be lost  he had reached the top of the bank and was running towards the group at the tents and he actually infused me with some of his redhot enthusiasm for i hastened after him  but you cant begin to get the maria out before they will be in here i shouted  he stopped short gazed at the approaching boat and then at me  is that so  yes of course said i they will be here in ten minutes  the celebrity stood in the midst of the excited four his hair was parted precisely and he had induced a monocle to remain in his eye long enough to examine the scimitar his nose at the critical elevation this unruffled exterior made a deep impression on the four was the celebrity not undergoing the crucial test of a true sport he was an example alike to criminals and philosophers  mr cooke hurried into the group which divided respectfully for him and grasped the celebrity by the hand  something else has got to be done old man he said in a voice which shook with emotion theyll be on us before we can get the maria out  farrar who was nailing a rustic bench near by straightened up at this his lip curling with a desire to laugh  the celebrity laid his hand on my clients shoulder  cooke said he im deeply grateful for all the trouble you wish to take and for the solicitude you have shown but let things be ill come out of it all right  never cried cooke looking proudly around the four as some highland chief might have surveyed a faithful clan id a damned sight rather go to jail myself  a damned sight echoed the four in unison  i insist cooke said the celebrity taking out his eyeglass and tapping mr cookes purple necktie i insist that you drop this business i repeat my thanks to you and these gentlemen for the friendship they have shown but say again that i am as innocent of this crime as a baby  mr cooke paid no attention to this speech his face became radiant  didnt any of you fellows strike a cave or a hollow tree or something of that sort knocking around this morning  one man slapped his knee  the very place he cried i fell into it and he showed a rent in his trousers corroboratively its big enough to hold twenty of allen and the detective doesnt live that could find it  hustle him off quick said mr cooke  the mandate was obeyed as literally as though robin hood himself had given it the celebrity disappeared into the forest carried rather than urged towards his destined place of confinement  the commotion had brought mr trevor to the spot he caught sight of the celebritys back between the trees then he looked at the catboat entering the cove a man in the stern preparing to pull in the tender  he intercepted mr cooke on his way to the beach  what have you done with mr allen he asked in a menacing voice  good god said mr cooke whose contempt for mr trevor was now infinite you talk as if i were the governor of the state what the devil could i do with him  i will have no evasion replied mr trevor taking an imposing posture in front of him you are trying to defeat the ends of justice by assisting a dangerous criminal to escape i have warned you sir and warn you again of the consequences of your meditated crime and i give you my word i will do all in my power to frustrate it  mr cooke dug his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets here was a complication he had not looked for the scimitar lay at anchor with her sail down and two men were coming ashore in the tender mr cookes attitude being that of a man who reconsiders a rash resolve mr trevor was emboldened to say in a moderated tone  you were carried away by your generosity mr cooke i was sure when you took time to think you would see it in another light  mr cooke started off for the place where the boat had grounded i did not catch his reply and probably should not have written it here if i had the senator looked as if he had been sandbagged  the two men jumped out of the boat and hauled it up mr cooke waved an easy salute to one whom i recognized as the big boatman from asquith familiarly known as captain jay he owned the scimitar and several smaller boats the captain went through the pantomime of an introduction between mr cooke and the other whom my client shook warmly by the hand and presently all three came towards us  mr cooke led them to a bar he had improvised by the brook a pool served the office of refrigerator and mr cooke had devised an ingenious but complicated arrangement of strings and labels which enabled him to extract any bottle or set of bottles without having to bare his arm and pull out the lot farrar and i responded to the call he had given and went down to assist in the entertainment my client with his back to us was busy manipulating the strings  gentlemen he said let me make you acquainted with mr drew you all know the captain  had i not suspected mr drews profession i think i should not have remarked that he gave each of us a keen look as he raised his head he had reddishbrown hair and a pair of bushy red whiskers each of which tapered to a long point he was broad in the shoulders and the clothes he wore rather enhanced this breadth his suit was gray and almost new the trousers perceptibly bagging at the knee and he had a felt hat a necktie of the white and flowery pattern and squaretoed congress boots in short he was a decidedly ordinary looking person you would meet a hundred like him in the streets of far harbor and beaverton he might have been a prosperous business man in either of those townsa comfortable lumber merchant or mine owner and he had chosen just the getup i should have picked for detective work in that region he had a pleasant eye and a very fetching and hearty manner but his long whiskers troubled me especially i kept wondering if they were real  the captain is sailing mr drew over to far harbor explained mr cooke and they have put in here for the night  mr drew was plainly not an amateur for he volunteered nothing further than this the necessary bottles having been produced mr cooke held up his glass and turned to the stranger  welcome to our party old man said he  mr drew drained his glass and complimented mr cooke on the branda sure key to my clients heart whereupon he seated himself between mr drew and the captain and began a discourse on the subject of his own cellar on which he talked for nearly an hour his only pauses were for the worthy purpose of filling the detectives or the captains glass and these he watched with a hospitable solicitude the captain had the advantage three to one and i made no doubt his employer bitterly regretted not having a boatman whose principles were more strict at the end of the hour captain jay who by nature was inclined to be taciturn and crabbed waxed loquacious and even jovial he sang us the songs he had learned in the winter lumbercamps which mr cooke never failed to encore to the echo my client vowed he had not spent a pleasanter afternoon for years he plied the captain with cigars and explained to him the mystery of the strings and labels and the captain experimented until he had broken some of the bottles  mr cooke was not a person who made any great distinction between the three degrees acquaintance friendship and intimacy when a stranger pleased him he went from one to the other with such comparative ease that a hardhearted man and no other could have resented his advances mr drew was anything but a hardhearted man and he did not object to my clients familiarity mr cooke made no secret of his admiration for mr drew and there were just two things about him that mr cooke admired and wondered at above all elsethe bushy red whiskers but it appeared that these were the only things that mr drew was really touchy about i noticed that the detective without being impolite did his best to discourage these remarks but my client knew no such word as discouragement he was continually saying i think ill grow some like that old man or have those cut and the likea kind of humor in which the captain took an incredible delight and finally when a certain pitch of good feeling had been arrived at mr cooke reached out and playfully grabbed hold of the one near him the detective drew back mr cooke said he with dignity ill have to ask you to let my whiskers alone  certainly old man replied my client anything but abashed youll pardon me but they seemed too good to be true i congratulate you on them  i was amused as well as alarmed at this piece of boldness but the incident passed off without any disagreeable results except perhaps a slight nervousness noticeable in the detective and this soon disappeared as the sun grew low the celebritys conductors straggled in with fishingrods and told of an afternoons sport and we left the captain peacefully but sonorously slumbering on the bank  crocker said my client to me afterwards they didnt feel like the real homegrown article but arent they damned handsome     chapter xiii  after supper captain jay was rowed out and put to bed in his own bunk on the scimitar then we heaped together a huge pile of the driftwood on the beach and raised a blazing beacon the red light of which i doubt not could be seen from the mainland the men made prongs from the soft wood while miss thorn produced from the stores some large tins of marshmallows  the memory of that evening lingers with me yet the fire colored everything the waves dashed in ruby foam at our feet and even the tall frowning pines at our backs were softened the sting was gone out of the keen night wind from the north i found a place beside the gray cape i had seen for the first time the night of the cotillon i no longer felt any great dislike for miss thorn let it be known resentment was easier when the distance between mohair and asquith separated usimpossible on a yachting excursion but why should i be justifying myself  mr cooke and the four in addition to other accomplishments possessed excellent voices and mr drew sang a bass which added much to the melody one of the four played a banjo it is only justice to mr drew to say that he seemed less like a detective than any man i have ever met he told a good story and was quick at repartee and after a while the music by tacit consent was abandoned for the sake of hearing him talk he related how he had worked up the lake point by point from beaverton to asquith and lightened his narrative with snappy accounts of the different boatmen he had run across and of the different predicaments into which he had fallen his sketches were so vivid that mr cooke forgot to wink at me after a while and sat spellbound while i marvelled at the imaginative faculty he displayed he had us in roars of laughter his stories were far from incredible and he looked less like a liar than a detective he showed too an accurate and astonishing knowledge of the lake which could hardly have been acquired in any other way than the longshore trip he had described not once did he hint of a special purpose which had brought him to the island and it was growing late the fire died down upon the stones and the thought of the celebrity alone in a dark cave in the middle of the island began to prey upon me i was not designed for a practical joker and i take it that pity is a part of every selfrespecting mans composition in the cool of the night season the ludicrous side of the matter did not appeal to me quite as strongly as in the glare of day a joke should never be pushed to cruelty it was in vain that i argued i had no direct hand in the concealing of him i felt my responsibility quite as heavy upon me perhaps bears still remained in these woods and if a bear should devour the author of the sybarites would the world ever forgive me could i ever repay the debt to the young women of these united states to speak truth i expected every moment to see him appear why in the name of all his works did he stay there nothing worse could befall him than to go to far harbor with drew where our words concerning his identity would be taken and what an advertisement this would be for the great author the sybarites now selling by thousands would increase its sales to ten thousands ah there was the rub the clue to his remaining in the cave was this very kink in the celebritys character there was nothing bohemian in that character it yearned after the eminently respectable its very eccentricities were within the limits of good form the celebrity shunned the biscuits and beer of the literary clubs and his books were bound for the boudoir to have it proclaimed in the sensational journals that the hands of this choice being had been locked for grand larceny was a thought too horrible to entertain his very manservant would have cried aloud against it better a hundred nights in a cave than one such experience  miss trevors behavior that evening was so unrestful as to lead me to believe that she too was going through qualms of sympathy for the victim as we were breaking up for the evening she pulled my sleeve  dont you think we have carried our joke a little too far mr crocker she whispered uneasily i cant bear to think of him in that terrible place  it will do him a world of good i replied assuming a gayety i did not feel it is not pleasant to reflect that some day ones own folly might place one in alike situation and the night was dismally cool and windy now that the fire had gone out miss trevor began to philosophize  such practical pleasantries as this she said are like infernal machines they often blow up the people that start them and they are next to impossible to steer  perhaps it is just as well not to assume we are the instruments of providence i said  here we ran into miss thorn who was carrying a lantern  i have been searching everywhere for you two mischiefmakers said she you ought to be ashamed of yourselves heaven only knows how this little experiment will end here is aunt maria usually serene on the verge of hysterics she says he shouldnt stay in that damp cave another minute here is your father irene organizing relief parties and walking the floor of his tent like a madman and here is uncle fenelon insane over the idea of getting the poor innocent man into canada and here is a detective saddled upon us perhaps for days and uncle fenelon has gotten his boatman drunk you ought to be ashamed of yourselves she repeated  miss trevor laughed in spite of the gravity of these things and so did i  oh come marian said she it isnt as bad as all that and you talk as if you hadnt anything to be reproached for your own defence of the celebrity wasnt as strong as it might have been  by the light of the lantern i saw miss thorn cast one meaning look at miss trevor  what are you going to do about it asked miss thorn addressing me think of that unhappy man without a bed without blankets without even a toothbrush  he hasnt been wholly off my mind i answered truthfully but there isnt anything we can do tonight with that beastly detective to notice it  then you must go very early tomorrow morning before the detective gets up  i couldnt help smiling at the notion of getting up before a detective  i am only too willing i said  it must be by four oclock miss thorn went on energetically and we must have a guide we can trust arrange it with one of uncle fenelons friends  we i repeated  you certainly dont imagine that i am going to be left behind said miss thorn  i made haste to invite for the expedition one of the four who was quite willing to go and we got together all the bodily comforts we could think of and put them in a hamper the fraction not forgetting to add a few bottles from mr cookes immersed bar  long after the camp had gone to bed i lay on the pineneedles above the brook shielded from the wind by a break in the slope and thought of the strange happenings of that day presently the waning moon climbed reluctantly from the waters and the stream became mottled black and white the trees tall blurs the lake rose and fell with a mighty rhythm and the little brook hurried madly over the stones to join it one thought chased another from my brain  at such times when ones consciousness of outer things is dormant an earthquake might continue for some minutes without one realizing it i did not observe though i might have seen from where i lay the flap of one of the tents drawn back and two figures emerge they came and stood on the bank above under the tree which sheltered me and i experienced a curious phenomenon i heard and understood and remembered the first part of the conversation which passed between them and did not know it  i am sorry to disturb you said one  not at all said the other whose tone i thought afterwards betokened surprise and no great cheerfulness  but i have had no other opportunity to speak with you  no said the other rather uneasily  suddenly my senses were alert and i knew that mr trevor had pulled the detective out of bed the senator had no doubt anticipated an easier time and he now began feeling for an opening more than once he cleared his throat to commence while mr drew pulled his scant clothing closer about him his whiskers playing in the breeze  in cincinnati mr drew said mr trevor at length i am a known if not an influential citizen and i have served my state for three terms in its senate  i have visited your city mr trevor answered mr drew his teeth chattering audibly and i know you by reputation  then sir mr trevor continued with a flourish which appeared absolutely grotesque in his attenuated costume it must be clear to you that i cannot give my consent to a flagrant attempt by an unscrupulous person to violate the laws of this country  your feelings are to be respected sir  mr trevor cleared his throat again discretion is always to be observed mr drew and i who have been in the public service know the full value of it  mr trevor leaned forward at the same time glancing anxiously up at the tree for fear perhaps that mr cooke might be concealed therein he said in a stage whisper  a criminal is concealed on this island  drew started perceptibly  yes said mr trevor with a glance of triumph at having produced an impression on a detective i thought it my duty to inform you he has been hidden by the followers of the unscrupulous person i referred to in a cave i believe i repeat sir as a man of unimpeachable standing i considered it my duty to tell you  you have my sincere thanks mr trevor said drew holding out his hand and i shall act on the suggestion  mr trevor clasped the hand of the detective and they returned quietly to their respective tents and in course of time i followed them wondering how this incident might affect our mornings expedition     chapter xiv  my first thought on rising was to look for the detective the touch of the coming day was on the lake and i made out the two boats dimly riding on the dead swell and tugging idly at their chains the detective had been assigned to a tent which was occupied by mr cooke and the four and they were sleeping soundly at my entrance but drews blankets were empty i hurried to the beach but the scimitars boat was still drawn up there near the marias tender proving that he was still on the island  outside of the ladies tent i came upon miss thorn stowing a large basket i told her that we had taken that precaution the night before  what did you put in she demanded  i enumerated the articles as best i could and when i had finished she said  and i am filling this with the things you have forgotten  i lost no time in telling her what i had overheard the night before and that the detective was gone from his tent she stopped her packing and looked at me in concern  he is probably watching us she said do you think we had better go  i thought it could do no harm if we are followed said i all we have to do is to turn back  miss trevor came out as i spoke and our conductor appeared bending under the hamper i shouldered some blankets and the basket and we started we followed a rough path evidently cut by a camping party in some past season but now overgrown the fraction marched ahead and i formed the rear guard several times it seemed to me as though someone were pushing after us and more than once we halted i put down the basket and went back to reconnoitre once i believed i saw a figure flitting in the gray light but i set it down to my imagination  finally we reached a brook sneaking along beneath the underbrush as though fearing to show itself and we followed its course branches lashed our faces and brambles tore our clothes and then as the sunlight was filtering through and turning the brook from blue to crystal we came upon the celebrity he was seated in a little open space on the bank apparently careless of capture he did not even rise at our approach his face showed the effect of a sleepless night and wore an expression inimical to all mankind the conductor threw his bundle on the bank and laid his hand on the celebritys shoulder  halloa old man said he cheerily you must have had a hard night of it but we couldnt make you any sooner because that hawk of an officer had his eye on us  the celebrity shook himself free and in place of the gratitude for which the fraction had looked and which he had every reason to expect he got something different  this outrage has gone far enough said the celebrity with a terrible calmness the fraction was a man of the world  come come old chap he said soothingly dont cut up well make things a little more homelike here and he pulled a bottle from the depths of the hamper this will brace you up  he picked up the hamper and disappeared into the place of retention while the celebrity threw the bottle into the brush and just then may i be forgiven if i am imaginative i heard a human laugh come from that direction in the casting of that bottle the celebrity had given vent to some of the feelings he had been collecting overnight and it must have carried about thirty yards i dived after it like a retriever puppy for a stone but the bottle was gone perhaps i could say more but it doesnt do to believe in yourself too thoroughly when you get up early i had nothing to say when i returned  you here crocker said the author fixing his eye on me deuced kind of you to get up so early and carry a basket so far for me  it has been a real pleasure i assure you i protested and it had there was a silent space while the two young ladies regarded him softened by his haggard and dishevelled aspect and perplexed by his attitude nothing i believe appeals to a woman so much as this very lack of bodily care and the rogue knew it  how long is this little game of yours to continuethis bullbaiting he inquired how long am i to be made a butt of for the amusement of a lot of imbeciles  miss thorn crossed over and seated herself on the ground beside him you must be sensible she said in a tone that she might have used to a spoiled child i know it is difficult after the night you have had but you have always been willing to listen to reason  a pang of something went through me when i saw them together reason said the celebrity raising his head reason yes but where is the reason in all this because a man who happens to be my double commits a crime is it right that i whose reputation is without a mark should be made to suffer and why have i been made a fool of by two people whom i had every cause to suppose my friends  you will have to ask them replied miss thorn with a glance at us they are mischiefmakers ill admit but they are not malicious see what they have done this morning and how could they have foreseen that a detective was on his way to the island  crocker might have known it said he melting hes so cursed smart  and think miss thorn continued quick to follow up an advantage think what would have happened if they hadnt denied you this horrid man would have gone off with you to asquith or somewhere else with handcuffs on your wrists for it isnt a detectives place to take evidence mr crocker says perhaps we should all have had to go to epsom and i couldnt bear to see you in handcuffs you know  dont you think we had better leave them alone i said to miss trevor  she smiled and shook her head  you are blind as a bat mr crocker she said  the celebrity had weighed miss thorns words and was listening passively now while she talked there may be talents which she did not possess i will not pretend to say but i know there are many professions she might have chosen had she not been a woman she would have made a name for herself at the bar as a public speaker she would have excelled and had i not been so long accustomed to picking holes in arguments i am sure i should not have perceived the fallacies of this she was making for the benefit of the celebrity he surely did not it is strange how a man can turn under such influence from one feeling to another the celebrity lost his resentment apprehension took its place he became more and more nervous questioned me from time to time on the law wished to know whether he would be called upon for testimony at allens trial whether there was any penalty attached to the taking of another mans name precisely what drew would do with him if captured and the tail of his eye was on the thicket as he made this inquiry it may be surmised that i took an exquisite delight in quenching this newborn thirst for knowledge and finally we all went into the cave  miss thorn unpacked the things we had brought while i surveyed the cavern it was in the solid rock some ten feet high and irregular in shape and perfectly dry it was a marvel to me how cosy she made it one of the marias lanterns was placed in a niche and the celebritys silver toiletset laid out on a ledge of the rock which answered perfectly for a dressingtable miss thorn had not forgotten a small mirror and as a last office set a dainty breakfast on a linen napkin on the rock heating the coffee in a chafingdish  there she exclaimed surveying her labors i hope you will be more comfortable  he had already taken the precaution to brush his hair and pull himself together his thanks such as they were he gave to miss thorn it is true that she had done more than any one else  goodbye old boy said the fraction well come back when we get the chance and dont let that hundred thousand keep you awake  the fraction and i covered up the mouth of the cave with brush he became confidential  lucky dog allen he said theyll never get him away from cooke and he can have any girl he wants for the asking by george i believe miss thorn will elope with him if he ever reaches canada  i only mention this as a sample of the fractions point of view i confess the remark annoyed me at the time  miss thorn lingered in the cave for a minute after miss trevor came out then we retraced our way down the brook which was dancing now in the sunlight miss trevor stopped now and then to rest in reality to laugh i do not know what the fraction thought of such heartless conduct he and i were constantly on the alert for mr drew but we sighted the camp without having encountered him it was halfpast six and we had trusted to slip in unnoticed by any one but as we emerged from the trees the bustling scene which greeted our eyes filled us with astonishment two of the tents were down and the third in a collapsed condition while confusion reigned supreme and in the midst of it all stood mr cooke an animated central figure pedestalled on a stump giving emphatic directions in a voice of authority he spied us from his elevated position before we had crossed the brook  here they come maria he shouted  we climbed to the top of the slope and were there confronted by mrs cooke and mr trevor with mr cooke close behind them  where the devil is allen my client demanded excitedly of the fraction  allen repeated that gentleman why we made him comfortable and left him of course we had sense enough not to bring him here to be pulled  but you damfool cried mr cooke slightly forgetting himself drew has escaped  escaped  yes escaped said mr cooke as though our conductor were personally responsible he got away this morning before we know it well have the whole police force of far harbor out here to jug the lot of us  the fraction being deficient for the moment in language proper to express his appreciation of this new development simply volunteered to return for the celebrity and left in a great hurry  irene said mr trevor can it be possible that you have stolen away for the express purpose of visiting this criminal  if he is a criminal father it is no reason that he should starve  it is no reason cried her father hotly why a young girl who has been brought up as you have should throw every ladylike instinct to the winds there are men enough in this camp to keep him from starving i will not have my daughters name connected with that of a defaulter irene you have set the seal of disgrace upon a name which i have labored for a lifetime to make one of the proudest in the land and it was my fond hope that i possessed a daughter who  during this speech my anger had been steadily rising but it was mrs cooke who interrupted him  mr trevor said she perhaps you are not aware that while you are insulting your daughter you are also insulting my niece it may be well for you to know that miss trevor still has my respect as a woman and my admiration as a lady and since she has been so misjudged by her father she has my deepest sympathy but i wish to beg of you if you have anything of this nature to say to her you will take her feelings into consideration as well as ours  miss trevor gave her one expressive look of gratitude the senator was effectually silenced he had come by some inexplicable inference to believe that mrs cooke while subservient to the despotic will of her husband had been miraculously saved from depravity and had set her face against this last monumental act of outlawry     volume 4     chapter xv  i am convinced that mr cooke possessed at least some of the qualities of a great general in certain campaigns of past centuries and even of this it has been heroworship that impelled the rank and file rather than any high sympathy with the cause they were striving for and so it was with us that morning our commander was everywhere at once encouraging us to work and holding over us in impressive language the awful alternative of capture for he had the art in a high degree of inoculating his followers with the spirit which animated him and shortly to my great surprise i found myself working as though my life depended on it i certainly did not care very much whether the celebrity was captured or not and yet with the prospect of getting him over the border i had not thought of breakfast farrar had a natural inclination for work of this sort but even he was infused somewhat with the contagious haste and enthusiasm which filled the air and together we folded the tents with astonishing despatch and rowed them out to the maria mr cooke having gone to his knees in the water to shove the boat off  what are we doing this for said farrar to me as we hoisted the sail  we both laughed  i have just been asking myself that question i replied  you are a nice district attorney crocker he said you have made a most proper and equitable decision in giving your consent to allens escape doesnt your conscience smart  not unbearably ill tell you what farrar said i the truth is that this fellow never embezzled so much as a tencent piece he isnt guilty he isnt the man  isnt the man repeated farrar  no i answered its a long tale and no time to tell it now but he is really as he claims to be the author of all those detestable books we have been hearing so much of  the deuce he is exclaimed farrar dropping the stopper he was tying did he write the sybarites  yes sir he wrote the sybarites and all the rest of that trash  hes the fellow that maintains a man ought to marry a girl after he has become engaged to her  exactly i said smiling at his way of putting it  preaches constancy to all men but doesnt object to stealing  i laughed  youre badly mixed i explained i told you he never stole anything he was only ass enough to take the mans name who is the living image of him and the other man took the bonds  oh come now said he tell me something improbable while you are about it  its true i replied repressing my mirth true as the tale of timothy i knew him when he was a mere boy but i dont give you that as a proof for he might have become all things to all men since ask miss trevor or miss thorn she knows the other man the bicycle man and has seen them both together  where in india was one standing on the ground looking at his double go to heaven or was it at one of those drawingroom shows where a medium holds conversation with your soul while your body sleeps on the lounge by george crocker i thought you were a sensible man  no wonder i got angry but i might have come at some proper estimation of farrars incredulity by that time  i suppose you wouldnt take a ladys word i growled  not for that he said busy again with the sail stops nor st chrysostoms were he to come here and vouch for it it is too damned improbable  stranger things than that have happened i retorted fuming  not to any of us he said presently he added chuckling hed better not get into the clutches of that man drew  what do you mean i demanded farrar was exasperating at times  drew will wind those handcuffs on him like tourniquets he laughed  there seemed to be something behind this remark but before i could inquire into it we were interrupted by mr cooke who was standing on the beach swearing and gesticulating for the boat  i trust said farrar as we rowed ashore that this blind excitement will continue and that we shall have the extreme pleasure of setting down our friend in her majestys dominions with a yachtingsuit and a ham sandwich  we sat down to a hasty breakfast in the middle of which the celebrity arrived his appearance was unexceptionable but his heavy jaw was set in a manner which should have warned mr cooke not to trifle with him  sit down old man and take a bite before we start for canada said my client  the celebrity walked up to him  mr cooke he began in a menacing tone it is high time this nonsense was ended i am tired of being made a buffoon of for your party for your gratification i have spent a sleepless night in those cold damp woods and i warn you that practical joking can be carried too far i will not go to canada and i insist that you sail me back to asquith  mr cooke winked significantly in our direction and tapped his head  i dont wonder youre a little upset old man he said humoringly patting him but sit down for a bite of something and youll see things differently  ive had my breakfast he said taking out a cigarette  then mr trevor got up  he demands sir to be delivered over to the authorities said he and you have no right to refuse him i protest strongly  and you can protest all you damn please retorted my client this isnt the ohio state senate do you know where i would put you mr trevor do you know where you ought to be in a hencoop sir if i had one here in a hencoop what would you do if a man who had gone a little out of his mind asked you for a gun to shoot himself with give it him i suppose but i put mr allen ashore in canada with the funds to get off with and then my dutys done  this speech as mr cooke had no doubt confidently hoped threw the senator into a frenzy of wrath  the day will come sir he shouted shaking his fist at my client the day will come when you will rue this bitterly  dont get off any of your oratorical frills on me replied mr cooke contemptuously you ought to be tied and muzzled  mr trevor was white with anger  i for one will not go to canada he cried  youll stay here and starve then said mr cooke damned little i care  mr trevor turned to farrar who was biting his lip  mr farrar i know you to be a rising young man of sound principles and mr crocker likewise you are the only ones who can sail have you reflected that you are about to ruin your careers  we are prepared to take the chances i think said farrar  mr cooke looked us over proudly and gratefully as much as to say that while he lived we should not lack the necessities of life  at nine we embarked the celebrity and mr trevor for the same reason that the animals took to the arkbecause they had to there was a spanking breeze in the westnorthwest and a clear sky a day of days for a sail mr cooke produced a map which farrar and i consulted and without much trouble we hit upon a quiet place to land on the canadian side our course was northnorthwest and therefore the wind enabled us to hold it without much trouble bear island is situated some eighteen miles from shore and about equidistant between asquith and far harbor which latter we had to pass on our way northward  although a brisk sea was on the wind had been steady from that quarter all night and the motion was uniform the maria was an excellent seaboat there was no indication therefore of the return of that malady which had been so prevalent on the passage to bear island mr cooke had never felt better and looked every inch a seacaptain in his natty yachtingsuit he had acquired a tan on the island and as is eminently proper on a boat he affected nautical manners and nautical ways but his vernacular savored so hopelessly of the track and stall that he had been able to acquire no mastery over the art of marine invective and he possessed not so much as one maritime oath as soon as we had swung clear of the cove he made for the weather stays where he assumed a posture not unlike that in the famous picture of farragut ascending mobile bay his leather case was swung over his shoulder and with his glasses he swept the lake in search of the scimitar and other vessels of a like unamiable character  although my client could have told you offhand jackstraws last mile in a bicycle sulky his notion of the scimitars speed was as vague as his knowledge of seamanship and when i informed him that in all probability she had already passed the light on far harbor reef some nine miles this side of the far harbor police station he went into an inordinate state of excitement mr cooke was indeed that day the embodiment of an unselfish if misdirected zeal he was following the dictates of both heart and conscience in his endeavor to rescue his guest from the law and true zeal is invariably contagious what but such could have commanded the unremitting labors of that morning farrar himself had done three mens work before breakfast and it was in great part owing to him that we were now leaving the island behind us he was sailing the maria that day as she will never be sailed again her lee gunwale awash and a wake like a surveyors line behind her more than once i called to mind his facetious observation about mr drew and wondered if he knew more than he had said about the detective  once in the open the maria showed but small consideration for her passengers for she went through the seas rather than over them and mr cooke manfully keeping his station on the weather bow likewise went through the seas no argument could induce him to leave the post he had thus heroically chosen which was one of honor rather than utility for the lake was as vacant of sails as the day that father marquette or some one else first beheld it under such circumstances ease must be considered as only a relative term and the accommodations of the maria afforded but two comfortable spotsthe cabin and the lea aft of the cabin bulkhead this being the case the somewhat peculiar internal relations of the party decided its grouping  i know of no worse place than a small yacht or than a large one for that matter for uncongenial people the four betook themselves to the cabin which was fortunately large and made life bearable with a game of cards while mrs cooke whose adaptability and sense i had come greatly to admire contented herself with a corner and a book the ungrateful cause of the expedition himself occupied another corner i caught sight of him through the cabin skylight and the silver pencil he was holding over his notebook showed unmistakable marks of teeth  outside mr trevor his face wearing an immutable expression of defiance for the wickedness surrounding him had placed his daughter for safekeeping between himself and the only other reliable character on boardthe refrigerator but miss thorn appeared in a blue mackintosh and a pair of heavy yachtingboots courting rather than avoiding a drenching even a mackintosh is becoming to some women all morning she sat behind mr cooke on the rise of the cabin her back against the mast and her hair flying in the wind and i for one was not sorry the celebrity had given us this excuse for a sail     chapter xvi  about halfpast eleven mr cookes vigilance was rewarded by a glimpse of the lighthouse on far harbor reef and almost simultaneously he picked up to the westward the ragged outline of the housetops and spires of the town itself but as we neared the reef the harbor appeared as quiet as a sunday morning a few mackinaws were sailing hither and thither and the far harbor and beaverton boat was coming out my client in view of the peaceful aspect affairs had assumed presently consented to relinquish his post and handed the glasses over to me with an injunction to be watchful  i promised and mr cooke feeling his way aft with more discretion than grace finally descended into the cabin where he was noisily received and i was left with miss thorn while my client had been there in front of us his lively conversation and naive if profane remarks kept us in continual laughter when with him it was utterly impossible to see any other than the ludicrous side of this madcap adventure albeit he himself was so keenly in earnest as to its performance it was with misgiving that i saw him disappear into the hatchway and my impulse was to follow him our spirits like those in a thermometer are never stationary mine were continually being sent up or down the night before when i had sat with miss thorn beside the fire they went up this morning her anxious solicitude for the celebrity had sent them down again she both puzzled and vexed me i could not desert my post as lookout and i remained in somewhat awkward suspense as to what she was going to say gazing at distant objects through the glasses her remark when it came took me by surprise  i am afraid she said seriously that uncle fenelons principles are not all that they should be his morality is something like his tobacco which doesnt injure him particularly but is dangerous to others  i was more than willing to meet her on the neutral ground of uncle fenelon  do you think his principles contagious i asked  they have not met with the opposition they deserve she replied uncle fenelons ideas of life are not those of other menyours for instance and his affairs mental and material are happily for him such that he can generally carry out his notions with small inconvenience he is no doubt convinced that he is acting generously in attempting to rescue the celebrity from a term in prison what he does not realize is that he is acting ungenerously to other guests who have infinitely more at stake  but our friend from ohio has done his best to impress this upon him i replied failing to perceive her drift and if his words are wasted surely the thing is hopeless  i am not joking said she i was not thinking of mr trevor but of you i like you mr crocker you may not believe it but i do for the life of me i could think of no fitting reply to this declaration why was that abominable word like ever put into the english language yes i like you she continued meditatively in the face of the fact that you persist in disliking me  nothing of the kind  oh i know you mustnt think me so stupid as all that it is a mortifying truth that i like you and that you have no use for me  i have never known how to take a jest from a woman i suppose i should have laughed this off instead i made a fool of myself  i shall be as frank with you i said and declare that i like you though i should be much happier if i didnt  she blushed at this if i am not mistaken perhaps it was unlooked for  at any rate she went on i should deem it my duty to warn you of the consequences of this joke of yours they may not be all that you have anticipated the consequences for you i mean which you do not seem to have taken into account  consequences for me i exclaimed  i fear that you will think what i am going to say uncalled for and that i am meddling with something that does not concern me but it seems to me that you are undervaluing the thing you have worked so hard to attain they say that you have ability that you have acquired a practice and a position which at your age give the highest promise for the future that you are to be counsel for the railroad in short that you are the coming man in this section of the state i have found this out said she cutting short my objections in spite of the short time i have been here  nonsense i said reddening in my turn  suppose that the celebrity is captured she continued thrusting her hands into the pockets of her mackintosh it appears that he is shadowed and it is not unreasonable to expect that we shall be chased before the day is over then we shall be caught redhanded in an attempt to get a criminal over the border please wait until i have finished she said holding up her hand at an interruption i was about to make you and i know he is not a criminal but he might as well be as far as you are concerned as district attorney you are doubtless known to the local authorities if the celebrity is arrested after a long pursuit it will avail you nothing to affirm that you knew all along he was the noted writer you will pardon me if i say that they will not believe you then he will be taken east for identification and if i know anything about politics and especially the state of affairs in local politics with which you are concerned the incident and the interval following it will be fatal to your chances with the railroadto your chances in general you perceive mr crocker how impossible it is to play with fire without being burned  i did perceive at the time the amazing thoroughness with which she had gone into the subject of my own unimportant affairs the astuteness and knowledge of the world she had shown and the clearness with which she had put the situation did not strike me nothing struck me but the alarming sense of my own stupidity which was as keen as i have ever felt it what man in a public position however humble has not political enemies the image of omeara was wafted suddenly before me disagreeably near and his face wore the smile of victory all of mr cookes money could not save me my spirits sank as the immediate future unfolded itself and i even read the article in omearas organ the northern lights which was to be instrumental in divesting me of my public trust and fair fame generally yes if the celebrity was caught on the other side of far harbor all would be up with john crocker but it would never do to let miss thorn discover my discomfiture  there is something in what you say i replied with what bravado i could muster  a little i think she returned smiling now what i wish you to do is to make uncle fenelon put into far harbor if he refuses you can go in in spite of him since you and mr farrar are the only ones who can sail you have the situation in your own hands  there was certainly wisdom in this also but the die was cast now and pride alone was sufficient to hold me to the course i had rashly begun upon pride what an awkward thing it is and more difficult for most of us to swallow than a sponge  i thank you for this interest in my welfare miss thorn i began  no fine speeches please sir she cut in but do as i advise  i fear i cannot  why do you say that the thing is simplicity itself  i should lose my selfrespect as a practical joker and besides i said maliciously i started out to have some fun with the celebrity and i want to have it  well she replied rather coolly of course you can do as you choose  we were passing within a hundred yards of the lighthouse set cheerlessly on the bald and sandy tip of the point an icy silence sat between us and such a silence is invariably insinuating this one suggested a horrible thought what if miss thorn had warned me in order to save the celebrity from humiliation i thrust it aside but it returned again and grinned had she not practised insincerity before and any one with half an eye could see that she was in love with the celebrity even the fraction had remarked it what more natural than with her cleverness she had hit upon this means of terminating the authors troubles by working upon my fears  human weakness often proves too much for those of us who have the very best intentions up to now the refrigerator and mr trevor had kept the strictest and most jealous of vigils over irene but at length the senator succumbed to the drowsiness which never failed to attack him at this hour and he forgot the disrepute of his surroundings in a respectable sleep whereupon his daughter joined us on the forecastle  i knew that would happen to papa if i only waited long enough she said oh he thinks youre dreadful mr crocker he says that nowadays young men havent any principle i mustnt be seen talking to you  i have been trying to convince mr crocker that his stand in the matter is not only immoral but suicidal said miss thorn perhaps she added meaningly he will listen to you  i dont understand answered miss trevor  miss thorn has been good enough to point out i explained that the political machine in this section which has the honor to detest me will seize upon the pretext of the celebritys capture to ruin me they will take the will for the deed  of course they will do just that cried miss trevor how bright of you to think of it marian  miss thorn stood up  i leave you to persuade him said she i have no doubt you will be able to do it  with that she left us quite suddenly abruptly i thought and her manner seemed to impress miss trevor  i wonder what is the matter with marian said she and leaned over the skylight why she has gone down to talk with the celebrity  isnt that rather natural i asked with asperity  she turned to me with an amused expression  her conduct seems to worry you vastly mr crocker i noticed that you were quite upset this morning in the cave why was it  you must have imagined it i said stiffly  i should like to know she said with the air of one trying to solve a knotty problem i should like to know how many men are as blind as you  you are quite beyond me miss trevor i answered may i request you to put that remark in other words  i protest that you are a most unsatisfactory person she went on not heeding my annoyance most abnormally modest people are if i were to stick you with this hatpin for instance you would accept the matter as a positive insult  i certainly should i said laughing and besides it would be painful  there you are said she exultingly i knew it but i flatter myself there are men who would go into an ecstasy of delight if i ran a hatpin into them i am merely taking this as an illustration of my point  it is a very fine point said i but some people take pleasure in odd things i can easily conceive of a man gallant enough to suffer the agony for the sake of pleasing a pretty girl  i told you so she pouted you have missed it entirely you are hopelessly blind on that side and numb perhaps you didnt know that you have had a hatpin sticking in you for some time  i began feeling myself nervously  for more than a month she cried and to think that you have never felt it my action was too much for her gravity and she fell back against the skylight in a fit of merriment which threatened to wake her father and i hoped it would  it pleases you to speak in parables this morning i said  mr crocker she began again when she had regained her speech shall i tell you of a great misfortune which might happen to a girl  i should be pleased to hear it i replied courteously  that misfortune then would be to fall in love with you  happily that is not within the limits of probability i answered beginning to be a little amused but why  lightning often strikes where it is least expected she replied archly listen if a young woman were unlucky enough to lose her heart to you she might do everything but tell you and you would never know it i scarcely believe you would know it if she did tell you  i must have jumped unconsciously  oh you neednt think i am in love with you  not for a minute i made haste to say  she pointed towards the timbercovered hills beyond the shore  do you see that stream which comes foaming down the notch into the lake in front of us she asked let us suppose that you lived in a cabin beside that brook and that once in a while when you went out to draw your water you saw a nugget ofgold washing along with the pebbles on the bed how many days do you think you would be in coming to the conclusion that there was a pocket of gold somewhere above you and in starting in search of it  not long surely  ah you are not lacking in perception there but if i were to tell you that i knew of the existence of such a mine from various proofs i have had and that the mine was in the possession of a certain person who was quite willing to share it with you on application you would not believe me  probably not  well said miss trevor with a nod of finality i was actually about to make such a disclosure but i see it would be useless  i confess she aroused my curiosity no coaxing however would induce her to interpret  no she insisted strangely if you cannot put two and two together i fear i cannot help you and no one i ever heard of has come to any good by meddling  miss trevor folded her hands across her lap she wore that air which i am led to believe is common to all women who have something of importance to disclose or at least what they consider is of importance there was an element of pity too in her expression for she had given me my chance and my wits had been found wanting  do not let it be surmised that i attach any great value to such banter as she had been indulging in at the same time however i had an uneasy feeling that i had missed something which might have been to my advantage it was in vain that i whipped my dull senses but one conclusion was indicated by all this inference and i dont care even to mention that it was preposterous  then miss trevor shifted to a very serious mood she honestly did her best to persuade me to relinquish our enterprise to go to mr cooke and confess the whole thing  i wish we had washed our hands of this celebrity from the first she said with a sigh how dreadful if you lose your position on account of this foolishness  but i shant i answered reassuringly we are getting near the border now and no sign of trouble and besides i added i think miss thorn tried to frighten me and she very nearly succeeded it was prettily done  of course she tried to frighten you i wish she had succeeded  but her object was transparent  her object she exclaimed her object was to save you  i think not i replied it was to save the celebrity  miss trevor rose and grasped one of the sail rings to keep her balance she looked at me pityingly  do you really believe that  firmly  then you are hopeless mr crocker totally hopeless i give you up and she went back to her seat beside the refrigerator     chapter xvii  crocker old man crocker what the devil does that mean  i turned with a start to perceive a bare head thrust above the cabin roof the scant hair flying and two large brown eyes staring into mine full of alarm and reproach a plump finger was pointing to where the sandy reef lay far astern of us  the mackinaws were flecked far and wide over the lake and a dirty smudge on the blue showed where the far harbor and beaverton boat had gone over the horizon but there over the point and dangerously close to the land hung another smudge gradually pushing its way like a writhing black serpent lakewards thus i was rudely jerked back to face the problem with which we had left the island that morning  i snatched the neglected glasses from the deck and hurried aft to join my client on the overhang but a pipe was all they revealed above the bleak hillocks of sand my client turned to me with a face that was white under the tan  crocker he cried in a tragic voice its a blessed police boat or i never picked a winner  nonsense i said other boats smoke beside police boats the lake is full of tugs  i was a little nettled at having been scared for a molehill  but i know it sure as hell he insisted  you know nothing about it and wont for an hour whats a pipe and a trail of smoke  he laid a hand on my shoulder and i felt it tremble  why do you suppose i came out he demanded solemnly  you were probably losing i said  i was winning  then you got tired of winning  but he held up a thumb within a few inches of my face and with it a ring i had often noticed a huge opal which he customarily wore on the inside of his hand  shes dead said mr cooke sadly  dead i repeated perplexed  yes shes dead as the day i lost the two thousand at sheepshead shes never gone back on me yet and unless i can make some little arrangement with those fellows he added tossing his head at the smoke you and i will put up tonight in some barn of a jail ive never been in jail but once said mr cooke and it isnt so damned pleasant i assure you i saw that he believed every word of it in fact that it was his religion i might as well have tried to argue the sultan out of mohammedanism  the pipe belonged to a tug that was certain farrar said so after a look over his shoulder disdaining glasses and he knew the lake better than many who made their living by it it was then that i made note of a curious anomaly in the betting character for thus far mr cooke like a great many of his friends was a skeptic he never ceased to hope until the stake had found its way into the other mans pocket and it was for hope that he now applied to farrar but even farrar did not attempt to account for the tugs appearance that near the land  shes in some detestable hurry to get up this way thats flat he said where she is the channel out of the harbor is not forty feet wide  by this time the rest of the party were gathered behind us on the high side of the boat in different stages of excitement scrutinizing the smoke mr cooke had the glasses glued to his eyes again his feet braced apart and every line of his body bespeaking the tension of his mind i imagined him standing thus the stump of his cigar tightly clutched between his teeth following the fortunes of some favorite on the far side of the belmont track  we waited without comment while the smoke crept by degrees towards the little white spindle on the tip of the point now and again catching a gleam of the suns rays from off the glass of the lantern and presently against the white lather of the lake i thought i caught sight of a black nose pushed out beyond the land another moment and the tug itself was bobbing in the open barely had she reached the deep water beyond the sands when her length began to shorten and the dense cloud of smoke that rose made it plain that she was firing at the sight i reflected that i had been a fool indeed a scant flue miles of water lay between us and her and if they really meant business back there and they gave every sign of it we had about an hour and a half to get rid of the celebrity the maria was a good boat but she had not been built to try conclusions with a far harbor tug  my client in spite of the ominous condition of his opal was not slow to make his intentions exceedingly clear for mr cooke was first and last and always a gentleman after that you might call him anything you pleased meditatively he screwed up his glasses and buckled them into the case and then he descended to the cockpit it was the celebrity he singled out of the party  allen said he when he stood before him i want to impress on you that my words gold ive stuck to you thus far and ill be damned now if i throw you over like they did jonah  mr cooke spoke with a fine dignity that in itself was impressive and when he had finished he looked about him until his eye rested on mr trevor as though opposition were to come from that quarter and the senator gave every sign of another eruption but the celebrity either from lack of appreciation of my clients loyalty or because of the nervousness which was beginning to show itself in his demeanor despite an effort to hide it returned no answer he turned on his heel and resumed his seat in the cabin mr cooke was visibly affected  id sooner lose my whip hand than go back on him now he declared  then vesuvius began to rumble  mr cooke said the senator may i suggest something which seems pertinent to me though it does not appear to have occurred to you  his tone was the calm one that the heroes used in the celebritys novels when they were about to drop on and annihilate wicked men  certainly sir my client replied briskly bringing himself up on his way back to the overhang  you have announced your intention of standing by mr allen as you express it have you reflected that there are some others who deserve to be consulted and considered beside mr allen and yourself  mr cooke was puzzled at this change of front and unused moreover to that veiled irony of parliamentary expression  talk english my friend said he  in plain words sir mr allen is a criminal who ought to be locked up he is a menace to society you who have a reputation i am given to understand for driving four horses have nothing to lose by a scandal while i have worked all my life for the little i have achieved and have a daughter to think about i will neither stand by mr allen nor by you  mr cooke was ready with a retort when the true significance of this struck him things were a trifle different now the tables had turned since leaving the island and the senator held it in his power to ruin our one remaining chance of escape strangely enough he missed the cause of mr cookes hesitation  look here old man said my client biting off another cigar im a firstrate fellow when you get to know me and id do the same for you as im doing for allen  i daresay sir i daresay said the other a trifle mollified i dont claim that youre not acting as you think right  i see it said mr cooke with admirable humility i see it i was wrong to haul you into this trevor and the only thing to consider now is how to get you out of it  here he appeared for a moment to be wrapped in deep thought and checked with his cigar an attempt to interrupt him  however you put it old man he said at last were all in a pretty bad hole  all cried mr trevor indignantly  yes all asserted mr cooke with composure there are the police and here is allen as good as run down if they find him when they get abroad you dont suppose theyll swallow anything you have to say about trying to deliver him over no sir youll be bagged and fined along with the rest of us and id be damned sorry to see it if i do say it and i blame myself freely for it old man now you take my advice and keep your mouth shut and ill take care of you ive got a place for allen  during this somewhat remarkable speech mr trevor as it were blew hot and cold by turns although its delivery was inconsiderate its logic was undeniable and the senator sat down again on the locker and was silent but i marked that off and on his fingers would open and shut convulsively  time alone would disclose what was to happen to us in the interval there was nothing to do but wait we had reached the stage where anxiety begins to take the place of excitement and we shifted restlessly from spot to spot and looked at the tug she was ploughing along after us and to such good purpose that presently i began to catch the white of the seas along her bows and the bright red with which her pipe was tipped farrar alone seemed to take but slight interest in her more than once i glanced at him as he stood under me but his eye was on the shuddering leach of the sail then i leaned over  what do you think of it i asked  i told you this morning drew would have handcuffs on him before night he replied without raising his head  hang your joking farrar i know more than you about it  then whats the use of asking me  dont you see that im ruined if were caught i demanded a little warmly  no i dont see it he replied you dont suppose i think you fool enough to risk this comedy if the man were guilty do you i dont believe all that rubbish about his being the criminals double either thats something the girls got up for your benefit  i ignored this piece of brutality  but im ruined anyway  how  i explained shortly what i thought our friend omeara would do under the circumstances an inference sufficed farrar  why didnt you say something about this before he asked gravely i would have put into far harbor  because i didnt think of it i confessed  farrar pulled down the corners of his mouth with trying not to smile  miss thorn is a woman of brains he remarked gently i respect her  i wondered by what mysterious train of reasoning he had arrived at this conclusion he said nothing for a while but toyed with the spokes of the wheel keeping the wind in the sail with undue nicety  i cant make them out he said all at once  then you believe theyre after us  i changed the course a point or two just to try them  and  and they changed theirs  who could have informed  drew of course i said who else  he laughed  drew doesnt know anything about allen said he and besides hes no more of a detective than i am  but drew was told there was a criminal on the island  who told him  i repeated the conversation between drew and mr trevor which i had overheard farrar whistled  but you did not speak of that this morning said he  no i replied feeling anything but comfortable at times when he was facetious as he had been this morning i was wont to lose sight of the fact that with farrar the manner was not the man and to forget the warmth of his friendship i was again to be reminded of this  well crocker he said briefly i would willingly give up this years state contract to have known it     chapter xviii  it was accurately as i can remember half after noon when mr cooke first caught the smoke over the point for the sun was very high at two our fate had been decided i have already tried to describe a part of what took place in that hour and a half although even now i cannot get it all straight in my mind races when a great deal is at stake are more or less chaotic a close four miles in a college eight is a succession of blurs with lucid but irrelevant intervals the weary months of hard work are forgotten and you are quite as apt to think of your first velocipede or of the pie that is awaiting you in the boathouse as of victory and defeat and a yacht race with a pair of rivals on your beam is very much the same  as i sat with my feet dangling over the washboard i reflected once or twice that we were engaged in a race all i had to do was to twist my head in order to make sure of it i also reflected i believe that i was in the position of a man who has bet all he owns with large odds on losing either way but on the whole i was occupied with more trivial matters a letter i had forgotten to write about a months rent a client whose summer address i had mislaid the sun was burning my neck behind when a whistle aroused me to the realization that the tug was no longer a toy boat dancing in the distance but a stern fact but two miles away there could be no mistake now for i saw the white steam of the signal against the smoke  i slid down and went into the cabin the celebrity was in the corner by the companionway with his head on the cushions and a book in his hand and forward under the low deck beams beyond the skylight i beheld the crouching figure of my client he had stripped off his coat and was busy at some task on the floor  theyre whistling for us to stop i said to him  how near are they old man he asked without looking up the perspiration was streaming down his face and he held a brace and bit in his hand under him was the trapdoor which gave access to the ballast below and through this he had bored a neat hole the yellow chips were still on his clothes  theyre not two miles away i answered but what in mystery are you doing there  but he only laid a finger beside his nose and bestowed a wink in my direction then he took some ashes from his cigar wetted his finger and thus ingeniously removed all appearance of newness from the hole he had made carefully cleaning up the chips and putting them in his pocket finally he concealed the brace and bit and opened the trap disclosing the rough stones of the ballast i watched him in amazement as he tore a mattress from an adjoining bunk and forced it through the opening spreading it fore and aft over the stones  now he said regaining his feet and surveying the whole with undisguised satisfaction hell be as safe there as in my new family vault  but i began a light dawning upon me  allen old man said mr cooke come here  the celebrity laid down his book and looked up my client was putting on his coat  come here old man he repeated  and he actually came but he stopped when he caught sight of the open trap and of the mattress beneath it  how will that suit you asked mr cooke smiling broadly as he wiped his face with an embroidered handkerchief  the celebrity looked at the mattress then at me and lastly at mr cooke his face was a study  andand you think i am going to get in there he said his voice shaking  my client fell back a step  why not he demanded its about your size comfortable and all the air you want here mr cooke stuck his finger through the bit hole damn me if i were in your fix i wouldnt stop at a kennel  then youre cursed badly mistaken said the celebrity going back to his corner im tired of being made an ass of for you and your party  an ass exclaimed my client in proper indignation  yes an ass said the celebrity and he resumed his book  it would seem that a student of human nature such as every successful writer should be might by this time have arrived at some conception of my clients character simple as it was and have learned to overlook the slight peculiarity in his mode of expressing himself but here the celebrity fell short if my clients emotions were not pitched in the same key as those of other people who shall say that his heart was not as large or his sympathies as wide as many another philanthropist  but mr cooke was an optimist and as such disposed to look at the best side of his friends and ignore the worst if indeed he perceived their faults at all it was plain to me even now that he did not comprehend the celebritys attitude that his guest should reject the one hope of escape left him was according to mr cooke only to be accounted for by a loss of mental balance nevertheless his disappointment was keen he let down the door and slowly led the way out of the cabin the whistle sounded shrilly in our ears  mr cooke sat down and drew a wallet from his pocket he began to count the bills and as if by common consent the four followed suit it was a task which occupied some minutes and when completed my client produced a morocco notebook and a pencil he glanced interrogatively at the man nearest him  three hundred and fifty  mr cooke put it down it was entirely a matter of course what else was there to be done and when he had gone the round of his followers he turned to farrar and me  how much are you fellows equal to he asked  i believe he did it because he felt we should resent being left out and so we should have mr cookes instincts were delicate  we told him then he paused his pencil in the air and his eyes doubtfully fixed on the senator for all this time mr trevor had been fidgeting in his seat but now he opened his long coat button by button and thrust his hand inside the flap oh falstaff  father father exclaimed miss trevor but her tongue was in her cheek  i have heard it stated that if a thoroughly righteous man were cast away with ninety and nine ruffians each of the ruffians would gain oneonehundredth in virtue whilst the righteous man would sink to their new level i am not able to say how much better mr cookes party was for mr trevors company but the senator seemed to realize that something serious had happened to him for his voice was not altogether steady as he pronounced the amount of his contribution  trevor cried mr cooke with great fervor i take it all back youre a true publicspirited old sport  but the senator had not yet reached that extreme of degradation where it is pleasurable to be congratulated on wickedness  my client added up the figures and rubbed his hands i regret to say that the aggregate would have bought up three small police organizations body and soul  pull up farrar old man he shouted  farrar released the wheel and threw the maria into the wind with the sail cracking and the big boom dodging over our heads we watched the tug as she drew nearer and nearer until we could hear the loud beating of her engines on one side some men were making ready to lower a boat and then a conspicuous figure in blue stood out by the davits then came the faint tinkle of a bell and the h sinclair of far harbor glided up and thrashed the water scarce a biscuitthrow away  hello there the man in uniform called out it was captain mccann chief of the far harbor police  mr cooke waved his cigar politely  is that mr cookes yacht the maria  the same said mr cooke  im fearing ill have to come aboard you mr cooke  all right old man glad to have you said my client  this brought a smile to mccanns face as he got into his boat we were all standing in the cockpit save the celebrity who was just inside of the cabin door i had time to note that he was pale and no more i must have been pale myself a few strokes brought the chief to the marias stern  its not me that likes to interfere with a gents pleasure party but business is business said he as he climbed aboard  my clients hospitality was oriental  make yourself at home old man he said a box of his largest and blackest cigars in his hand and these he advanced towards mccann before the knot was tied in the painter  then a wave of selfreproach swept over me was it possible that i like mr trevor had been deprived of all the morals i had ever possessed could it be that the district attorney was looking calmly on while mr cooke wilfully corrupted the far harbor chiefofpolice as agonizing a minute as i ever had in my life was that which it took mccann to survey those cigars his broad features became broader still as a huge red hand was reached out i saw it close lingeringly over the box and then mr cooke had struck a match the chief stepped over the washboard onto the handsome turkeyred cushions on the seats and thus he came face to face with me  holy fathers he exclaimed is it you who are here mr crocker and he pulled off his cap  no other mccann said i with what i believe was a most pitiful attempt at braggadocio  mccann began to puff at his cigar clouds of smoke came out of his face and floated down the wind he was so visibly embarrassed that i gained a little courage  and what brings you here i demanded  he scrutinized me in perplexity  i think youre guessing sir  never a guess mccann youll have to explain yourself  mccann had once had a wholesome respect for me but it looked now as if the bottom was dropping out of it  sure mr crocker he said what would you be doing in such company as im hunting for can it be that yere helping to lift a criminal over the border  mccann i asked sternly what have you had on the tug  force of habit proved too much for the man he went back to the apologetic  never a drop mr crocker upon me soul  this reminded mr cooke of something be it recorded that he had for once forgotten he lifted up the top of the refrigerator the chiefs eye followed him but i was not going to permit this  now mccann i commenced again if you will state your business here if you have any i shall be obliged you are delaying mr cooke  the chief was seized with a nervous tremor i think we were a pair in that only i managed to keep mine under when it came to the point and any bribing was to be done i had hit upon a course selfrespect demanded a dignity on my part with a painful indecision mccann pulled a paper from his pocket which i saw was a warrant and he dropped his cigar mr cooke was quick to give him another  ye come from bear island mr crocker he inquired  i replied in the affirmative  i hope its news im telling you he said soberly im hoping its news when i say that im here for mr charles wrexell allenthats the gentlemans name hes after taking a hundred thousand dollars away from boston then he turned to mr cooke the gentleman was aboard your boat sir when you left that country place of yourswhat dye call itmohair thank you sir and he wiped the water from his brow and theyre telling me he was on bear island with ye sure sir and i cant see why a gentleman of your standing would be wanting to get him over the border but i must do my duty begging your pardon mr crocker he added with a bow to me  certainly mccann i said  for a space there was only the bumping and straining of the yacht and the swish of the water against her sides then the chief spoke again  it will be saving you both trouble and inconvenience mr crocker if you give him up sir  what did the man mean why in the name of the law didnt he make a move i was conscious that my client was fumbling in his clothes for the wallet that he had muttered an invitation for the chief to go inside mccann smoked uneasily  i dont want to search the boat sir  at these words we all turned with one accord towards the cabin i felt farrar gripping my arm tightly from behind  the celebrity had disappeared  it was mr cooke who spoke  search the boat he said something between a laugh and a cry  yes sir the chief repeated firmly its sorry i am to do it with mr crocker here too  i have always maintained that nature had endowed my client with rare gifts and the ease with which he now assumed a part thus unexpectedly thrust upon him as well as the assurance with which he carried it out goes far to prove it  if theres anything in your line aboard chief he said blandly help yourself  some of us laughed i thought things a little too close to be funny since the celebrity had lost his nerve and betaken himself to the place of concealment mr cooke had prepared for him the whole composition of the affair was changed before if mccann had arrested the ostensible mr allen my word added to fifty dollars from my client would probably have been sufficient should he be found now no district attorney on the face of the earth could induce the chief to believe that he was any other than the real criminal nor would any bribe be large enough to compensate mccann for the consequences of losing so important a prisoner there was nothing now but to carry it off with a high hand mccann got up  be your lave mr crocker he said  never you mind me mccann i replied but you do what is right  with that he began his search it might have been ludicrous if i had had any desire to laugh for the chief wore the gingerly air of a man looking for a rattlesnake which has to be got somehow and my client assisted at the inspection with all the graces of a dancingmaster mccann poked into the forward lockers where we kept the storesdropping the iron lid within an inch of his toeand the clothinglockers and the saillockers he reached under the bunks and drew out his hand again quickly as though he expected to be bitten and at last he stood by the trap with the hole in it under which the celebrity lay prostrate i could hear my own breathing but mr cooke had his wits about him still and at this critical juncture he gave mccann a thump on the back which nearly carried him off his feet  they say the mast is hollow old man he suggested  be jabers mr cooke said mccann and im beginning to think it is  he took off his cap and scratched his head  well mccann i hope youre contented i said  mr crocker said he and its that thankful i am for you that the gent aint here but with him cutting high finks up at mr cookes house with a valet and him coming on the yacht with yese and the whole country in that state about him begorra said mccann and its domned strange maybe its swimmin in the water he is  the whole party had followed the search and at this speech of the chiefs our nervous tension became suddenly relaxed most of us sat down to laugh  im asking no questions mr crocker yell take notice he remarked his voice full of reproachful meaning  mccann said i you come outside i want to speak to you  he followed me out  now i went on you know me pretty well he nodded doubtfully and if i give you my word that charles wrexell allen is not on this yacht and never has been is that sufficient  is it the truth youre saying sir  i assured him that it was  then where is he mr crocker  god only knows i replied with fervor i dont mccann  the chief was satisfied he went back into the cabin and mr cooke in the exuberance of his joy produced champagne mccann had heard of my client and of his luxurious country place and moreover it was the first time he had ever been on a yellowplush yacht he tarried he drank mr cookes health and looked around him in wonder and awe and his remarks were worthy of record these sayings and the thought of the author of the sybarites stifling below with his mouth to an augerhole kept us in a continual state of merriment and at last our visitor rose to go  as he was stepping over the side mr cooke laid hold of a brass button and pressed a handful of the black cigars upon him  my regards to the detective old man said he  mccann stared  my regards to drew my client insisted  oh said mccann his face lighting up him with the whiskers what came from bear island in a catboat sure he wasnt no detective sir  what was he a police commissioner  mr cooke said mccann disdainfully as he got into his boat he wasnt nothing but a prospector doing the lake for one of them summer hotel companies     chapter xix  when the biography of the celebrity is written and i have no doubt it will be some day may his biographer kindly draw a veil over that instant in his life when he was tenderly and obsequiously raised by mr cooke from the trap in the floor of the marias cabin  it is sometimes the case that a good fright will heal a feud and whereas before the arrival of the h sinclair there had been much dissension and many quarrels concerning the disposal of the quasi charles wrexell allen when the tug steamed away to the southwards but one opinion remainedthat like jonah he must be got rid of and no one concurred more heartily in this than the celebrity himself he strolled about and smoked apathetically with the manner of one who was bored beyond description whilst the discussion was going on between farrar mr cooke and myself as to the best place to land him when considerately asked by my client whether he had any choice in the matter he replied somewhat facetiously that he could not think of making a suggestion to one who had shown such superlative skill in its previous management  mr trevor too experienced a change of sentiment in mr cookes favor it is not too much to say that the senators scare had been of such thoroughness that he was willing to agree to almost anything he had come so near to being relieved of that most precious possession his respectability that the reason in mr cookes course now appealed to him very strongly thus he became a tacit assenter in wrongdoing for circumstances thrust this once in a while upon the best of our citizens  the afternoon wore cool nay cold is a better word the wind brought with it a suggestion of the pineclad wastes of the northwestern wilderness whence it came and that sure harbinger of autumn the blue haze settled around the hills and benumbed the rays of the sun lingering over the crests farrar and i as navigators were glad to get into our overcoats while the others assembled in the little cabin and lighted the gasoline stove which stood in the corner outside we had our pipes for consolation and the sunset beauty of the lake  by six we were well over the line and consulting our chart we selected a cove behind a headland on our left which seemed the best we could do for an anchorage although it was shallow and full of rocks as we were changing our course to run in mr cooke appeared bundled up in his reefer he was in the best of spirits and was good enough to concur with our plans  now sir asked farrar what do you propose to do with allen  but our client only chuckled  wait and see old man he said ive got that all fixed  well farrar remarked when he had gone in again he has steered it deuced well so far i think we can trust him  it was dark when we dropped anchor a very tired party indeed and as the maria could not accommodate us all with sleeping quarters mr cooke decided that the ladies should have the cabin since the night was cold and so it might have been had not miss thorn flatly refused to sleep there the cabin was stuffy she said and so she carried her point leaving farrar and one of mr cookes friends to take care of the yacht the rest of us went ashore built a roaring fire and raised a tent and proceeded to make ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would allow the sense of relief over the danger passed produced a kind of lightheartedness amongst us and the topics broached at supper would not have been inappropriate at a friendly dinner party as we were separating for the night miss thorn said to me  i am so happy for your sake mr crocker that he was not discovered  for my sake could she really have meant it after all i went to sleep thinking of that sentence beside my client beneath the trees and it was first in my thoughts when i awoke  as we dipped our faces in the brook the next morning my client laughed softly to himself between the gasps and i knew that he had in mind the last consummate touch to his successful enterprise and the revelation came when the party were assembled at breakfast mr cooke stood up and drawing from his pocket a small and mysterious paper parcel he forthwith delivered himself in the tone and manner which had so endeared him to the familiars of the lake house bar  im not much for words as you all know said he with becoming modesty and i dont set up to be an orator i am just what you see herea damned plain man and theres only one virtue that i lay any claim tono one can say that i ever went back on a friend i want to thank all of you looking at the senator for what you have done for me and allen its not for us to talk about that hundred thousand dollarsmy private opinion is he seemed to have no scruples about making it public that allen is insane no old man dont interrupt me but you havent acted just right and thats a fact and i wont feel square with myself until i put him where i found him in safety i am sorry to say my friends he added with emotion that mr allen is about to leave us  he paused for breath palpably satisfied with so much of it and with the effect on his audience  now continued he we start this morning for a place which is only four miles or so from the town of saville and i shall then request my esteemed legal adviser mr crocker to proceed to the town and buy a readymade suit of clothes for mr allen a slouch hat a cheap necktie and a stout pair of farmers boots and i have here he said holding up the package i have here the rest of it my friends you heard the chief tell me that drew was doing the lake for a summer hotel syndicate but if drew wasnt a detective you can throw me into the lake he wasnt exactly pinkerton and i flatter myself that we were too many for him said mr cooke with deserved pride and he went away in such a devilish hurry that he forgot his handbag with some of his extra things  then my client opened the package and held up on a string before our astonished eyes a wig a pair of moustaches and two bushy red whiskers  and this was mr cookes scheme did it electrify his hearers perhaps even the senator was so choked with laughter that he was forced to cast loose one of the buttons which held on his turndown collar and farrar retired into the woods but the gravity of mr cookes countenance remained serene  old man he said to the celebrity youll have to learn the price of potatoes now here are mr drews duplicates try em on  this the celebrity politely but firmly refused to do  cooke said he it has never been my lot to visit so kind and considerate a host or to know a man who pursued his duty with so little thought and care of his own peril i wish to thank you and to apologize for any hasty expressions i may have dropped by mistake and i would it were possible to convince you that i am neither a maniac nor an embezzler but if its just the same to you i believe i can get along without the disguise you mentioned and so save mr crocker his pains in short if you will set me down at saville i am willing to take my chances of reaching the canadian pacific from that point without fear of detection  the celebritys speech produced a good impression on all save mr cooke who appeared a trifle waterlogged he had dealt successfully with mr allen when that gentleman had been in defiant moods or in moods of ugly sarcasm but this goodnatured turnyoudowneasy note puzzled my client not a little was this cherished scheme a whim or a joke to be lightly cast aside mr cooke thought not the determination which distinguished him still sat in his eye as he bustled about giving orders for the breaking of camp this refractory criminal must be saved from himself cost what it might and responsibility again rested heavy on my clients mind as i rowed him out to the maria  crocker he said if allen is scooped in spite of us you have got to go east and make him out an idiot  he seemed to think that i had a talent for this particular defence i replied that i would do my best  it wont be difficult he went on not near as tough as that case you won for me you can bring in all the bosh about his claiming to be an author you know and ill stand expenses  this was downright generous of mr cooke we have all no doubt drawn our line between what is right and what is wrong but i have often wondered how many of us with the worlds indorsement across our backs trespass as little on the other side of the line as he  after farrar and the four got aboard it fell to my lot to row the rest of the party to the yacht and this was no slight task that morning the tender was small holding but two beside the man at the oars and owing to the rocks and shallow water of which i have spoken the maria lay considerably over a quarter of a mile out hence each trip occupied some time mr cooke i had transferred with a load of canvas and the tent poles and next i returned for mrs cooke and mr trevor whom i deposited safely then i landed again helped in miss trevor and miss thorn leaving the celebrity for the last and was pulling for the yacht when a cry from the tenders stern arrested me  mr crocker they are sailing away without us  i turned in my seat the marias mainsail was up and the jib was being hoisted and her head was rapidly falling off to the wind farrar was casting in the stern waving a handkerchief i recognized mrs cooke and beside her a figure in black gesticulating frantically a vision of coattails flapping in the breeze then the yacht heeled on her course and forged lakewards  row mr crocker row they are leaving us cried miss trevor in alarm  i hastened to reassure her  farrar is probably trying something i said they will be turning presently  this is just what they did not do once out of the inlet they went about and headed northward up the coast and we remained watching them until mr trevor became a mere oscillating black speck against the sail  what can it mean asked miss thorn  i had not so much as an idea  they certainly wont desert us at any rate i said we had better go ashore again and wait  the celebrity was seated on the beach and he was whittling now whittling is an occupation which speaks of a contented frame of mind and the marias departure did not seem to have annoyed or disturbed him  castaways says he gayly castaways on a foreign shore two delightful young ladies a bright young lawyer a fugitive from justice no chaperon and nothing to eat and what a situation for a short story if only an author were permitted to make use of his own experiences  only you dont know how it will end miss thorn put in  the celebrity glanced up at her  i have a guess said he with a smile  is it true miss trevor asked that a story must contain the element of love in order to find favor with the public  that generally recommends it especially to your sex miss trevor he replied jocosely  miss trevor appeared interested  and tell me she went on isnt it sometimes the case that you start out intent on one ending and that your artistic sense of what is fitting demands another  dont be silly irene said miss thorn she was skipping flat pebbles over the water and doing it capitally too  i thought the celebrity rather resented the question  that sometimes happens of course said he carelessly he produced his inevitable gold cigarette case and held it out to me be sociable for once and have one he said  i accepted  do you know he continued lighting me a match it beats me why you and miss trevor put this thing up on me you have enjoyed it naturally and if you wanted to make me out a donkey you succeeded rather well i used to think that crocker was a pretty good friend of mine when i went to his dinners in new york and i once had every reason to believe he added that miss trevor and i were on excellent terms  was this audacity or stupidity undoubtedly both  so we were answered miss trevor and i should be very sorry to think mr allen she said meaningly that our relations had in any way changed  it was the celebritys turn to flush  at any rate he remarked in his most offhand manner i am much obliged to you both on sober reflection i have come to believe that you did the very best thing for my reputation     chapter xx  he had scarcely uttered these words before the reason for the marias abrupt departure became apparent the anchorage of the yacht had been at a spot whence nearly the whole south of the lake towards far harbor was open whilst a high tongue of land hid that part from us on the shore as he spoke there shot before our eyes a steaming tugboat and a second look was not needed to assure me that she was the h sinclair of far harbor they had perceived her from the yacht an hour since and it was clear that my client prompt to act as to think had decided at once to put out and lead her a blind chase so giving the celebrity a chance to make good his escape  the surprise and apprehension created amongst us by her sudden appearance was such that none of us for a space spoke or moved she was about a mile off shore but it was even whether the chief would decide that his quarry had been left behind in the inlet and turn in or whether he would push ahead after the yacht he gave us an abominable five minutes of uncertainty for when he came opposite the cove he slowed up apparently weighing his chances it was fortunate that we were hidden from his glasses by a copse of pines the sinclair increased her speed and pushed northward after the maria i turned to the celebrity  if you wish to escape now is your chance i said  for contrariness he was more than i have ever had to deal with now he crossed his knees and laughed  it strikes me you had better escape crocker said he you have more to run for  i looked across at miss thorn she had told him then of my predicament and she did not meet my eye he began to whittle again and remarked  it is only seventeen miles or so across these hills to far harbor old chap and you can get a train there for asquith  just as you choose said i shortly  with that i started off to gain the top of the promontory in order to watch the chase i knew that this could not last as long as that of the day before in less than three hours we might expect the maria and the tug in the cove and to be frank the indisposition of the celebrity to run troubled me had he come to the conclusion that it was just as well to submit to what seemed the inevitable and so enjoy the spice of revenge over me my thoughts gave zest to my actions and i was climbing the steep pineclad slope with rapidity when i heard miss trevor below me calling out to wait for her at the point of our ascent the ridge of the tongue must have been four hundred feet above the level of the water and from this place of vantage we could easily make out the maria in the distance and note from time to time the gain of the sinclair  it wasnt fair of me i know to leave marian said miss trevor apologetically but i simply couldnt resist the temptation to come up here  i hardly think she will bear you much ill will i answered dryly you did the kindest thing possible who knows but what they are considering the advisability of an elopement  we passed a most enjoyable morning up there all things taken into account for the day was too perfect for worries we even laughed at our hunger which became keen about noon as is always the case when one has nothing to eat so we set out to explore the ridge for blackberries these were so plentiful that i gathered a hatful for our friends below and then i lingered for a last look at the boats i could make out but one was it the yacht no for there was a trace of smoke over it and yet i was sure of a mast i put my hand over my eyes  what is it asked miss trevor anxiously  the tug has the maria in tow i said and they are coming this way  we scrambled down sobered by this discovery and thinking of little else and breaking through the bushes we came upon miss thorn and the celebrity to me preoccupied with the knowledge that the tug would soon be upon us there seemed nothing strange in the attitude of these two but miss trevor remarked something out of the common at once how keenly a woman scents a situation  the celebrity was standing with his back to miss thorn at the edge of the water his chin was in the air and to a casual observer he looked to be minutely interested in a flock of gulls passing over us and miss thorn she was enthroned upon a heap of driftwood and when i caught sight of her face i forgot the very existence of the police captain her lips were parted in a smile  you are just in time irene she said calmly mr allen has asked me to be his wife  i stood with the hatful of berries in my hand like a stiff wax figure in a museum the expected had come at last and how little do we expect the expected when it comes i was aware that both the young women were looking at me and that both were quietly laughing and i must have cut a ridiculous figure indeed though i have since been informed on good authority that this was not so much i cared then what happened then came miss trevors reply and it seemed to shake the very foundations of my wits  but marian said she you cant have him he is engaged to me and if its quite the same to you i want him myself it isnt often you know that one has the opportunity to marry a celebrity  the celebrity turned around an expression of extraordinary intelligence shot across his face and i knew then that the hole in the wellnigh invulnerable armor of his conceit had been found at last and miss thorn of all people had discovered it  engaged to you she cried i cant believe it he would be untrue to everything he has written  my word should be sufficient said miss trevor stiffly may i be hung if they hadnt acted it all out before if you should wish proofs however i have several notes from him which are at your service and an inscribed photograph no marian she added shaking her head i really cannot give him up  miss thorn rose and confronted him and her dignity was inspiring is this so she demanded is it true that you are engaged to marry miss trevor  the bone of contention was badly troubled he had undoubtedly known what it was to have two women quarrelling over his hand at the same time but i am willing to bet that the sensation of having them come together in his presence was new to him  i did not think he began i was not aware that miss trevor looked upon the matter in that light and you know  what disgusting equivocation miss trevor interrupted he asked me point blank to marry him and of course i consented he has never mentioned to me that he wished to break the engagement and i wouldnt have broken it  i felt like a newsboy in a galleryi wanted to cheer and the celebrity kicked the stones and things  who would have thought she persisted that the author of the sybarites the man who chose desmond for a hero could play thus idly with the heart of woman the man who wrote these beautiful lines inconstancy in a woman because of the present social conditions is sometimes pardonable in a man nothing is more despicable and how poetic a justice it is that he has to marry me and is thus forced to lead the life of selfdenial he has conceived for his hero mr crocker will you be my attorney if he should offer any objections  the humor of this proved too much for the three of us and miss trevor herself went into peals of laughter would that the celebrity could have seen his own face i doubt if even he could have described it but i wished for his sake that the earth might have kindly opened and taken him in  marian said miss trevor i am going to be very generous i relinquish the prize to you and to you only and i flatter myself there are not many girls in this world who would do it  thank you irene miss thorn replied gravely much as i want him i could not think of depriving you  well there is a limit to all endurance and the celebrity had reached his  crocker he said how far is it to the canadian pacific  i told him  i think i had best be starting said he  and a moment later he had disappeared into the woods  we stood gazing in the direction he had taken until the sound of his progress had died away the shock of it all had considerably muddled my brain and when at last i had adjusted my thoughts to the new conditions a sensation of relief of happiness of joy call it what you will came upon me and i could scarce restrain an impulse to toss my hat in the air he was gone at last but that was not the reason i was safe from omeara and calumny nor was this all and i did not dare to look at miss thorn the knowledge that she had planned and carried out with dignity and success such a campaign filled me with awe that i had misjudged her made me despise myself then i became aware that she was speaking to me and i turned  mr crocker do you think there is any danger that he will lose his way  no miss thorn i replied he has only to get to the top of that ridge and strike the road for saville as i told him  we were silent again until miss trevor remarked  well he deserved every bit of it  and more irene said miss thorn laughing he deserved to marry you  i think he wont come west again for a very long time said i  miss trevor regarded me wickedly and i knew what was coming  i hope you are convinced now mr crocker that our sex is not as black as you painted it that miss thorn knew what she was about and that she is not the inconsistent and variable creature you took her to be  i felt the blood rush to my face and miss thorn too became scarlet she went up to the mischievous irene and grasping her arms from behind bent them until she cried for mercy  how strong you are marian it is an outrage to hurt me so i havent said anything but she was incorrigible and when she had twisted free she began again  i took it upon myself to speak a few parables to mr crocker the other day you know marian that he is one of these levelheaded old fogies who think women ought to be kept in a menagerie behind bars to be inspected on saturday afternoons now i appeal to you if it wouldnt be disastrous to fall in love with a man of such ideas and just to let you know what a literal old lawbrief he is when i said he had had a hatpin sticking in him for several weeks he nearly jumped overboard and began to feel himself all over did you know that he actually believed you were doing your best to get married to the celebrity here she dodged miss thorn again oh yes he confided in me he used to worry himself ill over that ill tell you what he said to me only  but fortunately at this juncture miss trevor was captured again and miss thorn put her hand over her mouth heaven only knows what she would have said  the two boats did not arrive until nearly four oclock owing to some trouble to the tugs propeller not knowing what excuse my client might have given for leaving some of his party ashore i thought it best to go out to meet them seated on the cabin roof of the maria i beheld mr cooke and mccann in conversation each with a black cigar too big for him  hello crocker old man shouted my client did you think i was never coming back ive had lots of sport out of this hayseed captain and he poked that official playfully but i didnt get any grub so well have to go to far harbor  i caught the hint mr cooke had given out that he had started for saville to restock the larder  no he continued brass buttons didnt let me get to saville you see when he got back to town last night they told him he had been buncoed out of the biggest thing for years and they got it into his head that i was child enough to run a ferry for criminals they told him he wasnt the sleuth he thought he was so he came back theyll have the laugh on him now for sure  mccann listened with admirable goodnature gravely pulling at his cigar and eyeing mr cooke with a friendly air of admiration  mr crocker he said with melancholy humor its leery i am with the whole shootingmatch mr cooke here is a gentleman every inch of him and so be you mr crocker but im just after taking a look at the hole in the bottom of the boat ye have yer bunks in queer places mr cooke says i its not for me to be doubting a gentlemans word sir but im thinking me man is over the hills and far away and thats true for ye  mr cooke winked expressively  mccann youve been jerked said he have another bottle  the sinclair towed us to far harbor for a consideration the wind being strong again from the south and mccann was induced by the affable owner to remain on the yellowplush yacht i cornered him before we had gone a great distance  mccann said i what made you come back today  faith mr crocker i dont care if i am telling you i always had a liking for you sir and bechune you and me it was that divil omeara what made all the trouble i wasnt taking his money not me the saints forbid but glory be to god if he didnt raise a rumpus whin i come back without allen it was sure he was that the gent left that placewhat are ye calling itmohair in the maria and we telegraphs over to asquith he swore id lose me job if i didnt fetch him today mr crocker sir its the lumber business ill be startin next week said mccann  dont let that worry you mccann i answered i will see that you dont lose your place and i give you my word again that charles wrexell allen has never been aboard this yacht or at mohair to my knowledge what is more i will prove it tomorrow to your satisfaction  mccanns faith was touching  yere not to say another word sir he said and he stuck out his big hand which i grasped warmly  my affection for mccann still remains a strong one  after my talk with mccann i was sitting on the forecastle propped against the bitts of the marias anchorchain and looking at the swirling foam cast up by the tugs propeller there were many things i wished to turn over in my mind just then but i had not long been in a state of reverie when i became conscious that miss thorn was standing beside me i got to my feet  i have been wondering how long you would remain in that trance mr crocker she said is it too much to ask what you were thinking of  now it so chanced that i was thinking of her at that moment it would never have done to say this so i stammered and miss thorn was a young woman of tact  i should not have put that to so literal a man as you she declared i fear that you are incapable of crossing swords and then she added with a slight hesitation that puzzled me i did not come up here to ask you thati came to get your opinion  my opinion i repeated  not your legal opinion she replied smiling but your opinion as a citizen as an individual if you have one to be frank i want your opinion of me do you happen to have such a thing  i had but i was in no condition to give it  do you think me a very wicked girl she asked coloring you once thought me inconsistent i believe but i am not that have i done wrong in leading the celebrity to the point where you saw him this morning  heaven forbid i cried fervently but you might have spared me a great deal had you let me into the secret  spared you a great deal said miss thorn ii dont quite understand  well i began and there i stayed all the words in the dictionary seemed to slip out of my grasp and i foundered i realized i had said something which even in my wildest moments i had not dared to think of my secret was out before i knew i possessed it bad enough had i told it to farrar in an unguarded second but to her i was blindly seeking some way of escape when she said softly  did you really care  i am man enough i hope when there is need to be and it matters not what i felt then but the words came back to me  marian i said i cared more than you will ever learn  but it seems that she had known all the time almost since that night i had met her at the train and how i shall not pretend to answer that being quite beyond me i am very sure of one thing however which is that i never told a soul man or woman or even hinted at it how was it possible when i didnt know myself  the light in the west was gone as we were pulled into far harbor and the lamps of the little town twinkled brighter than i had ever seen them before i think they must have been reflected in our faces since miss trevor when she came forward to look for us saw something there and openly congratulated us and this most embarrassing young woman demanded presently  how did it happen marian did you propose to him  i was about to protest indignantly but marian laid her hand on my arm  tell it not in asquith said she irene i wont have him teased any more  we were drawing up to the dock and for the first time i saw that a crowd was gathered there the report of this chase had gone abroad some began calling out to mccann when we came within distance among others the editor of the northern lights and beside him i perceived with amusement the generous lines of the person of mr omeara himself i hurried back to give farrar a hand with the ropes and it was omeara who caught the one i flung ashore and wound it around a pile the people pressed around peering at our party on the maria and i heard mccann exhorting them to make way and just then as he was about to cross the plank they parted for some one from behind a breathless messenger halted at the edge of the wharf he held out a telegram  mccann seized it and dived into the cabin followed closely by my client and those of us who could push after he tore open the envelope his eye ran over the lines and then he began to slap his thigh and turn around in a circle like a man dazed  whiskey shouted mr cooke get him a glass of scotch  but mccann held up his hand  holy saint patrick he said in a husky voice its upset i am bottom upwards will ye listen to this     drew is your man reddish hair and long side whiskers gray    clothes pretends to represent summer hotel syndicate allen at    asquith unknown and harmless      signed  everhardt  sew me up said mr cooke if that dont beat hell     chapter xxi  in this world of lies the good and the bad are so closely intermingled that frequently one is the means of obtaining the other therefore i wish very freely to express my obligations to the celebrity for any share he may have had in contributing to the greatest happiness of my life  marian and i were married the very next month october at my clients palatial residence of mohair this was at mr cookes earnest wish and since marian was mrs cookes own niece and an orphan there seemed no good reason why my client should not be humored in the matter as for marian and me we did not much care whether we were married at mohair or the city of mexico mrs cooke i think had a secret preference for germantown  mr cooke quite overreached himself in that wedding the knot was tied as the papers expressed it under a huge bell of yellow roses the paper also named the figure which the flowers and the collation and other things cost mr cooke a natural reticence forbids me to repeat it but lest my client should think that i undervalue his kindness i will say that we had the grandest wedding ever seen in that part of the world mccann was there and mr cooke saw to it that he had a punchbowl all to himself in which to drink our healths judge short was there still followed by the conjugal eye and senator trevor who remained over in a new long black coat to kiss the bride mr cooke chartered two cars to carry guests from the east besides those who came as ordinary citizens miss trevor was of the party and farrar of course was best man would that i had the flow of words possessed by the reporter of the chicago sunday newspaper  but there is one thing i must mention before mrs crocker and i leave for new york in a shower of rice on mr cookes own private car and that is my clients gift in addition to the check he gave marian he presented us with a huge repousse silver urn he had had made to order and he expressed a desire that the design upon it should remind us of him forever and ever i think it will mercury is duly set forth in a gorgeous equipage driving four horses around the world at a furious pace and the artist by special instructions had docked their tails  from new york mrs crocker and i went abroad and it so chanced in december that we were staying a few days at a countryplace in sussex and the subject of the sybarites was broached at a dinnerparty the book was then having its sale in england  crocker said our host do you happen to have met the author of that book hes an american  i looked across the table at my wife and we both laughed  i happen to know him intimately i replied  do you now said the englishman what a very entertaining chap he is is he not i had him down in october and by jove we were laughing the blessed time he was telling us how he wrote his novels and he said pon my soul he did that he had a secretary or something of that sort to whom he told the plot and the secretary elaborated you know and wrote the draft and he said pon my honor that sometimes the clark wrote the plot and allthe whole blessed thingand that he never saw the book except to sign his name to it  you say he was here in october asked marian when the laugh had subsided  i have the date answered our host for he left me an autograph copy of the sybarites when he went away and after dinner he showed us the book with evident pride inscribed on the flyleaf was the name of the author october 10th but a glance sufficed to convince both of us that the celebrity had never written it  john said marian to me a suspicion of the truth crossing her mind john can it be the bicycle man  yes it can be i said it is  well said marian hes been doing a little more for our friend than we did  nor was this the last we heard of that meteoric trip through england which the alleged author of the sybarites had indulged in he did not go up to london not he it was given out that he was travelling for his health that he did not wish to be lionized and there were friends of the author in the metropolis who had never heard of his secretary and who were at a loss to understand his conduct they felt slighted one of these told me that the celebrity had been to a lincolnshire estate where he had created a decided sensation by his riding to hounds something the celebrity had never been known to do and before we crossed the channel marian saw another autograph copy of the famous novel  one day some months afterwards we were sitting in our little salon in a paris hotel when a card was sent up which marian took  john she cried its the celebrity  it was the celebrity in the flesh faultlessly groomed and clothed with frock coat gloves and stick he looked the picture of ruddy manly health and strength and we saw at once that he bore no illwill for the past he congratulated us warmly and it was my turn to offer him a cigarette he was nothing loath to reminisce on the subject of his experiences in the wilds of the northern lakes or even to laugh over them he asked affectionately after his friend cooke time had softened his feelings and we learned that he had another girl who was in paris just then and invited us on the spot to dine with her at josephs let me say in passing that as usual she did credit to the celebritys exceptional taste  now said he i have something to tell you two  he asked for another cigarette and i laid the box beside him  i suppose you reached saville all right i said anticipating  seven at night said he and so hungry that i ate what they call marble cake for supper and a great many other things out of little side dishes and nearly died of indigestion afterward then i took a train up to the main line an express came along why not go west i asked myself and i jumped aboard it was another whimyou know i am subject to them when i got to victoria i wired for money and sailed to japan and then i went on to india and through the suez taking things easy i fell in with some people i knew who were going where the spirit moved them and i went along  algiers for one place and whom do you think i saw there in the lobby of a hotel  charles wrexell allen cried marian and i together  the celebrity looked surprised how did you know he demanded  go on with your story said marian what did he do  what did he do said the celebrity why the blackguard stepped up and shook me by the hand and asked after my health and wanted to know whether i were married yet he was so beastly familiar that i took out my glass and i got him into a cafe for fear some one would see me with him my dear fellow said he you did me the turn of my lifehow can i ever repay you hang your impudence said i but i wanted to hear what he had to say dont lose your temper old chap he laughed you took a few liberties with my name and there was no good reason why i shouldnt take some with yours was there when i think of it the thing was most decidedly convenient it was the hand of providence you took liberties with my name i cried with that he coolly called to the waiter to fill our glasses now said he ive got a story for you do you remember the cotillon or whatever it was that cooke gave well that was all in the chicago papers and the miles standish agent there saw it and he knew pretty well that i wasnt west so he sent me the papers just for fun you may imagine my surprise when i read that i had been leading a dance out at mohair or some such barbarous place in the northwest i looked it up on the map asquith i mean and then i began to think i wondered who in the devil it might be who had taken my name and occupation and all that you see i had just relieved the company of a little money and it hit me like a clap of thunder one day that the idiot was you but i couldnt be sure and as long as i had to get out very soon anyway i concluded to go to mohair and make certain and then pile things off on you if you happened to be the man  at this point marian and i were seized with laughter in which the celebrity himself joined presently he continued  so i went said allen i provided myself with two disguises as a careful man should but by the time i reached that outlandish hole asquith the little thing i was mixed up in burst prematurely and the papers were full of it that morning the whole place was out with sticks so to speak hunting for you they told me the published description hit you to a dot all except the scar and they quarrelled about that i posed as the promoter of resort syndicates and i hired the scimitar and sailed over to bear island and i didnt have a bad time that afternoon only cooke insisted on making remarks about my whiskers and i was in mortal fear lest he might accidentally pull one off he came cursed near it by the way hes the very deuce of a man isnt he i knew he took me for a detective so i played the part and in the night that ass of a state senator nearly gave me pneumonia by getting me out in the air to tell me they had hid you in a cave so i sat up all night and followed the relief party in the morning and you nearly disfigured me for life when you threw that bottle into the woods then i went back to camp and left so fast that i forgot my extra pair of red whiskers i had two of each disguise you know so i didnt miss them  i guess mr allen went on gleefully that i got off about as cleanly as any criminal ever did thanks to you if wed fixed the thing up between us it couldnt have been any neater could it because i went straight to far harbor and got you into a peck of trouble right away and then slipped quietly into canada and put on the outfit of a travelling salesman and right here another bright idea struck me why not carry the thing farther i knew that you had advertised a trip to europe why the lord only knows so i went east and sailed for england on the canadian line and let me thank you for a little sport i had in a quiet way as the author of the sybarites i think i astonished some of your friends old boy  the celebrity lighted another cigarette  so if it hadnt been for me he said the miles standish bicycle company wouldnt have gone to the wall can they sentence me for assisting allen to get away crocker if they can i believe i shall stay over here  i think you are safe said i but didnt allen tell you any more  no a man he used to know came into the cafe and allen got out of the back door and i never saw him again  i believe i can tell you a little more said marian           the celebrity is still writing books of a high moral tone and unapproachable principle and his popularity is undiminished i have not heard however that he has given way to any more whims           pg editors bookmarks       a mans character
