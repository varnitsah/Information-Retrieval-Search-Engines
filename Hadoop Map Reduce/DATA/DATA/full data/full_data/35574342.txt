35574342	teatable talk     chapter i    they are very pretty some of them said the woman of the world not the sort of letters i should have written myself  i should like to see a loveletter of yours interrupted the minor poet  it is very kind of you to say so replied the woman of the world it never occurred to me that you would care for one  it is what i have always maintained retorted the minor poet you have never really understood me  i believe a volume of assorted loveletters would sell well said the girton girl written by the same hand if you like but to different correspondents at different periods  to the same person one is bound more or less to repeat oneself  or from different lovers to the same correspondent suggested the philosopher  it would be interesting to observe the response of various temperaments exposed to an unvaried influence  it would throw light on the vexed question whether the qualities that adorn our beloved are her own or ours lent to her for the occasion would the same woman be addressed as my queen by one correspondent and as dear popsy wopsy by another or would she to all her lovers be herself  you might try it i suggested to the woman of the world selecting of course only the more interesting  it would cause so much unpleasantness dont you think replied the woman of the world  those i left out would never forgive me it is always so with people you forget to invite to a funeralthey think it is done with deliberate intention to slight them  the first loveletter i ever wrote said the minor poet was when i was sixteen  her name was monica she was the lefthand girl in the third joint of the crocodile  i have never known a creature so ethereally beautiful  i wrote the letter and sealed it but i could not make up my mind whether to slip it into her hand when we passed them as we usually did on thursday afternoons or to wait for sunday  there can be no question murmured the girton girl abstractedly the best time is just as one is coming out of church  there is so much confusion besides one has ones prayerbooki beg your pardon  i was saved the trouble of deciding continued the minor poet on thursday her place was occupied by a fat redheaded girl who replied to my look of inquiry with an idiotic laugh and on sunday i searched the hypatia house pews for her in vain  i learnt subsequently that she had been sent home on the previous wednesday suddenly  it appeared that i was not the only one  i left the letter where i had placed it at the bottom of my desk and in course of time forgot it  years later i fell in love really  i sat down to write her a loveletter that should imprison her as by some subtle spell  i would weave into it the love of all the ages  when i had finished it i read it through and was pleased with it  then by an accident as i was going to seal it i overturned my desk and on to the floor fell that other loveletter i had written seven years before when a boy  out of idle curiosity i tore it open i thought it would afford me amusement  i ended by posting it instead of the letter i had just completed  it carried precisely the same meaning but it was better expressed with greater sincerity with more artistic simplicity  after all said the philosopher what can a man do more than tell a woman that he loves her  all the rest is mere picturesque amplification on a par with the full and descriptive report from our special correspondent elaborated out of a threeline telegram of reuters  following that argument said the minor poet you could reduce romeo and juliet to a twoline tragedy   lass and lad loved like mad  silly muddle very sad  to be told that you are loved said the girton girl is only the beginning of the theoremits proposition so to speak  or the argument of the poem murmured the old maid  the interest continued the girton girl lies in proving itwhy does he love me  i asked a man that once said the woman of the world  he said it was because he couldnt help it  it seemed such a foolish answer the sort of thing your housemaid always tells you when she breaks your favourite teapot  and yet i suppose it was as sensible as any other  more so commented the philosopher  it is the only possible explanation  i wish said the minor poet it were a question one could ask of people without offence i so often long to put it  why do men marry viragoes pimply girls with incipient moustaches  why do beautiful heiresses choose thicklipped little men who bully them  why are old bachelors generally speaking sympathetic kindhearted men and old maids so many of them sweetlooking and amiable  i think said the old maid that perhaps  but there she stopped  pray go on said the philosopher  i shall be so interested to have your views  it was nothing really said the old maid i have forgotten  if only one could obtain truthful answers the minor poet what a flood of light they might let fall on the hidden half of life  it seems to me said the philosopher that if anything love is being exposed to too much light  the subject is becoming vulgarised  every year a thousand problem plays and novels poems and essays tear the curtain from loves temple drag it naked into the marketplace for grinning crowds to gape at  in a million short stories wouldbe comic wouldbe serious it is handled more or less coarsely more or less unintelligently gushed over gibed and jeered at  not a shred of selfrespect is left to it  it is made the central figure of every farce danced and sung round in every musichall yelled at by gallery guffawed at by stalls  it is the stockintrade of every comic journal  could any god even a mumbo jumbo so treated hold its place among its votaries  every term of endearment has become a catchword every caress mocks us from the hoardings  every tender speech we make recalls to us even while we are uttering it a hundred parodies  every possible situation has been spoilt for us in advance by the american humorist  i have sat out a good many parodies of hamlet said the minor poet but the play still interests me  i remember a walking tour i once took in bavaria  in some places the waysides are lined with crucifixes that are either comic or repulsive  there is a firm that turns them out by machinery  yet to the peasants who pass by the christ is still beautiful  you can belittle only what is already contemptible  patriotism is a great virtue replied the philosopher  the jingoes have made it ridiculous  on the contrary said the minor poet they have taught us to distinguish between the true and the false  so it is with love the more it is cheapened ridiculed employed for market purposes the less the inclination to affect itto be in love with love as heine admitted he was for its own sake  is the necessity to love born in us said the girton girl or do we practise to acquire it because it is the fashionmake up our mind to love as boys learn to smoke because every other fellow does it and we do not like to be peculiar  the majority of men and women said the minor poet are incapable of love  with most it is a mere animal passion with others a mild affection  we talk about love said the philosopher as though it were a known quantity  after all to say that a man loves is like saying that he paints or plays the violin it conveys no meaning until we have witnessed his performance  yet to hear the subject discussed one might imagine the love of a dante or a society johnny of a cleopatra or a georges sand to be precisely the same thing  it was always poor susans trouble said the woman of the world she could never be persuaded that jim really loved her  it was very sad because i am sure he was devoted to her in his way  but he could not do the sort of things she wanted him to do she was so romantic  he did try  he used to go to all the poetical plays and study them  but he hadnt the knack of it and he was naturally clumsy  he would rush into the room and fling himself on his knees before her never noticing the dog so that instead of pouring out his heart as he had intended he would have to start off with so awfully sorry  hope i havent hurt the little beast  which was enough to put anybody out  young girls are so foolish said the old maid they run after what glitters and do not see the gold until it is too late  at first they are all eyes and no heart  i knew a girl i said or rather a young married woman who was cured of folly by the homoeopathic method  her great trouble was that her husband had ceased to be her lover  it seems to me so sad said the old maid  sometimes it is the womans fault sometimes the mans more often both  the little courtesies the fond words the tender nothings that mean so much to those that loveit would cost so little not to forget them and they would make life so much more beautiful  there is a line of common sense running through all things i replied the secret of life consists in not diverging far from it on either side  he had been the most devoted wooer never happy out of her eyes but before they had been married a year she found to her astonishment that he could be content even away from her skirts that he actually took pains to render himself agreeable to other women  he would spend whole afternoons at his club slip out for a walk occasionally by himself shut himself up now and again in his study  it went so far that one day he expressed a distinct desire to leave her for a week and go afishing with some other men  she never complainedat least not to him  that is where she was foolish said the girton girl  silence in such cases is a mistake  the other party does not know what is the matter with you and you yourselfyour temper bottled up within become more disagreeable every day  she confided her trouble to a friend i explained  i so dislike people who do that said the woman of the world emily never would speak to george she would come and complain about him to me as if i were responsible for him  i wasnt even his mother  when she had finished george would come along and i had to listen to the whole thing over again from his point of view i got so tired of it at last that i determined to stop it  how did you succeed asked the old maid who appeared to be interested in the recipe  i knew george was coming one afternoon explained the woman of the world so i persuaded emily to wait in the conservatory  she thought i was going to give him good advice instead of that i sympathised with him and encouraged him to speak his mind freely which he did  it made her so mad that she came out and told him what she thought of him  i left them at it  they were both of them the better for it and so was i  in my case i said it came about differently  her friend explained to him just what was happening  she pointed out to him how his neglect and indifference were slowly alienating his wifes affections from him  he argued the subject  but a lover and a husband are not the same he contended the situation is entirely different  you run after somebody you want to overtake but when you have caught him up you settle down quietly and walk beside him you dont continue shouting and waving your handkerchief after you have gained him  their mutual friend presented the problem differently  you must hold what you have won she said or it will slip away from you  by a certain course of conduct and behaviour you gained a sweet girls regard show yourself other than you were how can you expect her to think the same of you  you mean he inquired that i should talk and act as her husband exactly as i did when her lover  precisely said the friend why not  it seems to me a mistake he grumbled  try it and see said the friend  all right he said i will  and he went straight home and set to work  was it too late asked the old maid or did they come together again  for the next mouth i answered they were together twentyfour hours of the day  and then it was the wife who suggested like the poet in gilberts patience the delight with which she would welcome an occasional afternoon off  he hung about her while she was dressing in the morning  just as she had got her hair fixed he would kiss it passionately and it would come down again  all mealtime he would hold her hand under the table and insist on feeding her with a fork  before marriage he had behaved once or twice in this sort of way at picnics and after marriage when at breakfasttime he had sat at the other end of the table reading the paper or his letters she had reminded him of it reproachfully  the entire day he never left her side  she could never read a book instead he would read to her aloud generally browning poems or translations from goethe  reading aloud was not an accomplishment of his but in their courting days she had expressed herself pleased at his attempts and of this he took care in his turn to remind her  it was his idea that if the game were played at all she should take a hand also  if he was to blither it was only fair that she should bleat back  as he explained for the future they would both be lovers all their life long and no logical argument in reply could she think of  if she tried to write a letter he would snatch away the paper her dear hands were pressing and fall to kissing itand of course smearing it  when he wasnt giving her pins and needles by sitting on her feet he was balancing himself on the arm of her chair and occasionally falling over on top of her  if she went shopping he went with her and made himself ridiculous at the dressmakers  in society he took no notice of anybody but of her and was hurt if she spoke to anybody but to him  not that it was often during that month that they did see any society most invitations he refused for them both reminding her how once upon a time she had regarded an evening alone with him as an entertainment superior to all others  he called her ridiculous names talked to her in baby language while a dozen times a day it became necessary for her to take down her back hair and do it up afresh  at the end of a month as i have said it was she who suggested a slight cessation of affection  had i been in her place said the girton girl it would have been a separation i should have suggested  i should have hated him for the rest of my life  for merely trying to agree with you i said  for showing me i was a fool for ever having wanted his affection replied the girton girl  you can generally said the philosopher make people ridiculous by taking them at their word  especially women murmured the minor poet  i wonder said the philosopher is there really so much difference between men and women as we think  what there is may it not be the result of civilisation rather than of nature of training rather than of instinct  deny the contest between male and female and you deprive life of half its poetry urged the minor poet  poetry returned the philosopher was made for man not man for poetry  i am inclined to think that the contest you speak of is somewhat in the nature of a putup job on the part of you poets in the same way newspapers will always advocate war it gives them something to write about and is not altogether unconnected with sales  to test natures original intentions it is always safe to study our cousins the animals  there we see no sign of this fundamental variation the difference is merely one of degree  i quite agree with you said the girton girl  man acquiring cunning saw the advantage of using his one superiority brute strength to make woman his slave  in all other respects she is undoubtedly his superior  in a womans argument i observed equality of the sexes invariably does mean the superiority of woman  that is very curious added the philosopher  as you say a woman never can be logical  are all men logical demanded the girton girl  as a class replied the minor poet yes    chapter ii    what woman suffers from said the philosopher is overpraise it has turned her head  you admit then that she has a head demanded the girton girl  it has always been a theory of mine returned the philosopher that by nature she was intended to possess one  it is her admirers who have always represented her as brainless  why is it that the brainy girl invariably has straight hair asked the woman of the world  because she doesnt curl it explained the girton girl  she spoke somewhat snappishly it seemed to me  i never thought of that murmured the woman of the world  it is to be noted in connection with the argument i ventured to remark that we hear but little concerning the wives of intellectual men  when we do as in the case of the carlyles it is to wish we did not  when i was younger even than i am now said the minor poet i thought a good deal of marriagevery young men do  my wife i told myself must be a woman of mind  yet curiously of all the women i have ever loved no single one has been remarkable for intellect present company as usual of course excepted  why is it sighed the philosopher that in the most serious business of our life marriage serious considerations count for next to nothing  a dimpled chin can and often does secure for a girl the best of husbands while virtue and understanding combined cannot be relied upon to obtain her even one of the worst  i think the explanation is replied the minor poet that as regards let us say the most natural business of our life marriage our natural instincts alone are brought into play marriageclothe the naked fact in what flowers of rhetoric we will has to do with the purely animal part of our being  the man is drawn towards it by his primeval desires the woman by her inborn craving towards motherhood  the thin white hands of the old maid fluttered troubled where they lay upon her lap  why should we seek to explain away all the beautiful things of life she said  she spoke with a heat unusual to her  the blushing lad so timid so devotional worshipping as at the shrine of some mystic saint the young girl moving spell bound among dreams  they think of nothing but of one another  tracing a mountain stream to its sombre source need not mar its music for us as it murmurs through the valley expounded the philosopher  the hidden law of our being feeds each leaf of our life as sap runs through the tree  the transient blossom the ripened fruit is but its changing outward form  i hate going to the roots of things said the woman of the world poor dear papa was so fond of doing that  he would explain to us the genesis of oysters just when we were enjoying them  poor mamma could never bring herself to touch them after that  while in the middle of dessert he would stop to argue with my uncle paul whether pigs blood or bullocks was the best for grape vines  i remember the year before emily came out her favourite pony died i have never known her so cut up about anything before or since  she asked papa if he would mind her having the poor creature buried in the garden her idea was that she would visit now and then its grave and weep awhile  papa was awfully nice about it and stroked her hair certainly my dear he said we will have him laid to rest in the new strawberry bed  just then old pardoe the head gardener came up to us and touched his hat  well i was just going to inquire of miss emily he said if she wouldnt rather have the poor thing buried under one of the nectarinetrees  they aint been doing very well of late  he said it was a pretty spot and that he would put up a sort of stone  poor emily didnt seem to care much where the animal was buried by that time so we left them arguing the question  i forget how it was settled but i know we neither of us ate either strawberries or nectarines for the next two years  there is a time for everything agreed the philosopher  with the lover penning poetry to the wondrous red and white upon his mistress cheek we do not discuss the subject of pigment in the blood its cause and probable duration  nevertheless the subject is interesting  we men and women continued the minor poet we are natures favourites her hope for whom she has made sacrifice putting aside so many of her own convictions telling herself she is old fashioned  she has let us go from her to the strange school where they laugh at all her notions  we have learnt new strange ideas that bewilder the good dame  yet returning home it is curious to notice how little in the few essential things of life we differ from her other children who have never wandered from her side  our vocabulary has been extended and elaborated yet face to face with the realities of existence it is unavailing  clasping the living standing beside the dead our language still is but a cry  our wants have grown more complicated the tencourse banquet with all that it involves has substituted itself for the handful of fruits and nuts gathered without labour the stalled ox and a world of trouble for the dinner of herbs and leisure therewith  are we so far removed thereby above our little brother who having swallowed his simple succulent worm mounts a neighbouring twig and with easy digestion carols thanks to god  the square brick box about which we move hampered at every step by wooden lumber decked with many rags and strips of coloured paper cumbered with odds and ends of melted flint and moulded clay has replaced the cheap convenient cave  we clothe ourselves in the skins of other animals instead of allowing our own to develop into a natural protection  we hang about us bits of stone and metal but underneath it all we are little twolegged animals struggling with the rest to live and breed  beneath each hedgerow in the springtime we can read our own romances in the makingthe first faint stirring of the blood the roving eye the sudden marvellous discovery of the indispensable she the wooing the denial hope coquetry despair contention rivalry hate jealousy love bitterness victory and death  our comedies our tragedies are being played upon each blade of grass  in fur and feather we run epitomised  i know said the woman of the world i have heard it all so often  it is nonsense i can prove it to you  that is easy observed the philosopher  the sermon on the mount itself has been proved nonsenseamong others by a bishop nonsense is the reverse side of the patternthe tangled ends of the thread that wisdom weaves  there was a miss askew at the college said the girton girl  she agreed with every one  with marx she was a socialist with carlyle a believer in benevolent despotism with spinoza a materialist with newman a fanatic  i had a long talk with her before she left and tried to understand her she was an interesting girl  i think she said i could choose among them if only they would answer one another  but they dont  they wont listen to one another  they only repeat their own case  there never is an answer explained the philosopher  the kernel of every sincere opinion is truth  this life contains only the questionsthe solutions to be published in a future issue  she was a curious sort of young woman smiled the girton girl we used to laugh at her  i can quite believe it commented the philosopher  it is so like shopping said the old maid  like shopping exclaimed the girton girl  the old maid blushed  i was merely thinking she said  it sounds foolish  the idea occurred to me  you were thinking of the difficulty of choosing i suggested  yes answered the old maid  they will show you so many different things one is quite unableat least i know it is so in my own case  i get quite angry with myself  it seems so weakminded but i cannot help it  this very dress i have on now  it is very charming said the woman of the world in itself  i have been admiring it  though i confess i think you look even better in dark colours  you are quite right replied the old maid myself i hate it but you know how it is  i seemed to have been all the morning in the shop  i felt so tired  if only  the old maid stopped abruptly  i beg your pardon she said i am afraid ive interrupted  i am so glad you told us said the philosopher  do you know that seems to me an explanation  of what asked the girton girl  of how so many of us choose our views returned the philosopher we dont like to come out of the shop without something  but you were about to explain continued the philosopher turning to the woman of the world to prove a point  that i had been talking nonsense reminded her the minor poet if you are sure it will not weary you  not at all answered the woman of the world it is quite simple the gifts of civilisation cannot be the meaningless rubbish you advocates of barbarism would make out  i remember uncle pauls bringing us home a young monkey he had caught in africa  with the aid of a few logs we fitted up a sort of stagetree for this little brother of mine as i suppose you would call him in the gunroom it was an admirable imitation of the thing to which he and his ancestors must have been for thousands of years accustomed and for the first two nights he slept perched among its branches  on the third the little brute turned the poor cat out of its basket and slept on the eiderdown after which no more tree for him real or imitation  at the end of the three months if we offered him monkeynuts he would snatch them from our hand and throw them at our head  he much preferred gingerbread and weak tea with plenty of sugar and when we wanted him to leave the kitchen fire and enjoy a run in the garden we had to carry him out swearingi mean he was swearing of course  i quite agree with him  i much prefer this chair on which i am sittingthis wooden lumber as you term it to the most comfortable lump of old red sandstone that the best furnished cave could possibly afford and i am degenerate enough to fancy that i look very nice in this frockmuch nicer than my brothers or sisters to whom it originally belonged  they didnt know how to make the best of it  you would look charming anyhow i murmured with conviction even   i know what you are going to say interrupted the woman of the world please dont  its very shocking and besides i dont agree with you  i should have had a thick coarse skin with hair all over me and nothing by way of a change  i am contending said the minor poet that what we choose to call civilisation has done little beyond pandering to our animal desires your argument confirms my theory  your evidence in support of civilisation comes to thisthat it can succeed in tickling the appetites of a monkey  you need not have gone back so far  the noble savage of today flings aside his clear spring water to snatch at the missionarys gin  he will even discard his feathers which at least were picturesque for a chimneypot hat innocent of nap plaid trousers and cheap champagne follow in due course  where is the advancement  civilisation provides us with more luxuries for our bodies  that i grant you  has it brought us any real improvement that could not have been arrived at sooner by other roads  it has given us art said the girton girl  when you say us replied the minor poet i presume you are referring to the one person in half a million to whom art is anything more than a name  dismissing the countless hordes who have absolutely never heard the word and confining attention to the few thousands scattered about europe and america who prate of it how many of even these do you think it really influences entering into their lives refining broadening them  watch the faces of the thin but conscientious crowd streaming wearily through our miles of picture galleries and art museums gaping with guidebook in hand at ruined temple or cathedral tower striving with the spirit of the martyr to feel enthusiasm for old masters at which left to themselves they would enjoy a good laughfor chipped statues which uninstructed they would have mistaken for the damaged stock of a suburban teagarden  not more than one in twelve enjoys what he is looking at and he by no means is bound to be the best of the dozen  nero was a genuine lover of art and in modern times august the strong of saxony the man of sin as carlyle calls him has left undeniable proof behind him that he was a connoisseur of the first water  one recalls names even still more recent  are we so sure that art does elevate  you are talking for the sake of talking told him the girton girl  one can talk for the sake of thinking also reminded her the minor poet  the argument is one that has to be faced  but admitting that art has been of service to mankind on the whole that it possesses onetenth of the soulforming properties claimed for it in the advertisementwhich i take to be a generous estimateits effect upon the world at large still remains infinitesimal  it works down maintained the girton girl  from the few it spreads to the many  the process appears to be somewhat slow answered the minor poet the result for whatever it may be worth we might have obtained sooner by doing away with the middleman  what middleman demanded the girton girl  the artist explained the minor poet the man who has turned the whole thing into a business the shopman who sells emotions over the counter  a corot a turner is after all but a poor apology compared with a walk in spring through the black forest or the view from hampstead heath on a november afternoon  had we been less occupied acquiring the advantages of civilisation working upward through the weary centuries to the city slum the corrugatediron roofed farm we might have found time to learn to love the beauty of the world  as it is we have been so busy civilising ourselves that we have forgotten to live  we are like an old lady i once shared a carriage with across the simplon pass  by the way i remarked one is going to be saved all that bother in the future  they have nearly completed the new railway line one will be able to go from domo dorsola to brieg in a little over the two hours  they tell me the tunnelling is wonderful  it will be very charming sighed the minor poet  i am looking forward to a future when thanks to civilisation travel will be done away with altogether  we shall be sewn up in a sack and shot there  at the time i speak of we still had to be content with the road winding through some of the most magnificent scenery in switzerland  i rather enjoyed the drive myself but my companion was quite unable to appreciate it  not because she did not care for scenery  as she explained to me she was passionately fond of it but her luggage claimed all her attention  there were seventeen pieces of it altogether and every time the ancient vehicle lurched or swayed which on an average was once every thirty seconds she was in terror lest one or more of them should be jerked out  half her day was taken up in counting them and rearranging them and the only view in which she was interested was the cloud of dust behind us  one bonnetbox did contrive during the course of the journey to make its escape after which she sat with her arms round as many of the remaining sixteen articles as she could encompass and sighed  i knew an italian countess said the woman of the world she had been at school with mamma  she never would go half a mile out of her way for scenery  why should i she would say  what are the painters for  if there is anything good let them bring it to me and i will look at it  she said she preferred the picture to the real thing it was so much more artistic  in the landscape itself she complained there was sure to be a chimney in the distance or a restaurant in the foreground that spoilt the whole effect  the artist left it out  if necessary he could put in a cow or a pretty girl to help the thing  the actual cow if it happened to be there at all would probably be standing the wrong way round the girl in all likelihood would be fat and plain or be wearing the wrong hat the artist knew precisely the sort of girl that ought to be there and saw to it that she was there with just the right sort of hat she said she had found it so all through lifethe poster was always an improvement on the play  it is rapidly coming to that answered the minor poet  nature as a well known painter once put it is not creeping up fast enough to keep pace with our ideals  in advanced germany they improve the waterfalls and ornament the rocks  in paris they paint the babies faces  you can hardly lay the blame for that upon civilisation pleaded the girton girl  the ancient briton had a pretty taste in woads  mans first feeble steps upon the upward path of art assented the minor poet culminating in the rougepot and the hairdye  come laughed the old maid you are narrowminded  civilisation has given us music  surely you will admit that has been of help to us  my dear lady replied the minor poet you speak of the one accomplishment with which civilisation has had little or nothing to do the one art that nature has bestowed upon man in common with the birds and insects the one intellectual enjoyment we share with the entire animal creation excepting only the canines and even the howling of the dogone cannot be suremay be an honest however unsatisfactory attempt towards a music of his own  i had a fox terrier once who invariably howled in tune  jubal hampered not helped us  he it was who stifled music with the curse of professionalism so that now like shivering shopboys paying gate money to watch games they cannot play we sit mute in our stalls listening to the paid performer  but for the musician music might have been universal  the human voice is still the finest instrument that we possess  we have allowed it to rust the better to hear clever manipulators blow through tubes and twang wires  the musical world might have been a literal expression  civilisation has contracted it to designate a coterie  by the way said the woman of the world talking of music have you heard that last symphony of griegs  it came in the last parcel  i have been practising it  oh do let us hear it urged the old maid  i love grieg  the woman of the world rose and opened the piano  myself i have always been of opinion i remarked  please dont chatter said the minor poet    chapter iii    i never liked her said the old maid i always knew she was heartless  to my thinking said the minor poet she has shown herself a true woman  really said the woman of the world laughing i shall have to nickname you dr  johnson redivivus  i believe were the subject under discussion you would admire the coiffure of the furies  it would occur to you that it must have been naturally curly  it is the irish blood flowing in his veins i told them  he must always be agin the government  we ought to be grateful to him remarked the philosopher  what can be more uninteresting than an agreeable conversation i mean a conversationwhere everybody is in agreement  disagreement on the other hand is stimulating  maybe that is the reason i suggested why modern society is so tiresome an affair  by tabooing all difference of opinion we have eliminated all zest from our intercourse  religion sex politics any subject on which man really thinks is scrupulously excluded from all polite gatherings  conversation has become a chorus or as a writer wittily expressed it the pursuit of the obvious to no conclusion  when not occupied with mumbling i quite agree with youas you saythat is precisely my opinionwe sit about and ask each other riddles  what did the proboer  why did julius caesar  fashion has succeeded where force for centuries has failed added the philosopher  one notices the tendency even in public affairs it is bad form nowadays to belong to the opposition  the chief aim of the church is to bring itself into line with worldly opinion the nonconformist conscience grows every day a still smaller voice  i believe said the woman of the world that was the reason why emily never got on with poor dear george  he agreed with her in everything  she used to say it made her feel such a fool  man is a fighting animal explained the philosopher  an officer who had been through the south african war was telling me only the other day  he was with a column and news came in that a small commando was moving in the neighbourhood  the column set off in the highest of spirits and after three days trying work through a difficult country came up with as they thought the enemy  as a matter of fact it was not the enemy but a troop of imperial yeomanry that had lost its way  my friend informs me that the language with which his column greeted those unfortunate yeomen their fellow countrymen men of their own bloodwas most unsympathetic  myself i should hate a man who agreed with me said the girton girl  my dear replied the woman of the world i dont think any would  why not demanded the girton girl  i was thinking more of you dear replied the woman of the world  i am glad you all concur with me murmured the minor poet  i have always myself regarded the devils advocate as the most useful officer in the court of truth  i remember being present one evening i observed at a dinner party where an eminent judge met an equally eminent k  c whose client the judge that very afternoon had condemned to be hanged it is always a satisfaction remarked to him genially the judge condemning any prisoner defended by you  one feels so absolutely certain he was guilty  the k c responded that he should always remember the judges words with pride  who was it asked the philosopher who said  before you can attack a lie you must strip it of its truth  it sounds like emerson i ventured  very possibly assented the philosopher very possibly not there is much in reputation  most poetry gets attributed to shakespeare  i entered a certain drawingroom about a week ago i said  we were just speaking about you exclaimed my hostess  is not this yours  she pointed to an article in a certain magazine lying open on the table  no i replied one or two people have asked me that same question  it seems to me rather an absurd article i added  i cannot say i thought very much of it agreed my hostess  i cant help it said the old maid  i shall always dislike a girl who deliberately sells herself for money  but what else is there to sell herself for asked the minor poet  she should not sell herself at all retorted the old maid with warmth  she should give herself for love  are we not in danger of drifting into a difference of opinion concerning the meaning of words merely replied the minor poet we have all of us i suppose heard the story of the jew clothier remonstrated with by the rabbi for doing business on the sabbath doing bithness retorted the accused with indignation you call thelling a thuit like that for eighteen shillings doing bithness by iths tharity  this love for which the maiden gives herself let us be a little more exactdoes it not include as a matter of course material more tangible  would not the adored one look somewhat astonished on discovering that having given herself for love love was all that her lover proposed to give for her  would she not naturally exclaim  but wheres the house to say nothing of the fittings  and what are we to live on  it is you now who are playing with words asserted the old maid the greater includes the less  loving her he would naturally desire  with all his worldly goods her to endow completed for her the minor poet  in other words he pays a price for her  so far as love is concerned they are quits  in marriage the man gives himself to the woman as the woman gives herself to the man  man has claimed i am aware greater liberty for himself but the claim has always been vehemently repudiated by woman  she has won her case legally and morally now husband and wife are bound by the same laws this being so her contention that she gives herself falls to the ground  she exchanges herself  over and above she alone of the twain claims a price  say a living wage corrected the philosopher  lazy rubbish lolls in petticoats and idle stupidity struts in trousers  but class for class woman does her share of the worlds work  among the poor of the two it is she who labours the longer  there is a many versed ballad popular in country districts  often i have heard it sung in shrill piping voice at harvest supper or barn dance  the chorus runs    a mans work tis till set of sun but a womans work is never done   my housekeeper came to me a few months ago said the woman of the world to tell me that my cook had given notice  i am sorry to hear it i answered has she found a better place  i am not so sure about that answered markham shes going as general servant  as general servant i exclaimed  to old hudson at the coal wharf answered markham  his wife died last year if you remember  hes got seven children poor man and no one to look after them  i suppose you mean i said that shes marrying him  well thats the way she puts it laughed markham  what i tell her is shes giving up a good home and fifty pounds a year to be a general servant on nothing a week  but they never see it  i recollect her answered the minor poet a somewhat depressing lady  let me take another case  you possess a remarkably pretty housemaidedith if i have it rightly  i have noticed her remarked the philosopher  her manners strike me as really quite exceptional  i never could stand any one about me with carroty hair remarked the girton girl  i should hardly call it carroty contended the philosopher there is a golden tint of much richness underlying when you look closely  she is a very good girl agreed the woman of the world but i am afraid i shall have to get rid of her  the other woman servants dont get on with her  do you know whether she is engaged or not demanded the minor poet  at the present moment answered the woman of the world she is walking out i believe with the eldest son of the blue lion  but she is never adverse to a change  if you are really in earnest about the matter  i was not thinking of myself said the minor poet  but suppose some young gentleman of personal attractions equal to those of the blue lion or even not quite equal possessed of two or three thousand a year were to enter the lists do you think the blue lion would stand much chance  among the upper classes continued the minor poet opportunity for observing female instinct hardly exists  the girls choice is confined to lovers able to pay the price demanded if not by the beloved herself by those acting on her behalf  but would a daughter of the working classes ever hesitate other things being equal between mayfair and seven dials  let me ask you one chimed in the girton girl  would a bricklayer hesitate any longer between a duchess and a scullery maid  but duchesses dont fall in love with bricklayers returned the minor poet  now why not  the stockbroker flirts with the barmaidcases have been known often he marries her  does the lady out shopping ever fall in love with the waiter at the bunshop hardly ever  lordlings marry ballet girls but ladies rarely put their heart and fortune at the feet of the lion comique  manly beauty and virtue are not confined to the house of lords and its dependencies  how do you account for the fact that while it is common enough for the man to look beneath him the woman will almost invariably prefer her social superior and certainly never tolerate her inferior  why should king cophetua and the beggar maid appear to us a beautiful legend while queen cophetua and the tramp would be ridiculous  the simple explanation is expounded the girton girl woman is so immeasurably mans superior that only by weighting him more or less heavily with worldly advantages can any semblance of balance be obtained  then answered the minor poet you surely agree with me that woman is justified in demanding this makeweight  the woman gives her love if you will  it is the art treasure the gilded vase thrown in with the pound of tea but the tea has to be paid for  it all sounds very clever commented the old maid yet i fail to see what good comes of ridiculing a thing ones heart tells one is sacred  do not be so sure i am wishful to ridicule answered the minor poet  love is a wondrous statue god carved with his own hands and placed in the garden of life long ago  and man knowing not sin worshipped her seeing her beautiful  till the time came when man learnt evil then saw that the statue was naked and was ashamed of it  since when he has been busy draping it now in the fashion of this age now in the fashion of that  we have shod her in dainty bottines regretting the size of her feet  we employ the best artistes to design for her cunning robes that shall disguise her shape  each season we fix fresh millinery upon her changeless head we hang around her robes of woven words  only the promise of her ample breasts we cannot altogether hide shocking us not a little only that remains to tell us that beneath the tawdry tissues still stands the changeless statue god carved with his own hands  i like you better when you talk like that said the old maid but i never feel quite sure of you  all i mean of course is that money should not be her first consideration  marriage for moneyit is not marriage one cannot speak of it  of course one must be reasonable  you mean persisted the minor poet you would have her think also of her dinner of her clothes her necessities luxuries  it is not only for herself answered the old maid  for whom demanded the minor poet  the white hands of the old maid fluttered on her lap revealing her trouble for of the old school is this sweet friend of mine  there are the children to be considered i explained  a woman feels it even without knowing  it is her instinct  the old maid smiled on me her thanks  it is where i was leading said the minor poet  woman has been appointed by nature the trustee of the children  it is her duty to think of them to plan for them  if in marriage she does not take the future into consideration she is untrue to her trust  before you go further interrupted the philosopher there is an important point to be considered  are children better or worse for a pampered upbringing  is not poverty often the best school  it is what i always tell george remarked the woman of the world when he grumbles at the tradesmens books  if papa could only have seen his way to being a poor man i feel i should have been a better wife  please dont suggest the possibility i begged the woman of the world the thought is too bewildering  you were never imaginative replied the woman of the world  not to that extent i admitted  the best mothers make the worst children quoted the girton girl  i intend to bear that in mind  your mother was a very beautiful characterone of the most beautiful i ever knew remarked the old maid  there is some truth in the saying agreed the minor poet but only because it is the exception and nature invariably puts forth all her powers to counteract the result of deviation from her laws were it the rule then the bad mother would be the good mother and the good mother the bad mother  and  please dont go on said the woman of the world  i was up late last night  i was merely going to show explained the minor poet that all roads lead to the law that the good mother is the best mother  her duty is to her children to guard their infancy to take thought for their equipment  do you seriously ask us to believe demanded the old maid that the type of woman who does marry for money considers for a single moment any human being but herself  not consciously perhaps admitted the minor poet  our instincts that they may guide us easily are purposely made selfish  the flower secretes honey for its own purposes not with any sense of charity towards the bee  man works as he thinks for beer and baccy in reality for the benefit of unborn generations the woman in acting selfishly is assisting natures plans  in olden days she chose her mate for his strength  she possibly enough thought only of herself he could best provide for her then simple wants best guard her from the disagreeable accidents of nomadic life  but nature unseen directing her was thinking of the savage brood needing still more a bold protector  wealth now is the substitute for strength  the rich man is the strong man  the womans heart unconsciously goes out to him  do men never marry for money inquired the girton girl  i ask merely for information  maybe i have been misinformed but i have heard of countries where the dot is considered of almost more importance than the bride  the german officer i ventured to strike in is literally on sale  young lieutenants are most expensive and even an elderly colonel costs a girl a hundred thousand marks  you mean corrected the minor poet costs her father  the continental husband demands a dowry with his wife and sees that he gets it  he in his turn has to save and scrape for years to provide each of his daughters with the necessary dot  it comes to the same thing precisely  your argument could only apply were woman equally with man a wealth producer  as it is a womans wealth is invariably the result of a marriage either her own or that of some shrewd ancestress  and as regards the heiress the principle of sale and purchase if i may be forgiven the employment of common terms is still more religiously enforced  it is not often that the heiress is given away stolen she may be occasionally much to the indignation of lord chancellors and other guardians of such property the thief is very properly punishedimprisoned if need be  if handed over legitimately her price is strictly exacted not always in moneythat she possesses herself maybe in sufficiency it enables her to bargain for other advantages no less serviceable to her childrenfor title place position  in the same way the neolithic woman herself of exceptional strength and ferocity may have been enabled to bestow a thought upon her savage lovers beauty his prehistoric charm of manner thus in other directions no less necessary assisting the development of the race  i cannot argue with you said the old maid  i know one case they were both poor it would have made no difference to her but it did to him  maybe i am wrong but it seems to me that as you say our instincts are given us to guide us  i do not know  the future is not in our hands it does not belong to us  perhaps it were wiser to listen to the voices that are sent to us  i remember a case also said the woman of the world  she had risen to prepare the tea and was standing with her back to us like the woman you speak of she was poor but one of the sweetest creatures i have ever known  i cannot help thinking it would have been good for the world had she been a mother  my dear lady cried the minor poet you help me  i always do according to you laughed the woman of the world  i appear to resemble the bull that tossed the small boy high into the appletree he had been trying all the afternoon to climb  it is very kind of you answered the minor poet  my argument is that woman is justified in regarding marriage as the end of her existence the particular man as but a means  the woman you speak of acted selfishly rejecting the crown of womanhood because not tendered to her by hands she had chosen  you would have us marry without love asked the girton girl  with love if possible answered the minor poet without rather than not at all  it is the fulfilment of the womans law  you would make of us goods and chattels cried the girton girl  i would make of you what you are returned the minor poet the priestesses of natures temple leading man to the worship of her mysteries  an american humorist has described marriage as the craving of some young man to pay for some young womans board and lodging  there is no escaping from this definition let us accept it  it is beautifulso far as the young man is concerned  he sacrifices himself deprives himself that he may give  that is love  but from the womans point of view  if she accept thinking only of herself then it is a sordid bargain on her part  to understand her to be just to her we must look deeper  not sexual but maternal love is her kingdom  she gives herself not to her lover but through her lover to the great goddess of the myriad breasts that shadows ever with her guardian wings life from the outstretched hand of death  she may be a nice enough girl from natures point of view said the old maid personally i shall never like her    chapter iv    what is the time asked the girton girl  i looked at my watch  twenty past four i answered  exactly demanded the girton girl  precisely i replied  strange murmured the girton girl  there is no accounting for it yet it always is so  what is there no accounting for i inquired  what is strange  it is a german superstition explained the girton girl i learnt it at school  whenever complete silence falls upon any company it is always twenty minutes past the hour  why do we talk so much demanded the minor poet  as a matter of fact observed the woman of the world i dont think we donot we personally not much  most of our time we appear to be listening to you  then why do i talk so much if you prefer to put it that way continued the minor poet  if i talked less one of you others would have to talk more  there would be that advantage about it agreed the philosopher  in all probability you returned to him the minor poet  whether as a happy party we should gain or lose by the exchange it is not for me to say though i have my own opinion  the essential remains that the stream of chatter must be kept perpetually flowing  why  there is a man i know i said you may have met him a man named longrush  he is not exactly a bore  a bore expects you to listen to him  this man is apparently unaware whether you are listening to him or not  he is not a fool  a fool is occasionally amusing longrush never  no subject comes amiss to him  whatever the topic he has something uninteresting to say about it  he talks as a pianoorgan grinds out music steadily strenuously tirelessly  the moment you stand or sit him down he begins to continue ceaselessly till wheeled away in cab or omnibus to his next haltingplace  as in the case of his prototype his rollers are changed about once a month to suit the popular taste  in january he repeats to you dan lenos jokes and gives you other peoples opinions concerning the old masters at the guildhall  in june he recounts at length what is generally thought concerning the academy and agrees with most people on most points connected with the opera  if forgetful for a momentas an englishman may be excused for beingwhether it be summer or winter one may assure oneself by waiting to see whether longrush is enthusing over cricket or football  he is always upto date  the last new shakespeare the latest scandal the man of the hour the next nine days wonderby the evening longrush has his roller ready  in my early days of journalism i had to write each evening a column for a provincial daily headed what people are saying  the editor was precise in his instructions  i dont want your opinions i dont want you to be funny never mind whether the thing appears to you to be interesting or not  i want it to be real the things people are saying  i tried to be conscientious each paragraph began with that  i wrote the column because i wanted the thirty shillings  why anybody ever read it i fail to understand to this day but i believe it was one of the popular features of the paper  longrush invariably brings back to my mind the dreary hours i spent penning that fatuous record  i think i know the man you mean said the philosopher  i had forgotten his name  i thought it possible you might have met him i replied  well my cousin edith was arranging a dinnerparty the other day and as usual she did me the honour to ask my advice  generally speaking i do not give advice nowadays  as a very young man i was generous with it  i have since come to the conclusion that responsibility for my own muddles and mistakes is sufficient  however i make an exception in ediths case knowing that never by any chance will she follow it  speaking of editors said the philosopher bates told me at the club the other night that he had given up writing the answers to correspondents personally since discovery of the fact that he had been discussing at some length the attractive topic duties of a father with his own wife who is somewhat of a humorist  there was the wife of a clergyman my mother used to tell of said the woman of the world who kept copies of her husbands sermons she would read him extracts from them in bed in place of curtain lectures  she explained it saved her trouble  everything she felt she wanted to say to him he had said himself so much more forcibly  the argument always appears to me weak said the philosopher  if only the perfect may preach our pulpits would remain empty  am i to ignore the peace that slips into my soul when perusing the psalms to deny myself all benefit from the wisdom of the proverbs because neither david nor solomon was a worthy casket of the jewels that god had placed in them  is a temperance lecturer never to quote the selfreproaches of poor cassio because master will shakespeare there is evidence to prove was a gentleman alas much too fond of the bottle  the man that beats the drum may be himself a coward  it is the drum that is the important thing to us not the drummer  of all my friends said the woman of the world the one who has the most trouble with her servants is poor jane meredith  i am exceedingly sorry to hear it observed the philosopher after a slight pause  but forgive me i really do not see  i beg your pardon answered the woman of the world  i thought everybody knew jane meredith  she writes the perfect home column for the womans world  it will always remain a riddle one supposes said the minor poet which is the real egoi the author of the simple life fourteenth edition three and sixpence net  dont pleaded the old maid with a smile please dont  dont what demanded the minor poet  dont ridicule itmake fun of it even though it may happen to be your own  there are parts of it i know by heart  i say them over to myself when dont spoil it for me  the old maid laughed but nervously  my dear lady reassured her the minor poet do not be afraid  no one regards that poem with more reverence than do i  you can have but small conception what a help it is to me also  i too so often read it to myself and when we understand  as one who turns his back on scenes of riot to drink the moonlight in quiet ways i go to it for sweetness and for peace  so much do i admire the poem i naturally feel desire and curiosity to meet its author to know him i should delight drawing him aside from the crowded room to grasp him by the hand to say to him  my dearmy very dear mr minor poet i am so glad to meet you  i would i could tell you how much your beautiful work has helped me  this my dear sirthis is indeed privilege  but i can picture so vividly the bored look with which he would receive my gush  i can imagine the contempt with which he the pure liver would regard me did he know meme the liver of the fools hot days  a short french story i once read somewhere i said rather impressed me  a poet or dramatisti am not sure whichhad married the daughter of a provincial notary  there was nothing particularly attractive about her except her dot  he had run through his own small fortune and was in some need  she worshipped him and was as he used to boast to his friends the ideal wife for a poet  she cooked admirablya useful accomplishment during the first half dozen years of their married life and afterwards when fortune came to him managed his affairs to perfection by her care and economy keeping all worldly troubles away from his study door  an ideal hausfrau undoubtedly but of course no companion for our poet  so they went their ways till choosing as in all things the right moment when she could best be spared the good lady died and was buried  and here begins the interest of the story somewhat late  one article of furniture curiously out of place among the rich appointments of their fine hotel the woman had insisted on retaining a heavy clumsily carved oak desk her father had once used in his office and which he had given to her for her own as a birthday present back in the days of her teens  you must read the story for yourselves if you would enjoy the subtle sadness that surrounds it the delicate aroma of regret through which it moves  the husband finding after some little difficulty the right key fits it into the lock of the bureau  as a piece of furniture plain solid squat it has always jarred upon his artistic sense  she too his good affectionate sara had been plain solid a trifle squat  perhaps that was why the poor woman had clung so obstinately to the one thing in the otherwise perfect house that was quite out of place there  ah well she is gone now the good creature  and the bureauno the bureau shall remain nobody will need to come into this room no one ever did come there but the woman herself  perhaps she had not been altogether so happy as she might have been  a husband less intellectualone from whom she would not have lived so far apartone who could have entered into her simple commonplace life it might have been better for both of them  he draws down the lid pulls out the largest drawer it is full of manuscripts folded and tied neatly with ribbons once gay now faded  he thinks at first they are his own writings things begun and discarded reserved by her with fondness  she thought so much of him the good soul really she could not have been so dull as he had deemed her  the power to appreciate rightly this at least she must have possessed  he unties the ribbon no the writing is her own corrected altered underlined  he opens a second a third  then with a smile he sits down to read what can they be like these poems these stories  he laughs smoothing the crumpled paper foreseeing the trite commonness the shallow sentiment  the poor child  so she likewise would have been a litterateure  even she had her ambition her dream  the sunshine climbs the wall behind him creeps stealthily across the ceiling of the room slips out softly by the window leaving him alone  all these years he had been living with a fellow poet  they should have been comrades and they had never spoken  why had she hidden herself  why had she left him never revealing herself years ago when they were first marriedhe remembers nowshe had slipped little bluebound copybooks into his pocket laughing blushing asking him to read them  how could he have guessed  of course he had forgotten them  later they had disappeared again it had never occurred to him to think  often in the earlier days she had tried to talk to him about his work  had he but looked into her eyes he might have understood  but she had always been so homelyseeming so good  who would have suspected  then suddenly the blood rushes into his face  what must have been her opinion of his work  all these years he had imagined her the amazed devotee uncomprehending but admiring  he had read to her at times comparing himself the while with moliere reading to his cook  what right had she to play this trick upon him  the folly of it  the pity of it  he would have been so glad of her  what becomes i wonder mused the philosopher of the thoughts that are never spoken  we know that in nature nothing is wasted the very cabbage is immortal living again in altered form  a thought published or spoken we can trace but such must only be a small percentage  it often occurs to me walking down the street each man and woman that i pass by each silently spinning his silken thought short or long fine or coarse  what becomes of it  i heard you say once remarked the old maid to the minor poet that thoughts are in the air that the poet but gathers them as a child plucks wayside blossoms to shape them into nosegays  it was in confidence replied the minor poet  please do not let it get about or my publisher will use it as an argument for cutting down my royalties  i have always remembered it answered the old maid  it seemed so true  a thought suddenly comes to you  i think of them sometimes as of little motherless babes creeping into our brains for shelter  it is a pretty idea mused the minor poet  i shall see them in the twilight  pathetic little roundeyed things of goblin shape dimly luminous against the darkening air  whence come you little tender thought tapping at my brain  from the lonely forest where the peasant mother croons above the cradle while she knits  thought of love and longing  lies your gallant father with his boyish eyes unblinking underneath some tropic sun  thought of life and thought of death  are you of patrician birth cradled by some highborn maiden pacing slowly some sweet garden  or did you spring to life amid the din of loom or factory  poor little nameless foundlings i shall feel myself in future quite a philanthropist taking them in adopting them  you have not yet decided reminded him the woman of the world which you really are  the gentleman we get for three and sixpence net or the one we are familiar with the one we get for nothing  please dont think i am suggesting any comparison continued the woman of the world but i have been interested in the question since george joined a bohemian club and has taken to bringing down minor celebrities from saturday to monday  i hope i am not narrow minded but there is one gentleman i have been compelled to put my foot down on  i really do not think he will complain i interrupted  the woman of the world possesses i should explain the daintiest of feet  it is heavier than you think replied the woman of the world george persists i ought to put up with him because he is a true poet  i cannot admit the argument  the poet i honestly admire  i like to have him about the place  he lies on my drawingroom table in white vellum and helps to give tone to the room  for the poet i am quite prepared to pay the fourandsix demanded the man i dont want  to be candid he is not worth his own discount  it is hardly fair urged the minor poet to confine the discussion to poets  a friend of mine some years ago married one of the most charming women in new york and that is saying a good deal everybody congratulated him and at the outset he was pleased enough with himself  i met him two years later in geneva and we travelled together as far as rome  he and his wife scarcely spoke to one another the whole journey and before i left him he was good enough to give me advice which to another man might be useful  never marry a charming woman he counselled me  anything more unutterably dull than the charming woman outside business hours you cannot conceive  i think we must agree to regard the preacher concluded the philosopher merely as a brother artist  the singer may be a heavy fleshy man with a taste for beer but his voice stirs our souls  the preacher holds aloft his banner of purity  he waves it over his own head as much as over the heads of those around him  he does not cry with the master come to me but come with me and be saved  the prayer forgive them was the prayer not of the priest but of the god  the prayer dictated to the disciples was forgive us deliver us  not that he should be braver not that he should be stronger than they that press behind him is needed of the leader but that he should know the way  he too may faint he too may fall only he alone must never turn his back  it is quite comprehensible looked at from one point of view remarked the minor poet that he who gives most to others should himself be weak  the professional athlete pays i believe the price of central weakness  it is a theory of mine that the charming delightful people one meets with in society are people who have dishonestly kept to themselves gifts entrusted to them by nature for the benefit of the whole community  your conscientious hardworking humorist is in private life a dull dog  the dishonest trustee of laughter on the other hand robbing the world of wit bestowed upon him for public purposes becomes a brilliant conversationalist  but added the minor poet turning to me you were speaking of a man named longrush a great talker  a long talker i corrected  my cousin mentioned him third in her list of invitations  longrush she said with conviction we must have longrush  isnt he rather tiresome i suggested  he is tiresome she agreed but then hes so useful  he never lets the conversation drop  why is it asked the minor poet  why when we meet together must we chatter like a mob of sparrows  why must every assembly to be successful sound like the parrothouse of a zoological garden  i remember a parrot story i said but i forget who told it to me  maybe one of us will remember as you go on suggested the philosopher  a man i saidan old farmer if i remember rightlyhad read a lot of parrot stories or had heard them at the club  as a result he thought he would like himself to be the owner of a parrot so journeyed to a dealer and according to his own account paid rather a long price for a choice specimen  a week later he reentered the shop the parrot borne behind him by a boy  this bird said the farmer this bird you sold me last week aint worth a sovereign whats the matter with it demanded the dealer  how do i know whats the matter with the bird answered the farmer  what i tell you is that it aint worth a sovereigntain t worth a half a sovereign  why not persisted the dealer it talks all right dont it  talks retorted the indignant farmer the damn thing talks all day but it never says anything funny  a friend of mine said the philosopher once had a parrot  wont you come into the garden said the woman of the world rising and leading the way    chapter v    myself said the minor poet i read the book with the most intense enjoyment  i found it inspiringso inspiring i fear i did not give it sufficient attention  i must read it again  i understand you said the philosopher  a book that really interests us makes us forget that we are reading  just as the most delightful conversation is when nobody in particular appears to be talking  do you remember meeting that russian man george brought down here about three months ago asked the woman of the world turning to the minor poet  i forget his name  as a matter of fact i never knew it  it was quite unpronounceable and except that it ended of course with a double f equally impossible to spell  i told him frankly at the beginning i should call him by his christian name which fortunately was nicholas  he was very nice about it  i remember him distinctly said the minor poet  a charming man  he was equally charmed with you replied the woman of the world  i can credit it easily murmured the minor poet  one of the most intelligent men i ever met  you talked together for two hours in a corner said the woman of the world  i asked him when you had gone what he thought of you ah what a talker he exclaimed making a gesture of admiration with his hands  i thought maybe you would notice it i answered him  tell me what did he talk about  i was curious to know you had been so absorbed in yourselves and so oblivious to the rest of us  upon my word he replied i really cannot tell you  do you know i am afraid now i come to think of it that i must have monopolised the conversation  i was glad to be able to ease his mind on that point  i really dont think you did i assured him i should have felt equally confident had i not been present  you were quite correct returned the minor poet  i have a distinct recollection of having made one or two observations myself indeed if i may say so i talked rather well  you may also recollect continued the woman of the world that the next time we met i asked you what he had said and that your mind was equally a blank on the subject  you admitted you had found him interesting  i was puzzled at the time but now i begin to understand  both of you no doubt found the conversation so brilliant each of you felt it must have been your own  a good book i addeda good talk is like a good dinner  one assimilates it  the best dinner is the dinner you do not know you have eaten  a thing will often suggest interesting thought observed the old maid without being interesting  often i find the tears coming into my eyes as i witness some stupid melodramasomething said something hinted at will stir a memory start a train of thought  i once i said sat next to a countryman in the pit of a music hall some years ago  he enjoyed himself thoroughly up to halfpast ten  songs about mothersinlaw drunken wives and wooden legs he roared at heartily  at tenthirty entered a wellknown artiste who was then giving a series of what he called condensed tragedies in verse  at the first two my country friend chuckled hugely  the third ran  little boy pair of skates  broken ice heavens gates  my friend turned white rose hurriedly and pushed his way impatiently out of the house  i left myself some ten minutes later and by chance ran against him again in the bar of the criterion where he was drinking whisky rather copiously  i couldnt stand that fool he explained to me in a husky voice  truth is my youngest kid got drowned last winter skating  dont see any sense making fun of real trouble  i can cap your story with another said the philosopher  jim sent me a couple of seats for one of his first nights a month or two ago  they did not reach me till four oclock in the afternoon  i went down to the club to see if i could pick up anybody  the only man there i knew at all was a rather quiet young fellow a new member  he had just taken batess chambers in staple innyou have met him i think  he didnt know many people then and was grateful for my invitation  the play was one of those palais royal farces it cannot matter which they are all exactly alike  the fun consists of somebodys trying to sin without being found out  it always goes well  the british public invariably welcomes the theme provided it be dealt with in a merry fashion  it is only the serious discussion of evil that shocks us  there was the usual banging of doors and the usual screaming  everybody was laughing around us  my young friend sat with rather a curious fixed smile upon his face  fairly well constructed i said to him as the second curtain fell amid yells of delight  yes he answered i suppose its very funny  i looked at him he was little more than a boy  you are rather young i said to be a moralist  he gave a short laugh  oh i shall grow out of it in time he said  he told me his story later when i came to know him better  he had played the farce himself over in melbournehe was an australian only the third act had ended differently  his girl wife of whom he was passionately fond had taken it quite seriously and had committed suicide  a foolish thing to do  man is a beast said the girton girl who was prone to strong expression  i thought so myself when i was younger said the woman of the world  and dont you now when you hear a thing like that suggested the girton girl  certainly my dear replied the woman of the world there is a deal of the animal in man butwell i was myself expressing that same particular view of him the brute to a very old lady with whom i was spending a winter in brussels many years ago now when i was quite a girl  she had been a friend of my fathers and was one of the sweetest and kindesti was almost going to say the most perfect woman i have ever met though as a celebrated beauty stories dating from the early victorian era were told about her  but myself i never believed them  her calm gentle passionless face crowned with its soft silver hairi remember my first sight of the matterhorn on a summers evening somehow it at once reminded me of her  my dear laughed the old maid your anecdotal method is becoming as jerky as a cinematograph  i have noticed it myself replied the woman of the world i try to get in too much  the art of the raconteur observed the philosopher consists in avoiding the unessential  i have a friend who never yet to my knowledge reached the end of a story  it is intensely unimportant whether the name of the man who said the thing or did the deed be brown or jones or robinson  but she will worry herself into a fever trying to recollect  dear dear me she will leave off to exclaim i know his name so well  how stupid of me  she will tell you why she ought to recollect his name how she always has recollected his name till this precise moment  she will appeal to half the people in the room to help her  it is hopeless to try and induce her to proceed the idea has taken possession of her mind after a world of unnecessary trouble she recollects that it was tomkins and is delighted only to be plunged again into despair on discovery that she has forgotten his address  this makes her so ashamed of herself she declines to continue and full of self reproach she retires to her own room  later she reenters beaming with the street and number pat  but by that time she has forgotten the anecdote  well tell us about your old lady and what it was you said to her spoke impatiently the girton girl who is always eager when the subject under discussion happens to be the imbecility or criminal tendency of the opposite sex  i was at the age continued the woman of the world when a young girl tiring of fairy stories puts down the book and looks round her at the world and naturally feels indignant at what she notices  i was very severe upon both the shortcomings and the overgoings of manour natural enemy  my old friend used to laugh and that made me think her callous and foolish  one day our bonnelike all servants a lover of gossipcame to us delighted with a story which proved to me how just had been my estimate of the male animal  the grocer at the corner of our rue married only four years to a charming and devoted little wife had run away and left her  he never gave her even a hint the pretty angel so jeanne informed us  had had his box containing his clothes and everything he wanted ready packed for a week waiting for him at the railway stationjust told her he was going to play a game of dominoes and that she was not to sit up for him kissed her and the child good night andwell that was the last she ever saw of him  did madame ever hear the like of it concluded jeanne throwing up her hands to heaven  i am sorry to say jeanne that i have replied my sweet madame with a sigh and led the conversation by slow degrees back to the subject of dinner  i turned to her when jeanne had left the room  i can remember still the burning indignation of my face i had often spoken to the man myself and had thought what a delightful husband he wasso kind so attentive so proud seemingly of his dainty femme  doesnt that prove what i say i cried that men are beasts  i am afraid it helps in that direction replied my old friend  and yet you defend them i answered  at my age my dear she replied one neither defends nor blames one tries to understand  she put her thin white hand upon my head  shall we hear a little more of the story she said it is not a pleasant one but it may be useful to us  i dont want to hear any more of it i answered i have heard enough it is sometimes well she persisted to hear the whole of a case before forming our judgment  and she rang the bell for jeanne that story about our little grocer friend she saidit is rather interesting to me  why did he leave her and run awaydo you know jeanne shrugged her ample shoulders  oh the old story madame she answered with a short laugh  who was she asked my friend the wife of monsieur savary the wheelwright as good a husband as ever a woman had  its been going on for months the hussy thank you that will do jeanne  she turned again to me so soon as jeanne had left the room  my dear she said whenever i see a bad man i peep round the corner for the woman  whenever i see a bad woman i follow her eyes i know she is looking for her mate nature never makes odd samples  i cannot help thinking said the philosopher that a good deal of harm is being done to the race as a whole by the overpraise of women  who overpraises them demanded the girton girl  men may talk nonsense to usi dont know whether any of us are foolish enough to believe itbut i feel perfectly sure that when they are alone most of their time is occupied in abusing us  that is hardly fair interrupted the old maid  i doubt if they do talk about us among themselves as much as we think  besides it is always unwise to go behind the verdict  some very beautiful things have been said about women by men  well ask them said the girton girl  here are three of them present  now honestly when you talk about us among yourselves do you gush about our virtue and goodness and wisdom  gush said the philosopher reflecting gush would hardly be the correct word  in justice to the truth i said i must admit our girton friend is to a certain extent correct  every man at some time of his life esteems to excess some one particular woman  very young men lacking in experience admire perhaps indiscriminately  to them anything in a petticoat is adorable  the milliner makes the angel and very old men so i am told return to the delusions of their youth but as to this i cannot as yet speak positively  the rest of uswell when we are alone it must be confessed as our philosopher says that gush is not the correct word  i told you so chortled the girton girl  maybe i added it is merely the result of reaction  convention insists that to her face we show her a somewhat exaggerated deference  her very follies we have to regard as added charmsthe poets have decreed it  maybe it comes as a relief to let the pendulum swing back  but is it not a fact asked the old maid that the best men and even the wisest are those who have held women in most esteem  do we not gauge civilization by the position a nation accords to its women  in the same way as we judge them by the mildness of their laws their tenderness for the weak  uncivilised man killed off the useless numbers of the tribe we provide for them hospitals almshouses  mans attitude towards woman proves the extent to which he has conquered his own selfishness the distance he has travelled from the law of the ape  might is right  please dont misunderstand me pleaded the philosopher with a nervous glance towards the lowering eyebrows of the girton girl  i am not saying for a moment woman is not the equal of man indeed it is my belief that she is  i am merely maintaining she is not his superior  the wise man honours woman as his friend his fellow labourer his complement  it is the fool who imagines her unhuman  but are we not better persisted the old maid for our ideals  i dont say we women are perfectplease dont think that  you are not more alive to our faults than we are  read the women novelists from george eliot downwards  but for your own sakeis it not well man should have something to look up to and failing anything better  i draw a very wide line answered the philosopher between ideals and delusions  the ideal has always helped man but that belongs to the land of his dreams his most important kingdom the kingdom of his future  delusions are earthly structures that sooner or later fall about his ears blinding him with dust and dirt  the petticoatgoverned country has always paid dearly for its folly  elizabeth cried the girton girl  queen victoria  were ideal sovereigns returned the philosopher leaving the government of the country to its ablest men  france under its pompadours the byzantine empire under its theodoras are truer examples of my argument  i am speaking of the unwisdom of assuming all women to be perfect  belisarius ruined himself and his people by believing his own wife to be an honest woman  but chivalry i argued has surely been of service to mankind  to an immense extent agreed the philosopher  it seized a natural human passion and turned it to good uses  then it was a reality  so once was the divine right of kings the infallibility of the church for cumbering the ground with the lifeless bodies of which mankind has paid somewhat dearly  not its upstanding lies they can be faced and defeatedbut its dead truths are the worlds stumblingblocks  to the man of war and rapine trained in cruelty and injustice the woman was the one thing that spoke of the joy of yielding  woman as compared with man was then an angel  it was no mere form of words  all the tender offices of life were in her hands  to the warrior his life divided between fighting and debauchery his womenfolk tending the sick helping the weak comforting the sorrowing must have moved with white feet across a world his vices had made dark  her mere subjection to the priesthood her inborn feminine delight in form and ceremonynow an influence narrowing her charitymust then to his dim eyes trained to look upon dogma as the living soul of his religion have seemed a halo deifying her  woman was then the servant  it was naturally to her advantage to excite tenderness and mercy in man  since she has become the mistress of the world  it is no longer her interested mission to soften his savage instincts  nowadays it is the women who make war the women who exalt brute force  today it is the woman who happy herself turns a deaf ear to the worlds low cry of pain holding that man honoured who would ignore the good of the species to augment the comforts of his own particular family holding in despite as a bad husband and father the man whose sense of duty extends beyond the circle of the home  one recalls lady nelsons reproach to her lord after the battle of the nile  i have married a wife and therefore cannot come is the answer to his god that many a woman has prompted to her lovers tongue  i was speaking to a woman only the other day about the cruelty of skinning seals alive  i feel so sorry for the poor creatures she murmured but they say it gives so much more depth of colour to the fur  her own jacket was certainly a very beautiful specimen  when i was editing a paper i said i opened my columns to a correspondence on this very subject  many letters were sent to me most of them trite many of them foolish  one a genuine document i remember  it came from a girl who for six years had been assistant to a fashionable dressmaker  she was rather tired of the axiom that all women at all times are perfection  she suggested that poets and novelists should take service for a year in any large drapery or millinery establishment where they would have an opportunity of studying woman in her natural state so to speak  it is unfair to judge us by what i confess is our chief weakness argued the woman of the world  woman in pursuit of clothes ceases to be humanshe reverts to the original brute besides dressmakers can be very trying  the fault is not entirely on one side  i still fail to be convinced remarked the girton girl that woman is overpraised  not even the present conversation so far as it has gone altogether proves your point  i am not saying it is the case among intelligent thinkers explained the philosopher but in popular literature the convention still lingers  to womans face no man cares to protest against it and woman to her harm has come to accept it as a truism  what are little girls made of  sugar and spice and all thats nice  in more or less varied form the idea has entered into her blood shutting out from her hope of improvement  the girl is discouraged from asking herself the occasionally needful question  am i on the way to becoming a sound useful member of society  or am i in danger of degenerating into a vain selfish lazy piece of goodfor nothing rubbish  she is quite content so long as she can detect in herself no tendency to male vices forgetful that there are also feminine vices  woman is the spoilt child of the age  no one tells her of her faults  the world with its thousand voices flatters her sulks bad temper and pigheaded obstinacy are translated as pretty fannys wilful ways  cowardice contemptible in man or woman she is encouraged to cultivate as a charm  incompetence to pack her own bag or find her own way across a square and round a corner is deemed an attraction  abnormal ignorance and dense stupidity entitle her to pose as the poetical ideal  if she give a penny to a street beggar selecting generally the fraud or kiss a puppys nose we exhaust the language of eulogy proclaiming her a saint  the marvel to me is that in spite of the folly upon which they are fed so many of them grow to be sensible women  myself remarked the minor poet i find much comfort in the conviction that talk as talk is responsible for much less good and much less harm in the world than we who talk are apt to imagine words to grow and bear fruit must fall upon the earth of fact  but you hold it right to fight against folly demanded the philosopher  heavens yes cried the minor poet  that is how one knows it is follyif we can kill it  against the truth our arrows rattle harmlessly    chapter vi    but what is her reason demanded the old maid  reason  i dont believe any of them have any reason  the woman of the world showed sign of being short of temper a condition of affairs startlingly unusual to her  says she hasnt enough work to do  she must be an extraordinary woman commented the old maid  the trouble i have put myself to in order to keep that woman just because george likes her savouries no one would believe continued indignantly the woman of the world  we have had a dinner party regularly once a week for the last six months entirely for her benefit  now she wants me to give two  i wont do it  if i could be of any service offered the minor poet  my digestion is not what it once was but i could make up in qualitya recherche little banquet twice a week say on wednesdays and saturdays i would make a point of eating with you  if you think that would content her  it is really thoughtful of you replied the woman of the world but i cannot permit it  why should you be dragged from the simple repast suitable to a poet merely to oblige my cook  it is not reason  i was thinking rather of you continued the minor poet  ive half a mind said the woman of the world to give up housekeeping altogether and go into an hotel  i dont like the idea but really servants are becoming impossible  it is very interesting said the minor poet  i am glad you find it so snapped the woman of the world  what is interesting i asked the minor poet  that the tendency of the age he replied should be slowly but surely driving us into the practical adoption of a social state that for years we have been denouncing the socialists for merely suggesting  everywhere the publichouses are multiplying the private dwellings diminishing  can you wonder at it commented the woman of the world  you men talk about the joys of home  some of you write poetrygenerally speaking one of you who lives in chambers and spends twothirds of his day at a club  we were sitting in the garden  the attention of the minor poet became riveted upon the sunset  ethel and i by the fire  ethel never gets a chance of sitting by the fire  so long as you are there comfortable you do not notice that she has left the room to demand explanation why the drawingroom scuttle is always filled with slack and the best coal burnt in the kitchen range  home to us women is our place of business that we never get away from  i suppose said the girton girlto my surprise she spoke with entire absence of indignation  as a rule the girton girl stands for what has been termed divine discontent with things in general in the course of time she will outlive her surprise at finding the world so much less satisfactory an abode than she had been led to supposealso her present firm conviction that given a free hand she could put the whole thing right in a quarter of an hour  there are times even now when her tone suggests less certainty of her being the first person who has ever thought seriously about the matter  i suppose said the girton girl it comes of education our grandmothers were content to fill their lives with these small household duties  they rose early worked with their servants saw to everything with their own eyes  nowadays we demand time for selfdevelopment for reading for thinking for pleasure household drudgery instead of being the object of our life has become an interference to it  we resent it  the present revolt of woman continued the minor poet will be looked back upon by the historian of the future as one of the chief factors in our social evolution  the homethe praises of which we still sing but with gathering misgivingdepended on her willingness to live a life of practical slavery  when adam delved and eve spanadam confining his delving to the space within his own fence eve staying her spinningwheel the instant the family hosiery was completethen the home rested upon the solid basis of an actual fact  its foundations were shaken when the man became a citizen and his interests expanded beyond the domestic circle  since that moment woman alone has supported the institution  now she in her turn is claiming the right to enter the community to escape from the solitary confinement of the lovers castle  the mansions with common diningrooms readingrooms their system of common service are springing up in every quarter the house the villa is disappearing  the story is the same in every country  the separate dwelling where it remains is being absorbed into a system  in america the experimental laboratory of the future the houses are warmed from a common furnace  you do not light the fire you turn on the hot air  your dinner is brought round to you in a travelling oven  you subscribe for your valet or your ladys maid  very soon the private establishment with its staff of unorganised quarrelling servants of necessity either over or underworked will be as extinct as the lake dwelling or the sandstone cave  i hope said the woman of the world that i may live to see it  in all probability replied the minor poet you will  i would i could feel as hopeful for myself  if your prophecy be likely of fulfilment remarked the philosopher i console myself with the reflection that i am the oldest of the party  myself i never read these full and exhaustive reports of the next century without revelling in the reflection that before they can be achieved i shall be dead and buried  it may be a selfish attitude but i should be quite unable to face any of the machinemade futures our growing guild of seers prognosticate  you appear to me most of you to ignore a somewhat important considerationnamely that mankind is alive  you work out your answers as if he were a sum in ruleofthree  if man in so many thousands of years has done so much in such a direction at this or that rate of speed what will he be doing and so on  you forget he is swayed by impulses that can enter into no calculationdrawn hither and thither by powers that can never be represented in your algebra  in one generation christianity reduced platos republic to an absurdity  the printingpress has upset the unanswerable conclusions of machiavelli  i disagree with you said the minor poet  the fact does not convince me of my error retorted the philosopher  christianity continued the minor poet gave merely an added force to impulses the germs of which were present in the infant race  the printingpress teaching us to think in communities has nonplussed to a certain extent the aims of the individual as opposed to those of humanity  without prejudice without sentiment cast your eye back over the panorama of the human race  what is the picture that presents itself  scattered here and there over the wild voiceless desert first the holes and caves next the rude built huts the wigwams the lake dwellings of primitive man lonely solitary followed by his dam and brood he creeps through the tall grass ever with watchful terrorhaunted eyes satisfies his few desires communicates by means of a few grunts and signs his tiny store of knowledge to his offspring then crawling beneath a stone or into some tangled corner of the jungle dies and disappears  we look again  a thousand centuries have flashed and faded  the surface of the earth is flecked with strange quivering patches  here where the sun shines on the wood and sea close together almost touching one another there among the shadows far apart  the tribe has formed itself  the whole tiny mass moves forward halts runs backwards stirred always by one common impulse  man has learnt the secret of combination of mutual help the city rises  from its stone centre spreads its power the nation leaps to life civilisation springs from leisure no longer is each mans life devoted to his mere animal necessities  the artificer the thinkerhis fellows shall protect him  socrates dreams phidias carves the marble while pericles maintains the law and leonidas holds the barbarian at bay  europe annexes piece by piece the dark places of the earth gives to them her laws  the empire swallows the small state russia stretches her arm round asia  in london we toast the union of the englishspeaking peoples in berlin and vienna we rub a salamander to the deutscher bund in paris we whisper of a communion of the latin races  in great things so in small  the stores the huge emporium displaces the small shopkeeper the trust amalgamates a hundred firms the union speaks for the worker  the limits of country of language are found too narrow for the new ideas  german american or englishlet what yard of coloured cotton you choose float from the mizzenmast the business of the human race is their captain  one hundred and fifty years ago old sam johnson waited in a patrons anteroom today the entire world invites him to growl his table talk the while it takes its dish of tea  the poet the novelist speak in twenty languages nationalityit is the county council of the future  the worlds high roads run turnpikefree from pole to pole  one would be blind not to see the goal towards which we are rushing  at the outside it is but a generation or two off  it is one huge murmuring hiveone universal hive just the size of the round earth  the bees have been before us they have solved the riddle towards which we in darkness have been groping  the old maid shuddered visibly  what a terrible idea she said  to us replied the minor poet not to those who will come after us  the child dreads manhood  to abraham roaming the world with his flocks the life of your modern city man chained to his office from ten to four would have seemed little better than penal servitude  my sympathies are with the abrahamitical ideal observed the philosopher  mine also agreed the minor poet  but neither you nor i represent the tendency of the age  we are its curiosities  we and such as we serve as the brake regulating the rate of progress  the genius of species shows itself moving in the direction of the organised communityall life welded together controlled by one central idea  the individual worker is drawn into the factory chippendale today would have been employed sketching designs the chair would have been put together by fifty workers each one trained to perfection in his own particular department  why does the hotel with its five hundred servants its catering for three thousand mouths work smoothly while the desirable family residence with its two or three domestics remains the scene of waste confusion and dispute  we are losing the talent of living alone the instinct of living in communities is driving it out  so much the worse for the community was the comment of the philosopher  man as ibsen has said will always be at his greatest when he stands alone  to return to our friend abraham surely he wandering in the wilderness talking with his god was nearer the ideal than the modern citizen thinking with his morning paper applauding silly shibboleths from a theatre pit guffawing at coarse jests one of a musichall crowd  in the community it is the lowest always leads  you spoke just now of all the world inviting samuel johnson to its dish of tea  how many read him as compared to the number of subscribers to the hapenny joker  this thinking in communities as it is termed to what does it lead  to mafficking and dreyfus scandals  what crowd ever evolved a noble idea  if socrates and galileo confucius and christ had thought in communities the world would indeed be the anthill you appear to regard as its destiny  in balancing the books of life one must have regard to both sides of the ledger responded the minor poet  a crowd i admit of itself creates nothing on the other hand it receives ideals into its bosom and gives them needful shelter  it responds more readily to good than to evil  what greater stronghold of virtue than your sixpenny gallery  your burglar arrived fresh from jumping on his mother finds himself applauding with the rest stirring appeals to the inborn chivalry of man  suggestion that it was right or proper under any circumstances to jump upon ones mother he would at such moment reject with horror  thinking in communities is good for him  the hooligan whose patriotism finds expression in squirting dirty water into the face of his coster sweetheart  the boulevardiere primed with absinth shouting conspuez les juifs the motive force stirring them in its origin was an ideal  even into making a fool of itself a crowd can be moved only by incitement of its finer instincts  the service of prometheus to mankind must not be judged by the statistics of the insurance office  the world as a whole has gained by community will attain its goal only through community  from the nomadic savage by the winding road of citizenship we have advanced far  the way winds upward still hidden from us by the mists but along its tortuous course lies our track into the promised land  not the development of the individualthat is his own concernbut the uplifting of the race would appear to be the law  the lonely great ones they are the shepherds of the flockthe servants not the masters of the world  moses shall die and be buried in the wilderness seeing only from afar the restingplace of mans tired feet  it is unfortunate that the hapenny joker and its kind should have so many readers maybe it teaches those to read who otherwise would never read at all  we are impatient forgetting that the coming and going of our generations are but as the swinging of the pendulum of natures clock  yesterday we booked our seats for gladiatorial shows for the burning of christians our windows for newgate hangings  even the musical farce is an improvement upon thatat least from the humanitarian point of view  in the southern states of america observed the philosopher sticking to his guns they run excursion trains to lynching exhibitions  the bullfight is spreading to france and english newspapers are advocating the reintroduction of bearbaiting and cockfighting  are we not moving in a circle  the road winds as i have allowed returned the minor poet the gradient is somewhat steep  just now maybe we are traversing a backward curve  i gain my faith by pausing now and then to look behind  i see the weary way with many a downward sweep  but we are climbing my friend we are climbing  but to such a very dismal goal according to your theory grumbled the old maid  i should hate to feel myself an insect in a hive my little round of duties apportioned to me my every action regulated by a fixed law my place assigned to me my very food and drink i suppose apportioned to me  do think of something more cheerful  the minor poet laughed  my dear lady he replied it is too late  the thing is already done  the hive already covers us the cells are in building  who leads his own life  who is master of himself  what can you do but live according to your income in i am sure a very charming little cell buzz about your little world with your cheerful kindly song helping these your fellow insects here doing day by day the useful offices apportioned to you by your temperament and means seeing the same faces treading ever the same narrow circle  why do i write poetry  i am not to blame  i must live  it is the only thing i can do  why does one man live and die upon the treeless rocks of iceland another labour in the vineyards of the apennines  why does one woman make matches ride in a van to epping forest drink gin and change hats with her lover on the homeward journey another pant through a dinnerparty and half a dozen receptions every night from march to june rush from country house to fashionable continental resort from july to february dress as she is instructed by her milliner say the smart things that are expected of her  who would be a sweep or a chaperon were all roads free  who is it succeeds in escaping the law of the hive  the loafer the tramp  on the other hand who is the man we respect and envy  the man who works for the community the publicspirited man as we call him the unselfish man the man who labours for the labours sake and not for the profit devoting his days and nights to learning natures secrets to acquiring knowledge useful to the race  is he not the happiest the man who has conquered his own sordid desires who gives himself to the public good  the hive was founded in dark days before man knew it has been built according to false laws  this man will have a cell bigger than any other cell all the other little men shall envy him a thousand fellowcrawling mites shall slave for him wear out their lives in wretchedness for him and him alone all their honey they shall bring to him he shall gorge while they shall starve  of what use  he has slept no sounder in his foolishly fanciful cell  sleep is to tired eyes not to silken coverlets  we dream in seven dials as in park lane  his stomach distend it as he willit is very smallresents being distended  the store of honey rots  the hive was conceived in the dark days of ignorance stupidity brutality  a new hive shall arise  i had no idea said the woman of the world you were a socialist  nor had i agreed the minor poet before i began talking  and next wednesday laughed the woman of the world you will be arguing in favour of individualism  very likely agreed the minor poet  the deep moans round with many voices  ill take another cup of tea said the philosopher
