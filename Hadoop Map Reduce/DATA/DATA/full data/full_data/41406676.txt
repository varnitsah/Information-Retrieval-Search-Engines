41406676	adventure      we are those fools who could not rest       in the dull earth we left behind    but burned with passion for the west       and drank strange frenzy from its wind    the world where wise men live at ease       fades from our unregretful eyes    and blind across uncharted seas       we stagger on our enterprise     the ship of fools     chapter isomething to be done   he was a very sick white man  he rode pickaback on a woollyheaded blackskinned savage the lobes of whose ears had been pierced and stretched until one had torn out while the other carried a circular block of carved wood three inches in diameter  the torn ear had been pierced again but this time not so ambitiously for the hole accommodated no more than a short clay pipe  the manhorse was greasy and dirty and naked save for an exceedingly narrow and dirty loincloth but the white man clung to him closely and desperately  at times from weakness his head drooped and rested on the woolly pate  at other times he lifted his head and stared with swimming eyes at the cocoanut palms that reeled and swung in the shimmering heat  he was clad in a thin undershirt and a strip of cotton cloth that wrapped about his waist and descended to his knees  on his head was a battered stetson known to the trade as a badenpowell  about his middle was strapped a belt which carried a largecalibred automatic pistol and several spare clips loaded and ready for quick work  the rear was brought up by a black boy of fourteen or fifteen who carried medicine bottles a pail of hot water and various other hospital appurtenances  they passed out of the compound through a small wicker gate and went on under the blazing sun winding about among newplanted cocoanuts that threw no shade  there was not a breath of wind and the superheated stagnant air was heavy with pestilence  from the direction they were going arose a wild clamour as of lost souls wailing and of men in torment  a long low shed showed ahead grasswalled and grassthatched and it was from here that the noise proceeded  there were shrieks and screams some unmistakably of grief others unmistakably of unendurable pain  as the white man drew closer he could hear a low and continuous moaning and groaning  he shuddered at the thought of entering and for a moment was quite certain that he was going to faint for that most dreaded of solomon island scourges dysentery had struck berande plantation and he was all alone to cope with it  also he was afflicted himself  by stooping close still on manback he managed to pass through the low doorway  he took a small bottle from his follower and sniffed strong ammonia to clear his senses for the ordeal  then he shouted shut up and the clamour stilled  a raised platform of forest slabs six feet wide with a slight pitch extended the full length of the shed alongside of it was a yardwide runway  stretched on the platform side by side and crowded close lay a score of blacks  that they were low in the order of human life was apparent at a glance  they were maneaters their faces were asymmetrical bestial their bodies were ugly and ape like  they wore noserings of clamshell and turtleshell and from the ends of their noses which were also pierced projected horns of beads strung on stiff wire  their ears were pierced and distended to accommodate wooden plugs and sticks pipes and all manner of barbaric ornaments  their faces and bodies were tattooed or scarred in hideous designs  in their sickness they wore no clothing not even loincloths though they retained their shell armlets their bead necklaces and their leather belts between which and the skin were thrust naked knives  the bodies of many were covered with horrible sores  swarms of flies rose and settled or flew back and forth in clouds  the white man went down the line dosing each man with medicine  to some he gave chlorodyne  he was forced to concentrate with all his will in order to remember which of them could stand ipecacuanha and which of them were constitutionally unable to retain that powerful drug  one who lay dead he ordered to be carried out  he spoke in the sharp peremptory manner of a man who would take no nonsense and the well men who obeyed his orders scowled malignantly  one muttered deep in his chest as he took the corpse by the feet  the white man exploded in speech and action  it cost him a painful effort but his arm shot out landing a backhand blow on the blacks mouth  what name you angara he shouted  what for talk long you eh  i knock seven bells out of you too much quick  with the automatic swiftness of a wild animal the black gathered himself to spring  the anger of a wild animal was in his eyes but he saw the white mans hand dropping to the pistol in his belt  the spring was never made  the tensed body relaxed and the black stooping over the corpse helped carry it out  this time there was no muttering  swine the white man gritted out through his teeth at the whole breed of solomon islanders  he was very sick this white man as sick as the black men who lay helpless about him and whom he attended  he never knew each time he entered the festering shambles whether or not he would be able to complete the round  but he did know in large degree of certainty that if he ever fainted there in the midst of the blacks those who were able would be at his throat like ravening wolves  part way down the line a man was dying  he gave orders for his removal as soon as he had breathed his last  a black stuck his head inside the shed door saying  four fella sick too much  fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman  the white man singled out the weakest and put him in the place just vacated by the corpse  also he indicated the next weakest telling him to wait for a place until the next man died  then ordering one of the well men to take a squad from the fieldforce and build a leanto addition to the hospital he continued along the runway administering medicine and cracking jokes in bechedemer english to cheer the sufferers  now and again from the far end a weird wail was raised  when he arrived there he found the noise was emitted by a boy who was not sick  the white mans wrath was immediate  what name you sing out alla time he demanded  him fella my brother belong me was the answer  him fella die too much  you sing out him fella brother belong you die too much the white man went on in threatening tones  i cross too much along you  what name you sing out eh  you fathead make um brother belong you die dose up too much  you fella finish sing out savvee  you fella no finish sing out i make finish damn quick  he threatened the wailer with his fist and the black cowered down glaring at him with sullen eyes  sing out no good little bit the white man went on more gently  you no sing out  you chase um fella fly  too much strong fella fly  you catch water washee brother belong you washee plenty too much bime bye brother belong you all right  jump he shouted fiercely at the end his will penetrating the low intelligence of the black with dynamic force that made him jump to the task of brushing the loathsome swarms of flies away  again he rode out into the reeking heat  he clutched the blacks neck tightly and drew a long breath but the dead air seemed to shrivel his lungs and he dropped his head and dozed till the house was reached every effort of will was torture yet he was called upon continually to make efforts of will  he gave the black he had ridden a nip of trade gin  viaburi the houseboy brought him corrosive sublimate and water and he took a thorough antiseptic wash  he dosed himself with chlorodyne took his own pulse smoked a thermometer and lay back on the couch with a suppressed groan  it was midafternoon and he had completed his third round that day  he called the houseboy  take um big fella look along jessie he commanded  the boy carried the long telescope out on the veranda and searched the sea  one fella schooner long way little bit he announced  one fella jessie  the white man gave a little gasp of delight  you make um jessie five sticks tobacco along you he said  there was silence for a time during which he waited with eager impatience  maybe jessie maybe other fella schooner came the faltering admission  the man wormed to the edge of the couch and slipped off to the floor on his knees  by means of a chair he drew himself to his feet  still clinging to the chair supporting most of his weight on it he shoved it to the door and out upon the veranda  the sweat from the exertion streamed down his face and showed through the undershirt across his shoulders  he managed to get into the chair where he panted in a state of collapse  in a few minutes he roused himself  the boy held the end of the telescope against one of the veranda scantlings while the man gazed through it at the sea  at last he picked up the white sails of the schooner and studied them  no jessie he said very quietly  thats the malakula  he changed his seat for a steamer recliningchair  three hundred feet away the sea broke in a small surf upon the beach  to the left he could see the white line of breakers that marked the bar of the balesuna river and beyond the rugged outline of savo island  directly before him across the twelvemile channel lay florida island and farther to the right dim in the distance he could make out portions of malaitathe savage island the abode of murder and robbery and maneatingthe place from which his own two hundred plantation hands had been recruited between him and the beach was the canegrass fence of the compound  the gate was ajar and he sent the houseboy to close it  within the fence grew a number of lofty cocoanut palms  on either side the path that led to the gate stood two tall flagstaffs  they were reared on artificial mounds of earth that were ten feet high  the base of each staff was surrounded by short posts painted white and connected by heavy chains the staffs themselves were like ships masts with topmasts spliced on in true nautical fashion with shrouds ratlines gaffs and flaghalyards from the gaff of one two gay flags hung limply one a checkerboard of blue and white squares the other a white pennant centred with a red disc  it was the international code signal of distress  on the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded  the man watched it and knew that it was sick  he wondered idly if it felt as bad as he felt and was feebly amused at the thought of kinship that somehow penetrated his fancy  he roused himself to order the great bell to be rung as a signal for the plantation hands to cease work and go to their barracks  then he mounted his manhorse and made the last round of the day  in the hospital were two new cases  to these he gave castoroil  he congratulated himself  it had been an easy day  only three had died  he inspected the copradrying that had been going on and went through the barracks to see if there were any sick lying hidden and defying his rule of segregation  returned to the house he received the reports of the bossboys and gave instructions for next days work  the boats crew boss also he had in to give assurance as was the custom nightly that the whaleboats were hauled up and padlocked  this was a most necessary precaution for the blacks were in a funk and a whaleboat left lying on the beach in the evening meant a loss of twenty blacks by morning  since the blacks were worth thirty dollars apiece or less according to how much of their time had been worked out berande plantation could ill afford the loss  besides whaleboats were not cheap in the solomons and also the deaths were daily reducing the working capital  seven blacks had fled into the bush the week before and four had dragged themselves back helpless from fever with the report that two more had been killed and kaikaid 1 by the hospitable bushmen  the seventh man was still at large and was said to be working along the coast on the lookout to steal a canoe and get away to his own island  viaburi brought two lighted lanterns to the white man for inspection  he glanced at them and saw that they were burning brightly with clear broad flames and nodded his head  one was hoisted up to the gaff of the flagstaff and the other was placed on the wide veranda  they were the leading lights to the berande anchorage and every night in the year they were so inspected and hung out  he rolled back on his couch with a sigh of relief  the days work was done  a rifle lay on the couch beside him  his revolver was within reach of his hand  an hour passed during which he did not move  he lay in a state of halfslumber halfcoma  he became suddenly alert  a creak on the back veranda was the cause  the room was lshaped the corner in which stood his couch was dim but the hanging lamp in the main part of the room over the billiard table and just around the corner so that it did not shine on him was burning brightly  likewise the verandas were well lighted  he waited without movement  the creaks were repeated and he knew several men lurked outside  what name he cried sharply  the house raised a dozen feet above the ground shook on its pile foundations to the rush of retreating footsteps  theyre getting bold he muttered  something will have to be done  the full moon rose over malaita and shone down on berande  nothing stirred in the windless air  from the hospital still proceeded the moaning of the sick  in the grassthatched barracks nearly two hundred woollyheaded maneaters slept off the weariness of the days toil though several lifted their heads to listen to the curses of one who cursed the white man who never slept  on the four verandas of the house the lanterns burned  inside between rifle and revolver the man himself moaned and tossed in intervals of troubled sleep     chapter iisomething is done   in the morning david sheldon decided that he was worse  that he was appreciably weaker there was no doubt and there were other symptoms that were unfavourable  he began his rounds looking for trouble  he wanted trouble  in full health the strained situation would have been serious enough but as it was himself growing helpless something had to be done  the blacks were getting more sullen and defiant and the appearance of the men the previous night on his verandaone of the gravest of offences on berandewas ominous  sooner or later they would get him if he did not get them first if he did not once again sear on their dark souls the flaming mastery of the white man  he returned to the house disappointed  no opportunity had presented itself of making an example of insolence or insubordinationsuch as had occurred on every other day since the sickness smote berande  the fact that none had offended was in itself suspicious  they were growing crafty  he regretted that he had not waited the night before until the prowlers had entered  then he might have shot one or two and given the rest a new lesson writ in red for them to con  it was one man against two hundred and he was horribly afraid of his sickness overpowering him and leaving him at their mercy  he saw visions of the blacks taking charge of the plantation looting the store burning the buildings and escaping to malaita  also one gruesome vision he caught of his own head sundried and smokecured ornamenting the canoe house of a cannibal village  either the jessie would have to arrive or he would have to do something  the bell had hardly rung sending the labourers into the fields when sheldon had a visitor  he had had the couch taken out on the veranda and he was lying on it when the canoes paddled in and hauled out on the beach  forty men armed with spears bows and arrows and warclubs gathered outside the gate of the compound but only one entered  they knew the law of berande as every native knew the law of every white mans compound in all the thousand miles of the farflung solomons  the one man who came up the path sheldon recognized as seelee the chief of balesuna village  the savage did not mount the steps but stood beneath and talked to the white lord above  seelee was more intelligent than the average of his kind but his intelligence only emphasized the lowness of that kind  his eyes close together and small advertised cruelty and craftiness  a geestring and a cartridgebelt were all the clothes he wore  the carved pearlshell ornament that hung from nose to chin and impeded speech was purely ornamental as were the holes in his ears mere utilities for carrying pipe and tobacco  his brokenfanged teeth were stained black by betel nut the juice of which he spat upon the ground  as he talked or listened he made grimaces like a monkey  he said yes by dropping his eyelids and thrusting his chin forward  he spoke with childish arrogance strangely at variance with the subservient position he occupied beneath the veranda  he with his many followers was lord and master of balesuna village  but the white man without followers was lord and master of berandeay and on occasion singlehanded had made himself lord and master of balesuna village as well  seelee did not like to remember that episode  it had occurred in the course of learning the nature of white men and of learning to abominate them  he had once been guilty of sheltering three runaways from berande  they had given him all they possessed in return for the shelter and for promised aid in getting away to malaita  this had given him a glimpse of a profitable future in which his village would serve as the one depot on the underground railway between berande and malaita  unfortunately he was ignorant of the ways of white men  this particular white man educated him by arriving at his grass house in the gray of dawn  in the first moment he had felt amused  he was so perfectly safe in the midst of his village  but the next moment and before he could cry out a pair of handcuffs on the white mans knuckles had landed on his mouth knocking the cry of alarm back down his throat  also the white mans other fist had caught him under the ear and left him without further interest in what was happening  when he came to he found himself in the white mans whaleboat on the way to berande  at berande he had been treated as one of no consequence with handcuffs on hands and feet to say nothing of chains  when his tribe had returned the three runaways he was given his freedom  and finally the terrible white man had fined him and balesuna village ten thousand cocoanuts  after that he had sheltered no more runaway malaita men  instead he had gone into the business of catching them  it was safer  besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head  but if he ever got a chance at that white man if he ever caught him sick or stood at his back when he stumbled and fell on a bushtrailwell there would be a head that would fetch a price in malaita  sheldon was pleased with what seelee told him  the seventh man of the last batch of runaways had been caught and was even then at the gate  he was brought in heavyfeatured and defiant his arms bound with cocoanut sennit the dry blood still on his body from the struggle with his captors  me savvee you good fella seelee sheldon said as the chief gulped down a quartertumbler of raw tradegin  fella boy belong me you catch short time little bit  this fella boy strong fella too much  i give you fella one case tobaccomy word one case tobacco  then you good fella along me i give you three fathom calico one fella knife big fella too much  the tobacco and trade goods were brought from the storeroom by two house boys and turned over to the chief of balesuna village who accepted the additional reward with a noncommittal grunt and went away down the path to his canoes  under sheldons directions the houseboys handcuffed the prisoner by hands and feet around one of the pile supports of the house  at eleven oclock when the labourers came in from the field sheldon had them assembled in the compound before the veranda  every able man was there including those who were helping about the hospital even the women and the several pickaninnies of the plantation were lined up with the rest two deepa horde of naked savages a trifle under two hundred strong  in addition to their ornaments of bead and shell and bone their pierced ears and nostrils were burdened with safetypins wire nails metal hairpins rusty iron handles of cooking utensils and the patent keys for opening corned beef tins  some wore penknives clasped on their kinky locks for safety  on the chest of one a china doorknob was suspended on the chest of another the brass wheel of an alarm clock  facing them clinging to the railing of the veranda for support stood the sick white man  any one of them could have knocked him over with the blow of a little finger  despite his firearms the gang could have rushed him and delivered that blow when his head and the plantation would have been theirs  hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing  but one thing they lacked the thing that he possessed the flame of mastery that would not quench that burned fiercely as ever in the diseasewasted body and that was ever ready to flare forth and scorch and singe them with its ire  narada  billy sheldon called sharply  two men slunk unwillingly forward and waited  sheldon gave the keys of the handcuffs to a houseboy who went under the house and loosed the prisoner  you fella narada you fella billy take um this fella boy along tree and make fast hands high up was sheldons command  while this was being done slowly amidst mutterings and restlessness on the part of the onlookers one of the houseboys fetched a heavyhandled heavylashed whip  sheldon began a speech  this fella arunga me cross along him too much  i no steal this fella arunga  i no gammon  i say all right you come along me berande work three fella year  he say all right me come along you work three fella year  he come  he catch plenty good fella kaikai 2 plenty good fella money  what name he run away  me too much cross along him  i knock

all fella marys 3 look see bime bye they like run away they think strong fella too much no run away  billy strong fella too much ten fella three times  the houseboy extended the whip to him but billy did not take it sheldon waited quietly  the eyes of all the cannibals were fixed upon him in doubt and fear and eagerness  it was the moment of test whereby the lone white man was to live or be lost  ten fella three times billy sheldon said encouragingly though there was a certain metallic rasp in his voice  billy scowled looked up and looked down but did not move  billy  sheldons voice exploded like a pistol shot  the savage started physically  grins overspread the grotesque features of the audience and there was a sound of tittering  spose you like too much lash that fella arunga you take him fella tulagi billy said  one fella government agent make plenty lash  that um fella law  me savvee um fella law  it was the law and sheldon knew it  but he wanted to live this day and the next day and not to die waiting for the law to operate the next week or the week after  too much talk along you he cried angrily  what name eh  what name  me savvee law the savage repeated stubbornly  astoa  another man stepped forward in almost a sprightly way and glanced insolently up  sheldon was selecting the worst characters for the lesson  you fella astoa you fella narada tie up that fella billy alongside other fella same fella way  strong fella tie he cautioned them  you fella astoa take that fella whip  plenty strong big fella too much ten fella three times  savvee  no astoa grunted  sheldon picked up the rifle that had leaned against the rail and cocked it  i know you astoa he said calmly  you work along queensland six years  me fella missionary the black interrupted with deliberate insolence  queensland you stop jail one fella year  white fella master damn fool no hang you  you too much bad fella  queensland you stop jail six months two fella time  two fella time you steal  all right you missionary  you savvee one fella prayer  yes me savvee prayer was the reply  all right then you pray now short time little bit  you say one fella prayer damn quick then me kill you  sheldon held the rifle on him and waited  the black glanced around at his fellows but none moved to aid him  they were intent upon the coming spectacle staring fascinated at the white man with death in his hands who stood alone on the great veranda  sheldon has won and he knew it astoa changed his weight irresolutely from one foot to the other  he looked at the white man and saw his eyes gleaming level along the sights  astoa sheldon said seizing the psychological moment i count three fella time  then i shoot you fella dead goodbye all finish you  and sheldon knew that when he had counted three he would drop him in his tracks  the black knew it too  that was why sheldon did not have to do it for when he had counted one astoa reached out his hand and took the whip  and right well astoa laid on the whip angered at his fellows for not supporting him and venting his anger with every stroke  from the veranda sheldon egged him on to strike with strength till the two triced savages screamed and howled while the blood oozed down their backs  the lesson was being well written in red  when the last of the gang including the two howling culprits had passed out through the compound gate sheldon sank down halffainting on his couch  youre a sick man he groaned  a sick man  but you can sleep at ease tonight he added half an hour later     chapter iiithe jessie   two days passed and sheldon felt that he could not grow any weaker and live much less make his four daily rounds of the hospital  the deaths were averaging four a day and there were more new cases than recoveries the blacks were in a funk  each one when taken sick seemed to make every effort to die  once down on their backs they lacked the grit to make a struggle  they believed they were going to die and they did their best to vindicate that belief  even those that were well were sure that it was only a mater of days when the sickness would catch them and carry them off  and yet believing this with absolute conviction they somehow lacked the nerve to rush the frail wraith of a man with the white skin and escape from the charnel house by the whaleboats  they chose the lingering death they were sure awaited them rather than the immediate death they were very sure would pounce upon them if they went up against the master  that he never slept they knew  that he could not be conjured to death they were equally surethey had tried it  and even the sickness that was sweeping them off could not kill him  with the whipping in the compound discipline had improved  they cringed under the iron hand of the white man  they gave their scowls or malignant looks with averted faces or when his back was turned  they saved their mutterings for the barracks at night where he could not hear  and there were no more runaways and no more nightprowlers on the veranda  dawn of the third day after the whipping brought the jessies white sails in sight  eight miles away it was not till two in the afternoon that the light airfans enabled her to drop anchor a quarter of a mile off the shore  the sight of her gave sheldon fresh courage and the tedious hours of waiting did not irk him  he gave his orders to the boss boys and made his regular trips to the hospital  nothing mattered now his troubles were at an end  he could lie down and take care of himself and proceed to get well  the jessie had arrived  his partner was on board vigorous and hearty from six weeks recruiting on malaita  he could take charge now and all would be well with berande  sheldon lay in the steamerchair and watched the jessies whaleboat pull in for the beach  he wondered why only three sweeps were pulling and he wondered still more when beached there was so much delay in getting out of the boat  then he understood  the three blacks who had been pulling started up the beach with a stretcher on their shoulders  a white man whom he recognized as the jessies captain walked in front and opened the gate then dropped behind to close it  sheldon knew that it was hughie drummond who lay in the stretcher and a mist came before his eyes  he felt an overwhelming desire to die  the disappointment was too great  in his own state of terrible weakness he felt that it was impossible to go on with his task of holding berande plantation tight gripped in his fist  then the will of him flamed up again and he directed the blacks to lay the stretcher beside him on the floor  hughie drummond whom he had last seen in health was an emaciated skeleton  his closed eyes were deepsunken  the shrivelled lips had fallen away from the teeth and the cheekbones seemed bursting through the skin  sheldon sent a houseboy for his thermometer and glanced questioningly at the captain  blackwater fever the captain said  hes been like this for six days unconscious  and weve got dysentery on board  whats the matter with you  im burying four a day sheldon answered as he bent over from the steamerchair and inserted the thermometer under his partners tongue  captain oleson swore blasphemously and sent a houseboy to bring whisky and soda  sheldon glanced at the thermometer  one hundred and seven he said  poor hughie  captain oleson offered him some whisky  couldnt think of itperforation you know sheldon said  he sent for a bossboy and ordered a grave to be dug also some of the packingcases to be knocked together into a coffin  the blacks did not get coffins  they were buried as they died being carted on a sheet of galvanized iron in their nakedness from the hospital to the hole in the ground  having given the orders sheldon lay back in his chair with closed eyes  its ben fair hell sir captain oleson began then broke off to help himself to more whisky  its ben fair hell mr sheldon i tell you contrary winds and calms  weve ben driftin all about the shop for ten days  theres ten thousand sharks following us for the tucker weve ben throwin over to them  they was snappin at the oars when we started to come ashore  i wisht to god a norwesterd come along an blow the solomons clean to hell  we got it from the waterwater from owga creek  filled my casks with it  how was we to know  ive filled there before an it was all right we had sixty recruitsfull up and my crew of fifteen  weve ben buryin them day an night  the beggars wont live damn them  they die out of spite  only three of my crew left on its legs  five more down  seven dead  oh hell  whats the good of talkin  how many recruits left sheldon asked  lost half  thirty left  twenty down and ten tottering around  sheldon sighed  that means another addition to the hospital  weve got to get them ashore somehowviaburi  hey you viaburi ring big fella bell strong fella too much  the hands called in from the fields at that unwonted hour were split into detachments  some were sent into the woods to cut timber for house beams others to cutting canegrass for thatching and forty of them lifted a whaleboat above their heads and carried it down to the sea sheldon had gritted his teeth pulled his collapsing soul together and taken berande plantation into his fist once more  have you seen the barometer captain oleson asked pausing at the bottom of the steps on his way to oversee the disembarkation of the sick  no sheldon answered  is it down  its going down  then youd better sleep aboard tonight was sheldons judgment  never mind the funeral  ill see to poor hughie  a nigger was kicking the bucket when i dropped anchor  the captain made the statement as a simple fact but obviously waited for a suggestion  the other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him  dump him over he cried  great god man dont you think ive got enough graves ashore  i just wanted to know that was all the captain answered in no wise offended  sheldon regretted his childishness  oh captain oleson he called  if you can see your way to it come ashore tomorrow and lend me a hand  if you cant send the mate  right o  ill come myself  mr johnsons dead sir  i forgot to tell youthree days ago  sheldon watched the jessies captain go down the path with waving arms and loud curses calling upon god to sink the solomons  next sheldon noted the jessie rolling lazily on the glassy swell and beyond in the northwest high over florida island an alpine chain of darkmassed clouds  then he turned to his partner calling for boys to carry him into the house  but hughie drummond had reached the end  his breathing was imperceptible  by mere touch sheldon could ascertain that the dying mans temperature was going down  it must have been going down when the thermometer registered one hundred and seven  he had burned out  sheldon knelt beside him the houseboys grouped around their white singlets and loincloths peculiarly at variance with their dark skins and savage countenances their huge earplugs and carved and glistening noserings sheldon tottered to his feet at last and halffell into the steamerchair  oppressive as the heat had been it was now even more oppressive  it was difficult to breathe  he panted for air  the faces and naked arms of the houseboys were beaded with sweat  marster one of them ventured big fella wind he come strong fella too much  sheldon nodded his head but did not look  much as he had loved hughie drummond his death and the funeral it entailed seemed an intolerable burden to add to what he was already sinking under  he had a feelingnay it was a certitudethat all he had to do was to shut his eyes and let go and that he would die sink into immensity of rest  he knew it it was very simple  all he had to do was close his eyes and let go for he had reached the stage where he lived by will alone  his weary body seemed torn by the oncoming pangs of dissolution  he was a fool to hang on  he had died a score of deaths already and what was the use of prolonging it to twoscore deaths before he really died  not only was he not afraid to die but he desired to die  his weary flesh and weary spirit desired it and why should the flame of him not go utterly out  but his mind that could will life or death still pulsed on  he saw the two whaleboats land on the beach and the sick on stretchers or picka back groaning and wailing go by in lugubrious procession  he saw the wind making on the clouded horizon and thought of the sick in the hospital  here was something waiting his hand to be done and it was not in his nature to lie down and sleep or die when any task remained undone  the bossboys were called and given their orders to rope down the hospital with its two additions  he remembered the spare anchorchain new and blackpainted that hung under the house suspended from the floor beams and ordered it to be used on the hospital as well  other boys brought the coffin a grotesque patchwork of packingcases and under his directions they laid hughie drummond in it  half a dozen boys carried it down the beach while he rode on the back of another his arms around the blacks neck one hand clutching a prayerbook  while he read the service the blacks gazed apprehensively at the dark line on the water above which rolled and tumbled the racing clouds  the first breath of the wind faint and silken tonic with life fanned through his drybaked body as he finished reading  then came the second breath of the wind an angry gust as the shovels worked rapidly filling in the sand  so heavy was the gust that sheldon still on his feet seized hold of his manhorse to escape being blown away  the jessie was blotted out and a strange ominous sound arose as multitudinous wavelets struck foaming on the beach  it was like the bubbling of some colossal cauldron  from all about could be heard the dull thudding of falling cocoanuts  the tall delicatetrunked trees twisted and snapped about like whiplashes  the air seemed filled with their flying leaves any one of which stemon could brain a man  then came the rain a deluge a straight horizontal sheet that poured along like a river defying gravitation  the black with sheldon mounted on him plunged ahead into the thick of it stooping far forward and low to the ground to avoid being toppled over backward  hes sleeping out and far tonight sheldon quoted as he thought of the dead man in the sand and the rainwater trickling down upon the cold clay  so they fought their way back up the beach  the other blacks caught hold of the manhorse and pulled and tugged  there were among them those whose fondest desire was to drag the rider in the sand and spring upon him and mash him into repulsive nothingness  but the automatic pistol in his belt with its rattling quickdealing death and the automatic death defying spirit in the man himself made them refrain and buckle down to the task of hauling him to safety through the storm  wet through and exhausted he was nevertheless surprised at the ease with which he got into a change of clothing  though he was fearfully weak he found himself actually feeling better  the disease had spent itself and the mend had begun  now if i dont get the fever he said aloud and at the same moment resolved to go to taking quinine as soon as he was strong enough to dare  he crawled out on the veranda  the rain had ceased but the wind which had dwindled to a halfgale was increasing  a big sea had sprung up and the milelong breakers curling up to the overfall two hundred yards from shore were crashing on the beach  the jessie was plunging madly to two anchors and every second or third sea broke clear over her bow two flags were stiffly undulating from the halyards like squares of flexible sheetiron  one was blue the other red  he knew their meaning in the berande private codewhat are your instructions  shall i attempt to land boat  tacked on the wall between the signal locker and the billiard rules was the code itself by which he verified the signal before making answer  on the flagstaff gaff a boy hoisted a white flag over a red which stood forrun to neal island for shelter  that captain oleson had been expecting this signal was apparent by the celerity with which the shackles were knocked out of both anchorchains he slipped his anchors leaving them buoyed to be picked up in better weather  the jessie swung off under her full staysail then the foresail doublereefed was run up  she was away like a racehorse clearing balesuna shoal with half a cablelength to spare  just before she rounded the point she was swallowed up in a terrific squall that far outblew the first  all that night while squall after squall smote berande uprooting trees overthrowing coprasheds and rocking the house on its tall piles sheldon slept  he was unaware of the commotion  he never wakened  nor did he change his position or dream  he awoke a new man  furthermore he was hungry  it was over a week since food had passed his lips  he drank a glass of condensed cream thinned with water and by ten oclock he dared to take a cup of beeftea  he was cheered also by the situation in the hospital  despite the storm there had been but one death and there was only one fresh case while half a dozen boys crawled weakly away to the barracks  he wondered if it was the wind that was blowing the disease away and cleansing the pestilential land  by eleven a messenger arrived from balesuna village dispatched by seelee  the jessie had gone ashore halfway between the village and neal island  it was not till nightfall that two of the crew arrived reporting the drowning of captain oleson and of the one remaining boy  as for the jessie from what they told him sheldon could not but conclude that she was a total loss  further to hearten him he was taken by a shivering fit  in half an hour he was burning up  and he knew that at least another day must pass before he could undertake even the smallest dose of quinine  he crawled under a heap of blankets and a little later found himself laughing aloud  he had surely reached the limit of disaster  barring earthquake or tidalwave the worst had already befallen him  the flibbertygibbet was certainly safe in mboli pass since nothing worse could happen things simply had to mend  so it was shivering under his blankets that he laughed until the houseboys with heads together marvelled at the devils that were in him     chapter ivjoan lackland   by the second day of the northwester sheldon was in collapse from his fever  it had taken an unfair advantage of his weak state and though it was only ordinary malarial fever in fortyeight hours it had run him as low as ten days of fever would have done when he was in condition  but the dysentery had been swept away from berande  a score of convalescents lingered in the hospital but they were improving hourly  there had been but one more deaththat of the man whose brother had wailed over him instead of brushing the flies away  on the morning of the fourth day of his fever sheldon lay on the veranda gazing dimly out over the raging ocean  the wind was falling but a mighty sea was still thundering in on berande beach the flying spray reaching in as far as the flagstaff mounds the foaming wash creaming against the gateposts  he had taken thirty grains of quinine and the drug was buzzing in his ears like a nest of hornets making his hands and knees tremble and causing a sickening palpitation of the stomach  once opening his eyes he saw what he took to be an hallucination  not far out and coming in across the jessies anchorage he saw a whaleboats nose thrust skyward on a smoky crest and disappear naturally as an actual whaleboats nose should disappear as it slid down the back of the sea  he knew that no whaleboat should be out there and he was quite certain no men in the solomons were mad enough to be abroad in such a storm  but the hallucination persisted  a minute later chancing to open his eyes he saw the whaleboat full length and saw right into it as it rose on the face of a wave  he saw six sweeps at work and in the stern clearly outlined against the overhanging wall of white a man who stood erect gigantic swaying with his weight on the steeringsweep  this he saw and an eighth man who crouched in the bow and gazed shoreward  but what startled sheldon was the sight of a woman in the sternsheets between the strokeoar and the steersman  a woman she was for a braid of her hair was flying and she was just in the act of recapturing it and stowing it away beneath a hat that for all the world was like his own badenpowell  the boat disappeared behind the wave and rose into view on the face of the following one  again he looked into it  the men were darkskinned and larger than solomon islanders but the woman he could plainly see was white  who she was and what she was doing there were thoughts that drifted vaguely through his consciousness  he was too sick to be vitally interested and besides he had a half feeling that it was all a dream but he noted that the men were resting on their sweeps while the woman and the steersman were intently watching the run of seas behind them  good boatmen was sheldons verdict as he saw the boat leap forward on the face of a huge breaker the sweeps plying swiftly to keep her on that front of the moving mountain of water that raced madly for the shore  it was well done  part full of water the boat was flung upon the beach the men springing out and dragging its nose to the gateposts  sheldon had called vainly to the houseboys who at the moment were dosing the remaining patients in the hospital  he knew he was unable to rise up and go down the path to meet the newcomers so he lay back in the steamer chair and watched for ages while they cared for the boat  the woman stood to one side her hand resting on the gate  occasionally surges of sea water washed over her feet which he could see were encased in rubber seaboots  she scrutinized the house sharply and for some time she gazed at him steadily  at last speaking to two of the men who turned and followed her she started up the path  sheldon attempted to rise got half up out of his chair and fell back helplessly  he was surprised at the size of the men who loomed like giants behind her  both were sixfooters and they were heavy in proportion  he had never seen islanders like them  they were not black like the solomon islanders but light brown and their features were larger more regular and even handsome  the womanor girl rather he decidedwalked along the veranda toward him  the two men waited at the head of the steps watching curiously the girl was angry he could see that  her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering  that she had a temper was his thought  but the eyes were striking  he decided that they were not gray after all or at least not all gray  they were large and wide apart and they looked at him from under level brows  her face was cameolike so clear cut was it  there were other striking things about herthe cowboy stetson hat the heavy braids of brown hair and the longbarrelled 38 colts revolver that hung in its holster on her hip  pretty hospitality i must say was her greeting letting strangers sink or swim in your front yard  ii beg your pardon he stammered by a supreme effort dragging himself to his feet  his legs wobbled under him and with a suffocating sensation he began sinking to the floor  he was aware of a feeble gratification as he saw solicitude leap into her eyes then blackness smote him and at the moment of smiting him his thought was that at last and for the first time in his life he had fainted  the ringing of the big bell aroused him  he opened his eyes and found that he was on the couch indoors  a glance at the clock told him that it was six and from the direction the suns rays streamed into the room he knew that it was morning  at first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened  then on the wall he saw a stetson hat hanging and beneath it a full cartridgebelt and a longbarrelled 38 colts revolver  the slender girth of the belt told its feminine story and he remembered the whaleboat of the day before and the gray eyes that flashed beneath the level brows  she it must have been who had just rung the bell  the cares of the plantation rushed upon him and he sat up in bed clutching at the wall for support as the mosquito screen lurched dizzily around him  he was still sitting there holding on with eyes closed striving to master his giddiness when he heard her voice  youll lie right down again sir she said  it was sharply imperative a voice used to command  at the same time one hand pressed him back toward the pillow while the other caught him from behind and eased him down  youve been unconscious for twentyfour hours now she went on and i have taken charge  when i say the word youll get up and not until then  now what medicine do you takequinine  here are ten grains thats right  youll make a good patient  my dear madame he began  you musnt speak she interrupted that is in protest  otherwise you can talk  but the plantation  a dead man is of no use on a plantation  dont you want to know about me  my vanity is hurt  here am i just through my first shipwreck and here are you not the least bit curious talking about your miserable plantation  cant you see that i am just bursting to tell somebody anybody about my shipwreck  he smiled it was the first time in weeks  and he smiled not so much at what she said as at the way she said itthe whimsical expression of her face the laughter in her eyes and the several tiny lines of humour that drew in at the corners  he was curiously wondering as to what her age was as he said aloud  yes tell me please  that i will notnot now she retorted with a toss of the head  ill find somebody to tell my story to who does not have to be asked  also i want information  i managed to find out what time to ring the bell to turn the hands to and that is about all  i dont understand the ridiculous speech of your people  what time do they knock off  at elevengo on again at one  that will do thank you  and now where do you keep the key to the provisions  i want to feed my men  your men he gasped  on tinned goods  no no  let them go out and eat with my boys  her eyes flashed as on the day before and he saw again the imperative expression on her face  that i wont my men are men  ive been out to your miserable barracks and watched them eat  faugh  potatoes  nothing but potatoes no salt  nothing  only potatoes  i may have been mistaken but i thought i understood them to say that that was all they ever got to eat two meals a day and every day in the week  he nodded  well my men wouldnt stand that for a single day much less a whole week  where is the key  hanging on that clotheshook under the clock  he gave it easily enough but as she was reaching down the key she heard him say  fancy niggers and tinned provisions  this time she really was angry  the blood was in her cheeks as she turned on him  my men are not niggers  the sooner you understand that the better for our acquaintance  as for the tinned goods ill pay for all they eat please dont worry about that  worry is not good for you in your condition  and i wont stay any longer than i have tojust long enough to get you on your feet and not go away with the feeling of having deserted a white man  youre american arent you he asked quietly  the question disconcerted her for the moment  yes she vouchsafed with a defiant look  why  nothing  i merely thought so  anything further  he shook his head  why he asked  oh nothing  i thought you might have something pleasant to say  my name is sheldon david sheldon he said with direct relevance holding out a thin hand  her hand started out impulsively then checked  my name is lackland joan lackland  the hand went out  and let us be friends  it could not be otherwise he began lamely  and i can feed my men all the tinned goods i want she rushed on  till the cows come home he answered attempting her own lightness then adding that is to berande  you see we dont have any cows at berande  she fixed him coldly with her eyes  is that a joke she demanded  i really dont knowii thought it was but then you see im sick  youre english arent you was her next query  now thats too much even for a sick man he cried  you know well enough that i am  oh she said absently then you are  he frowned tightened his lips then burst into laughter in which she joined  its my own fault he confessed  i shouldnt have baited you  ill be careful in the future  in the meantime go on laughing and ill see about breakfast  is there anything you would fancy  he shook his head  it will do you good to eat something  your fever has burned out and you are merely weak  wait a moment  she hurried out of the room in the direction of the kitchen tripped at the door in a pair of sandals several sizes too large for her feet and disappeared in rosy confusion  by jove those are my sandals he thought to himself  the girl hasnt a thing to wear except what she landed on the beach in and she certainly landed in seaboots     chapter vshe would a planter be   sheldon mended rapidly  the fever had burned out and there was nothing for him to do but gather strength  joan had taken the cook in hand and for the first time as sheldon remarked the chop at berande was white mans chop  with her own hands joan prepared the sick mans food and between that and the cheer she brought him he was able after two days to totter feebly out upon the veranda  the situation struck him as strange and stranger still was the fact that it did not seem strange to the girl at all  she had settled down and taken charge of the household as a matter of course as if he were her father or brother or as if she were a man like himself  it is just too delightful for anything she assured him  it is like a page out of some romance  here i come along out of the sea and find a sick man all alone with two hundred slaves  recruits he corrected  contract labourers  they serve only three years and they are free agents when they enter upon their contracts  yes yes she hurried on  a sick man alone with two hundred recruits on a cannibal islandthey are cannibals arent they  or is it all talk  talk he said with a smile  its a trifle more than that  most of my boys are from the bush and every bushman is a cannibal  but not after they become recruits  surely the boys you have here wouldnt be guilty  theyd eat you if the chance afforded  are you just saying so on theory or do you really know she asked  i know  why  what makes you think so  your own men here  yes my own men here the very houseboys the cook that at the present moment is making such delicious rolls thanks to you  not more than three months ago eleven of them sneaked a whaleboat and ran for malaita nine of them belonged to malaita  two were bushmen from san cristoval they were foolsthe two from san cristoval i mean so would any two malaita men be who trusted themselves in a boat with nine from san cristoval  yes she asked eagerly  then what happened  the nine malaita men ate the two from san cristoval all except the heads which are too valuable for mere eating  they stowed them away in the sternlocker till they landed  and those two heads are now in some bush village back of langa langa  she clapped her hands and her eyes sparkled  they are really and truly cannibals  and just think this is the twentieth century  and i thought romance and adventure were fossilized  he looked at her with mild amusement  what is the matter now she queried  oh nothing only i dont fancy being eaten by a lot of filthy niggers is the least bit romantic  no of course not she admitted  but to be among them controlling them directing them two hundred of them and to escape being eaten by themthat at least if it isnt romantic is certainly the quintessence of adventure  and adventure and romance are allied you know  by the same token to go into a niggers stomach should be the quintessence of adventure he retorted  i dont think you have any romance in you she exclaimed  youre just dull and sombre and sordid like the business men at home  i dont know why youre here at all  you should be at home placidly vegetating as a bankers clerk oror  a shopkeepers assistant thank you  yes thatanything  what under the sun are you doing here on the edge of things  earning my bread and butter trying to get on in the world  by the bitter road the younger son must tread ere he win to hearth and saddle of his own she quoted  why if that isnt romantic then nothing is romantic  think of all the younger sons out over the world on a myriad of adventures winning to those same hearths and saddles  and here you are in the thick of it doing it and here am i in the thick of it doing it  ii beg pardon he drawled  well im a younger daughter then she amended and i have no hearth nor saddlei havent anybody or anythingand im just as far on the edge of things as you are  in your case then ill admit there is a bit of romance he confessed  he could not help but think of the preceding nights and of her sleeping in the hammock on the veranda under mosquito curtains her bodyguard of tahitian sailors stretched out at the far corner of the veranda within call  he had been too helpless to resist but now he resolved she should have his couch inside while he would take the hammock  you see i had read and dreamed about romance all my life she was saying but i never in my wildest fancies thought that i should live it  it was all so unexpected  two years ago i thought there was nothing left to me but     she faltered and made a moue of distaste well the only thing that remained it seemed to me was marriage  and you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridgebelt he suggested  i didnt think of the cannibal isle but the cartridgebelt was blissful  you wouldnt dare use the revolver if you were compelled to  or noting the glint in her eyes if you did use it towell to hit anything  she started up suddenly to enter the house  he knew she was going for her revolver  never mind he said heres mine  what can you do with it  shoot the block off your flaghalyards  he smiled his unbelief  i dont know the gun she said dubiously  its a light trigger and you dont have to hold down  draw fine  yes yes she spoke impatiently  i know automaticsthey jam when they get hotonly i dont know yours  she looked at it a moment  its cocked  is there a cartridge in the chamber  she fired and the block remained intact  its a long shot he said with the intention of easing her chagrin  but she bit her lip and fired again  the bullet emitted a sharp shriek as it ricochetted into space  the metal block rattled back and forth again and again she fired till the clip was emptied of its eight cartridges  six of them were hits  the block still swayed at the gaff end but it was battered out of all usefulness  sheldon was astonished it was better than he or even hughie drummond could have done  the women he had known when they sporadically fired a rifle or revolver usually shrieked shut their eyes and blazed away into space  thats really good shooting    for a woman he said  you only missed it twice and it was a strange weapon  but i cant make out the two misses she complained  the gun worked beautifully too  give me another clip and ill hit it eight times for anything you wish  i dont doubt it  now ill have to get a new block  viaburi  here you fella catch one fella block along storeroom  ill wager you cant do it eight out of eight    anything you wish she challenged  no fear of my taking it on was his answer  who taught you to shoot  oh my father at first and then von and his cowboys  he was a shotdad i mean though von was splendid too  sheldon wondered secretly who von was and he speculated as to whether it was von who two years previously had led her to believe that nothing remained for her but matrimony  what part of the united states is your home he asked  chicago or wyoming or somewhere out there  you know you havent told me a thing about yourself  all that i know is that you are miss joan lackland from anywhere  youd have to go farther west to find my stamping grounds  ah let me seenevada  she shook her head  california  still farther west  it cant be or else ive forgotten my geography  its your politics she laughed  dont you remember annexation  the philippines he cried triumphantly  no hawaii  i was born there  it is a beautiful land  my im almost homesick for it already  not that i havent been away  i was in new york when the crash came  but i do think it is the sweetest spot on earthhawaii i mean  then what under the sun are you doing down here in this godforsaken place he asked  only fools come here he added bitterly  nielsen wasnt a fool was he she queried  as i understand he made three millions here  only too true and that fact is responsible for my being here  and for me too she said  dad heard about him in the marquesas and so we started  only poor dad didnt get here  heyour fatherdied he faltered  she nodded and her eyes grew soft and moist  i might as well begin at the beginning  she lifted her head with a proud air of dismissing sadness after the manner of a woman qualified to wear a badenpowell and a longbarrelled colts  i was born at hilo thats on the island of hawaiithe biggest and best in the whole group i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up  they live in the open and they know how to ride and swim before they know what six timessix is  as for me i cant remember when i first got on a horse nor when i learned to swim  that came before my a b cs  dad owned cattle ranches on hawaii and mauibig ones for the islands  hokuna had two hundred thousand acres alone  it extended in between mauna koa and mauna loa and it was there i learned to shoot goats and wild cattle  on molokai they have big spotted deer  von was the manager of hokuna  he had two daughters about my own age and i always spent the hot season there and once a whole year  the three of us were like indians  not that we ran wild exactly but that we were wild to run wild  there were always the governesses you know and lessons and sewing and housekeeping but im afraid we were too often bribed to our tasks with promises of horses or of cattle drives  von had been in the army and dad was an old seadog and they were both stern disciplinarians only the two girls had no mother and neither had i and they were two men after all  they spoiled us terribly  you see they didnt have any wives and they made chums out of uswhen our tasks were done  we had to learn to do everything about the house twice as well as the native servants did itthat was so that we should know how to manage some day  and we always made the cocktails which was too holy a rite for any servant  then too we were never allowed anything we could not take care of ourselves  of course the cowboys always roped and saddled our horses but we had to be able ourselves to go out in the paddock and rope our horses  what do you mean by rope sheldon asked  to lariat them to lasso them  and dad and von timed us in the saddling and made a most rigid examination of the result  it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles  the houseboys always cleaned them and greased them but we had to learn how in order to see that they did it properly  more than once at first one or the other of us had our rifles taken away for a week just because of a tiny speck of rust  we had to know how to build fires in the driving rain too out of wet wood when we camped out which was the hardest thing of allexcept grammar i do believe  we learned more from dad and von than from the governesses dad taught us french and von german  we learned both languages passably well and we learned them wholly in the saddle or in camp  in the cool season the girls used to come down and visit me in hilo where dad had two houses one at the beach or the three of us used to go down to our place in puna and that meant canoes and boats and fishing and swimming  then too dad belonged to the royal hawaiian yacht club and took us racing and cruising  dad could never get away from the sea you know  when i was fourteen i was dads actual housekeeper with entire power over the servants and i am very proud of that period of my life  and when i was sixteen we three girls were all sent up to california to mills seminary which was quite fashionable and stifling how we used to long for home  we didnt chum with the other girls who called us little cannibals just because we came from the sandwich islands and who made invidious remarks about our ancestors banqueting on captain cookwhich was historically untrue and besides our ancestors hadnt lived in hawaii  i was three years at mills seminary with trips home of course and two years in new york and then dad went smash in a sugar plantation on maui the report of the engineers had not been right  then dad had built a railroad that was called lacklands follyit will pay ultimately though  but it contributed to the smash  the pelaulau ditch was the finishing blow  and nothing would have happened anyway if it hadnt been for that big money panic in wall street  dear good dad  he never let me know  but i read about the crash in a newspaper and hurried home  it was before that though that people had been dinging into my ears that marriage was all any woman could get out of life and goodbye to romance  instead of which with dads failure i fell right into romance  how long ago was that sheldon asked  last yearthe year of the panic  let me see sheldon pondered with an air of gravity  sixteen plus five plus one equals twentytwo  you were born in 1887  yes but it is not nice of you  i am really sorry he said but the problem was so obvious  cant you ever say nice things  or is it the way you english have there was a snap in her gray eyes and her lips quivered suspiciously for a moment  i should recommend mr sheldon that you read gertrude athertons american wives and english husbands  thank you i have  its over there  he pointed at the generously filled bookshelves  but i am afraid it is rather partisan  anything unenglish is bound to be she retorted  i never have liked the english anyway  the last one i knew was an overseer  dad was compelled to discharge him  one swallow doesnt make a summer  but that englishman made lots of troublethere  and now please dont make me any more absurd than i already am  im trying not to  oh for that matter  she tossed her head opened her mouth to complete the retort then changed her mind  i shall go on with my history  dad had practically nothing left and he decided to return to the sea  hed always loved it and i half believe that he was glad things had happened as they did  he was like a boy again busy with plans and preparations from morning till night  he used to sit up half the night talking things over with me  that was after i had shown him that i was really resolved to go along  he had made his start you know in the south seaspearls and pearl shelland he was sure that more fortunes in trove of one sort and another were to be picked up  cocoanutplanting was his particular idea with trading and maybe pearling along with other things until the plantation should come into bearing  he traded off his yacht for a schooner the miele and away we went  i took care of him and studied navigation  he was his own skipper  we had a danish mate mr ericson and a mixed crew of japanese and hawaiians  we went up and down the line islands first until dad was heartsick  everything was changed  they had been annexed and divided by one power or another while big companies had stepped in and gobbled land trading rights fishing rights everything  next we sailed for the marquesas  they were beautiful but the natives were nearly extinct  dad was cut up when he learned that the french charged an export duty on coprahe called it medievalbut he liked the land  there was a valley of fifteen thousand acres on nukahiva half inclosing a perfect anchorage which he fell in love with and bought for twelve hundred chili dollars  but the french taxation was outrageous that was why the land was so cheap and worst of all we could obtain no labour  what kanakas there were wouldnt work and the officials seemed to sit up nights thinking out new obstacles to put in our way  six months was enough for dad  the situation was hopeless  well go to the solomons he said and get a whiff of english rule  and if there are no openings there well go on to the bismarck archipelago  ill wager the admiraltys are not yet civilized  all preparations were made things packed on board and a new crew of marquesans and tahitians shipped  we were just ready to start to tahiti where a lot of repairs and refitting for the miele were necessary when poor dad came down sick and died  and you were left all alone  joan nodded  very much alone  i had no brothers nor sisters and all dads people were drowned in a kansas cloudburst  that happened when he was a little boy  of course i could go back to von  theres always a home there waiting for me  but why should i go  besides there were dads plans and i felt that it devolved upon me to carry them out  it seemed a fine thing to do  also i wanted to carry them out  and    here i am  take my advice and never go to tahiti  it is a lovely place and so are the natives  but the white people  now barabbas lived in tahiti thieves robbers and lairsthat is what they are  the honest men wouldnt require the fingers of one hand to count  the fact that i was a woman only simplified matters with them  they robbed me on every pretext and they lied without pretext or need  poor mr ericson was corrupted  he joined the robbers and okd all their demands even up to a thousand per cent  if they robbed me of ten francs his share was three  one bill of fifteen hundred francs i paid netted him five hundred francs  all this of course i learned afterward  but the miele was old the repairs had to be made and i was charged not three prices but seven prices  i never shall know how much ericson got out of it  he lived ashore in a nicely furnished house  the shipwrights were giving it to him rentfree fruit vegetables fish meat and ice came to this house every day and he paid for none of it  it was part of his graft from the various merchants  and all the while with tears in his eyes he bemoaned the vile treatment i was receiving from the gang  no i did not fall among thieves  i went to tahiti  but when the robbers fell to cheating one another i got my first clues to the state of affairs  one of the robbed robbers came to me after dark with facts figures and assertions  i knew i was ruined if i went to law  the judges were corrupt like everything else  but i did do one thing  in the dead of night i went to ericsons house  i had the same revolver ive got now and i made him stay in bed while i overhauled things  nineteen hundred and odd francs was what i carried away with me he never complained to the police and he never came back on board  as for the rest of the gang they laughed and snapped their fingers at me there were two americans in the place and they warned me to leave the law alone unless i wanted to leave the miele behind as well  then i sent to new zealand and got a german mate  he had a masters certificate and was on the ships papers as captain but i was a better navigator than he and i was really captain myself  i lost her too but its no reflection on my seamanship  we were drifting four days outside there in dead calms  then the norwester caught us and drove us on the lee shore  we made sail and tried to clew off when the rotten work of the tahiti shipwrights became manifest  our jibboom and all our head stays carried away  our only chance was to turn and run through the passage between florida and ysabel  and when we were safely through in the twilight where the chart shows fourteen fathoms as the shoalest water we smashed on a coral patch  the poor old miele struck only once and then went clear but it was too much for her and we just had time to clear away in the boat when she went down  the german mate was drowned  we lay all night to a seadrag and next morning sighted your place here  i suppose you will go back to von now sheldon queried  nothing of the sort  dad planned to go to the solomons  i shall look about for some land and start a small plantation  do you know any good land around here  cheap  by george you yankees are remarkable really remarkable said sheldon i should never have dreamed of such a venture  adventure joan corrected him  thats rightadventure it is  and if youd gone ashore on malaita instead of guadalcanar youd have been kaikaid long ago along with your noble tahitian sailors  joan shuddered  to tell the truth she confessed we were very much afraid to land on guadalcanar  i read in the sailing directions that the natives were treacherous and hostile  some day i should like to go to malaita  are there any plantations there  not one  not a white trader even  then i shall go over on a recruiting vessel some time  impossible sheldon cried  it is no place for a woman  i shall go just the same she repeated  but no selfrespecting woman  be careful she warned him  i shall go some day and then you may be sorry for the names you have called me     chapter vitempest   it was the first time sheldon had been at close quarters with an american girl and he would have wondered if all american girls were like joan lackland had he not had wit enough to realize that she was not at all typical  her quick mind and changing moods bewildered him while her outlook on life was so different from what he conceived a womans outlook should be that he was more often than not at sixes and sevens with her he could never anticipate what she would say or do next  of only one thing was he sure and that was that whatever she said or did was bound to be unexpected and unsuspected  there seemed too something almost hysterical in her makeup  her temper was quick and stormy and she relied too much on herself and too little on him which did not approximate at all to his ideal of womans conduct when a man was around her assumption of equality with him was disconcerting and at times he halfconsciously resented the impudence and bizarreness of her intrusion upon himrising out of the sea in a howling norwester fresh from poking her revolver under ericsons nose protected by her gang of huge polynesian sailors and settling down in berande like any shipwrecked sailor  it was all on a par with her badenpowell and the long 38 colts  at any rate she did not look the part  and that was what he could not forgive  had she been shorthaired heavyjawed largemuscled hard bitten and utterly unlovely in every way all would have been well instead of which she was hopelessly and deliciously feminine  her hair worried him it was so generously beautiful  and she was so slenderly and prettily the womanthe girl ratherthat it cut him like a knife to see her with quick comprehensive eyes and sharply imperative voice superintend the launching of the whaleboat through the surf  in imagination he could see her roping a horse and it always made him shudder  then too she was so manysided  her knowledge of literature and art surprised him while deep down was the feeling that a girl who knew such things had no right to know how to rig tackles heave up anchors and sail schooners around the south seas  such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips  while for such a girl to insist that she was going on a recruiting cruise around malaita was positive selfsacrilege  he always perturbedly harked back to her feminineness  she could play the piano far better than his sisters at home and with far finer appreciationthe piano that poor hughie had so heroically laboured over to keep in condition  and when she strummed the guitar and sang liquid velvety hawaiian hulas he sat entranced  then she was all woman and the magic of sex kidnapped the irritations of the day and made him forget the big revolver the badenpowell and all the rest  but what right the next thought in his brain would whisper had such a girl to swagger around like a man and exult that adventure was not dead  woman that adventured were adventuresses and the connotation was not nice  besides he was not enamoured of adventure  not since he was a boy had it appealed to himthough it would have driven him hard to explain what had brought him from england to the solomons if it had not been adventure  sheldon certainly was not happy  the unconventional state of affairs was too much for his conservative disposition and training  berande inhabited by one lone white man was no place for joan lackland  yet he racked his brain for a way out and even talked it over with her  in the first place the steamer from australia was not due for three weeks  one thing is evident you dont want me here she said  ill man the whaleboat tomorrow and go over to tulagi  but as i told you before that is impossible he cried  there is no one there  the resident commissioner is away in australia  them is only one white man a third assistant understrapper and exsailora common sailor  he is in charge of the government of the solomons to say nothing of a hundred or so niggersprisoners  besides he is such a fool that he would fine you five pounds for not having entered at tulagi which is the port of entry you know  he is not a nice man and i repeat it is impossible  there is guvutu she suggested  he shook his head  theres nothing there but fever and five white men who are drinking themselves to death  i couldnt permit it  oh thank you she said quietly  i guess ill start todayviaburi you go along noa noah speak m come along me  noa noah was her head sailor who had been boatswain of the miele  where are you going sheldon asked in surprisevlaburi  you stop  to guvutuimmediately was her reply  but i wont permit it  that is why i am going  you said it once before and it is something i cannot brook  what  he was bewildered by her sudden anger  if i have offended in any way  viaburi you fetch m one fella noa noah along me she commanded  the black boy started to obey  viaburi  you no stop i break m head belong you  and now miss lackland i insistyou must explain  what have i said or done to merit this  you have presumed you have dared  she choked and swallowed and could not go on  sheldon looked the picture of despair  i confess my head is going around with it all he said  if you could only be explicit  as explicit as you were when you told me that you would not permit me to go to guvutu  but whats wrong with that  but you have no rightno man has the rightto tell me what he will permit or not permit  im too old to have a guardian nor did i sail all the way to the solomons to find one  a gentleman is every womans guardian  well im not every womanthats all  will you kindly allow me to send your boy for noa noah  i wish him to launch the whaleboat  or shall i go myself for him  both were now on their feet she with flushed cheeks and angry eyes he puzzled vexed and alarmed  the black boy stood like a statuea plum black statuetaking no interest in the transactions of these incomprehensible whites but dreaming with calm eyes of a certain bush village high on the jungle slopes of malaita with blue smoke curling up from the grass houses against the gray background of an oncoming mountain squall  but you wont do anything so foolish he began  there you go again she cried  i didnt mean it that way and you know i didnt  he was speaking slowly and gravely  and that other thing that not permittingit is only a manner of speaking  of course i am not your guardian  you know you can go to guvutu if you want toor to the devil he was almost tempted to add  only i should deeply regret it that is all  and i am very sorry that i should have said anything that hurt you  remember i am an englishman  joan smiled and sat down again  perhaps i have been hasty she admitted  you see i am intolerant of restraint  if you only knew how i have been compelled to fight for my freedom  it is a sore point with me this being told what i am to do or not do by you selfconstituted lords of creationviaburi i you stop along kitchen  no bring m noa noahand now mr sheldon what am i to do  you dont want me here and there doesnt seem to be any place for me to go  that is unfair  your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me  i was very lonely and very sick  i really am not certain whether or not i should have pulled through had you not happened along  but that is not the point  personally purely selfishly personally i should be sorry to see you go  but i am not considering myself  i am considering you itit is hardly the proper thing you know  if i were marriedif there were some woman of your own race herebut as it is  she threw up her hands in mock despair  i cannot follow you she said  in one breath you tell me i must go and in the next breath you tell me there is no place to go and that you will not permit me to go  what is a poor girl to do  thats the trouble he said helplessly  and the situation annoys you  only for your sake  then let me save your feelings by telling you that it does not annoy me at allexcept for the row you are making about it  i never allow what cant be changed to annoy me  there is no use in fighting the inevitable  here is the situation  you are here  i am here  i cant go elsewhere by your own account  you certainly cant go elsewhere and leave me here alone with a whole plantation and two hundred woolly cannibals on my hands  therefore you stay and i stay  it is very simple  also it is adventure  and furthermore you neednt worry for yourself  i am not matrimonially inclined  i came to the solomons for a plantation not a husband  sheldon flushed but remained silent  i know what you are thinking she laughed gaily  that if i were a man youd wring my neck for me  and i deserve it too  im so sorry  i ought not to keep on hurting your feelings  im afraid i rather invite it he said relieved by the signs of the tempest subsiding  i have it she announced  lend me a gang of your boys for today ill build a grass house for myself over in the far corner of the compoundon piles of course  i can move in tonight  ill be comfortable and safe  the tahitians can keep an anchor watch just as aboard ship  and then ill study cocoanut planting  in return ill run the kitchen end of your household and give you some decent food to eat and finally i wont listen to any of your protests  i know all that you are going to say and offeryour giving the bungalow up to me and building a grass house for yourself  and i wont have it  you may as well consider everything settled  on the other hand if you dont agree i will go across the river beyond your jurisdiction and build a village for myself and my sailors whom i shall send in the whaleboat to guvutu for provisions  and now i want you to teach me billiards     chapter viia hardbitten gang   joan took hold of the household with no uncertain grip revolutionizing things till sheldon hardly recognized the place  for the first time the bungalow was clean and orderly  no longer the houseboys loafed and did as little as they could while the cook complained that head belong him walk about too much from the strenuous course in cookery which she put him through  nor did sheldon escape being roundly lectured for his laziness in eating nothing but tinned provisions  she called him a muddler and a slouch and other invidious names for his slackness and his disregard of healthful food  she sent her whaleboat down the coast twenty miles for limes and oranges and wanted to know scathingly why said fruits had not long since been planted at berande while he was beneath contempt because there was no kitchen garden  mummy apples which he had regarded as weeds under her guidance appeared as appetizing breakfast fruit and at dinner were metamorphosed into puddings that elicited his unqualified admiration bananas foraged from the bush were served cooked and raw a dozen different ways each one of which he declared was better than any other she or her sailors dynamited fish daily while the balesuna natives were paid tobacco for bringing in oysters from the mangrove swamps  her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation  she taught the cook how to make yeast from the milk that in turn raised light and airy bread from the tiptop heart of the tree she concocted a delicious salad  from the milk and the meat of the nut she made various sauces and dressings sweet and sour that were served according to preparation with dishes that ranged from fish to pudding  she taught sheldon the superiority of cocoanut cream over condensed cream for use in coffee  from the old and sprouting nuts she took the solid spongy centres and turned them into salads  her forte seemed to be salads and she astonished him with the deliciousness of a salad made from young bamboo shoots  wild tomatoes which had gone to seed or been remorselessly hoed out from the beginning of berande were foraged for salads soups and sauces  the chickens which had always gone into the bush and hidden their eggs were given layingbins and joan went out herself to shoot wild duck and wild pigeons for the table  not that i like to do this sort of work she explained in reference to the cookery but because i cant get away from dads training  among other things she burned the pestilential hospital quarrelled with sheldon over the dead and in anger set her own men to work building a new and what she called a decent hospital  she robbed the windows of their lawn and muslin curtains replacing them with gaudy calico from the tradestore and made herself several gowns  when she wrote out a list of goods and clothing for herself to be sent down to sydney by the first steamer sheldon wondered how long she had made up her mind to stay  she was certainly unlike any woman he had ever known or dreamed of  so far as he was concerned she was not a woman at all  she neither languished nor blandished  no feminine lures were wasted on him  he might have been her brother or she his brother for all sex had to do with the strange situation  any mere polite gallantry on his part was ignored or snubbed and he had very early given up offering his hand to her in getting into a boat or climbing over a log and he had to acknowledge to himself that she was eminently fitted to take care of herself  despite his warnings about crocodiles and sharks she persisted in swimming in deep water off the beach nor could he persuade her when she was in the boat to let one of the sailors throw the dynamite when shooting fish  she argued that she was at least a little bit more intelligent than they and that therefore there was less liability of an accident if she did the shooting  she was to him the most masculine and at the same time the most feminine woman he had ever met  a source of continual trouble between them was the disagreement over methods of handling the black boys  she ruled by stern kindness rarely rewarding never punishing and he had to confess that her own sailors worshipped her while the houseboys were her slaves and did three times as much work for her as he had ever got out of them  she quickly saw the unrest of the contract labourers and was not blind to the danger always imminent that both she and sheldon ran  neither of them ever ventured out without a revolver and the sailors who stood the night watches by joans grass house were armed with rifles  but joan insisted that this reign of terror had been caused by the reign of fear practised by the white men  she had been brought up with the gentle hawaiians who never were illtreated nor roughly handled and she generalized that the solomon islanders under kind treatment would grow gentle  one evening a terrific uproar arose in the barracks and sheldon aided by joans sailors succeeded in rescuing two women whom the blacks were beating to death  to save them from the vengeance of the blacks they were guarded in the cookhouse for the night  they were the two women who did the cooking for the labourers and their offence had consisted of one of them taking a bath in the big cauldron in which the potatoes were boiled  the blacks were not outraged from the standpoint of cleanliness they often took baths in the cauldrons themselves  the trouble lay in that the bather had been a low degraded wretched female for to the solomon islander all females are low degraded and wretched  next morning joan and sheldon at breakfast were aroused by a swelling murmur of angry voices  the first rule of berande had been broken  the compound had been entered without permission or command and all the two hundred labourers with the exception of the bossboys were guilty of the offence  they crowded up threatening and shouting close under the front veranda  sheldon leaned over the veranda railing looking down upon them while joan stood slightly back  when the uproar was stilled two brothers stood forth  they were large men splendidly muscled and with faces unusually ferocious even for solomon islanders  one was carinjama otherwise the silent and the other was bellinjama the boaster  both had served on the queensland plantations in the old days and they were known as evil characters wherever white men met and gammed  we fella boy we want m them dam two black fella mary said bellinjama  what you do along black fella mary sheldon asked  kill m said bellinjama  what name you fella boy talk along me sheldon demanded with a show of rising anger  big bell he ring  you no belong along here  you belong along field  bime by big fella bell he ring you stop along kaikai you come talk along me about two fella mary  now all you boy get along out of here  the gang waited to see what bellinjama would do and bellinjama stood still  me no go he said  you watch out bellinjama sheldon said sharply or i send you along tulagi one big fella lashing  my word you catch m strong fella  bellinjama glared up belligerently  you want m fight he said putting up his fists in approved returned queenslander style  now in the solomons where whites are few and blacks are many and where the whites do the ruling such an offer to fight is the deadliest insult blacks are not supposed to dare so highly as to offer to fight a white man  at the best all they can look for is to be beaten by the white man  a murmur of admiration at bellinjamas bravery went up from the listening blacks  but bellinjamas voice was still ringing in the air and the murmuring was just beginning when sheldon cleared the rail leaping straight downward  from the top of the railing to the ground it was fifteen feet and bellinjama was directly beneath  sheldons flying body struck him and crushed him to earth  no blows were needed to be struck  the black had been knocked helpless  joan startled by the unexpected leap saw carinjama the silent reach out and seize sheldon by the throat as he was halfway to his feet while the fivescore blacks surged forward for the killing  her revolver was out and carinjama let go his grip reeling backward with a bullet in his shoulder  in that fleeting instant of action she had thought to shoot him in the arm which at that short distance might reasonably have been achieved  but the wave of savages leaping forward had changed her shot to the shoulder it was a moment when not the slightest chance could be taken  the instant his throat was released sheldon struck out with his fist and carinjama joined his brother on the ground  the mutiny was quelled and five minutes more saw the brothers being carried to the hospital and the mutineers marshalled by the gangbosses on the way to the fields  when sheldon came up on the veranda he found joan collapsed on the steamerchair and in tears  the sight unnerved him as the row just over could not possibly have done  a woman in tears was to him an embarrassing situation and when that woman was joan lackland from whom he had grown to expect anything unexpected he was really frightened  he glanced down at her helplessly and moistened his lips  i want to thank you he began  there isnt a doubt but what you saved my life and i must say  she abruptly removed her hands showing a wrathful and tearstained face  you brute  you coward she cried  you have made me shoot a man and i never shot a man in my life before  its only a fleshwound and he isnt going to die sheldon managed to interpolate  what of that  i shot him just the same  there was no need for you to jump down there that way  it was brutal and cowardly  oh now i say he began soothingly  go away  dont you see i hate you hate you  oh wont you go away  sheldon was white with anger  then why in the name of common sense did you shoot he demanded  bebebecause you were a white man she sobbed  and dad would never have left any white man in the lurch  but it was your fault  you had no right to get yourself in such a position  besides it wasnt necessary  i am afraid i dont understand he said shortly turning away  we will talk it over later on  look how i get on with the boys she said while he paused in the doorway stiffly polite to listen  theres those two sick boys i am nursing  they will do anything for me when they get well and i wont have to keep them in fear of their life all the time  it is not necessary i tell you all this harshness and brutality  what if they are cannibals  they are human beings just like you and me and they are amenable to reason  that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals  he nodded and went out  i suppose ive been unforgivably foolish was her greeting when he returned several hours later from a round of the plantation  ive been to the hospital and the man is getting along all right  it is not a serious hurt  sheldon felt unaccountably pleased and happy at the changed aspect of her mood  you see you dont understand the situation he began  in the first place the blacks have to be ruled sternly  kindness is all very well but you cant rule them by kindness only  i accept all that you say about the hawaiians and the tahitians  you say that they can be handled that way and i believe you  i have had no experience with them  but you have had no experience with the blacks and i ask you to believe me they are different from your natives  you are used to polynesians  these boys are melanesians  theyre blacks  theyre niggerslook at their kinky hair  and theyre a whole lot lower than the african niggers really you know there is a vast difference  they possess no gratitude no sympathy no kindliness  if you are kind to them they think you are a fool  if you are gentle with them they think you are afraid  and when they think you are afraid watch out for they will get you  just to show you let me state the one invariable process in a black mans brain when on his native heath he encounters a stranger  his first thought is one of fear  will the stranger kill him his next thought seeing that he is not killed is can he kill the stranger  there was packard a colonial trader some twelve miles down the coast  he boasted that he ruled by kindness and never struck a blow the result was that he did not rule at all  he used to come down in his whaleboat to visit hughie and me  when his boats crew decided to go home he had to cut his visit short to accompany them  i remember one sunday afternoon when packard had accepted our invitation to stop to dinner  the soup was just served when hughie saw a nigger peering in through the door  he went out to him for it was a violation of berande custom  any nigger has to send in word by the houseboys and to keep outside the compound  this man who was one of packards boatscrew was on the veranda  and he knew better too  what name said hughie you tell m white man close up we fella boatscrew go along  he no come now we fella boy no wait  we go  and just then hughie fetched him a clout that knocked him clean down the stairs and off the veranda  but it was needlessly cruel joan objected  you wouldnt treat a white man that way  and thats just the point  he wasnt a white man  he was a low black nigger and he was deliberately insulting not alone his own white master but every white master in the solomons  he insulted me  he insulted hughie  he insulted berande  of course according to your lights to your formula of the rule of the strong  yes sheldon interrupted but it was according to the formula of the rule of the weak that packard ruled  and what was the result  i am still alive  packard is dead  he was unswervingly kind and gentle to his boys and his boys waited till one day he was down with fever  his head is over on malaita now  they carried away two whaleboats as well filled with the loot of the store  then there was captain mackenzie of the ketch minota  he believed in kindness  he also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons  on his second trip to malaita recruiting he ran into bina which is near langa langa the rifles with which the boatscrew should have been armed were locked up in his cabin  when the whaleboat went ashore after recruits he paraded around the deck without even a revolver on him  he was tomahawked  his head remains in malaita  it was suicide  so was packards finish suicide  i grant that precaution is necessary in dealing with them joan agreed but i believe that more satisfactory results can be obtained by treating them with discreet kindness and gentleness  and there i agree with you but you must understand one thing berande bar none is by far the worst plantation in the solomons so far as the labour is concerned  and how it came to be so proves your point the previous owners of berande were not discreetly kind  they were a pair of unadulterated brutes  one was a downeast yankee as i believe they are called and the other was a guzzling german  they were slave drivers  to begin with they bought their labour from johnny beblowed the most notorious recruiter in the solomons  he is working out a ten years sentence in fiji now for the wanton killing of a black boy during his last days here he had made himself so obnoxious that the natives on malaita would have nothing to do with him  the only way he could get recruits was by hurrying to the spot whenever a murder or series of murders occurred  the murderers were usually only too willing to sign on and get away to escape vengeance  down here they call such escapes pierhead jumps  there is suddenly a roar from the beach and a nigger runs down to the water pursued by clouds of spears and arrows of course johnny bebloweds whaleboat is lying ready to pick him up in his last days johnny got nothing but pierhead jumps  and the first owners of berande bought his recruitsa hardbitten gang of murderers  they were all fiveyear boys  you see the recruiter has the advantage over a boy when he makes a pierhead jump  he could sign him on for ten years did the law permit  well thats the gang of murderers weve got on our hands now  of course some are dead some have been killed and there are others serving sentences at tulagi  very little clearing did those first owners do and less planting  it was war all the time  they had one manager killed  one of the partners had his shoulder slashed nearly off by a caneknife  the other was speared on two different occasions  both were bullies wherefore there was a streak of cowardice in them and in the end they had to give up  they were chased awayliterally chased awayby their own niggers  and along came poor hughie and me two new chums to take hold of that hardbitten gang we did not know the situation and we had bought berande and there was nothing to do but hang on and muddle through somehow  at first we made the mistake of indiscreet kindness  we tried to rule by persuasion and fair treatment  the niggers concluded that we were afraid  i blush to think of what fools we were in those first days  we were imposed on and threatened and insulted and we put up with it hoping our squaredealing would soon mend things  instead of which everything went from bad to worse  then came the day when hughie reprimanded one of the boys and was nearly killed by the gang  the only thing that saved him was the number on top of him which enabled me to reach the spot in time  then began the rule of the strong hand  it was either that or quit and we had sunk about all our money into the venture and we could not quit and besides our pride was involved  we had started out to do something and we were so made that we just had to go on with it  it has been a hard fight for we were and are to this day considered the worst plantation in the solomons from the standpoint of labour  do you know we have been unable to get white men in  weve offered the managership to half a dozen  i wont say they were afraid for they were not  but they did not consider it healthyat least that is the way it was put by the last one who declined our offer  so hughie and i did the managing ourselves  and when he died you were prepared to go on all alone joan cried with shining eyes  i thought id muddle through  and now miss lackland please be charitable when i seem harsh and remember that the situation is unparalleled down here  weve got a bad crowd and were making them work  youve been over the plantation and you ought to know  and i assure you that there are no better threeandfouryearsold trees on any other plantation in the solomons  we have worked steadily to change matters for the better  weve been slowly getting in new labour  that is why we bought the jessie  we wanted to select our own labour  in another year the time will be up for most of the original gang  you see they were recruited during the first year of berande and their contracts expire on different months  naturally they have contaminated the new boys to a certain extent but that can soon be remedied and then berande will be a respectable plantation  joan nodded but remained silent  she was too occupied in glimpsing the vision of the one lone white man as she had first seen him helpless from fever a collapsed wraith in a steamerchair who up to the last heart beat by some strange alchemy of race was pledged to mastery  it is a pity she said  but the white man has to rule i suppose  i dont like it sheldon assured her  to save my life i cant imagine how i ever came here  but here i am and i cant run away  blind destiny of race she said faintly smiling  we whites have been land robbers and sea robbers from remotest time  it is in our blood i guess and we cant get away from it  i never thought about it so abstractly he confessed  ive been too busy puzzling over why i came here     chapter viiilocal colour   at sunset a small ketch fanned in to anchorage and a little later the skipper came ashore  he was a softspoken gentlevoiced young fellow of twenty but he won joans admiration in advance when sheldon told her that he ran the ketch all alone with a black crew from malaita  and romance lured and beckoned before joans eyes when she learned he was christian young a norfolk islander but a direct descendant of john young one of the original bounty mutineers  the blended tahitian and english blood showed in his soft eyes and tawny skin but the english hardness seemed to have disappeared  yet the hardness was there and it was what enabled him to run his ketch singlehanded and to wring a livelihood out of the fighting solomons  joans unexpected presence embarrassed him until she herself put him at his ease by a frank comradely manner that offended sheldons sense of the fitness of things feminine  news from the world young had not but he was filled with news of the solomons  fifteen boys had stolen rifles and run away into the bush from lunga plantation which was farther east on the guadalcanar coast  and from the bush they had sent word that they were coming back to wipe out the three white men in charge while two of the three white men in turn were hunting them through the bush  there was a strong possibility young volunteered that if they were not caught they might circle around and tap the coast at berande in order to steal or capture a whaleboat  i forgot to tell you that your trader at ugi has been murdered he said to sheldon  five big canoes came down from port adams  they landed in the nighttime and caught oscar asleep  what they didnt steal they burned  the flibbertygibbet got the news at mboli pass and ran down to ugi  i was at mboli when the news came  i think ill have to abandon ugi sheldon remarked  its the second trader youve lost there in a year young concurred to make it safe there ought to be two white men at least  those malaita canoes are always raiding down that way and you know what that port adams lot is  ive got a dog for you  tommy jones sent it up from neal island  he said hed promised it to you  its a firstclass niggerchaser  hadnt been on board two minutes when he had my whole boatscrew in the rigging  tommy calls him satan  ive wondered several times why you had no dogs here joan said  the trouble is to keep them  theyre always eaten by the crocodiles  jack hanley was killed at marovo lagoon two months ago young announced in his mild voice  the news just came down on the apostle  where is marovo lagoon joan asked  new georgia a couple of hundred miles to the westward sheldon answered  bougainville lies just beyond  his own houseboys did it young went on but they were put up to it by the marovo natives  his santa cruz boatscrew escaped in the whale boat to choiseul and mather in the lily sailed over to marovo  he burned a village and got hanleys head back  he found it in one of the houses where the niggers had it drying  and thats all the news ive got except that theres a lot of new leeenfields loose on the eastern end of ysabel  nobody knows how the natives got them  the government ought to investigate  andoh yes a war vessels in the group the cambrian  she burned three villages at binaon account of the minota you knowand shelled the bush  then she went to sio to straighten out things there  the conversation became general and just before young left to go on board joan asked  how can you manage all alone mr young  his large almost girlish eyes rested on her for a moment before he replied and then it was in the softest and gentlest of voices  oh i get along pretty well with them  of course there is a bit of trouble once in a while but that must be expected  you must never let them think you are afraid  ive been afraid plenty of times but they never knew it  you would think he wouldnt strike a mosquito that was biting him sheldon said when young had gone on board  all the norfolk islanders that have descended from the bounty crowd are that way  but look at young  only three years ago when he first got the minerva he was lying in suu on malaita  there are a lot of returned queenslanders therea rough crowd  they planned to get his head  the son of their chief old oneeyed billy had recruited on lunga and died of dysentery that meant that a white mans head was owing to suuany white man it didnt matter who so long as they got the head  and young was only a lad and they made sure to get his easily  they decoyed his whaleboat ashore with a promise of recruits and killed all hands  at the same instant the suu gang that was on board the minerva jumped young  he was just preparing a dynamite stick for fish and he lighted it and tossed it in amongst them  one cant get him to talk about it but the fuse was short the survivors leaped overboard while he slipped his anchor and got away  theyve got one hundred fathoms of shell money on his head now which is worth one hundred pounds sterling  yet he goes into suu regularly  he was there a short time ago returning thirty boys from cape marshthats the fulcrum brothers plantation  at any rate his news tonight has given me a better insight into the life down here joan said  and it is colourful life to say the least the solomons ought to be printed red on the chartsand yellow too for the diseases  the solomons are not always like this sheldon answered  of course berande is the worst plantation and everything it gets is the worst  i doubt if ever there was a worse run of sickness than we were just getting over when you arrived  just as luck would have it the jessie caught the contagion as well  berande has been very unfortunate  all the old timers shake their heads at it  they say it has what you americans call a hoodoo on it  berande will succeed joan said stoutly  i like to laugh at superstition  youll pull through and come out the big end of the horn the ill luck cant last for ever  i am afraid though the solomons is not a white mans climate  it will be though  give us fifty years and when all the bush is cleared off back to the mountains fever will be stamped out everything will be far healthier  there will be cities and towns here for theres an immense amount of good land going to waste  but it will never become a white mans climate in spite of all that joan reiterated  the white man will always be unable to perform the manual labour  that is true  it will mean slavery she dashed on  yes like all the tropics  the black the brown and the yellow will have to do the work managed by the white men  the black labour is too wasteful however and in time chinese or indian coolies will be imported  the planters are already considering the matter  i for one am heartily sick of black labour  then the blacks will die off  sheldon shrugged his shoulders and retorted  yes like the north american indian who was a far nobler type than the melanesian  the world is only so large you know and it is filling up  and the unfit must perish  precisely so  the unfit must perish  in the morning joan was roused by a great row and hullabaloo  her first act was to reach for her revolver but when she heard noa noah who was on guard laughing outside she knew there was no danger and went out to see the fun  captain young had landed satan at the moment when the bridgebuilding gang had started along the beach  satan was big and black shorthaired and muscular and weighed fully seventy pounds  he did not love the blacks  tommy jones had trained him well tying him up daily for several hours and telling off one or two black boys at a time to tease him  so satan had it in for the whole black race and the second after he landed on the beach the bridgebuilding gang was stampeding over the compound fence and swarming up the cocoanut palms  good morning sheldon called from the veranda  and what do you think of the niggerchaser  im thinking we have a task before us to train him in to the houseboys she called back  and to your tahitians too  look out noah  run for it  satan having satisfied himself that the treeperches were unassailable was charging straight for the big tahitian  but noah stood his ground though somewhat irresolutely and satan to every ones surprise danced and frisked about him with laughing eyes and wagging tail  now that is what i might call a proper dog was joans comment  he is at least wiser than you mr sheldon  he didnt require any teaching to recognize the difference between a tahitian and a black boy  what do you think noah  why dont he bite you  he savvee you tahitian eh  noa noah shook his head and grinned  he no savvee me tahitian he explained  he savvee me wear pants all the same white man  youll have to give him a course in sartor resartus sheldon laughed as he came down and began to make friends with satan  it chanced just then that adamu adam and matauare two of joans sailors entered the compound from the far sidegate  they had been down to the balesuna making an alligator trap and instead of trousers were clad in lavalavas that flapped gracefully about their stalwart limbs  satan saw them and advertised his find by breaking away from sheldons hands and charging  no got pants noah announced with a grin that broadened as adamu adam took to flight  he climbed up the platform that supported the galvanized iron tanks which held the water collected from the roof  foiled here satan turned and charged back on matauare  run matauare  run joan called  but he held his ground and waited the dog  he is the fearless onethat is what his name means joan explained to sheldon  the tahitian watched satan coolly and when that sanguinemouthed creature lifted into the air in the final leap the mans hand shot out it was a fair grip on the lower jaw and satan described a half circle and was flung to the rear turning over in the air and falling heavily on his back  three times he leaped and three times that grip on his jaw flung him to defeat  then he contented himself with trotting at matauares heels eyeing him and sniffing him suspiciously  its all right satan its all right sheldon assured him  that good fella belong along me  but satan dogged the tahitians movements for a full hour before he made up his mind that the man was an appurtenance of the place  then he turned his attention to the three houseboys cornering ornfiri in the kitchen and rushing him against the hot stove stripping the lavalava from lalaperu when that excited youth climbed a verandapost and following viaburi on top the billiardtable where the battle raged until joan managed a rescue     chapter ixas between a man and a woman   it was satans inexhaustible energy and good spirits that most impressed them  his teeth seemed perpetually to ache with desire and in lieu of black legs he husked the cocoanuts that fell from the trees in the compound kept the enclosure clear of intruding hens and made a hostile acquaintance with every bossboy who came to report  he was unable to forget the torment of his puppyhood wherein everlasting hatred of the black had been woven into the fibres of consciousness and such a terror did he make himself that sheldon was forced to shut him up in the living room when for any reason strange natives were permitted in the compound  this always hurt satans feelings and fanned his wrath so that even the houseboys had to watch out for him when he was first released  christian young sailed away in the minerva carrying an invitation that would be delivered nobody knew when to tommy jones to drop in at berande the next time he was passing  what are your plans when you get to sydney sheldon asked that night at dinner  first ive heard that im going to sydney joan retorted  i suppose youve received information by bushtelegraph that that third assistant understrapper and exsailorman at tulagi is going to deport me as an undesirable immigrant  oh no nothing of the sort i assure you sheldon began with awkward haste fearful of having offended though he knew not how  i was just wondering that was all  you see with the loss of the schooner and   and all the rest    you understand   i was thinking that ifaifhang it all until you could communicate with your friends my agents at sydney could advance you a loan temporary you see why id be only too glad and all the rest you know  the proper  but his jaw dropped and he regarded her irritably and with apprehension  what is the matter he demanded with a show of heat  what have i done now  joans eyes were bright with battle the curve of her lips sharp with mockery  certainly not the unexpected she said quietly  merely ignored me in your ordinary everyday mangod superior fashion  naturally it counted for nothing my telling you that i had no idea of going to sydney  go to sydney i must because you in your superior wisdom have so decreed  she paused and looked at him curiously as though he were some strange breed of animal  of course i am grateful for your offer of assistance but even that is no salve to wounded pride  for that matter it is no more than one white man should expect from another  shipwrecked mariners are always helped along their way  only this particular mariner doesnt need any help furthermore this mariner is not going to sydney thank you  but what do you intend to do  find some spot where i shall escape the indignity of being patronized and bossed by the superior sex  come now that is putting it a bit too strongly  sheldon laughed but the strain in his voice destroyed the effect of spontaneity  you know yourself how impossible the situation is  i know nothing of the sort sir  and if it is impossible well havent i achieved it  but it cannot continue  really  oh yes it can  having achieved it i can go on achieving it  i intend to remain in the solomons but not on berande  tomorrow i am going to take the whaleboat over to parisulay  i was talking with captain young about it  he says there are at least four hundred acres and every foot of it good for planting  being an island he says i wont have to bother about wild pigs destroying the young trees  all ill have to do is to keep the weeds hoed until the trees come into bearing  first ill buy the island next get forty or fifty recruits and start clearing and planting and at the same time ill run up a bungalow and then youll be relieved of my embarrassing presencenow dont say that it isnt  it is embarrassing he said bluntly  but you refuse to see my point of view so there is no use in discussing it  now please forget all about it and consider me at your service concerning this    this project of yours  i know more about cocoanutplanting than you do  you speak like a capitalist  i dont know how much money you have but i dont fancy you are rolling in wealth as you americans say  but i do know what it costs to clear land  suppose the government sells you pari sulay at a pound an acre clearing will cost you at least four pounds more that is five pounds for four hundred acres or say ten thousand dollars  have you that much  she was keenly interested and he could see that the previous clash between them was already forgotten  her disappointment was plain as she confessed  no i havent quite eight thousand dollars  then heres another way of looking at it  youll need as you said at least fifty boys  not counting premiums their wages are thirty dollars a year  i pay my tahitians fifteen a month she interpolated  they wont do on straight plantation work  but to return  the wages of fifty boys each year will come to three hundred poundsthat is fifteen hundred dollars  very well  it will be seven years before your trees begin to bear  seven times fifteen hundred is ten thousand five hundred dollarsmore than you possess and all eaten up by the boys wages with nothing to pay for bungalow building tools quinine trips to sydney and so forth  sheldon shook his head gravely  youll have to abandon the idea  but i wont go to sydney she cried  i simply wont  ill buy in to the extent of my money as a small partner in some other plantation  let me buy in in berande  heaven forbid he cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter  there i wont tease you  really you know im not accustomed to forcing my presence where it is not desired  yes yes i know youre just aching to point out that ive forced myself upon you ever since i landed only you are too polite to say so  yet as you said yourself it was impossible for me to go away so i had to stay  you wouldnt let me go to tulagi  you compelled me to force myself upon you  but i wont buy in as partner with any one  ill buy parisulay but ill put only ten boys on it and clear slowly  also ill invest in some old ketch and take out a trading license  for that matter ill go recruiting on malaita  she looked for protest and found it in sheldons clenched hand and in every line of his cleancut face  go ahead and say it she challenged  please dont mind me  imim getting used to it you know  really i am  i wish i were a woman so as to tell you how preposterously insane and impossible it is he blurted out  she surveyed him with deliberation and said  better than that you are a man  so there is nothing to prevent your telling me for i demand to be considered as a man  i didnt come down here to trail my womans skirts over the solomons  please forget that i am accidentally anything else than a man with a mans living to make  inwardly sheldon fumed and fretted  was she making game of him  or did there lurk in her the insidious unhealthfulness of unwomanliness  or was it merely a case of blank staring sentimental idiotic innocence  i have told you he began stiffly that recruiting on malaita is impossible for a woman and that is all i care to sayor dare  and i tell you in turn that it is nothing of the sort  ive sailed the miele here master if you please all the way from tahitieven if i did lose her which was the fault of your admiralty charts  i am a navigator and that is more than your solomons captains are  captain young told me all about it  and i am a seamana better seaman than you when it comes right down to it and you know it  i can shoot  i am not a fool  i can take care of myself  and i shall most certainly buy a ketch run her myself and go recruiting on malaita  sheldon made a hopeless gesture  thats right she rattled on  wash your hands of me  but as von used to say you just watch my smoke  theres no use in discussing it  let us have some music  he arose and went over to the big phonograph but before the disc started and while he was winding the machine he heard her saying  i suppose youve been accustomed to jane eyres all your life  thats why you dont understand me  come on satan lets leave him to his old music  he watched her morosely and without intention of speaking till he saw her take a rifle from the stand examine the magazine and start for the door  where are you going he asked peremptorily  as between man and woman she answered it would be too terriblyerindecent for you to tell me why i shouldnt go alligatoring  goodnight  sleep well  he shut off the phonograph with a snap started toward the door after her then abruptly flung himself into a chair  youre hoping a gator catches me arent you she called from the veranda and as she went down the steps her rippling laughter drifted tantalizingly back through the wide doorway     chapter xa message from boucher   the next day sheldon was left all alone  joan had gone exploring pari sulay and was not to be expected back until the late afternoon  sheldon was vaguely oppressed by his loneliness and several heavy squalls during the afternoon brought him frequently on to the veranda telescope in hand to scan the sea anxiously for the whaleboat  betweenwhiles he scowled over the plantation accountbooks made rough estimates added and balanced and scowled the harder  the loss of the jessie had hit berande severely  not alone was his capital depleted by the amount of her value but her earnings were no longer to be reckoned on and it was her earnings that largely paid the running expenses of the plantation  poor old hughie he muttered aloud once  im glad you didnt live to see it old man  what a cropper what a cropper  between squalls the flibbertygibbet ran in to anchorage and her skipper pete oleson brother to the oleson of the jessie ancient grizzled wildeyed emaciated by fever dragged his weary frame up the veranda steps and collapsed in a steamerchair  whisky and soda kept him going while he made report and turned in his accounts  youre rotten with fever sheldon said  why dont you run down to sydney for a blow of decent climate  the old skipper shook his head  i cant  ive ben in the islands too long  id die  the fever comes out worse down there  kill or cure sheldon counselled  its straight kill for me  i tried it three years ago  the cool weather put me on my back before i landed  they carried me ashore and into hospital  i was unconscious one stretch for two weeks  after that the doctors sent me back to the islandssaid it was the only thing that would save me  well im still alive but im too soaked with fever  a month in australia would finish me  but what are you going to do sheldon queried  you cant stay here until you die  thats all thats left to me  id like to go back to the old country but i couldnt stand it  ill last longer here and here ill stay until i peg out but i wish to god id never seen the solomons thats all  he declined to sleep ashore took his orders and went back on board the cutter  a lurid sunset was blotted out by the heaviest squall of the day and sheldon watched the whaleboat arrive in the thick of it  as the spritsail was taken in and the boat headed on to the beach he was aware of a distinct hurt at sight of joan at the steeringoar standing erect and swaying her strength to it as she resisted the pressures that tended to throw the craft broadside in the surf  her tahitians leaped out and rushed the boat high up the beach and she led her bizarre following through the gate of the compound  the first drops of rain were driving like hailstones the tall cocoanut palms were bending and writhing in the grip of the wind while the thick cloudmass of the squall turned the brief tropic twilight abruptly to night  quite unconsciously the brooding anxiety of the afternoon slipped from sheldon and he felt strangely cheered at the sight of her running up the steps laughing face flushed hair flying her breast heaving from the violence of her late exertions  lovely perfectly lovelyparisulay she panted  i shall buy it ill write to the commissioner tonight  and the site for the bungalowive selected it alreadyis wonderful  you must come over some day and advise me  you wont mind my staying here until i can get settled  wasnt that squall beautiful  and i suppose im late for dinner  ill run and get clean and be with you in a minute  and in the brief interval of her absence he found himself walking about the big livingroom and impatiently and with anticipation awaiting her coming  do you know im never going to squabble with you again he announced when they were seated  squabble was the retort  its such a sordid word  it sounds cheap and nasty  i think its much nicer to quarrel  call it what you please but we wont do it any more will we  he cleared his throat nervously for her eyes advertised the immediate beginning of hostilities  i beg your pardon he hurried on  i should have spoken for myself  what i mean is that i refuse to quarrel  you have the most horrible way without uttering a word of making me play the fool  why i began with the kindest intentions and here i am now  making nasty remarks she completed for him  its the way you have of catching me up he complained  why i never said a word  i was merely sitting here being sweetly lured on by promises of peace on earth and all the rest of it when suddenly you began to call me names  hardly that i am sure  well you said i was horrible or that i had a horrible way about me which is the same thing  i wish my bungalow were up  id move tomorrow  but her twitching lips belied her words and the next moment the man was more uncomfortable than ever being made so by her laughter  i was only teasing you  honest injun  and if you dont laugh ill suspect you of being in a temper with me  thats right laugh  but dont she added in alarm dont if it hurts you  you look as though you had a toothache  there theredont say it  you know you promised not to quarrel while i have the privilege of going on being as hateful as i please  and to begin with theres the flibbertygibbet  i didnt know she was so large a cutter but shes in disgraceful condition  her rigging is something queer and the next sharp squall will bring her headgear all about the shop  i watched noa noahs face as we sailed past  he didnt say anything  he just sneered  and i dont blame him  her skippers rotten bad with fever sheldon explained  and he had to drop his mate off to take hold of things at ugithats where i lost oscar my trader  and you know what sort of sailors the niggers are  she nodded her head judicially and while she seemed to debate a weighty judgment he asked for a second helping of tinned beefnot because he was hungry but because he wanted to watch her slim firm fingers naked of jewels and banded metals while his eyes pleasured in the swell of the forearm appearing from under the sleeve and losing identity in the smooth round wrist undisfigured by the netted veins that come to youth when youth is gone  the fingers were brown with tan and looked exceedingly boyish  then and without effort the concept came to him yes that was it  he had stumbled upon the clue to her tantalizing personality  her fingers sunburned and boyish told the story  no wonder she had exasperated him so frequently  he had tried to treat with her as a woman when she was not a woman  she was a mere girland a boyish girl at thatwith sunburned fingers that delighted in doing what boys fingers did with a body and muscles that liked swimming and violent endeavour of all sorts with a mind that was daring but that dared no farther than boys adventures and that delighted in rifles and revolvers stetson hats and a sexless camaraderie with men  somehow as he pondered and watched her it seemed as if he sat in church at home listening to the choirboys chanting  she reminded him of those boys or their voices rather  the same sexless quality was there  in the body of her she was woman in the mind of her she had not grown up she had not been exposed to ripening influences of that sort  she had had no mother  von her father native servants and rough island life had constituted her training  horses and rifles had been her toys camp and trail her nursery  from what she had told him her seminary days had been an exile devoted to study and to ceaseless longing for the wild riding and swimming of hawaii  a boys training and a boys point of view  that explained her chafe at petticoats her revolt at what was only decently conventional  some day she would grow up but as yet she was only in the process  well there was only one thing for him to do  he must meet her on her own basis of boyhood and not make the mistake of treating her as a woman  he wondered if he could love the woman she would be when her nature awoke and he wondered if he could love her just as she was and himself wake her up  after all whatever it was she had come to fill quite a large place in his life as he had discovered that afternoon while scanning the sea between the squalls  then he remembered the accounts of berande and the cropper that was coming and scowled  he became aware that she was speaking  i beg pardon he said  whats that you were saying  you werent listening to a wordi knew it she chided  i was saying that the condition of the flibbertygibbet was disgraceful and that to morrow when youve told the skipper and not hurt his feelings i am going to take my men out and give her an overhauling  well scrub her bottom too  why theres whiskers on her copper four inches long  i saw it when she rolled  dont forget im going cruising on the flibberty some day even if i have to run away with her  while at their coffee on the veranda satan raised a commotion in the compound near the beach gate and sheldon finally rescued a mauled and frightened black and dragged him on the porch for interrogation  what fella marster you belong he demanded  what name you come along this fella place sun he go down  me blong boucher  too many boy belong along port adams stop along my fella marster  too much walk about  the black drew a scrap of notepaper from under his belt and passed it over  sheldon scanned it hurriedly  its from boucher he explained the fellow who took packards place packard was the one i told you about who was killed by his boatscrew he says the port adams crowd is outfifty of them in big canoesand camping on his beach  theyve killed half a dozen of his pigs already and seem to be looking for trouble  and hes afraid they may connect with the fifteen runaways from lunga  in which case she queried  in which case billy pape will be compelled to send bouchers successor its papes station you know  i wish i knew what to do  i dont like to leave you here alone  take me along then  he smiled and shook his head  then youd better take my men along she advised  theyre good shots and theyre not afraid of anythingexcept utami and hes afraid of ghosts  the big bell was rung and fifty black boys carried the whaleboat down to the water  the regular boatscrew manned her and matauare and three other tahitians belted with cartridges and armed with rifles sat in the sternsheets where sheldon stood at the steeringoar  my i wish i could go with you joan said wistfully as the boat shoved off  sheldon shook his head  im as good as a man she urged  you really are needed here he replied  theres that lunga crowd they might reach the coast right here and with both of us absent rush the plantation  goodbye  well get back in the morning some time  its only twelve miles  when joan started to return to the house she was compelled to pass among the boatcarriers who lingered on the beach to chatter in queer ape like fashion about the events of the night  they made way for her but there came to her as she was in the midst of them a feeling of her own helplessness  there were so many of them  what was to prevent them from dragging her down if they so willed  then she remembered that one cry of hers would fetch noa noah and her remaining sailors each one of whom was worth a dozen blacks in a struggle  as she opened the gate one of the boys stepped up to her  in the darkness she could not make him out  what name she asked sharply  what name belong you  me aroa he said  she remembered him as one of the two sick boys she had nursed at the hospital  the other one had died  me take m plenty fella medicine too much aroa was saying  well and you all right now she answered  me want m tobacco plenty fella tobacco me want m calico me want m porpoise teeth me want m one fella belt  she looked at him humorously expecting to see a smile or at least a grin on his face  instead his face was expressionless  save for a narrow breechclout a pair of earplugs and about his kinky hair a chaplet of white cowrieshells he was naked  his body was freshoiled and shiny and his eyes glistened in the starlight like some wild animals  the rest of the boys had crowded up at his back in a solid wall  some one of them giggled but the remainder regarded her in morose and intense silence  well she said  what for you want plenty fella things  me take m medicine quoth aroa  you pay me  and this was a sample of their gratitude she thought  it looked as if sheldon had been right after all  aroa waited stolidly  a leaping fish splashed far out on the water  a tiny wavelet murmured sleepily on the beach  the shadow of a flyingfox drifted by in velvet silence overhead a light air fanned coolly on her cheek it was the landbreeze beginning to blow  you go along quarters she said starting to turn on her heel to enter the gate  you pay me said the boy  aroa you all the same one big fool  i no pay you  now you go  but the black was unmoved  she felt that he was regarding her almost insolently as he repeated  i take m medicine  you pay me  you pay me now  then it was that she lost her temper and cuffed his ears so soundly as to drive him back among his fellows  but they did not break up  another boy stepped forward  you pay me he said  his eyes had the querulous troubled look such as she had noticed in monkeys but while he was patently uncomfortable under her scrutiny his thick lips were drawn firmly in an effort at sullen determination  what for she asked  me gogoomy he said  bawo brother belong me  bawo she remembered was the sick boy who had died  go on she commanded  bawo take m medicine  bawo finish  bawo my brother  you pay me father belong me one big fella chief along port adams  you pay me  joan laughed  gogoomy you just the same as aroa one big fool  my word who pay me for medicine  she dismissed the matter by passing through the gate and closing it  but gogoomy pressed up against it and said impudently  father belong me one big fella chief  you no bang m head belong me  my word you fright too much  me fright she demanded while anger tingled all through her  too much fright bang m head belong me gogoomy said proudly  and then she reached for him across the gate and got him  it was a sweeping broadhanded slap so heavy that he staggered sideways and nearly fell  he sprang for the gate as if to force it open while the crowd surged forward against the fence  joan thought rapidly  her revolver was hanging on the wall of her grass house  yet one cry would bring her sailors and she knew she was safe  so she did not cry for help  instead she whistled for satan at the same time calling him by name  she knew he was shut up in the living room but the blacks did not wait to see  they fled with wild yells through the darkness followed reluctantly by gogoomy while she entered the bungalow laughing at first but finally vexed to the verge of tears by what had taken place she had sat up a whole night with the boy who had died and yet his brother demanded to be paid for his life  ugh the ungrateful beast she muttered while she debated whether or not she would confess the incident to sheldon     chapter xithe port adams crowd   and so it was all settled easily enough sheldon was saying  he was on the veranda drinking coffee  the whaleboat was being carried into its shed  boucher was a bit timid at first to carry off the situation with a strong hand but he did very well once we got started  we made a play at holding a court and telepasse the old scoundrel accepted the findings  hes a port adams chief a filthy beggar  we fined him ten times the value of the pigs and made him move on with his mob  oh theyre a sweet lot i must say at least sixty of them in five big canoes and out for trouble  theyve got a dozen sniders that ought to be confiscated  why didnt you joan asked  and have a row on my hands with the commissioner  hes terribly touchy about his black wards as he calls them  well we started them along their way though they went in on the beach to kaikai several miles back  they ought to pass here some time today  two hours later the canoes arrived  no one saw them come  the house boys were busy in the kitchen at their own breakfast  the plantation hands were similarly occupied in their quarters  satan lay sound asleep on his back under the billiard table in his sleep brushing at the flies that pestered him  joan was rummaging in the storeroom and sheldon was taking his siesta in a hammock on the veranda  he awoke gently  in some occult subtle way a warning that all was not well had penetrated his sleep and aroused him  without moving he glanced down and saw the ground beneath covered with armed savages  they were the same ones he had parted with that morning though he noted an accession in numbers there were men he had not seen before  he slipped from the hammock and with deliberate slowness sauntered to the railing where he yawned sleepily and looked down on them  it came to him curiously that it was his destiny ever to stand on this high place looking down on unending hordes of black trouble that required control bullying and cajolery  but while he glanced carelessly over them he was keenly taking stock  the new men were all armed with modern rifles ah he had thought so  there were fifteen of them undoubtedly the lunga runaways  in addition a dozen old sniders were in the hands of the original crowd  the rest were armed with spears clubs bows and arrows and longhandled tomahawks  beyond drawn up on the beach he could see the big warcanoes with high and fantastically carved bows and sterns ornamented with scrolls and bands of white cowrie shells  these were the men who had killed his trader oscar at ugi  what name you walk about this place he demanded  at the same time he stole a glance seaward to where the flibbertygibbet reflected herself in the glassy calm of the sea  not a soul was visible under her awnings and he saw the whaleboat was missing from alongside  the tahitians had evidently gone shooting fish up the balesuna  he was all alone in his high place above this trouble while his world slumbered peacefully under the breathless tropic noon  nobody replied and he repeated his demand more of mastery in his voice this time and a hint of growing anger  the blacks moved uneasily like a herd of cattle at the sound of his voice  but not one spoke  all eyes however were staring at him in certitude of expectancy  something was about to happen and they were waiting for it waiting with the unanimous unstable mobmind for the one of them who would make the first action that would precipitate all of them into a common action  sheldon looked for this one for such was the one to fear  directly beneath him he caught sight of the muzzle of a rifle barely projecting between two black bodies that was slowly elevating toward him  it was held at the hip by a man in the second row  what name you sheldon suddenly shouted pointing directly at the man who held the gun who startled and lowered the muzzle  sheldon still held the whip hand and he intended to keep it  clear out all you fella boys he ordered  clear out and walk along salt water  savvee  me talk spoke up a fat and filthy savage whose hairy chest was caked with the unwashed dirt of years  oh is that you telepasse the white man queried genially  you tell m boys clear out and you stop and talk along me  him good fella boy was the reply  him stop along  well what do you want sheldon asked striving to hide under assumed carelessness the weakness of concession  that fella boy belong along me  the old chief pointed out gogoomy whom sheldon recognized  white mary belong you too much no good telepasse went on  bang m head belong gogoomy  gogoomy all the same chief  bimeby me finish gogoomy big fella chief  white mary bang m head  no good  you pay me plenty tobacco plenty powder plenty calico  you old scoundrel was sheldons comment  an hour before he had been chuckling over joans recital of the episode and here an hour later was telepasse himself come to collect damages  gogoomy sheldon ordered what name you walk about here  you get along quarters plenty quick  me stop was the defiant answer  white mary blong you bang m head old telepasse began again  my word plenty big fella trouble you no pay  you talk along boys sheldon said with increasing irritation  you tell m get to hell along beach  then i talk with you  sheldon felt a slight vibration of the veranda and knew that joan had come out and was standing by his side  but he did not dare glance at her  there were too many rifles down below there and rifles had a way of going off from the hip  again the veranda vibrated with her moving weight and he knew that joan had gone into the house  a minute later she was back beside him  he had never seen her smoke and it struck him as peculiar that she should be smoking now  then he guessed the reason  with a quick glance he noted the hand at her side and in it the familiar paperwrapped dynamite  he noted also the end of fuse split properly into which had been inserted the head of a wax match  telepasse you old reprobate tell m boys clear out along beach  my word i no gammon along you  me no gammon said the chief  me want m pay white mary bang m head blong gogoomy  ill come down there and bang m head blong you sheldon replied leaning toward the railing as if about to leap over  an angry murmur arose and the blacks surged restlessly  the muzzles of many guns were rising from the hips  joan was pressing the lighted end of the cigarette to the fuse  a snider went off with the roar of a bomb gun and sheldon heard a pane of windowglass crash behind him  at the same moment joan flung the dynamite the fuse hissing and spluttering into the thick of the blacks  they scattered back in too great haste to do any more shooting  satan aroused by the one shot was snarling and panting to be let out  joan heard and ran to let him out and thereat the tragedy was averted and the comedy began  rifles and spears were dropped or flung aside in a wild scramble for the protection of the cocoanut palms  satan multiplied himself  never had he been free to tear and rend such a quantity of black flesh before and he bit and snapped and rushed the flying legs till the last pair were above his head  all were treed except telepasse who was too old and fat and he lay prone and without movement where he had fallen while satan with too great a heart to worry an enemy that did not move dashed frantically from tree to tree barking and springing at those who clung on lowest down  i fancy you need a lesson or two in inserting fuses sheldon remarked dryly  joans eyes were scornful  there was no detonator on it she said  besides the detonator is not yet manufactured that will explode that charge  its only a bottle of chlorodyne  she put her fingers into her mouth and sheldon winced as he saw her blow like a boy a sharp imperious whistlethe call she always used for her sailors and that always made him wince  theyre gone up the balesuna shooting fish he explained  but there comes oleson with his boatscrew  hes an old warhorse when he gets started  see him banging the boys  they dont pull fast enough for him  and now whats to be done she asked  youve treed your game but you cant keep it treed  no but i can teach them a lesson  sheldon walked over to the big bell  it is all right he replied to her gesture of protest  my boys are practically all bushmen while these chaps are saltwater men and theres no love lost between them  you watch the fun  he rang a general call and by the time the two hundred labourers trooped into the compound satan was once more penned in the livingroom complaining to high heaven at his abominable treatment  the plantation hands were dancing wardances around the base of every tree and filling the air with abuse and vituperation of their hereditary enemies  the skipper of the flibbertygibbet arrived in the thick of it in the first throes of oncoming fever staggering as he walked and shivering so severely that he could scarcely hold the rifle he carried  his face was ghastly blue his teeth clicked and chattered and the violent sunshine through which he walked could not warm him  ill sssit down and kkkeep a guard on em he chattered  dddash it all i always gget ffever when theres any excitement  wwwhwhat are you going to do  gather up the guns first of all  under sheldons direction the houseboys and gangbosses collected the scattered arms and piled them in a heap on the veranda  the modern rifles stolen from lunga sheldon set aside the sniders he smashed into fragments the pile of spears clubs and tomahawks he presented to joan  a really unique addition to your collection he smiled picked up right on the battlefield  down on the beach he built a bonfire out of the contents of the canoes his blacks smashing breaking and looting everything they laid hands on the canoes themselves splintered and broken filled with sand and coral boulders were towed out to ten fathoms of water and sunk  ten fathoms will be deep enough for them to work in sheldon said as they walked back to the compound  here a saturnalia had broken loose  the warsongs and dances were more unrestrained and from abuse the plantation blacks had turned to pelting their helpless foes with pieces of wood handfuls of pebbles and chunks of coralrock  and the seventyfive lusty cannibals clung stoically to their treeperches enduring the rain of missiles and snarling down promises of vengeance  therell be wars for forty years on malaita on account of this sheldon laughed  but i always fancy old telepasse will never again attempt to rush a plantation  eh you old scoundrel he added turning to the old chief who sat gibbering in impotent rage at the foot of the steps  now head belong you bang m too  come on miss lackland bang m just once  it will be the crowning indignity  ugh hes too dirty  id rather give him a bath  here you adamu adam give this devildevil a wash  soap and water  fill that washtub ornfiri run and fetch m scrubbrush  the tahitians back from their fishing and grinning at the bedlam of the compound entered into the joke  tambo  tambo shrieked the cannibals from the trees appalled at so awful a desecration as they saw their chief tumbled into the tub and the sacred dirt rubbed and soused from his body  joan who had gone into the bungalow tossed down a strip of white calico in which old telepasse was promptly wrapped and he stood forth resplendent and purified withal he still spat and strangled from the soapsuds with which noa noah had gargled his throat  the houseboys were directed to fetch handcuffs and one by one the lunga runaways were haled down out of their trees and made fast  sheldon ironed them in pairs and ran a steel chain through the links of the irons  gogoomy was given a lecture for his mutinous conduct and locked up for the afternoon  then sheldon rewarded the plantation hands with an afternoons holiday and when they had withdrawn from the compound permitted the port adams men to descend from the trees  and all afternoon he and joan loafed in the cool of the veranda and watched them diving down and emptying their sunken canoes of the sand and rocks  it was twilight when they embarked and paddled away with a few broken paddles  a breeze had sprung up and the flibbertygibbet had already sailed for lunga to return the runaways     chapter xiimr morgan and mr raff   sheldon was back in the plantation superintending the building of a bridge when the schooner malakula ran in close and dropped anchor joan watched the taking in of sail and the swinging out of the boat with a sailors interest and herself met the two men who came ashore  while one of the houseboys ran to fetch sheldon she had the visitors served with whisky and soda and sat and talked with them  they seemed awkward and constrained in her presence and she caught first one and then the other looking at her with secret curiosity  she felt that they were weighing her appraising her and for the first time the anomalous position she occupied on berande sank sharply home to her  on the other hand they puzzled her  they were neither traders nor sailors of any type she had known  nor did they talk like gentlemen despite the fact that there was nothing offensive in their bearing and that the veneer of ordinary social nicety was theirs  undoubtedly they were men of affairsbusiness men of a sort but what affairs should they have in the solomons and what business on berande  the elder one morgan was a huge man bronzed and moustached with a deep bass voice and an almost guttural speech and the other raff was slight and effeminate with nervous hands and watery washedout gray eyes who spoke with a faint indefinable accent that was hauntingly reminiscent of the cockney and that was yet not cockney of any brand she had ever encountered  whatever they were they were selfmade men she concluded and she felt the impulse to shudder at thought of falling into their hands in a business way  there they would be merciless  she watched sheldon closely when he arrived and divined that he was not particularly delighted to see them  but see them he must and so pressing was the need that after a little perfunctory general conversation he led the two men into the stuffy office  later in the afternoon she asked lalaperu where they had gone  my word quoth lalaperu plenty walk about plenty look m  look m tree look m ground belong tree look m all fella bridge look m copra house look m grassland look m river look m whaleboatmy word plenty big fella look m too much  what fella man them two fella she queried  big fella marster along white man was the extent of his description  but joan decided that they were men of importance in the solomons and that their examination of the plantation and of its accounts was of sinister significance  at dinner no word was dropped that gave a hint of their errand  the conversation was on general topics but joan could not help noticing the troubled absent expression that occasionally came into sheldons eyes after coffee she left them and at midnight from across the compound she could hear the low murmur of their voices and see glowing the fiery ends of their cigars  up early herself she found they had already departed on another tramp over the plantation  what you think she asked viaburi  sheldon marster he go along finish short time little bit was the answer  what you think she asked ornfiri  sheldon marster big fella walk about along sydney  yes me tink so  he finish along berande  all day the examination of the plantation and the discussion went on and all day the skipper of the malakula sent urgent messages ashore for the two men to hasten  it was not until sunset that they went down to the boat and even then a final talk of nearly an hour took place on the beach  sheldon was combating somethingthat she could plainly see and that his two visitors were not giving in she could also plainly see  what name she asked lightly when sheldon sat down to dinner  he looked at her and smiled but it was a very wan and wistful smile  my word she went on  one big fella talk  sun he go downtalktalk sun he come uptalktalk all the time talktalk  what name that fella talktalk  oh nothing much  he shrugged his shoulders  they were trying to buy berande that was all  she looked at him challengingly  it must have been more than that  it was you who wanted to sell  indeed no miss lackland i assure you that i am far from desiring to sell  dont let us fence about it she urged  let it be straight talk between us  youre in trouble  im not a fool  tell me  besides i may be able to help toto suggest something  in the pause that followed he seemed to debate not so much whether he would tell her as how to begin to tell her  im american you see she persisted and our american heritage is a large parcel of business sense  i dont like it myself but i know ive got itat least more than you have  let us talk it over and find a way out  how much do you owe  a thousand pounds and a few trifles oversmall bills you know  then too thirty of the boys finish their time next week and their balances will average ten pounds each  but what is the need of bothering your head with it  really you know  what is berande worthright now  whatever morgan and raff are willing to pay for it  a glance at her hurt expression decided him  hughie and i have sunk eight thousand pounds in it and our time  it is a good property and worth more than that  but it has three years to run before its returns begin to come in that is why hughie and i engaged in trading and recruiting  the jessie and our stations came very near to paying the running expenses of berande  and morgan and raff offered you what  a thousand pounds clear after paying all bills  the thieves she cried  no theyre good business men that is all  as they told me a thing is worth no more than one is willing to pay or to receive  and how much do you need to carry on berande for three years joan hurried on  two hundred boys at six pounds a year means thirtysix hundred poundsthats the main item  my how cheap labour does mount up  thirtysix hundred pounds eighteen thousand dollars just for a lot of cannibals  yet the place is good security  you could go down to sydney and raise the money  he shook his head  you cant get them to look at plantations down there  theyve been taken in too often  but i do hate to give the place upmore for hughies sake i swear than my own  he was bound up in it  you see he was a persistent chap and hated to acknowledge defeat  itit makes me uncomfortable to think of it myself  we were running slowly behind but with the jessie we hoped to muddle through in some fashion  you were muddlers the pair of you without doubt  but you neednt sell to morgan and raff  i shall go down to sydney on the next steamer and ill come back in a secondhand schooner  i should be able to buy one for five or six thousand dollars  he held up his hand in protest but she waved it aside  i may manage to freight a cargo back as well  at any rate the schooner will take over the jessies business  you can make your arrangements accordingly and have plenty of work for her when i get back  im going to become a partner in berande to the extent of my bag of sovereignsive got over fifteen hundred of them you know  well draw up an agreement right nowthat is with your permission and i know you wont refuse it  he looked at her with goodnatured amusement  you know i sailed here all the way from tahiti in order to become a planter she insisted  you know what my plans were  now ive changed them thats all  id rather be a part owner of berande and get my returns in three years than break ground on parisulay and wait seven years  and thiserthis schooner      sheldon changed his mind and stopped  yes go on  you wont be angry he queried  no no this is business  go on  youeryou would run her yourselfbe the captain in shortand go recruiting on malaita  certainly  we would save the cost of a skipper  under an agreement you would be credited with a managers salary and i with a captains  its quite simple  besides if you wont let me be your partner i shall buy parisulay get a much smaller vessel and run her myself  so what is the difference  the differencewhy all the difference in the world  in the case of parisulay you would be on an independent venture  you could turn cannibal for all i could interfere in the matter  but on berande you would be my partner and then i would be responsible  and of course i couldnt permit you as my partner to be skipper of a recruiter  i tell you the thing is what i would not permit any sister or wife of mine  but im not going to be your wife thank goodnessonly your partner  besides its all ridiculous he held on steadily  think of the situation  a man and a woman both young partners on an isolated plantation  why the only practical way out would be that id have to marry you  mine was a business proposition not a marriage proposal she interrupted coldly angry  i wonder if somewhere in this world there is one man who could accept me for a comrade  but you are a woman just the same he began and there are certain conventions certain decencies  she sprang up and stamped her foot  do you know what id like to say she demanded  yes he smiled youd like to say damn petticoats  she nodded her head ruefully  thats what i wanted to say but it sounds different on your lips  it sounds as though you meant it yourself and that you meant it because of me  well i am going to bed  but do please think over my proposition and let me know in the morning  theres no use in my discussing it now  you make me so angry  you are cowardly you know and very egotistic  you are afraid of what other fools will say  no matter how honest your motives if others criticized your actions your feelings would be hurt and you think more about your own wretched feelings than you do about mine  and then being a cowardall men are at heart cowardsyou disguise your cowardice by calling it chivalry  i thank heaven that i was not born a man  goodnight  do think it over  and dont be foolish  what berande needs is good american hustle  you dont know what that is  you are a muddler  besides you are enervated  im fresh to the climate  let me be your partner and youll see me rattle the dry bones of the solomons  confess ive rattled yours already  i should say so he answered  really you know you have  i never received such a dressingdown in my life  if any one had ever told me that id be a party even to the present situation    yes i confess you have rattled my dry bones pretty considerably  but that is nothing to the rattling they are going to get she assured him as he rose and took her hand  goodnight  and do do give me a rational decision in the morning     chapter xiiithe logic of youth   i wish i knew whether you are merely headstrong or whether you really intend to be a solomon planter sheldon said in the morning at breakfast  i wish you were more adaptable joan retorted  you have more preconceived notions than any man i ever met  why in the name of common sense in the name of    fair play cant you get it into your head that i am different from the women you have known and treat me accordingly  you surely ought to know i am different  i sailed my own schooner hereskipper if you please  i came here to make my living you know that ive told you often enough  it was dads plan and im carrying it out just as you are trying to carry out your hughies plan dad started to sail and sail until he could find the proper islands for planting  he died and i sailed and sailed until i arrived here wellshe shrugged her shouldersthe schooner is at the bottom of the sea  i cant sail any farther therefore i remain here  and a planter i shall certainly be  you see he began  i havent got to the point she interrupted  looking back on my conduct from the moment i first set foot on your beach i can see no false pretence that i have made about myself or my intentions  i was my natural self to you from the first  i told you my plans and yet you sit there and calmly tell me that you dont know whether i really intend to become a planter or whether it is all obstinacy and pretence  now let me assure you for the last time that i really and truly shall become a planter thanks to you or in spite of you  do you want me for a partner  but do you realize that i would be looked upon as the most foolish jackanapes in the south seas if i took a young girl like you in with me here on berande he asked  no decidedly not  but there you are again worrying about what idiots and the generally evilminded will think of you  i should have thought you had learned selfreliance on berande instead of needing to lean upon the moral support of every whiskyguzzling worthless south sea vagabond  he smiled and said  yes that is the worst of it  you are unanswerable  yours is the logic of youth and no man can answer that  the facts of life can but they have no place in the logic of youth  youth must try to live according to its logic  that is the only way to learn better  there is no harm in trying she interjected  but there is  that is the very point  the facts always smash youths logic and they usually smash youths heart too  its like platonic friendships and    and all such things they are all right in theory but they wont work in practice  i used to believe in such things once that is why i am here in the solomons at present  joan was impatient  he saw that she could not understand  life was too clearly simple to her  it was only the youth who was arguing with him the youth with youths pureminded and invincible reasoning  hers was only the boys soul in a womans body  he looked at her flushed eager face at the great ropes of hair coiled on the small head at the rounded lines of the figure showing plainly through the homemade gown and at the eyesboys eyes under cool level browsand he wondered why a being that was so much beautiful woman should be no woman at all  why in the deuce was she not carrotyhaired or crosseyed or harelipped  suppose we do become partners on berande he said at the same time experiencing a feeling of fright at the prospect that was tangled with a contradictory feeling of charm either ill fall in love with you or you with me  propinquity is dangerous you know  in fact it is propinquity that usually gives the facer to the logic of youth  if you think i came to the solomons to get married she began wrathfully  well there are better men in hawaii thats all  really you know the way you harp on that one string would lead an unprejudiced listener to conclude that you are prurientminded  she stopped appalled  his face had gone red and white with such abruptness as to startle her  he was patently very angry  she sipped the last of her coffee and arose saying  ill wait until you are in a better temper before taking up the discussion again  that is whats the matter with you  you get angry too easily  will you come swimming  the tide is just right  if she were a man id bundle her off the plantation root and crop whale boat tahitian sailors sovereigns and all he muttered to himself after she had left the room  but that was the trouble  she was not a man and where would she go and what would happen to her  he got to his feet lighted a cigarette and her stetson hat hanging on the wall over her revolverbelt caught his eye  that was the devil of it too  he did not want her to go  after all she had not grown up yet  that was why her logic hurt  it was only the logic of youth but it could hurt damnably at times  at any rate he would resolve upon one thing never again would he lose his temper with her  she was a child he must remember that  he sighed heavily  but why in reasonableness had such a child been incorporated in such a womans form  and as he continued to stare at her hat and think the hurt he had received passed away and he found himself cudgelling his brains for some way out of the muddlefor some method by which she could remain on berande  a chaperone  why not  he could send to sydney on the first steamer for one  he could  her trilling laughter smote upon his reverie and he stepped to the screendoor through which he could see her running down the path to the beach  at her heels ran two of her sailors papehara and mahameme in scarlet lavalavas with naked sheathknives gleaming in their belts  it was another sample of her wilfulness  despite entreaties and commands and warnings of the danger from sharks she persisted in swimming at any and all times and by special preference it seemed to him immediately after eating  he watched her take the water diving cleanly like a boy from the end of the little pier and he watched her strike out with single overhand stroke her henchmen swimming a dozen feet on either side  he did not have much faith in their ability to beat off a hungry maneater though he did believe implicitly that their lives would go bravely before hers in case of an attack  straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller  there was a slight restless heave to the sea and soon the three heads were disappearing behind it with greater frequency  he strained his eyes to keep them in sight and finally fetched the telescope on to the veranda a squall was making over from the direction of florida but then she and her men laughed at squalls and the white choppy sea at such times  she certainly could swim he had long since concluded  that came of her training in hawaii  but sharks were sharks and he had known of more than one good swimmer drowned in a tiderip  the squall blackened the sky beat the ocean white where he had last seen the three heads and then blotted out sea and sky and everything with its deluge of rain  it passed on and berande emerged in the bright sunshine as the three swimmers emerged from the sea  sheldon slipped inside with the telescope and through the screendoor watched her run up the path shaking down her hair as she ran to the freshwater shower under the house  on the veranda that afternoon he broached the proposition of a chaperone as delicately as he could explaining the necessity at berande for such a body a housekeeper to run the boys and the storeroom and perform divers other useful functions  when he had finished he waited anxiously for what joan would say  then you dont like the way ive been managing the house was her first objection  and next brushing his attempted explanations aside one of two things would happen  either i should cancel our partnership agreement and go away leaving you to get another chaperone to chaperone your chaperone or else id take the old hen out in the whaleboat and drown her  do you imagine for one moment that i sailed my schooner down here to this raw edge of the earth in order to put myself under a chaperone  but really    er    you know a chaperone is a necessary evil he objected  weve got along very nicely so far without one  did i have one on the miele  and yet i was the only woman on board  there are only three things i am afraid ofbumblebees scarlet fever and chaperones  ugh the clucking evilminded monsters finding wrong in everything seeing sin in the most innocent actions and suggesting sinyes causing sinby their diseased imaginings  phew sheldon leaned back from the table in mock fear  you neednt worry about your bread and butter he ventured  if you fail at planting you would be sure to succeed as a writernovels with a purpose you know  i didnt think there were persons in the solomons who needed such books she retaliated  but you are certainly oneyou and your custodians of virtue  he winced but joan rattled on with the platitudinous originality of youth  as if anything good were worth while when it has to be guarded and put in legirons and handcuffs in order to keep it good  your desire for a chaperone as much as implies that i am that sort of creature  i prefer to be good because it is good to be good rather than because i cant be bad because some arguseyed old frump wont let me have a chance to be bad  but itit is not that he put in  it is what others will think  let them think the nastyminded wretches  it is because men like you are afraid of the nastyminded that you allow their opinions to rule you  i am afraid you are a female shelley he replied and as such you really drive me to become your partner in order to protect you  if you take me as a partner in order to protect me    i    i shant be your partner thats all  youll drive me into buying pari sulay yet  all the more reason he attempted  do you know what ill do she demanded  ill find some man in the solomons who wont want to protect me  sheldon could not conceal the shock her words gave him  you dont mean that you know he pleaded  i do i really do  i am sick and tired of this protection dodge  dont forget for a moment that i am perfectly able to take care of myself besides i have eight of the best protectors in the worldmy sailors  you should have lived a thousand years ago he laughed or a thousand years hence  you are very primitive and equally supermodern  the twentieth century is no place for you  but the solomon islands are  you were living like a savage when i came along and found youeating nothing but tinned meat and scones that would have ruined the digestion of a camel  anyway ive remedied that and since we are to be partners it will stay remedied  you wont die of malnutrition be sure of that  if we enter into partnership he announced it must be thoroughly understood that you are not allowed to run the schooner  you can go down to sydney and buy her but a skipper we must have  at so much additional expense and most likely a whiskydrinking irresponsible and incapable man to boot  besides id have the business more at heart than any man we could hire  as for capability i tell you i can sail all around the average broken captain or promoted able seaman you find in the south seas  and you know i am a navigator  but being my partner he said coolly makes you none the less a lady  thank you for telling me that my contemplated conduct is unladylike  she arose tears of anger and mortification in her eyes and went over to the phonograph  i wonder if all men are as ridiculous as you she said  he shrugged his shoulders and smiled  discussion was uselesshe had learned that and he was resolved to keep his temper  and before the day was out she capitulated  she was to go to sydney on the first steamer purchase the schooner and sail back with an island skipper on board  and then she inveigled sheldon into agreeing that she could take occasional cruises in the islands though he was adamant when it came to a recruiting trip on malaita  that was the one thing barred  and after it was all over and a terse and businesslike agreement by her urging drawn up and signed sheldon paced up and down for a full hour meditating upon how many different kinds of a fool he had made of himself  it was an impossible situation and yet no more impossible than the previous one and no more impossible than the one that would have obtained had she gone off on her own and bought parisulay  he had never seen a more independent woman who stood more in need of a protector than this boyminded girl who had landed on his beach with eight picturesque savages a longbarrelled revolver a bag of gold and a gaudy merchandise of imagined romance and adventure  he had never read of anything to compare with it  the fictionists as usual were exceeded by fact  the whole thing was too preposterous to be true  he gnawed his moustache and smoked cigarette after cigarette satan back from a prowl around the compound ran up to him and touched his hand with a cold damp nose  sheldon caressed the animals ears then threw himself into a chair and laughed heartily  what would the commissioner of the solomons think  what would his people at home think and in the one breath he was glad that the partnership had been effected and sorry that joan lackland had ever come to the solomons  then he went inside and looked at himself in a handmirror  he studied the reflection long and thoughtfully and wonderingly     chapter xivthe martha   they were deep in a game of billiards the next morning after the eleven oclock breakfast when viaburi entered and announced  big fella schooner close up  even as he spoke they heard the rumble of chain through hawsepipe and from the veranda saw a big blackpainted schooner swinging to her just caught anchor  its a yankee joan cried  see that bow  look at that elliptical stern  ah i thought so as the stars and stripes fluttered to the masthead  noa noah at sheldons direction ran the union jack up the flagstaff  now what is an american vessel doing down here joan asked  its not a yacht though ill wager she can sail  look  her name  what is it  martha san francisco sheldon read looking through the telescope its the first yankee i ever heard of in the solomons  they are coming ashore whoever they are  and by jove look at those men at the oars its an allwhite crew  now what reason brings them here  theyre not proper sailors joan commented  id be ashamed of a crew of blackboys that pulled in such fashion  look at that fellow in the bowthe one just jumping out hed be more at home on a cowpony  the boatscrew scattered up and down the beach ranging about with eager curiosity while the two men who had sat in the sternsheets opened the gate and came up the path to the bungalow  one of them a tall and slender man was clad in white ducks that fitted him like a semimilitary uniform  the other man in nondescript garments that were both of the sea and shore and that must have been uncomfortably hot slouched and shambled like an overgrown ape  to complete the illusion his face seemed to sprout in all directions with a dense bushy mass of red whiskers while his eyes were small and sharp and restless  sheldon who had gone to the head of the steps introduced them to joan the bewhiskered individual who looked like a scotsman had the teutonic name of von blix and spoke with a strong american accent  the tall man in the wellfitting ducks who gave the english name of tudorjohn tudortalked purelyenunciated english such as any cultured american would talk save for the fact that it was most delicately and subtly touched by a faint german accent  joan decided that she had been helped to identify the accent by the short germanlooking moustache that did not conceal the mouth and its full red lips which would have formed a cupids bow but for some harshness or severity of spirit that had moulded them masculinely  von blix was rough and boorish but tudor was gracefully easy in everything he did or looked or said  his blue eyes sparkled and flashed his cleancut mobile features were an index to his slightest shades of feeling and expression  he bubbled with enthusiasms and his faintest smile or lightest laugh seemed spontaneous and genuine  but it was only occasionally at first that he spoke for von blix told their story and stated their errand  they were on a goldhunting expedition  he was the leader and tudor was his lieutenant  all handsand there were twentyeightwere shareholders in varying proportions in the adventure  several were sailors but the large majority were miners culled from all the camps from mexico to the arctic ocean  it was the old and everuntiring pursuit of gold and they had come to the solomons to get it  part of them under the leadership of tudor were to go up the balesuna and penetrate the mountainous heart of guadalcanar while the martha under von blix sailed away for malaita to put through similar exploration  and so said von blix for mr tudors expedition we must have some blackboys  can we get them from you  of course we will pay tudor broke in  you have only to charge what you consider them worth  you pay them six pounds a year dont you  in the first place we cant spare them sheldon answered  we are short of them on the plantation as it is  we tudor asked quickly  then you are a firm or a partnership  i understood at guvutu that you were alone that you had lost your partner  sheldon inclined his head toward joan and as he spoke she felt that he had become a trifle stiff  miss lackland has become interested in the plantation since then  but to return to the boys  we cant spare them and besides they would be of little use  you couldnt get them to accompany you beyond binu which is a short days work with the boats from here  they are malaitamen and they are afraid of being eaten  they would desert you at the first opportunity  you could get the binu men to accompany you another days journey through the grasslands but at the first roll of the foothills look for them to turn back  they likewise are disinclined to being eaten  is it as bad as that asked von blix  the interior of guadalcanar has never been explored sheldon explained the bushmen are as wild men as are to be found anywhere in the world to day  i have never seen one  i have never seen a man who has seen one they never come down to the coast though their scouting parties occasionally eat a coast native who has wandered too far inland  nobody knows anything about them  they dont even use tobaccohave never learned its use  the austrian expeditionscientists you knowgot part way in before it was cut to pieces  the monument is up the beach there several miles  only one man got back to the coast to tell the tale  and now you have all i or any other man knows of the inside of guadalcanar  but goldhave you heard of gold tudor asked impatiently  do you know anything about gold  sheldon smiled while the two visitors hung eagerly upon his words  you can go two miles up the balesuna and wash colours from the gravel ive done it often  there is gold undoubtedly back in the mountains  tudor and von blix looked triumphantly at each other  old wheatsheafs yarn was true then tudor said and von blix nodded and if malaita turns out as well  tudor broke off and looked at joan  it was the tale of this old beachcomber that brought us here he explained  von blix befriended him and was told the secret  he turned and addressed sheldon  i think we shall prove that white men have been through the heart of guadalcanar long before the time of the austrian expedition  sheldon shrugged his shoulders  we have never heard of it down here he said simply  then he addressed von blix  as to the boys you couldnt use them farther than binu and ill lend you as many as you want as far as that  how many of your party are going and how soon will you start  ten said tudor nine men and myself  and you should be able to start day after tomorrow von blix said to him  the boats should practically be knocked together this afternoon tomorrow should see the outfit portioned and packed  as for the martha mr sheldon well rush the stuff ashore this afternoon and sail by sundown  as the two men returned down the path to their boat sheldon regarded joan quizzically  theres romance for you he said and adventuregoldhunting among the cannibals  a title for a book she cried  or better yet goldhunting among the headhunters  my wouldnt it sell  and now arent you sorry you became a cocoanut planter he teased think of investing in such an adventure  if i did she retorted von blix wouldnt be finicky about my joining in the cruise to malaita  i dont doubt but what he would jump at it  what do you think of them she asked  oh old von blix is all right a solid sort of chap in his fashion but tudor is flyawaytoo much on the surface you know  if it came to being wrecked on a desert island id prefer von blix  i dont quite understand joan objected  what have you against tudor  you remember brownings last duchess  she nodded  well tudor reminds me of her  but she was delightful  so she was  but she was a woman  one expects something different from a manmore control you know more restraint more deliberation  a man must be more solid more solid and steadygoing and less effervescent  a man of tudors type gets on my nerves  one demands more repose from a man  joan felt that she did not quite agree with his judgment and somehow sheldon caught her feeling and was disturbed  he remembered noting how her eyes had brightened as she talked with the newcomerconfound it all was he getting jealous he asked himself  why shouldnt her eyes brighten  what concern was it of his  a second boat had been lowered and the outfit of the shore party was landed rapidly  a dozen of the crew put the knockeddown boats together on the beach  there were five of these craftlean and narrow with flaring sides and remarkably long  each was equipped with three paddles and several ironshod poles  you chaps certainly seem to know riverwork sheldon told one of the carpenters  the man spat a mouthful of tobaccojuice into the white sand and answered  we use em in alaska  theyre modelled after the yukon polingboats and you can bet your life theyre crackerjacks  this creekll be a snap alongside some of them northern streams  five hundred pounds in one of them boats an two men can snake it along in a way thatd surprise you  at sunset the martha broke out her anchor and got under way dipping her flag and saluting with a bomb gun  the union jack ran up and down the staff and sheldon replied with his brass signalcannon  the miners pitched their tents in the compound and cooked on the beach while tudor dined with joan and sheldon  their guest seemed to have been everywhere and seen everything and met everybody and encouraged by joan his talk was largely upon his own adventures  he was an adventurer of adventurers and by his own account had been born into adventure  descended from old new england stock his father a consulgeneral he had been born in germany in which country he had received his early education and his accent  then still a boy he had rejoined his father in turkey and accompanied him later to persia his father having been appointed minister to that country  tudor had always been a wanderer and with facile wit and quick vivid description he leaped from episode and place to episode and place relating his experiences seemingly not because they were his but for the sake of their bizarreness and uniqueness for the unusual incident or the laughable situation  he had gone through south american revolutions been a rough rider in cuba a scout in south africa a war correspondent in the russojapanese war  he had mushed dogs in the klondike washed gold from the sands of nome and edited a newspaper in san francisco  the president of the united states was his friend  he was equally at home in the clubs of london and the continent the grand hotel at yokohama and the selectors shanties in the nevernever country  he had shot big game in siam pearled in the paumotus visited tolstoy seen the passion play and crossed the andes on muleback while he was a living directory of the fever holes of west africa  sheldon leaned back in his chair on the veranda sipping his coffee and listening  in spite of himself he felt touched by the charm of the man who had led so varied a life  and yet sheldon was not comfortable  it seemed to him that the man addressed himself particularly to joan  his words and smiles were directed impartially toward both of them yet sheldon was certain had the two men of them been alone that the conversation would have been along different lines  tudor had seen the effect on joan and deliberately continued the flow of reminiscence netting her in the glamour of romance  sheldon watched her rapt attention listened to her spontaneous laughter quick questions and passing judgments and felt grow within him the dawning consciousness that he loved her  so he was very quiet and almost sad though at times he was aware of a distinct irritation against his guest and he even speculated as to what percentage of tudors tale was true and how any of it could be proved or disproved  in this connection as if the scene had been prepared by a clever playwright utami came upon the veranda to report to joan the capture of a crocodile in the trap they had made for her  tudors face illuminated by the match with which he was lighting his cigarette caught utamis eye and utami forgot to report to his mistress  hello tudor he said with a familiarity that startled sheldon  the polynesians hand went out and tudor shaking it was staring into his face  who is it he asked  i cant see you  utami  and who the dickens is utami  where did i ever meet you my man  you no forget the huahine utami chided  last time huahine sail  tudor gripped the tahitians hand a second time and shook it with genuine heartiness  there was only one kanaka who came out of the huahine that last voyage and that kanaka was joe  the deuce take it man im glad to see you though i never heard your new name before  yes everybody speak me joe along the huahine  utami my name all the time just the same  but what are you doing here tudor asked releasing the sailors hand and leaning eagerly forward  me sail along missie lackalanna her schooner miele  we go tahiti raiatea tahaa borabora manua tutuila apia savaii and fiji islandsplenty fiji islands  me stop along missie lackalanna in solomons  very soon she catch other schooner  he and i were the two survivors of the wreck of the huahine tudor explained to the others  fiftyseven all told on board when we sailed from huapa and joe and i were the only two that ever set foot on land again  hurricane you know in the paumotus  that was when i was after pearls  and you never told me utami that youd been wrecked in a hurricane joan said reproachfully  the big tahitian shifted his weight and flashed his teeth in a conciliating smile  me no tink nothing t all he said  he halfturned as if to depart by his manner indicating that he considered it time to go while yet he desired to remain  all right utami tudor said  ill see you in the morning and have a yarn  he saved my life the beggar tudor explained as the tahitian strode away and with heavy softness of foot went down the steps  swim  i never met a better swimmer  and thereat solicited by joan tudor narrated the wreck of the huahine while sheldon smoked and pondered and decided that whatever the mans shortcomings were he was at least not a liar     chapter xva discourse on manners   the days passed and tudor seemed loath to leave the hospitality of berande  everything was ready for the start but he lingered on spending much time in joans company and thereby increasing the dislike sheldon had taken to him  he went swimming with her in point of rashness exceeding her and dynamited fish with her diving among the hungry groundsharks and contesting with them for possession of the stunned prey until he earned the approval of the whole tahitian crew arahu challenged him to tear a fish from a sharks jaws leaving half to the shark and bringing the other half himself to the surface and tudor performed the feat a flip from the sandpaper hide of the astonished shark scraping several inches of skin from his shoulder  and joan was delighted while sheldon looking on realized that here was the hero of her adventuredreams coming true  she did not care for love but he felt that if ever she did love it would be that sort of a mana man who exhibited was his way of putting it  he felt himself handicapped in the presence of tudor who had the gift of making a show of all his qualities  sheldon knew himself for a brave man wherefore he made no advertisement of the fact  he knew that just as readily as the other would he dive among groundsharks to save a life but in that fact he could find no sanction for the foolhardy act of diving among sharks for the half of a fish  the difference between them was that he kept the curtain of his shop window down  life pulsed steadily and deep in him and it was not his nature needlessly to agitate the surface so that the world could see the splash he was making  and the effect of the others amazing exhibitions was to make him retreat more deeply within himself and wrap himself more thickly than ever in the nerveless stoical calm of his race  you are so stupid the last few days joan complained to him  one would think you were sick or bilious or something  you dont seem to have an idea in your head above black labour and cocoanuts  what is the matter  sheldon smiled and beat a further retreat within himself listening the while to joan and tudor propounding the theory of the strong arm by which the white man ordered life among the lesser breeds  as he listened sheldon realized as by revelation that that was precisely what he was doing  while they philosophized about it he was living it placing the strong hand of his race firmly on the shoulders of the lesser breeds that laboured on berande or menaced it from afar  but why talk about it he asked himself  it was sufficient to do it and be done with it  he said as much dryly and quietly and found himself involved in a discussion with joan and tudor siding against him in which a more astounding charge than ever he had dreamed of was made against the very english control and reserve of which he was secretly proud  the yankees talk a lot about what they do and have done tudor said and are looked down upon by the english as braggarts  but the yankee is only a child  he does not know effectually how to brag  he talks about it you see  but the englishman goes him one better by not talking about it  the englishmans proverbial lack of bragging is a subtler form of brag after all  it is really clever as you will agree  i never thought of it before joan cried  of course  an englishman performs some terrifically heroic exploit and is very modest and reservedrefuses to talk about it at alland the effect is that by his silence he as much as says i do things like this every day  it is as easy as rolling off a log  you ought to see the really heroic things i could do if they ever came my way  but this little thing this little episodereally dont you know i fail to see anything in it remarkable or unusual  as for me if i went up in a powder explosion or saved a hundred lives id want all my friends to hear about it and their friends as well  id be prouder than lucifer over the affair  confess mr sheldon dont you feel proud down inside when youve done something daring or courageous  sheldon nodded  then she pressed home the point isnt disguising that pride under a mask of careless indifference equivalent to telling a lie  yes it is he admitted  but we tell similar lies every day  it is a matter of training and the english are better trained that is all  your countrymen will be trained as well in time  as mr tudor said the yankees are young  thank goodness we havent begun to tell such lies yet was joans ejaculation  oh but you have sheldon said quickly  you were telling me a lie of that order only the other day  you remember when you were going up the lanternhalyards hand over hand  your face was the personification of duplicity  it was no such thing  pardon me a moment he went on  your face was as calm and peaceful as though you were reclining in a steamerchair  to look at your face one would have inferred that carrying the weight of your body up a rope hand over hand was a very commonplace accomplishmentas easy as rolling off a log  and you neednt tell me miss lackland that you didnt make faces the first time you tried to climb a rope  but like any circus athlete you trained yourself out of the facemaking period  you trained your face to hide your feelings to hide the exhausting effort your muscles were making  it was to quote mr tudor a subtler exhibition of physical prowess  and that is all our english reserve isa mere matter of training  certainly we are proud inside of the things we do and have done proud as luciferyes and prouder  but we have grown up and no longer talk about such things  i surrender joan cried  you are not so stupid after all  yes you have us there tudor admitted  but you wouldnt have had us if you hadnt broken your training rules  how do you mean  by talking about it  joan clapped her hands in approval  tudor lighted a fresh cigarette while sheldon sat on imperturbably silent  he got you there joan challenged  why dont you crush him  really i cant think of anything to say sheldon said  i know my position is sound and that is satisfactory enough  you might retort she suggested that when an adult is with kindergarten children he must descend to kindergarten idioms in order to make himself intelligible  that was why you broke training rules  it was the only way to make us children understand  youve deserted in the heat of the battle miss lackland and gone over to the enemy tudor said plaintively  but she was not listening  instead she was looking intently across the compound and out to sea  they followed her gaze and saw a green light and the loom of a vessels sails  i wonder if its the martha come back tudor hazarded  no the sidelight is too low joan answered  besides theyve got the sweeps out  dont you hear them  they wouldnt be sweeping a big vessel like the martha  besides the martha has a gasoline enginetwentyfive horsepower tudor added  just the sort of a craft for us joan said wistfully to sheldon  i really must see if i cant get a schooner with an engine  i might get a secondhand engine put in  that would mean the additional expense of an engineers wages he objected  but it would pay for itself by quicker passages she argued and it would be as good as insurance  i know  ive knocked about amongst reefs myself  besides if you werent so mediaeval i could be skipper and save more than the engineers wages  he did not reply to her thrust and she glanced at him  he was looking out over the water and in the lantern light she noted the lines of his facestrong stern dogged the mouth almost chaste but firmer and thinnerlipped than tudors  for the first time she realized the quality of his strength the calm and quiet of it its simple integrity and reposeful determination  she glanced quickly at tudor on the other side of her  it was a handsomer face one that was more immediately pleasing but she did not like the mouth  it was made for kissing and she abhorred kisses  this was not a deliberately achieved concept it came to her in the form of a faint and vaguely intangible repulsion  for the moment she knew a fleeting doubt of the man  perhaps sheldon was right in his judgment of the other  she did not know and it concerned her little for boats and the sea and the things and happenings of the sea were of far more vital interest to her than men and the next moment she was staring through the warm tropic darkness at the loom of the sails and the steady green of the moving sidelight and listening eagerly to the click of the sweeps in the rowlocks  in her minds eye she could see the straining naked forms of black men bending rhythmically to the work and somewhere on that strange deck she knew was the inevitable masterman conning the vessel in to its anchorage peering at the dim treeline of the shore judging the deceitful nightdistances feeling on his cheek the first fans of the land breeze that was even then beginning to blow weighing thinking measuring gauging the score or more of evershifting forces through which by which and in spite of which he directed the steady equilibrium of his course  she knew it because she loved it and she was alive to it as only a sailor could be  twice she heard the splash of the lead and listened intently for the cry that followed  once a mans voice spoke low imperative issuing an order and she thrilled with the delight of it  it was only a direction to the man at the wheel to port his helm  she watched the slight altering of the course and knew that it was for the purpose of enabling the flathauled sails to catch those first fans of the land breeze and she waited for the same low voice to utter the one word steady  and again she thrilled when it did utter it  once more the lead splashed and eleven fadom was the resulting cry  let go the low voice came to her through the darkness followed by the surging rumble of the anchor chain  the clicking of the sheaves in the blocks as the sails ran down headsails first was music to her and she detected on the instant the jamming of a jibdownhaul and almost saw the impatient jerk with which the sailor must have cleared it  nor did she take interest in the two men beside her till both lights red and green came into view as the anchor checked the onward way  sheldon was wondering as to the identity of the craft while tudor persisted in believing it might be the martha  its the minerva joan said decidedly  how do you know sheldon asked sceptical of her certitude  its a ketch to begin with  and besides i could tell anywhere the rattle of her main peakblockstheyre too large for the halyard  a dark figure crossed the compound diagonally from the beach gate where whoever it was had been watching the vessel  is that you utami joan called  no missie me matapuu was the answer  what vessel is it  me tink minerva  joan looked triumphantly at sheldon who bowed  if matapuu says so it must be so he murmured  but when joan lackland says so you doubt she cried just as you doubt her ability as a skipper  but never mind youll be sorry some day for all your unkindness  theres the boat lowering now and in five minutes well be shaking hands with christian young  lalaperu brought out the glasses and cigarettes and the eternal whisky and soda and before the five minutes were past the gate clicked and christian young tawny and golden gentle of voice and look and hand came up the bungalow steps and joined them     chapter xvithe girl who had not grown up   news as usual christian young broughtnews of the drinking at guvutu where the men boasted that they drank between drinks news of the new rifles adrift on ysabel of the latest murders on malaita of tom butlers sickness on santa ana and last and most important news that the matambo had gone on a reef in the shortlands and would be laid off one run for repairs  that means five weeks more before you can sail for sydney sheldon said to joan  and that we are losing precious time she added ruefully  if you want to go to sydney the upolu sails from tulagi tomorrow afternoon young said  but i thought she was running recruits for the germans in samoa she objected  at any rate i could catch her to samoa and change at apia to one of the weir line freighters  its a long way around but still it would save time  this time the upolu is going straight to sydney young explained shes going to drydock you see and you can catch her as late as five tomorrow afternoonat least so her first officer told me  but ive got to go to guvutu first  joan looked at the men with a whimsical expression  ive some shopping to do  i cant wear these berande curtains into sydney  i must buy cloth at guvutu and make myself a dress during the voyage down  ill start immediatelyin an hour lalaperu you bring m one fella adamu adam along me  tell m that fella ornfiri make m kaikai take along whaleboat  she rose to her feet looking at sheldon  and you please have the boys carry down the whale boatmy boat you know  ill be off in an hour  both sheldon and tudor looked at their watches  its an allnight row sheldon said  you might wait till morning  and miss my shopping  no thank you  besides the upolu is not a regular passenger steamer and she is just as liable to sail ahead of time as on time  and from what i hear about those guvutu sybarites the best time to shop will be in the morning  and now youll have to excuse me for ive got to pack  ill go over with you sheldon announced  let me run you over in the minerva said young  she shook her head laughingly  im going in the whaleboat  one would think from all your solicitude that id never been away from home before  you mr sheldon as my partner i cannot permit to desert berande and your work out of a mistaken notion of courtesy  if you wont permit me to be skipper i wont permit your galivanting over the sea as protector of young women who dont need protection  and as for you captain young you know very well that you just left guvutu this morning that you are bound for marau and that you said yourself that in two hours you are getting under way again  but may i not see you safely across tudor asked a pleading note in his voice that rasped on sheldons nerves  no no and again no she cried  youve all got your work to do and so have i  i came to the solomons to work not to be escorted about like a doll  for that matter heres my escort and there are seven more like him  adamu adam stood beside her towering above her as he towered above the three white men  the clinging cotton undershirt he wore could not hide the bulge of his tremendous muscles  look at his fist said tudor  id hate to receive a punch from it  i dont blame you  joan laughed reminiscently  i saw him hit the captain of a swedish bark on the beach at levuka in the fijis  it was the captains fault  i saw it all myself and it was splendid  adamu only hit him once and he broke the mans arm  you remember adamu  the big tahitian smiled and nodded his black eyes soft and deerlike seeming to give the lie to so belligerent a nature  we start in an hour in the whaleboat for guvutu big brother joan said to him  tell your brothers all of them so that they can get ready  we catch the upolu for sydney  you will all come along and sail back to the solomons in the new schooner  take your extra shirts and dungarees along  plenty cold weather down there  now run along and tell them to hurry  leave the guns behind  turn them over to mr sheldon  we wont need them  if you are really bent upon going sheldon began  thats settled long ago she answered shortly  im going to pack now but ill tell you what you can do for meissue some tobacco and other stuff they want to my men  an hour later the three men had shaken hands with joan down on the beach she gave the signal and the boat shoved off six men at the oars the seventh man forard and adamu adam at the steeringsweep  joan was standing up in the sternsheets reiterating her goodbyesa slim figure of a woman in the tightfitting jacket she had worn ashore from the wreck the longbarrelled colts revolver hanging from the loose belt around her waist her clearcut face like a boys under the stetson hat that failed to conceal the heavy masses of hair beneath  youd better get into shelter she called to them  theres a big squall coming  and i hope youve got plenty of chain out captain young goodbye  goodbye everybody  her last words came out of the darkness which wrapped itself solidly about the boat  yet they continued to stare into the blackness in the direction in which the boat had disappeared listening to the steady click of the oars in the rowlocks until it faded away and ceased  she is only a girl christian young said with slow solemnity  the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment  she is only a girl he repeated with greater solemnity  a dashed pretty one and a good traveller tudor laughed  she certainly has spunk eh sheldon  yes she is brave was the reluctant answer for sheldon did not feel disposed to talk about her  thats the american of it tudor went on  push and go and energy and independence  what do you think skipper  i think she is young very young only a girl replied the captain of the minerva continuing to stare into the blackness that hid the sea  the blackness seemed suddenly to increase in density and they stumbled up the beach feeling their way to the gate  watch out for nuts sheldon warned as the first blast of the squall shrieked through the palms  they joined hands and staggered up the path with the ripe cocoanuts thudding in a monstrous rain all around them they gained the veranda where they sat in silence over their whisky each man staring straight out to sea where the wildly swinging riding light of the minerva could be seen in the lulls of the driving rain  somewhere out there sheldon reflected was joan lackland the girl who had not grown up the woman good to look upon with only a boys mind and a boys desires leaving berande amid storm and conflict in much the same manner that she had first arrived in the sternsheets of her whaleboat adamu adam steering her savage crew bending to the oars  and she was taking her stetson hat with her along with the cartridgebelt and the longbarrelled revolver  he suddenly discovered an immense affection for those fripperies of hers at which he had secretly laughed when first he saw them  he became aware of the sentimental direction in which his fancy was leading him and felt inclined to laugh  but he did not laugh the next moment he was busy visioning the hat and belt and revolver undoubtedly this was love he thought and he felt a tiny glow of pride in him in that the solomons had not succeeded in killing all his sentiment  an hour later christian young stood up knocked out his pipe and prepared to go aboard and get under way  shes all right he said apropos of nothing spoken and yet distinctly relevant to what was in each of their minds  shes got a good boats crew and shes a sailor herself  goodnight mr sheldon  anything i can do for you down marauway  he turned and pointed to a widening space of starry sky  its going to be a fine night after all  with this favouring bit of breeze she has sail on already and shell make guvutu by daylight  goodnight  i guess ill turn in old man tudor said rising and placing his glass on the table  ill start the first thing in the morning  its been disgraceful the way ive been hanging on here  goodnight  sheldon sitting on alone wondered if the other man would have decided to pull out in the morning had joan not sailed away  well there was one bit of consolation in it joan had certainly lingered at berande for no man not even tudor  i start in an hourher words rang in his brain and under his eyelids he could see her as she stood up and uttered them he smiled  the instant she heard the news she had made up her mind to go  it was not very flattering to man but what could any man count in her eyes when a schooner waiting to be bought in sydney was in the wind what a creature  what a creature        berande was a lonely place to sheldon in the days that followed  in the morning after joans departure he had seen tudors expedition off on its way up the balesuna in the late afternoon through his telescope he had seen the smoke of the upolu that was bearing joan away to sydney and in the evening he sat down to dinner in solitary state devoting more of his time to looking at her empty chair than to his food  he never came out on the veranda without glancing first of all at her grass house in the corner of the compound and one evening idly knocking the balls about on the billiard table he came to himself to find himself standing staring at the nail upon which from the first she had hung her stetson hat and her revolverbelt  why should he care for her he demanded of himself angrily  she was certainly the last woman in the world he would have thought of choosing for himself  never had he encountered one who had so thoroughly irritated him rasped his feelings smashed his conventions and violated nearly every attribute of what had been his ideal of woman  had he been too long away from the world  had he forgotten what the race of women was like  was it merely a case of propinquity  and she wasnt really a woman  she was a masquerader  under all her seeming of woman she was a boy playing a boys pranks diving for fish amongst sharks sporting a revolver longing for adventure and what was more going out in search of it in her whaleboat along with her savage islanders and her bag of sovereigns  but he loved herthat was the point of it all and he did not try to evade it  he was not sorry that it was so  he loved herthat was the overwhelming astounding fact  once again he discovered a big enthusiasm for berande  all the bubble illusions concerning the life of the tropical planter had been pricked by the stern facts of the solomons  following the death of hughie he had resolved to muddle along somehow with the plantation but this resolve had not been based upon desire  instead it was based upon the inherent stubbornness of his nature and his dislike to give over an attempted task  but now it was different  berande meant everything  it must succeednot merely because joan was a partner in it but because he wanted to make that partnership permanently binding  three more years and the plantation would be a splendidpaying investment  they could then take yearly trips to australia and oftener and an occasional run home to englandor hawaii would come as a matter of course  he spent his evenings poring over accounts or making endless calculations based on cheaper freights for copra and on the possible maximum and minimum market prices for that staple of commerce  his days were spent out on the plantation  he undertook more clearing of bush and clearing and planting went on under his personal supervision at a faster pace than ever before  he experimented with premiums for extra work performed by the black boys and yearned continually for more of them to put to work  not until joan could return on the schooner would this be possible for the professional recruiters were all under long contracts to the fulcrum brothers morgan and raff and the fires philp company while the flibbertygibbet was wholly occupied in running about among his widely scattered trading stations which extended from the coast of new georgia in one direction to ulava and sikiana in the other  blacks he must have and if joan were fortunate in getting a schooner three months at least must elapse before the first recruits could be landed on berande  a week after the upolus departure the malakula dropped anchor and her skipper came ashore for a game of billiards and to gossip until the land breeze sprang up  besides as he told his supercargo he simply had to come ashore not merely to deliver the large package of seeds with full instructions for planting from joan but to shock sheldon with the little surprise born of information he was bringing with him  captain auckland played the billiards first and it was not until he was comfortably seated in a steamerchair his second whisky securely in his hand that he let off his bomb  a great piece that miss lackland of yours he chuckled  claims to be a partowner of berande  says shes your partner  is that straight  sheldon nodded coldly  you dont say  that is a surprise  well she hasnt convinced guvutu or tulagi of it  theyre pretty used to irregular things over there butha ha he stopped to have his laugh out and to mop his bald head with a trade handkerchief  but that partnership yarn of hers was too big to swallow though it gave them the excuse for a few more drinks  there is nothing irregular about it  it is an ordinary business transaction  sheldon strove to act as though such transactions were quite the commonplace thing on plantations in the solomons  she invested something like fifteen hundred pounds in berande  so she said  and she has gone to sydney on business for the plantation  oh no she hasnt  i beg pardon sheldon queried  i said she hasnt thats all  but didnt the upolu sail  i could have sworn i saw her smoke last tuesday afternoon late as she passed savo  the upolu sailed all right  captain auckland sipped his whisky with provoking slowness  only miss lackland wasnt a passenger  then where is she  at guvutu last i saw of her  she was going to sydney to buy a schooner wasnt she  yes yes  thats what she said  well shes bought one though i wouldnt give her ten shillings for it if a norwester blows up and its about time we had one  this has been too long a spell of good weather to last  if you came here to excite my curiosity old man sheldon said youve certainly succeeded  now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened  what schooner  where is it  how did she happen to buy it  first the schooner martha the skipper answered checking his replies off on his fingers  second the martha is on the outside reef at poongapoonga looted clean of everything portable and ready to go to pieces with the first bit of lively sea  and third miss lackland bought her at auction  she was knocked down to her for fiftyfive quid by the thirdassistantresidentcommissioner  i ought to know  i bid fifty myself for morgan and raff  my word werent they hot  i told them to go to the devil and that it was their fault for limiting me to fifty quid when they thought the chance to salve the martha was worth more you see they werent expecting competition  fulcrum brothers had no representative present neither had fires philp company and the only man to be afraid of was nielsens agent squires and him they got drunk and sound asleep over in guvutu  twenty says i for my bid  twentyfive says the little girl thirty says i  forty says she  fifty says i  fiftyfive says she  and there i was stuck  hold on says i wait till i see my owners  no you dont says she  its customary says i  not anywhere in the world says she  then its courtesy in the solomons says i  and dye know on my faith i think burnettd have done it only she pipes up sweet and pert as you please mr auctioneer will you kindly proceed with the sale in the customary manner  ive other business to attend to and i cant afford to wait all night on men who dont know their own minds  and then she smiles at burnett as wellyou know one of those fetching smiles and damme if burnett doesnt begin singing out goin goin goinlast bidgoin goin for fiftyfive sovereignsgoin goin goneto you misserwhat name please  joan lackland says she with a smile to me and thats how she bought the martha  sheldon experienced a sudden thrill  the marthaa finer schooner than the malakula and for that matter the finest in the solomons she was just the thing for recruits and she was right on the spot  then he realized that for such a craft to sell at auction for fiftyfive pounds meant that there was small chance for saving her  but how did it happen he asked  werent they rather quick in selling the martha  had to  you know the reef at poongapoonga  shes not worth tuppence on it if any kind of a sea kicks up and its ripe for a norwester any moment now  the crowd abandoned her completely  didnt even dream of auctioning her  morgan and raff persuaded them to put her up  theyre a cooperative crowd you know an organized business corporation fore and aft all hands and the cook  they held a meeting and voted to sell  but why didnt they stand by and try to save her  stand by  you know malaita  and you know poongapoonga  thats where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands  there was nothing to do but take to the boats  the martha missed stays going in and inside five minutes she was on the reef and in possession  the niggers swarmed over her and they just threw the crew into the boats  i talked with some of the men  they swear there were two hundred war canoes around her inside half an hour and five thousand bushmen on the beach  said you couldnt see malaita for the smoke of the signal fires anyway they cleared out for tulagi  but why didnt they fight sheldon asked  it was funny they didnt but they got separated  you see twothirds of them were in the boats without weapons running anchors and never dreaming the natives would attack  they found out their mistake too late  the natives had charge  thats the trouble of new chums on the coast  it would never have happened with you or me or any oldtimer  but what is miss lackland intending to do captain auckland grinned  shes going to try to get the martha off i should say  or else why did she pay fiftyfive quid for her  and if she fails shell try to get her money back by saving the gearspars you know and patent steering gear and winches and such things  at least thats what id do if i was in her place  when i sailed the little girl had chartered the emilyim going recruiting says munsterhes the skipper and owner now  and how much will you net on the cruise asks she  oh fifty quid says he  good says she you bring your emily along with me and youll get seventyfive  you know that big ships anchor and chain piled up behind the coalsheds  she was just buying that when i left shes certainly a hustler that little girl of yours  she is my partner sheldon corrected  well shes a good one thats all and a cool one  my word a white woman on malaita and at poongapoonga of all places  oh i forgot to tell youshe palavered burnett into lending her eight rifles for her men and three cases of dynamite  youd laugh to see the way she makes that guvutu gang stand around  and to see them being polite and trying to give advice  lord lord man that little girls a wonder a marvel aaa catastrophe  thats what she is a catastrophe  shes gone through guvutu and tulagi like a hurricane every last swine of them in love with herexcept raff  hes sore over the auction and he sprang his recruiting contract with munster on her  and what does she do but thank him and read it over and point out that while munster was pledged to deliver all recruits to morgan and raff there was no clause in the document forbidding him from chartering the emily  theres your contract says she passing it back  and a very good contract it is  the next time you draw one up insert a clause that will fit emergencies like the present one  and lord lord she had him too  but theres the breeze and im off  goodbye old man  hope the little girl succeeds  the marthas a whacking fine boat and shed take the place of the jessie     chapter xviiyour miss lackland   the next morning sheldon came in from the plantation to breakfast to find the mission ketch apostle at anchor her crew swimming two mares and a filly ashore  sheldon recognized the animals as belonging to the resident commissioner and he immediately wondered if joan had bought them  she was certainly living up to her threat of rattling the dry bones of the solomons and he was prepared for anything  miss lackland sent them said welshmere the missionary doctor stepping ashore and shaking hands with him  theres also a box of saddles on board  and this letter from her  and the skipper of the flibbertygibbet  the next moment and before he could greet him oleson stepped from the boat and began  shes stolen the flibberty mr sheldon  run clean away with her shes a wild one  she gave me the fever  brought it on by shock  and got me drunk as wellrotten drunk  dr welshmere laughed heartily  nevertheless she is not an unmitigated evil your miss lackland  shes sworn three men off their drink or to the same purpose shut off their whisky  you know thembrahms curtis and fowler  she shipped them on the flibbertygibbet along with her  shes the skipper of the flibberty now oleson broke in  and shell wreck her as sure as god didnt make the solomons  dr welshmere tried to look shocked but laughed again  she has quite a way with her he said  i tried to back out of bringing the horses over  said i couldnt charge freight that the apostle was under a yacht license that i was going around by savo and the upper end of guadalcanar  but it was no use  bother the charge said she  you take the horses like a good man and when i float the martha ill return the service some day  and bother your orders said she to me oleson cried  im your boss now said she and you take your orders from me  look at that load of ivory nuts i said  bother them said she im playin for something bigger than ivory nuts  well dump them overside as soon as we get under way  sheldon put his hands to his ears  i dont know what has happened and you are trying to tell me the tale backwards  come up to the house and get in the shade and begin at the beginning  what i want to know oleson began when they were seated is is she your partner or aint she  thats what i want to know  she is sheldon assured him  well whod have believed it  oleson glanced appealingly at dr welshmere and back again at sheldon  ive seen a few unlikely things in these solomonsrats two feet long butterflies the commissioner hunts with a shotgun earornaments that would shame the devil and headhunting devils that make the devil look like an angel  ive seen them and got used to them but this young woman of yours  miss lackland is my partner and partowner of berande sheldon interrupted  so she said the irate skipper dashed on  but she had no papers to show for it  how was i to know  and then there was that load of ivory nutseight tons of them  for heavens sake begin at the sheldon tried to interrupt  and then shes hired them drunken loafers three of the worst scoundrels that ever disgraced the solomonsfifteen quid a month eachwhat dye think of that  and sailed away with them too  phewyou might give me a drink  the missionary wont mind  ive been on his teetotal hooker four days now and im perishing  dr welshmere nodded in reply to sheldons look of inquiry and viaburi was dispatched for the whisky and siphons  it is evident captain oleson sheldon remarked to that refreshed mariner that miss lackland has run away with your boat  now please give a plain statement of what occurred  right o here goes  id just come in on the flibberty  she was on board before i dropped the hookin that whaleboat of hers with her gang of tahiti heathensthat big adamu adam and the rest  dont drop the anchor captain oleson she sang out  i want you to get under way for poongapoonga  i looked to see if shed been drinking  what was i to think  i was rounding up at the time alongside the shoala ticklish placeheadsails running down and losing way so i says excuse me miss lackland and yells forard let go  you might have listened to me and saved yourself trouble says she climbing over the rail and squinting along forard and seeing the first shackle flip out and stop  theres fifteen fathom says she you may as well turn your men to and heave up  and then we had it out  i didnt believe her  i didnt think youd take her on as a partner and i told her as much and wanted proof  she got high and mighty and i told her i was old enough to be her grandfather and that i wouldnt take gammon from a chit like her  and then i ordered her off the flibberty  captain oleson she says sweet as you please ive a few minutes to spare on you and ive got some good whisky over on the emily  come on along  besides i want your advice about this wrecking business  everybody says youre a crackerjack sailormanthats what she said crackerjack  and i went in her whaleboat adamu adam steering and looking as solemn as a funeral  on the way she told me about the martha and how shed bought her and was going to float her  she said shed chartered the emily and was sailing as soon as i could get the flibberty underway  it struck me that her gammon was reasonable enough and i agreed to pull out for berande right o and get your orders to go along to poongapoonga  but she said there wasnt a second to be lost by any such foolishness and that i was to sail direct for poongapoonga and that if i couldnt take her word that she was your partner shed get along without me and the flibberty  and right theres where she fooled me  down in the emilys cabin was them three soaksyou know themfowler and curtis and that brahms chap  have a drink says she  i thought they looked surprised when she unlocked the whisky locker and sent a nigger for the glasses and watermonkey  but she must have tipped them off unbeknownst to me and they knew just what to do  excuse me she says im going on deck a minute  now that minute was half an hour  i hadnt had a drink in ten days  im an old man and the fever has weakened me  then i took it on an empty stomach too and there was them three soaks setting me an example they arguing for me to take the flibberty to poongapoonga an me pointing out my duty to the contrary  the trouble was all the arguments were pointed with drinks and me not being a drinking man so to say and weak from fever     well anyway at the end of the halfhour down she came again and took a good squint at me  thatll do nicely i remember her saying and with that she took the whisky bottles and hove them overside through the companionway  thats the last she said to the three soaks till the martha floats and youre back in guvutu  itll be a long time between drinks  and then she laughed  she looked at me and saidnot to me mind you but to the soaks its time this worthy man went ashoreme worthy man  fowler she saidyou know just like a straight order and she didnt mister himit was plain fowlerfowler she said just tell adamu adam to man the whaleboat and while hes taking captain oleson ashore have your boat put me on the flibberty  the three of you sail with me so pack your dunnage  and the one of you that shows up best will take the mates billet  captain oleson doesnt carry a mate you know  i dont remember much after that  all hands got me over the side and it seems to me i went to sleep sitting in the sternsheets and watching that adamu steer  then i saw the flibbertys mainsail hoisting and heard the clank of her chain coming in and i woke up  here put me on the flibberty i said to adamu  i put you on the beach said he missie lackalanna say beach plenty good for you  well i let out a yell and reached for the steeringsweep  i was doing my best by my owners you see  only that adamu gives me a shove down on the bottom boards puts one foot on me to hold me down and goes on steering  and thats all  the shock of the whole thing brought on fever  and now ive come to find out whether im skipper of the flibberty or that chit of yours with her pirating heathen boatscrew  never mind skipper  you can take a vacation on pay  sheldon spoke with more assurance than he felt  if miss lackland who is my partner has seen fit to take charge of the flibbertygibbet why it is all right  as you will agree there was no time to be lost if the martha was to be got off  it is a bad reef and any considerable sea would knock her bottom out  you settle down here skipper and rest up and get the fever out of your bones  when the flibbertygibbet comes back youll take charge again of course  after dr welshmere and the apostle departed and captain oleson had turned in for a sleep in a veranda hammock sheldon opened joans letter     dear mr sheldonplease forgive me for stealing the    flibbertygibbet  i simply had to  the martha means everything    to us  think of it only fiftyfive pounds for her two hundred and    seventyfive dollars  if i dont save her i know i shall be able to    pay all expenses out of her gear which the natives will not have    carried off  and if i do save her it is the haul of a lifetime  and    if i dont save her ill fill the emily and the flibbertygibbet    with recruits  recruits are needed right now on berande more than    anything else     and please please dont be angry with me  you said i shouldnt go    recruiting on the flibberty and i wont  ill go on the emily     i bought two cows this afternoon  that trader at nogi died of fever    and i bought them from his partner sam willis his name is who agrees    to deliver themmost likely by the minerva next time she is down    that way  berande has been long enough on tinned milk     and dr welshmere has agreed to get me some orange and lime trees from    the mission station at ulava  he will deliver them the next trip of    the apostle  if the sydney steamer arrives before i get back plant    the sweet corn she will bring between the young trees on the high bank    of the balesuna  the current is eating in against that bank and you    should do something to save it     i have ordered some figtrees and loquats too from sydney  dr    welshmere will bring some mangoseeds  they are big trees and require    plenty of room     the martha is registered 110 tons  she is the biggest schooner in    the solomons and the best  i saw a little of her lines and guess the    rest  she will sail like a witch  if she hasnt filled with water    her engine will be all right  the reason she went ashore was because    it was not working  the engineer had disconnected the feedpipes to    clean out the rust  poor business unless at anchor or with plenty of    sea room     plant all the trees in the compound even if you have to clean out the    palms later on     and dont plant the sweet corn all at once  let a few days elapse    between plantings     joan lackland  he fingered the letter lingering over it and scrutinizing the writing in a way that was not his wont  how characteristic was his thought as he studied the boyish scrawlclear to read painfully clear but none the less boyish  the clearness of it reminded him of her face of her cleanly stencilled brows her straightly chiselled nose the very clearness of the gaze of her eyes the firmly yet delicately moulded lips and the throat neither fragile nor robust butbut just right he concluded an adequate and beautiful pillar for so shapely a burden  he looked long at the name  joan lacklandjust an assemblage of letters of commonplace letters but an assemblage that generated a subtle and heady magic  it crept into his brain and twined and twisted his mental processes until all that constituted him at that moment went out in love to that scrawled signature  a few commonplace lettersyet they caused him to know in himself a lack that sweetly hurt and that expressed itself in vague spiritual outpourings and delicious yearnings joan lackland  each time he looked at it there arose visions of her in a myriad moods and guisescoming in out of the flying smother of the gale that had wrecked her schooner launching a whaleboat to go afishing running dripping from the sea with streaming hair and clinging garments to the freshwater shower frightening fourscore cannibals with an empty chlorodyne bottle teaching ornfiri how to make bread hanging her stetson hat and revolverbelt on the hook in the livingroom talking gravely about winning to hearth and saddle of her own or juvenilely rattling on about romance and adventure brighteyed her face flushed and eager with enthusiasm  joan lackland  he mused over the cryptic wonder of it till the secrets of love were made clear and he felt a keen sympathy for lovers who carved their names on trees or wrote them on the beachsands of the sea  then he came back to reality and his face hardened  even then she was on the wild coast of malaita and at poongapoonga of all villainous and dangerous portions the worst peopled with a teeming population of head hunters robbers and murderers  for the instant he entertained the rash thought of calling his boatscrew and starting immediately in a whale boat for poongapoonga  but the next instant the idea was dismissed what could he do if he did go  first she would resent it  next she would laugh at him and call him a silly and after all he would count for only one rifle more and she had many rifles with her  three things only could he do if he went  he could command her to return he could take the flibbertygibbet away from her he could dissolve their partnershipany and all of which he knew would be foolish and futile and he could hear her explain in terse set terms that she was legally of age and that nobody could say come or go to her  no his pride would never permit him to start for poongapoonga though his heart whispered that nothing could be more welcome than a message from her asking him to come and lend a hand  her very wordslend a hand and in his fancy he could see and hear her saying them  there was much in her wilful conduct that caused him to wince in the heart of him  he was appalled by the thought of her shoulder to shoulder with the drunken rabble of traders and beachcombers at guvutu  it was bad enough for a clean fastidious man but for a young woman a girl at that it was awful  the theft of the flibbertygibbet was merely amusing though the means by which the theft had been effected gave him hurt  yet he found consolation in the fact that the task of making oleson drunk had been turned over to the three scoundrels  and next and swiftly came the vision of her alone with those same three scoundrels on the emily sailing out to sea from guvutu in the twilight with darkness coming on  then came visions of adamu adam and noa noah and all her brawny tahitian following and his anxiety faded away being replaced by irritation that she should have been capable of such wildness of conduct  and the irritation was still on him as he got up and went inside to stare at the hook on the wall and to wish that her stetson hat and revolver belt were hanging from it     chapter xviiimaking the books come true   several quiet weeks slipped by  berande after such an unusual run of visiting vessels drifted back into her old solitude  sheldon went on with the daily round clearing bush planting cocoanuts smoking copra building bridges and riding about his work on the horses joan had bought  news of her he had none  recruiting vessels on malaita left the poongapoonga coast severely alone and the clansman a samoan recruiter dropping anchor one sunset for billiards and gossip reported rumours amongst the sio natives that there had been fighting at poonga poonga  as this news would have had to travel right across the big island little dependence was to be placed on it  the steamer from sydney the kammambo broke the quietude of berande for an hour while landing mail supplies and the trees and seeds joan had ordered  the minerva bound for cape marsh brought the two cows from nogi  and the apostle hurrying back to tulagi to connect with the sydney steamer sent a boat ashore with the orange and lime trees from ulava  and these several weeks marked a period of perfect weather there were days on end when sleek calms ruled the breathless sea and days when vagrant wisps of air fanned for several hours from one direction or another  the landbreezes at night alone proved regular and it was at night that the occasional cutters and ketches slipped by too eager to take advantage of the light winds to drop anchor for an hour  then came the longexpected norwester  for eight days it raged lulling at times to short durations of calm then shifting a point or two and raging with renewed violence  sheldon kept a precautionary eye on the buildings while the balesuna in flood so savagely attacked the high bank joan had warned him about that he told off all the gangs to battle with the river  it was in the good weather that followed that he left the blacks at work one morning and with a shotgun across his pommel rode off after pigeons  two hours later one of the houseboys breathless and scratched ran him down with the news that the martha the flibberty gibbet and the emily were heading in for the anchorage  coming into the compound from the rear sheldon could see nothing until he rode around the corner of the bungalow  then he saw everything at oncefirst a glimpse at the sea where the martha floated huge alongside the cutter and the ketch which had rescued her and next the ground in front of the veranda steps where a great crowd of freshcaught cannibals stood at attention  from the fact that each was attired in a new snowwhite lavalava sheldon knew that they were recruits  part way up the steps one of them was just backing down into the crowd while another called out by name was coming up  it was joans voice that had called him and sheldon reined in his horse and watched  she sat at the head of the steps behind a table between munster and his white mate the three of them checking long lists joan asking the questions and writing the answers in the big redcovered berande labourjournal  what name she demanded of the black man on the steps  tagari came the answer accompanied by a grin and a rolling of curious eyes for it was the first whitemans house the black had ever seen  what place blong you  bangoora  no one had noticed sheldon and he continued to sit his horse and watch there was a discrepancy between the answer and the record in the recruiting books and a consequent discussion until munster solved the difficulty  bangoora he said  thats the little beach at the head of the bay out of latta  hes down as a lattamansee there it is tagari latta  what place you go you finish along white marster joan asked  bangoora the man replied and joan wrote it down  ogu joan called  the black stepped down and another mounted to take his place  but tagari just before he reached the bottom step caught sight of sheldon it was the first horse the fellow had ever seen and he let out a frightened screech and dashed madly up the steps  at the same moment the great mass of blacks surged away panicstricken from sheldons vicinity the grinning houseboys shouted encouragement and explanation and the stampede was checked the newcaught headhunters huddling closely together and staring dubiously at the fearful monster  hello joan called out  what do you mean by frightening all my boys come on up  what do you think of them she asked when they had shaken hands  and what do you think of herwith a wave of the hand toward the martha i thought youd deserted the plantation and that i might as well go ahead and get the men into barracks  arent they beauties  do you see that one with the split nose  hes the only man who doesnt hail from the poongapoonga coast and they said the poongapoonga natives wouldnt recruit  just look at them and congratulate me  there are no kiddies and halfgrown youths among them  theyre men every last one of them  i have such a long story i dont know where to begin and i wont begin anyway till were through with this and until you have told me that you are not angry with me  oguwhat place blong you she went on with her catechism  but ogu was a bushman lacking knowledge of the almost universal bechede mer english and half a dozen of his fellows wrangled to explain  there are only two or three more joan said to sheldon and then were done  but you havent told me that you are not angry  sheldon looked into her clear eyes as she favoured him with a direct untroubled gaze that threatened he knew from experience to turn teasingly defiant on an instants notice  and as he looked at her it came to him that he had never halfanticipated the gladness her return would bring to him  i was angry he said deliberately  i am still angry very angry he noted the glint of defiance in her eyes and thrilledbut i forgave and i now forgive all over again  though i still insist  that i should have a guardian she interrupted  but that day will never come  thank goodness im of legal age and able to transact business in my own right  and speaking of business how do you like my forceful american methods  mr raff from what i hear doesnt take kindly to them he temporized and youve certainly set the dry bones rattling for many a day  but what i want to know is if other american women are as successful in business ventures  luck most all luck she disclaimed modestly though her eyes lighted with sudden pleasure and he knew her boys vanity had been touched by his trifle of tempered praise  luck be blowed broke out the long mate sparrowhawk his face shining with admiration  it was hard work thats what it was  we earned our pay  she worked us till we dropped  and we were down with fever half the time  so was she for that matter only she wouldnt stay down and she wouldnt let us stay down  my word shes a slavedriverjust one more heave mr sparrowhawk and then you can go to bed for a weekshe to me and me staggerin round like a dead man with biliousgreen lights flashing inside my head an my head just bustin  i was all in but i gave that heave right oand then it was another heave now mr sparrowhawk just another heave  an the lord lumme the way she made love to old kinakina  he shook his head reproachfully while the laughter died down in his throat to longdrawn chuckles  he was older than telepasse and dirtier she assured sheldon and i am sure much wickeder  but this isnt work  let us get through with these lists  she turned to the waiting black on the steps  ogu you finish along big marster belong white man you go notnothere you tangari you speak m along that fella ogu  he finish he walk about notnot  have you got that mr munster  but youve broken the recruiting laws sheldon said when the new recruits had marched away to the barracks  the licenses for the flibberty and the emily dont allow for one hundred and fifty  what did burnett say  he passed them all of them she answered  captain munster will tell you what he saidsomething about being blowed or words to that effect now i must run and wash up  did the sydney orders arrive  yours are in your quarters sheldon said  hurry for breakfast is waiting  let me have your hat and belt  do please allow me  theres only one hook for them and i know where it is  she gave him a quick scrutiny that was almost womanlike then sighed with relief as she unbuckled the heavy belt and passed it to him  i doubt if i ever want to see another revolver she complained  that one has worn a hole in me im sure  i never dreamed i could get so weary of one  sheldon watched her to the foot of the steps where she turned and called back  my  i cant tell you how good it is to be home again  and as his gaze continued to follow her across the compound to the tiny grass house the realization came to him crushingly that berande and that little grass house was the only place in the world she could call home        and burnett said well ill be damnedi beg your pardon miss lackland but you have wantonly broken the recruiting laws and you know it captain munster narrated as they sat over their whisky waiting for joan to come back  and says she to him mr burnett can you show me any law against taking the passengers off a vessel thats on a reef that is not the point says he  its the very precise particular point says she and you bear it in mind and go ahead and pass my recruits  you can report me to the lord high commissioner if you want but i have three vessels here waiting on your convenience and if you delay them much longer therell be another report go in to the lord high commissioner  ill hold you responsible captain munster says he to me mad enough to eat scrapiron  no you wont says she im the charterer of the emily and captain munster has acted under my orders  what could burnett do  he passed the whole hundred and fifty though the emily was only licensed for forty and the flibbertygibbet for thirtyfive  but i dont understand sheldon said  this is the way she worked it  when the martha was floated we had to beach her right away at the head of the bay and whilst repairs were going on a new rudder being made sails bent gear recovered from the niggers and so forth miss lackland borrows sparrowhawk to run the flibberty along with curtis lends me brahms to take sparrowhawks place and starts both craft off recruiting  my word the niggers came easy  it was virgin ground  since the scottish chiefs no recruiter had ever even tried to work the coast and wed already put the fear of god into the niggers hearts till the whole coast was quiet as lambs when we filled up we came back to see how the martha was progressing  and thinking we was going home with our recruits sparrowhawk slipped in  lord lumme that miss lackland aint never satisfied  ill take em on the martha says she and you can go back and fill up again  but i told her it couldnt be done munster went on  i told her the martha hadnt a license for recruiting  oh she said it cant be done eh and she stood and thought a few minutes  and id seen her think before cried sparrowhawk and i knew at wunst that the thing was as good as done  munster lighted his cigarette and resumed  you see that spit she says to me with the little ripple breaking around it  theres a current sets right across it and on it  and you see them bafflin little catspaws  its good weather and a falling tide  you just start to beat out the two of you and all you have to do is miss stays in the same baffling puff and the current will set you nicely aground  that little wash of sea wont more than start a sheet or two of copper says she when munster kicked sparrowhawk explained  oh shes no green un that girl  then ill rescue your recruits and sail awaysimple aint it says she munster continued  you hang up one tide says she the next is the big high water  then you kedge off and go after more recruits theres no law against recruiting when youre empty  but there is against starving em i said you know yourself there aint any kai kai to speak of aboard of us and there aint a crumb on the martha  wed all been pretty well on native kaikai as it was said sparrowhawk  dont let the kaikai worry you captain munster says she if i can find grub for eightyfour mouths on the martha the two of you can do as much by your two vessels  now go ahead and get aground before a steady breeze comes up and spoils the manoeuvre  ill send my boats the moment you strike  and now goodday gentlemen  and we went and did it sparrowhawk said solemnly and then emitted a series of chuckling noises  we laid over starboard tack and i pinched the emily against the spit  go about captain munster yells at me go about or youll have me aground  he yelled other things much worse  but i didnt mind  i missed stays pretty as you please and the flibberty drifted down on him and fouled him and we went ashore together in as nice a mess as you ever want to see  miss lackland transferred the recruits and the trick was done  but where was she during the norwester sheldon asked  at langalanga  ran up there as it was coming on and laid there the whole week and traded for grub with the niggers  when we got to tulagi there she was waiting for us and scrapping with burnett  i tell you mr sheldon shes a wonder that girl a perfect wonder  munster refilled his glass and while sheldon glanced across at joans house anxious for her coming sparrowhawk took up the tale  gritty  shes the grittiest thing man or woman that ever blew into the solomons  you should have seen poongapoonga the morning we arrivedsniders popping on the beach and in the mangroves wardrums booming in the bush and signalsmokes raising everywhere  its all up says captain munster  yes thats what i said declared that mariner  of course it was all up  you could see it with half an eye and hear it with one ear  up your granny she says to him sparrowhawk went on  why we havent arrived yet much less got started  wait till the anchors down before you get afraid  thats what she said to me munster proclaimed  and of course it made me mad so that i didnt care what happened  we tried to send a boat ashore for a powwow but it was fired upon  and every once and a while some niggerd take a long shot at us out of the mangroves  they was only a quarter of a mile off sparrowhawk explained and it was damned nasty  dont shoot unless they try to board was miss lacklands orders but the dirty niggers wouldnt board  they just lay off in the bush and plugged away  that night we held a council of war in the flibbertys cabin  what we want says miss lackland is a hostage  thats what they do in books i said thinking to laugh her away from her folly munster interrupted  true says she and have you never seen the books come true  i shook my head  then youre not too old to learn says she  ill tell you one thing right now says i and that is ill be blowed if you catch me ashore in the nighttime stealing niggers in a place like this  you didnt say blowed sparrowhawk corrected  you said youd be damned  thats what i did and i meant it too  nobody asked you to go ashore says she quick as lightning sparrowhawk grinned  and she said more  she said and if i catch you going ashore without orders therell be troubleunderstand captain munster  who in hells telling this you or me the skipper demanded wrathfully  well she did didnt she insisted the mate  yes she did if you want to make so sure of it  and while youre about it you might as well repeat what she said to you when you said you wouldnt recruit on the poongapoonga coast for twice your screw  sparrowhawks sunreddened face flamed redder though he tried to pass the situation off by divers laughings and chucklings and facetwistings  go on go on sheldon urged and munster resumed the narrative  what we need says she is the strong hand  its the only way to handle them and weve got to take hold firm right at the beginning  im going ashore tonight to fetch kinakina himself on board and im not asking whos game to go for ive got every mans work arranged with me for him  im taking my sailors with me and one white man  of course im that white man i said for by that time i was mad enough to go to hell and back again  of course youre not says she  youll have charge of the covering boat  curtis stands by the landing boat  fowler goes with me  brahms takes charge of the flibberty and sparrowhawk of the emily  and we start at one oclock  my word it was a tough job lying there in the covering boat  i never thought doing nothing could be such hard work  we stopped about fifty fathoms off and watched the other boat go in  it was so dark under the mangroves we couldnt see a thing of it  dye know that little monkey looking nigger sheldon on the flibbertythe cook i mean  well he was cabinboy twenty years ago on the scottish chiefs and after she was cut off he was a slave there at poongapoonga  and miss lackland had discovered the fact  so he was the guide  she gave him half a case of tobacco for that nights work  and scared him fit to die before she could get him to come along sparrowhawk observed  well i never saw anything so black as the mangroves  i stared at them till my eyes were ready to burst  and then id look at the stars and listen to the surf sighing along the reef  and there was a dog that barked  remember that dog sparrowhawk  the brute nearly gave me heart failure when he first began  after a while he stoppedwasnt barking at the landing party at all and then the silence was harder than ever and the mangroves grew blacker and it was all i could do to keep from calling out to curtis in there in the landing boat just to make sure that i wasnt the only white man left alive  of course there was a row  it had to come and i knew it but it startled me just the same  i never heard such screeching and yelling in my life  the niggers must have just dived for the bush without looking to see what was up while her tahitians let loose shooting in the air and yelling to hurry em on  and then just as sudden came the silence againall except for some small kiddie that had got dropped in the stampede and that kept crying in the bush for its mother  and then i heard them coming through the mangroves and an oar strike on a gunwale and miss lackland laugh and i knew everything was all right we pulled on board without a shot being fired  and by god she had made the books come true for there was old kinakina himself being hoisted over the rail shivering and chattering like an ape  the rest was easy kinakinas word was law and he was scared to death  and we kept him on board issuing proclamations all the time we were in poongapoonga  it was a good move too in other ways  she made kinakina order his people to return all the gear theyd stripped from the martha  and back it came day after day steering compasses blocks and tackles sails coils of rope medicine chests ensigns signal flagseverything in fact except the trade goods and supplies which had already been kai kaid  of course she gave them a few sticks of tobacco to keep them in good humour  sure she did sparrowhawk broke forth  she gave the beggars five fathoms of calico for the big mainsail two sticks of tobacco for the chronometer and a sheathknife worth elevenpence hapenny for a hundred fathoms of brand new fiveinch manila  she got old kinakina with that strong hand on the go off and she kept him going all the time  shehere she comes now  it was with a shock of surprise that sheldon greeted her appearance  all the time while the tale of happening at poongapoonga had been going on he had pictured her as the woman he had always known clad roughly skirt made out of windowcurtain stuff an undersized mans shirt for a blouse straw sandals for foot covering with the stetson hat and the eternal revolver completing her costume  the readymade clothes from sydney had transformed her  a simple skirt and shirtwaist of some sort of wash goods set off her trim figure with a hint of elegant womanhood that was new to him  brown slippers peeped out as she crossed the compound and he once caught a glimpse to the ankle of brown openwork stockings somehow she had been made many times the woman by these mere extraneous trappings and in his mind these wild arabian nights adventures of hers seemed thrice as wonderful  as they went in to breakfast he became aware that munster and sparrowhawk had received a similar shock  all their air of camaraderie was dissipated and they had become abruptly and immensely respectful  ive opened up a new field she said as she began pouring the coffee old kinakina will never forget me im sure and i can recruit there whenever i want  i saw morgan at guvutu  hes willing to contract for a thousand boys at forty shillings per head  did i tell you that id taken out a recruiting license for the martha  i did and the martha can sign eighty boys every trip  sheldon smiled a trifle bitterly to himself  the wonderful woman who had tripped across the compound in her sydney clothes was gone and he was listening to the boy come back again     chapter xixthe lost toy   well joan said with a sigh ive shown you hustling american methods that succeed and get somewhere and here you are beginning your muddling again  five days had passed and she and sheldon were standing on the veranda watching the martha closehauled on the wind laying a tack off shore during those five days joan had never once broached the desire of her heart though sheldon in this particular instance reading her like a book had watched her lead up to the question a score of times in the hope that he would himself suggest her taking charge of the martha  she had wanted him to say the word and she had steeled herself not to say it herself  the matter of finding a skipper had been a hard one  she was jealous of the martha and no suggested man had satisfied her  oleson she had demanded  he does very well on the flibberty with me and my men to overhaul her whenever shes ready to fall to pieces through his slackness  but skipper of the martha  impossible  munster  yes hes the only man i know in the solomons id care to see in charge  and yet theres his record  he lost the umbawaone hundred and forty drowned  he was first officer on the bridge deliberate disobedience to instructions  no wonder they broke him  christian young has never had any experience with large boats  besides we cant afford to pay him what hes clearing on the minerva sparrowhawk is a good manto take orders  he has no initiative  hes an able sailor but he cant command  i tell you i was nervous all the time he had charge of the flibberty at poongapoonga when i had to stay by the martha  and so it had gone  no name proposed was satisfactory and moreover sheldon had been surprised by the accuracy of her judgments  a dozen times she almost drove him to the statement that from the showing she made of solomon islands sailors she was the only person fitted to command the martha  but each time he restrained himself while her pride prevented her from making the suggestion  good whaleboat sailors do not necessarily make good schoonerhandlers she replied to one of his arguments  besides the captain of a boat like the martha must have a large mind see things in a large way he must have capacity and enterprise  but with your tahitians on board sheldon had begun another argument  there wont be any tahitians on board she had returned promptly  my men stay with me  i never know when i may need them  when i sail they sail when i remain ashore they remain ashore  ill find plenty for them to do right here on the plantation  youve seen them clearing bush each of them worth half a dozen of your cannibals  so it was that joan stood beside sheldon and sighed as she watched the martha beating out to sea old kinross brought over from savo in command  kinross is an old fossil she said with a touch of bitterness in her voice  oh hell never wreck her through rashness rest assured of that but hes timid to childishness and timid skippers lose just as many vessels as rash ones  some day kinross will lose the martha because therell be only one chance and hell be afraid to take it  i know his sort  afraid to take advantage of a proper breeze of wind that will fetch him in in twenty hours hell get caught out in the calm that follows and spend a whole week in getting in  the martha will make money with him theres no doubt of it but she wont make near the money that she would under a competent master  she paused and with heightened colour and sparkling eyes gazed seaward at the schooner  my but she is a witch  look at her eating up the water and theres no wind to speak of  shes not got ordinary white metal either  its man ofwar copper every inch of it  i had them polish it with cocoanut husks when she was careened at poongapoonga  she was a sealhunter before this gold expedition got her  and sealhunters had to sail theyve run away from second class russian cruisers more than once up there off siberia  honestly if id dreamed of the chance waiting for me at guvutu when i bought her for less than three hundred dollars id never have gone partners with you  and in that case id be sailing her right now  the justice of her contention came abruptly home to sheldon  what she had done she would have done just the same if she had not been his partner  and in the saving of the martha he had played no part  single handed unadvised in the teeth of the laughter of guvutu and of the competition of men like morgan and raff she had gone into the adventure and brought it through to success  you make me feel like a big man who has robbed a small child of a lolly he said with sudden contrition  and the small child is crying for it  she looked at him and he noted that her lip was slightly trembling and that her eyes were moist  it was the boy all over he thought the boy crying for the wee bit boat with which to play  and yet it was a woman too  what a maze of contradiction she was  and he wondered had she been all woman and no boy if he would have loved her in just the same way  then it rushed in upon his consciousness that he really loved her for what she was for all the boy in her and all the rest of herfor the total of her that would have been a different total in direct proportion to any differing of the parts of her  but the small child wont cry any more for it she was saying  this is the last sob  some day if kinross doesnt lose her youll turn her over to your partner i know  and i wont nag you any more  only i do hope you know how i feel  it isnt as if id merely bought the martha or merely built her  i saved her  i took her off the reef  i saved her from the grave of the sea when fiftyfive pounds was considered a big risk  she is mine peculiarly mine  without me she wouldnt exist  that big norwester would have finished her the first three hours it blew  and then ive sailed her too and she is a witch a perfect witch  why do you know shell steer by the wind with half a spoke give and take  and going about  well you dont have to baby her starting headsheets flattening mainsail and gentling her with the wheel  put your wheel down and around she comes like a colt with the bit in its teeth  and you can back her like a steamer  i did it at langalanga between that shoal patch and the shorereef  it was wonderful  but you dont love boats like i do and i know you think im making a fool of myself  but some day im going to sail the martha again  i know it  i know it  in reply and quite without premeditation his hand went out to hers covering it as it lay on the railing  but he knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was the boy that returned the pressure he gave the boy sorrowing over the lost toy  the thought chilled him  never had he been actually nearer to her and never had she been more convincingly remote she was certainly not acutely aware that his hand was touching hers  in her grief at the departure of the martha it was to her anybodys handat the best a friends hand  he withdrew his hand and walked perturbedly away  why hasnt he got that big fishermans staysail on her she demanded irritably  it would make the old girl just walk along in this breeze  i know the sort old kinross is  hes the skipper that lies three days under doublereefed topsails waiting for a gale that doesnt come  safe oh yes hes safedangerously safe  sheldon retraced his steps  never mind he said  you can go sailing on the martha any time you pleaserecruiting on malaita if you want to  it was a great concession he was making and he felt that he did it against his better judgment  her reception of it was a surprise to him  with old kinross in command she queried  no thank you  hed drive me to suicide  i couldnt stand his handling of her  it would give me nervous prostration  ill never step on the martha again unless it is to take charge of her  im a sailor like my father and he could never bear to see a vessel mishandled  did you see the way kinross got under way  it was disgraceful  and the noise he made about it  old noah did better with the ark  but we manage to get somewhere just the same he smiled  so did noah  that was the main thing  for an antediluvian  she took another lingering look at the martha then turned to sheldon  you are a slovenly lot down here when it comes to boatsmost of you are any way  christian young is all right though munster has a slap dash style about him and they do say old nielsen was a crackerjack  but with the rest ive seen theres no dash no go no cleverness no real sailors pride  its all humdrum and podgy and slowgoing any going so long as you get there heaven knows when  but some day ill show you how the martha should be handled  ill break out anchor and get under way in a speed and style that will make your head hum and ill bring her alongside the wharf at guvutu without dropping anchor and running a line  she came to a breathless pause and then broke into laughter directed he could see against herself  old kinross is setting that fishermans staysail he remarked quietly  no she cried incredulously swiftly looking then running for the telescope  she regarded the manoeuvre steadily through the glass and sheldon watching her face could see that the skipper was not making a success of it  she finally lowered the glass with a groan  hes made a mess of it she said and now hes trying it over again and a man like that is put in charge of a fairy like the martha  well its a good argument against marriage thats all  no i wont look any more  come on in and play a steady conservative game of billiards with me  and after that im going to saddle up and go after pigeons  will you come along  an hour later just as they were riding out of the compound joan turned in the saddle for a last look at the martha a distant speck well over toward the florida coast  wont tudor be surprised when he finds we own the martha she laughed  think of it  if he doesnt strike paydirt hell have to buy a steamerpassage to get away from the solomons  still laughing gaily she rode through the gate  but suddenly her laughter broke flatly and she reined in the mare  sheldon glanced at her sharply and noted her face mottling even as he looked and turning orange and green  its the fever she said  ill have to turn back  by the time they were in the compound she was shivering and shaking and he had to help her from her horse  funny isnt it she said with chattering teeth  like seasicknessnot serious but horribly miserable while it lasts  im going to bed  send noa noah and viaburi to me  tell ornfiri to make hot water  ill be out of my head in fifteen minutes  but ill be all right by evening  short and sharp is the way it takes me  too bad to lose the shooting  thank you im all right  sheldon obeyed her instructions rushed hotwater bottles along to her and then sat on the veranda vainly trying to interest himself in a two monthsold file of sydney newspapers  he kept glancing up and across the compound to the grass house  yes he decided the contention of every white man in the islands was right the solomons was no place for a woman  he clapped his hands and lalaperu came running  here you he ordered go along barracks bring m black fella mary plenty too much altogether  a few minutes later the dozen black women of berande were ranged before him  he looked them over critically finally selecting one that was young comely as such creatures went and whose body bore no signs of skindisease  what name you he demanded  sangui  me mahua was the answer  all right you fella mahua  you finish cook along boys  you stop along white mary  all the time you stop along  you savvee  me savvee she grunted and obeyed his gesture to go to the grass house immediately  what name he asked viaburi who had just come out of the grass house  big fella sick was the answer  white fella mary talk m too much allee time  allee time talk m big fella schooner  sheldon nodded  he understood  it was the loss of the martha that had brought on the fever  the fever would have come sooner or later he knew but her disappointment had precipitated it  he lighted a cigarette and in the curling smoke of it caught visions of his english mother and wondered if she would understand how her son could love a woman who cried because she could not be skipper of a schooner in the cannibal isles     chapter xxa mantalk   the most patient man in the world is prone to impatience in loveand sheldon was in love  he called himself an ass a score of times a day and strove to contain himself by directing his mind in other channels but more than a score of times each day his thoughts roved back and dwelt on joan  it was a pretty problem she presented and he was continually debating with himself as to what was the best way to approach her  he was not an adept at lovemaking  he had had but one experience in the gentle art in which he had been more wooed than wooing and the affair had profited him little  this was another affair and he assured himself continually that it was a uniquely different and difficult affair  not only was here a woman who was not bent on finding a husband but it was a woman who wasnt a woman at all who was genuinely appalled by the thought of a husband who joyed in boys games and sentimentalized over such things as adventure who was healthy and normal and wholesome and who was so immature that a husband stood for nothing more than an encumbrance in her cherished scheme of existence  but how to approach her  he divined the fanatical love of freedom in her the deepseated antipathy for restraint of any sort  no man could ever put his arm around her and win her  she would flutter away like a frightened bird  approach by contactthat he realized was the one thing he must never do  his handclasp must be what it had always been the handclasp of hearty friendship and nothing more  never by action must he advertise his feeling for her  remained speech  but what speech  appeal to her love  but she did not love him  appeal to her brain  but it was apparently a boys brain  all the deliciousness and fineness of a finely bred woman was hers but for all he could discern her mental processes were sexless and boyish  and yet speech it must be for a beginning had to be made somewhere some time her mind must be made accustomed to the idea her thoughts turned upon the matter of marriage  and so he rode overseeing about the plantation with tightly drawn and puckered brows puzzling over the problem and steeling himself to the first attempt  a dozen ways he planned an intricate leading up to the first breaking of the ice and each time some link in the chain snapped and the talk went off on unexpected and irrelevant lines  and then one morning quite fortuitously the opportunity came  my dearest wish is the success of berande joan had just said apropos of a discussion about the cheapening of freights on copra to market  do you mind if i tell you the dearest wish of my heart he promptly returned  i long for it  i dream about it  it is my dearest desire  he paused and looked at her with intent significance but it was plain to him that she thought there was nothing more at issue than mutual confidences about things in general  yes go ahead she said a trifle impatient at his delay  i love to think of the success of berande he said but that is secondary  it is subordinate to the dearest wish which is that some day you will share berande with me in a completer way than that of mere business partnership  it is for you some day when you are ready to be my wife  she started back from him as if she had been stung  her face went white on the instant not from maidenly embarrassment but from the anger which he could see flaming in her eyes  this taking for grantedthis when i am ready she cried passionately then her voice swiftly became cold and steady and she talked in the way he imagined she must have talked business with morgan and raff at guvutu listen to me mr sheldon  i like you very well though you are slow and a muddler but i want you to understand once and for all that i did not come to the solomons to get married  that is an affliction i could have accumulated at home without sailing ten thousand miles after it  i have my own way to make in the world and i came to the solomons to do it  getting married is not making my way in the world  it may do for some women but not for me thank you  when i sit down to talk over the freight on copra i dont care to have proposals of marriage sandwiched in  besidesbesides  her voice broke for the moment and when she went on there was a note of appeal in it that wellnigh convicted him to himself of being a brute  dont you seeit spoils everything it makes the whole situation impossible    and    and i so loved our partnership and was proud of it  dont you seei cant go on being your partner if you make love to me  and i was so happy  tears of disappointment were in her eyes and she caught a swift sob in her throat  i warned you he said gravely  such unusual situations between men and women cannot endure  i told you so at the beginning  oh yes it is quite clear to me what you did  she was angry again and the feminine appeal had disappeared  you were very discreet in your warning  you took good care to warn me against every other man in the solomons except yourself  it was a blow in the face to sheldon  he smarted with the truth of it and at the same time he smarted with what he was convinced was the injustice of it  a gleam of triumph that flickered in her eye because of the hit she had made decided him  it is not so onesided as you seem to think it is he began  i was doing very nicely on berande before you came  at least i was not suffering indignities such as being accused of cowardly conduct as you have just accused me  rememberplease remember i did not invite you to berande  nor did i invite you to stay on at berande  it was by staying that you brought about thisto youunpleasant situation  by staying you made yourself a temptation and now you would blame me for it  i did not want you to stay  i wasnt in love with you then  i wanted you to go to sydney to go back to hawaii  but you insisted on staying  you virtually  he paused for a softer word than the one that had risen to his lips and she took it away from him  forced myself on youthats what you meant to say she cried the flags of battle painting her cheeks  go ahead  dont mind my feelings  all right i wont he said decisively realizing that the discussion was in danger of becoming a vituperative schoolboy argument  you have insisted on being considered as a man  consistency would demand that you talk like a man and like a man listen to mantalk  and listen you shall  it is not your fault that this unpleasantness has arisen  i do not blame you for anything remember that  and for the same reason you should not blame me for anything  he noticed her bosom heaving as she sat with clenched hands and it was all he could do to conquer the desire to flash his arms out and around her instead of going on with his coolly planned campaign  as it was he nearly told her that she was a most adorable boy  but he checked all such wayward fancies and held himself rigidly down to his disquisition  you cant help being yourself  you cant help being a very desirable creature so far as i am concerned  you have made me want you  you didnt intend to you didnt try to  you were so made that is all  and i was so made that i was ripe to want you  but i cant help being myself  i cant by an effort of will cease from wanting you any more than you by an effort of will can make yourself undesirable to me  oh this desire this want want want she broke in rebelliously  i am not quite a fool  i understand some things  and the whole thing is so foolish and absurdand uncomfortable  i wish i could get away from it  i really think it would be a good idea for me to marry noa noah or adamu adam or lalaperu there or any black boy  then i could give him orders and keep him penned away from me and men like you would leave me alone and not talk marriage and i want i want  sheldon laughed in spite of himself and far from any genuine impulse to laugh  you are positively soulless he said savagely  because ive a soul that doesnt yearn for a man for master she took up the gage  very well then  i am soulless and what are you going to do about it  i am going to ask you why you look like a woman  why have you the form of a woman the lips of a woman the wonderful hair of a woman  and i am going to answer because you are a womanthough the woman in you is asleepand that some day the woman will wake up  heaven forbid she cried in such sudden and genuine dismay as to make him laugh and to bring a smile to her own lips against herself  ive got some more to say to you sheldon pursued  i did try to protect you from every other man in the solomons and from yourself as well  as for me i didnt dream that danger lay in that quarter  so i failed to protect you from myself  i failed to protect you at all  you went your own wilful way just as though i didnt existwrecking schooners recruiting on malaita and sailing schooners one lone unprotected girl in the company of some of the worst scoundrels in the solomons  fowler and brahms and curtis  and such is the perverseness of human naturei am frank you seei love you for that too  i love you for all of you just as you are  she made a moue of distaste and raised a hand protestingly  dont he said  you have no right to recoil from the mention of my love for you  remember this is a mantalk  from the point of view of the talk you are a man  the woman in you is only incidental accidental and irrelevant  youve got to listen to the bald statement of fact strange though it is that i love you  and now i wont bother you any more about love  well go on the same as before  you are better off and safer on berande in spite of the fact that i love you than anywhere else in the solomons  but i want you as a final item of mantalk to remember from time to time that i love you and that it will be the dearest day of my life when you consent to marry me  i want you to think of it sometimes  you cant help but think of it sometimes  and now we wont talk about it any more  as between men theres my hand  he held out his hand  she hesitated then gripped it heartily and smiled through her tears  i wish she faltered i wish instead of that black mary youd given me somebody to swear for me  and with this enigmatic utterance she turned away     chapter xxicontraband   sheldon did not mention the subject again nor did his conduct change from what it had always been  there was nothing of the pining lover nor of the lover at all in his demeanour  nor was there any awkwardness between them  they were as frank and friendly in their relations as ever  he had wondered if his belligerent love declaration might have aroused some womanly selfconsciousness in joan but he looked in vain for any sign of it  she appeared as unchanged as he and while he knew that he hid his real feelings he was firm in his belief that she hid nothing  and yet the germ he had implanted must be at work he was confident of that though he was without confidence as to the result there was no forecasting this strange girls processes  she might awaken it was true and on the other hand and with equal chance he might be the wrong man for her and his declaration of love might only more firmly set her in her views on single blessedness  while he devoted more and more of his time to the plantation itself she took over the house and its multitudinous affairs and she took hold firmly in sailor fashion revolutionizing the system and discipline  the labour situation on berande was improving  the martha had carried away fifty of the blacks whose time was up and they had been among the worst on the plantationfiveyear men recruited by billy beblowed men who had gone through the old days of terrorism when the original owners of berande had been driven away  the new recruits being broken in under the new regime gave better promise  joan had joined with sheldon from the start in the programme that they must be gripped with the strong hand and at the same time be treated with absolute justice if they were to escape being contaminated by the older boys that still remained  i think it would be a good idea to put all the gangs at work close to the house this afternoon she announced one day at breakfast  ive cleaned up the house and you ought to clean up the barracks  there is too much stealing going on  a good idea sheldon agreed  their boxes should be searched  ive just missed a couple of shirts and my best toothbrush is gone  and two boxes of my cartridges she added to say nothing of handkerchiefs towels sheets and my best pair of slippers  but what they want with your toothbrush is more than i can imagine  theyll be stealing the billiard balls next  one did disappear a few weeks before you came sheldon laughed  well search the boxes this afternoon  and a busy afternoon it was  joan and sheldon both armed went through the barracks house by house the bossboys assisting and half a dozen messengers in relay shouting along the line the names of the boys wanted  each boy brought the key to his particular box and was permitted to look on while the contents were overhauled by the bossboys  a wealth of loot was recovered  there were fully a dozen caneknivesbig hacking weapons with razoredges capable of decapitating a man at a stroke  towels sheets shirts and slippers along with toothbrushes wispbrooms soap the missing billiard ball and all the lost and forgotten trifles of many months came to light  but most astonishing was the quantity of ammunitioncartridges for leemetfords for winchesters and marlins for revolvers from thirtytwo calibre to forty five shotgun cartridges joans two boxes of thirtyeight cartridges of prodigious bore for the ancient sniders of malaita flasks of black powder sticks of dynamite yards of fuse and boxes of detonators  but the great find was in the house occupied by gogoomy and five port adams recruits  the fact that the boxes yielded nothing excited sheldons suspicions and he gave orders to dig up the earthen floor  wrapped in matting well oiled free from rust and brand new two winchesters were first unearthed  sheldon did not recognize them  they had not come from berande neither had the forty flasks of black powder found under the cornerpost of the house and while he could not be sure he could remember no loss of eight boxes of detonators  a big colts revolver he recognized as hughie drummonds while joan identified a thirtytwo ivor and johnson as a loss reported by matapuu the first week he landed at berande  the absence of any cartridges made sheldon persist in the digging up of the floor and a fiftypound flour tin was his reward  with glowering eyes gogoomy looked on while sheldon took from the tin a hundred rounds each for the two winchesters and fully as many rounds more of nondescript cartridges of all sorts and makes and calibres  the contraband and stolen property was piled in assorted heaps on the back veranda of the bungalow  a few paces from the bottom of the steps were grouped the fortyodd culprits with behind them in solid array the several hundred blacks of the plantation  at the head of the steps joan and sheldon were seated while on the steps stood the gangbosses one by one the culprits were called up and examined  nothing definite could be extracted from them  they lied transparently but persistently and when caught in one lie explained it away with half a dozen others one boy complacently announced that he had found eleven sticks of dynamite on the beach  matapuus revolver found in the box of one kapu was explained away by that boy as having been given to him by lervumie lervumie called forth to testify said he had got it from noni noni had got it from sulefatoi sulefatoi from choka choka from ngava and ngava completed the circle by stating that it had been given to him by kapu kapu thus doubly damned calmly gave full details of how it had been given to him by lervumie and lervumie with equal wealth of detail told how he had received it from noni and from noni to sulefatoi it went on around the circle again  divers articles were traced indubitably to the houseboys each of whom steadfastly proclaimed his own innocence and cast doubts on his fellows the boy with the billiard ball said that he had never seen it in his life before and hazarded the suggestion that it had got into his box through some mysterious and occultly evil agency  so far as he was concerned it might have dropped down from heaven for all he knew how it got there  to the cooks and boatscrews of every vessel that had dropped anchor off berande in the past several years were ascribed the arrival of scores of the stolen articles and of the major portion of the ammunition  there was no tracing the truth in any of it though it was without doubt that the unidentified weapons and unfamiliar cartridges had come ashore off visiting craft  look at it sheldon said to joan  weve been sleeping over a volcano they ought to be whipped  no whip me gogoomy cried out from below  father belong me big fella chief  me whip too much trouble along you close up my word  what name you fella gogoomy sheldon shouted  i knock seven bells out of you  here you kwaque put m irons along that fella gogoomy  kwaque a strapping gangboss plucked gogoomy from out of his following and helped by the other gangbosses twisted his arms behind him and snapped on the heavy handcuffs  me finish along you close up you die altogether gogoomy with wrath distorted face threatened the bossboy  please no whipping joan said in a low voice  if whipping is necessary send them to tulagi and let the government do it  give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping  sheldon nodded and stood up facing the blacks  manonmie he called  manonmie stood forth and waited  you fella boy bad fella too much sheldon charged  you steal m plenty  you steal m one

fella no like malaita boys little bit  my word they give m you strong fella whipping  what you say  you take m one fella pound along me was the answer  and manonmie patently relieved stepped back while sheldon entered the fine in the plantation labour journal  boy after boy he called the offenders out and gave them their choice and boy by boy each one elected to pay the fine imposed  some fines were as low as several shillings while in the more serious cases such as thefts of guns and ammunition the fines were correspondingly heavy  gogoomy and his five tribesmen were fined three pounds each and at gogoomys guttural command they refused to pay  spose you go along tulagi sheldon warned him you catch m strong fella whipping and you stop along jail three fella year  mr burnett he look m along winchester look m along cartridge look m along revolver look m along black powder look m along dynamitemy word he cross too much he give you three fella year along jail  spose you no like

muttered at the same time scowling his hatred at sheldon and transferring half the scowl to joan and kwaque  me finish along you you catch m big fella trouble my word  father belong me big fella chief

 my word  there will be trouble with gogoomy yet sheldon said to joan as the bossboys marshalled their gangs and led them away to their work  keep an eye on him  be careful when you are riding alone on the plantation the loss of those winchesters and all that ammunition has hit him harder than your cuffing did  he is deadripe for mischief     chapter xxiigogoomy finishes along kwaque altogether   i wonder what has become of tudor  its two months since he disappeared into the bush and not a word of him after he left binu  joan lackland was sitting astride her horse by the bank of the balesuna where the sweet corn had been planted and sheldon who had come across from the house on foot was leaning against her horses shoulder  yes it is along time for no news to have trickled down he answered watching her keenly from under his hatbrim and wondering as to the measure of her anxiety for the adventurous goldhunter but tudor will come out all right  he did a thing at the start that i wouldnt have given him or any other man credit forpersuaded binu charley to go along with him  ill wager no other binu nigger has ever gone so far into the bush unless to be kaikaid  as for tudor  look look joan cried in a low voice pointing across the narrow stream to a slack eddy where a huge crocodile drifted like a log awash my  i wish i had my rifle  the crocodile leaving scarcely a ripple behind sank down and disappeared  a binu man was in early this morningfor medicine sheldon remarked it may have been that very brute that was responsible  a dozen of the binu women were out and the foremost one stepped right on a big crocodile  it was by the edge of the water and he tumbled her over and got her by the leg  all the other women got hold of her and pulled  and in the tug of war she lost her leg below the knee he said  i gave him a stock of antiseptics  shell pull through i fancy  ughthe filthy beasts joan gulped shudderingly  i hate them  i hate them  and yet you go diving among sharks sheldon chided  theyre only fishsharks  and as long as there are plenty of fish there is no danger  it is only when theyre famished that theyre liable to take a bite  sheldon shuddered inwardly at the swift vision that arose of the dainty flesh of her in a sharks manytoothed maw  i wish you wouldnt just the same he said slowly  you acknowledge there is a risk  but thats half the fun of it she cried  a trite platitude about his not caring to lose her was on his lips but he refrained from uttering it  another conclusion he had arrived at was that she was not to be nagged  continual or even occasional reminders of his feeling for her would constitute a tactical error of no mean dimensions  some for the book of verse some for the simple life and some for the sharks belly he laughed grimly then added just the same i wish i could swim as well as you  maybe it would beget confidence such as you have  do you know i think it would be nice to be married to a man such as you seem to be becoming she remarked with one of her abrupt changes that always astounded him  i should think you could be trained into a very good husbandyou know not one of the domineering kind but one who considered his wife was just as much an individual as himself and just as much a free agent  really you know i think you are improving  she laughed and rode away leaving him greatly cast down  if he had thought there had been one bit of coyness in her words one feminine flutter one womanly attempt at deliberate lure and encouragement he would have been elated  but he knew absolutely that it was the boy and not the woman who had so daringly spoken  joan rode on among the avenues of young cocoanutpalms saw a hornbill followed it in its erratic flights to the high forest on the edge of the plantation heard the cooing of wild pigeons and located them in the deeper woods followed the fresh trail of a wild pig for a distance circled back and took the narrow path for the bungalow that ran through twenty acres of uncleared cane  the grass was waisthigh and higher and as she rode along she remembered that gogoomy was one of a gang of boys that had been detailed to the grasscutting  she came to where they had been at work but saw no signs of them  her unshod horse made no sound on the soft sandy footing and a little further on she heard voices proceeding from out of the grass  she reined in and listened  it was gogoomy talking and as she listened she gripped her bridlerein tightly and a wave of anger passed over her  dog he stop m along house nighttime he walk about gogoomy was saying perforce in bechedemer english because he was talking to others beside his own tribesmen  you fella boy catch m one fella pig put m kaikai belong him along big fella fishhook  spose dog he walk about catch m kaikai you fella boy catch m dog allee same one shark  dog he finish close up  big fella marster sleep along big fella house  white mary sleep along pickaninny house  one fella adamu he

plenty knifefee plenty porpoise teeth plenty tobacco plenty calicomy word too much plenty everything we take m along whaleboat washee 5 like hell sun he come up we long way too much  me catch m pig sun he go down spoke up one whose thin falsetto voice joan recognized as belonging to cosse one of gogoomys tribesmen  me catch m dog said another  and me catch m white fella mary gogoomy cried triumphantly  me catch m kwaque he die along him damn quick  this much joan heard of the plan to murder and then her rising wrath proved too much for her discretion  she spurred her horse into the grass crying  what name you fella boy eh  what name  they arose scrambling and scattering and to her surprise she saw there were a dozen of them  as she looked in their glowering faces and noted the heavy twofoot hacking caneknives in their hands she became suddenly aware of the rashness of her act  if only she had had her revolver or a rifle all would have been well  but she had carelessly ventured out unarmed and she followed the glance of gogoomy to her waist and saw the pleased flash in his eyes as he perceived the absence of the dreadful mankilling revolver  the first article in the solomon islands code for white men was never to show fear before a native and joan tried to carry off the situation in cavalier fashion  too much talk along you fella boy she said severely  too much talk too little work  savvee  gogoomy made no reply but apparently shifting weight he slid one foot forward  the other boys spread fanwise about her were also sliding forward the cruel caneknives in their hands advertising their intention  you cut m grass she commanded imperatively  but gogoomy slid his other foot forward  she measured the distance with her eye  it would be impossible to whirl her horse around and get away she would be chopped down from behind  and in that tense moment the faces of all of them were imprinted on her mind in an unforgettable pictureone of them an old man with torn and distended earlobes that fell to his chest another with the broad flattened nose of africa and with withered eyes so buried under frowning brows that nothing but the sickly yellowishlooking whites could be seen a third thicklipped and bearded with kinky whiskers and gogoomyshe had never realized before how handsome gogoomy was in his mutinous and obstinate wildanimal way  there was a primitive aristocraticness about him that his fellows lacked  the lines of his figure were more rounded than theirs the skin smooth well oiled and free from disease  on his chest suspended from a single string of porpoiseteeth around his throat hung a big crescent carved out of opalescent pearlshell  a row of pure white cowrie shells banded his brow  from his hair drooped a long lone feather  above the swelling calf of one leg he wore as a garter a single string of white beads  the effect was dandyish in the extreme  a narrow geestring completed his costume  another man she saw old and shrivelled with puckered forehead and a puckered face that trembled and worked with animal passion as in the past she had noticed the faces of monkeys tremble and work  gogoomy she said sharply you no cut m grass my word i bang m head belong you  his expression became a trifle more disdainful but he did not answer instead he stole a glance to right and left to mark how his fellows were closing about her  at the same moment he casually slipped his foot forward through the grass for a matter of several inches  joan was keenly aware of the desperateness of the situation  the only way out was through  she lifted her ridingwhip threateningly and at the same moment drove in both spurs with her heels rushing the startled horse straight at gogoomy  it all happened in an instant  every cane knife was lifted and every boy save gogoomy leaped for her  he swerved aside to avoid the horse at the same time swinging his caneknife in a slicing blow that would have cut her in twain  she leaned forward under the flying steel which cut through her ridingskirt through the edge of the saddle through the saddle cloth and even slightly into the horse itself  her right hand still raised came down the thin whip whishing through the air  she saw the white cooked mark of the weal clear across the sullen handsome face and still what was practically in the same instant she saw the man with the puckered face overridden go down before her and she heard his snarling and grimacing chatterfor all the world like an angry monkey  then she was free and away heading the horse at top speed for the house  out of her seatraining she was able to appreciate sheldons executiveness when she burst in on him with her news  springing from the steamerchair in which he had been lounging while waiting for breakfast he clapped his hands for the houseboys and while listening to her he was buckling on his cartridgebelt and running the mechanism of his automatic pistol  ornfiri he snapped out his orders you fella ring big fella bell strong fella plenty  you finish m bell you put m saddle on horse viaburi you go quick house belong seelee he stop tell m plenty black fella run awayten fella two fella black fella boy  he scribbled a note and handed it to lalaperu  lalaperu you go quick house belong white fella marster boucher  that will head them back from the coast on both sides he explained to joan  and old seelee will turn his whole village loose on their track as well  in response to the summons of the big bell joans tahitians were the first to arrive by their glistening bodies and panting chests showing that they had run all the way  some of the farthestplaced gangs would be nearly an hour in arriving  sheldon proceeded to arm joans sailors and deal out ammunition and handcuffs  adamu adam with loaded rifle he placed on guard over the whaleboats  noa noah aided by matapuu were instructed to take charge of the workinggangs as fast as they came in to keep them amused and to guard against their being stampeded into making a break themselves  the five other tahitians were to follow joan and sheldon on foot  im glad we unearthed that arsenal the other day sheldon remarked as they rode out of the compound gate  a hundred yards away they encountered one of the clearing gangs coming in  it was kwaques gang but sheldon looked in vain for him  what name that fella kwaque he no stop along you he demanded  a babel of excited voices attempted an answer  shut m mouth belong you altogether sheldon commanded  he spoke roughly living up to the role of the white man who must always be strong and dominant  here you fella babatani you talk m mouth belong you  babatani stepped forward in all the pride of one singled out from among his fellows  gogoomy he finish along kwaque altogether was babatanis explanation he take m head blong him run like hell  in brief words and with paucity of imagination he described the murder and sheldon and joan rode on  in the grass where joan had been attacked they found the little shrivelled man still chattering and grimacing whom joan had ridden down  the mare had plunged on his ankle completely crushing it and a hundred yards crawl had convinced him of the futility of escape  to the last clearinggang from the farthest edge of the plantation was given the task of carrying him in to the house  a mile farther on where the runaways trail led straight toward the bush they encountered the body of kwaque  the head had been hacked off and was missing and sheldon took it on faith that the body was kwaques he had evidently put up a fight for a bloody trail led away from the body  once they were well into the thick bush the horses had to be abandoned papehara was left in charge of them while joan and sheldon and the remaining tahitians pushed ahead on foot  the way led down through a swampy hollow which was overflowed by the berande river on occasion and where the red trail of the murderers was crossed by a crocodiles trail they had apparently caught the creature asleep in the sun and desisted long enough from their flight to hack him to pieces  here the wounded man had sat down and waited until they were ready to go on  an hour later following along a wildpig trail sheldon suddenly halted the bloody tracks had ceased  the tahitians cast out in the bush on either side and a cry from utami apprised them of a find  joan waited till sheldon came back  its mauko he said  kwaque did for him and he crawled in there and died  thats two accounted for  there are ten more  dont you think youve got enough of it  she nodded  it isnt nice she said  ill go back and wait for you with the horses  but you cant go alone  take two of the men  then ill go on she said  it would be foolish to weaken the pursuit and i am certainly not tired  the trail bent to the right as though the runaways had changed their mind and headed for the balesuna  but the trail still continued to bend to the right till it promised to make a loop and the point of intersection seemed to be the edge of the plantation where the horses had been left crossing one of the quiet jungle spaces where naught moved but a velvety twelveinch butterfly they heard the sound of shots  eight joan counted  it was only one gun  it must be papehara  they hurried on but when they reached the spot they were in doubt  the two horses stood quietly tethered and papehara squatted on his hams was having a peaceful smoke  advancing toward him sheldon tripped on a body that lay in the grass and as he saved himself from falling his eyes lighted on a second  joan recognized this one  it was cosse one of gogoomys tribesmen the one who had promised to catch at sunset the pig that was to have baited the hook for satan  no luck missie was papeharas greeting accompanied by a disconsolate shake of the head  catch only two boy  i have good shot at gogoomy only i miss  but you killed them joan chided  you must catch them alive  the tahitian smiled  how he queried  i am have a smoke  i think about tahiti and breadfruit and jolly good time at bora bora  quick just like that ten boy he run out of bush for me  each boy have long knife  gogoomy have long knife one hand and kwaques head in other hand  i no stop to catch m alive  i shoot like hell  how you catch m alive ten boy ten long knife and kwaques head  the scattered paths of the different boys where they broke back after the disastrous attempt to rush the tahitian soon led together  they traced it to the berande which the runaways had crossed with the clear intention of burying themselves in the huge mangrove swamp that lay beyond  there is no use our going any farther sheldon said  seelee will turn out his village and hunt them out of that  theyll never get past him all we can do is to guard the coast and keep them from breaking back on the plantation and running amuck  ah i thought so  against the jungle gloom of the farther shore coming from down stream a small canoe glided  so silently did it move that it was more like an apparition  three naked blacks dipped with noiseless paddles longhafted slender bonebarbed throwingspears lay along the gunwale of the canoe while a quiverful of arrows hung on each mans back  the eyes of the manhunters missed nothing  they had seen sheldon and joan first but they gave no sign  where gogoomy and his followers had emerged from the river the canoe abruptly stopped then turned and disappeared into the deeper mangrove gloom  a second and a third canoe came around the bend from below glided ghostlike to the crossing of the runaways and vanished in the mangroves  i hope there wont be any more killing joan said as they turned their horses homeward  i dont think so sheldon assured her  my understanding with old seelee is that he is paid only for live boys so he is very careful     chapter xxiiia message from the bush   never had runaways from berande been more zealously hunted  the deeds of gogoomy and his fellows had been a bad example for the one hundred and fifty new recruits  murder had been planned a gangboss had been killed and the murderers had broken their contracts by fleeing to the bush  sheldon saw how imperative it was to teach his newcaught cannibals that bad examples were disastrous things to pattern after and he urged seelee on night and day while with the tahitians he practically lived in the bush leaving joan in charge of the plantation  to the north boucher did good work twice turning the fugitives back when they attempted to gain the coast  one by one the boys were captured  in the first mandrive through the mangrove swamp seelee caught two  circling around to the north a third was wounded in the thigh by boucher and this one dragging behind in the chase was later gathered in by seelees hunters  the three captives heavily ironed were exposed each day in the compound as good examples of what happened to bad examples all for the edification of the seven score and ten halfwild poongapoonga men  then the minerva running past for tulagi was signalled to send a boat and the three prisoners were carried away to prison to await trial  five were still at large but escape was impossible  they could not get down to the coast nor dared they venture too far inland for fear of the wild bushmen  then one of the five came in voluntarily and gave himself up and sheldon learned that gogoomy and two others were all that were at large  there should have been a fourth but according to the man who had given himself up the fourth man had been killed and eaten  it had been fear of a similar fate that had driven him in  he was a malu man from northwestern malaita as likewise had been the one that was eaten gogoomys two other companions were from port adams  as for himself the black declared his preference for government trial and punishment to being eaten by his companions in the bush  close up gogoomy kaikai me he said  my word me no like boy kai kai me  three days later sheldon caught one of the boys helpless from swamp fever and unable to fight or run away  on the same day seelee caught the second boy in similar condition  gogoomy alone remained at large and as the pursuit closed in on him he conquered his fear of the bushmen and headed straight in for the mountainous backbone of the island  sheldon with four tahitians and seelee with thirty of his hunters followed gogoomys trail a dozen miles into the open grasslands and then seelee and his people lost heart  he confessed that neither he nor any of his tribe had ever ventured so far inland before and he narrated for sheldons benefit most horrible tales of the horrible bushmen  in the old days he said they had crossed the grasslands and attacked the saltwater natives but since the coming of the white men to the coast they had remained in their interior fastnesses and no saltwater native had ever seen them again  gogoomy he finish along them fella bushmen he assured sheldon  my word he finish close up kaikai altogether  so the expedition turned back  nothing could persuade the coast natives to venture farther and sheldon with his four tahitians knew that it was madness to go on alone  so he stood waistdeep in the grass and looked regretfully across the rolling savannah and the softswelling foothills to the lions head a massive peak of rock that upreared into the azure from the midmost centre of guadalcanar a landmark used for bearings by every coasting mariner a mountain as yet untrod by the foot of a white man  that night after dinner sheldon and joan were playing billiards when satan barked in the compound and lalaperu sent to see brought back a tired and travelstained native who wanted to talk with the big fella white marster  it was only the mans insistence that procured him admittance at such an hour  sheldon went out on the veranda to see him and at first glance at the gaunt features and wasted body of the man knew that his errand was likely to prove important  nevertheless sheldon demanded roughly  what name you come along house belong me sun he go down  me charley the man muttered apologetically and wearily  me stop along binu  ah binu charley eh  well what name you talk along me  what place big fella marster along white man he stop  joan and sheldon together listened to the tale binu charley had brought he described tudors expedition up the balesuna the dragging of the boats up the rapids the passage up the river where it threaded the grass lands the innumerable washings of gravel by the white men in search of gold the first rolling foothills the mantraps of spearstaked pits in the jungle trails the first meeting with the bushmen who had never seen tobacco and knew not the virtues of smoking their friendliness the deeper penetration of the interior around the flanks of the lions head the bushsores and the fevers of the white men and their madness in trusting the bushmen  allee time i talk along white fella marster he said  me talk that fella bushman he look m eye belong him  he savvee too much  spose musket he stop along you that fella bushman he too much good friend along you  allee time he look sharp eye belong him  spose musket he no stop along you my word that fella bushman he chop m off head belong you  he kaikai you altogether  but the patience of the bushmen had exceeded that of the white men  the weeks had gone by and no overt acts had been attempted  the bushmen swarmed in the camp in increasing numbers and they were always making presents of yams and taro of pig and fowl and of wild fruits and vegetables  whenever the goldhunters moved their camp the bushmen volunteered to carry the luggage  and the white men waxed ever more careless  they grew weary prospecting and at the same time carrying their rifles and the heavy cartridgebelts and the practice began of leaving their weapons behind them in camp  i tell m plenty fella white marster look sharp eye belong him  and plenty fella white marster make m big laugh along me say binu charley allee same pickaninnymy word they speak along me allee same pickaninny  came the morning when binu charley noticed that the women and children had disappeared  tudor at the time was lying in a stupor with fever in a late camp five miles away the main camp having moved on those five miles in order to prospect an outcrop of likely quartz  binu charley was midway between the two camps when the absence of the women and children struck him as suspicious  my word he said me tink like hell  him black mary him pickaninny walk about long way big bit  what name  me savvee too much trouble close up  me fright like hell  me run  my word me run  tudor quite unconscious was slung across his shoulder and carried a mile down the trail  here hiding new trail binu charley had carried him for a quarter of a mile into the heart of the deepest jungle and hidden him in a big banyan tree  returning to try to save the rifles and personal outfit binu charley had seen a party of bushmen trotting down the trail and had hidden in the bush  here and from the direction of the main camp he had heard two rifle shots  and that was all  he had never seen the white men again nor had he ventured near their old camp he had gone back to tudor and hidden with him for a week living on wild fruits and the few pigeons and cockatoos he had been able to shoot with bow and arrow  then he had journeyed down to berande to bring the news tudor he said was very sick lying unconscious for days at a time and when in his right mind too weak to help himself  what name you no kill m that big fella marster joan demanded  he have m good fella musket plenty calico plenty tobacco plenty knife fee and two fella pickaninny musket shoot quick bangbangbangjust like that  the black smiled cunningly  me savvee too much  spose me kill m big fella marster bimeby plenty white fella marster walk about binu cross like hell  what name this fellow musket those plenty fella white marster talk m along me  my word binu charley finish altogether  spose me kill m him no good along me  plenty white fella marster cross along me  spose me no kill m him bimeby he give me plenty tobacco plenty calico plenty everything too much  there is only the one thing to do sheldon said to joan  she drummed with her hand and waited while binu charley gazed wearily at her with unblinking eyes  ill start the first thing in the morning sheldon said  well start she corrected  i can get twice as much out of my tahitians as you can and besides one white should never be alone under such circumstances  he shrugged his shoulders in token not of consent but of surrender knowing the uselessness of attempting to argue the question with her and consoling himself with the reflection that heaven alone knew what adventures she was liable to engage in if left alone on berande for a week  he clapped his hands and for the next quarter of an hour the houseboys were kept busy carrying messages to the barracks  a man was sent to balesuna village to command old seelees immediate presence  a boatscrew was started in a whaleboat with word for boucher to come down  ammunition was issued to the tahitians and the storeroom overhauled for a few days tinned provisions  viaburi turned yellow when told that he was to accompany the expedition and to everybodys surprise lalaperu volunteered to take his place  seelee arrived proud in his importance that the great master of berande should summon him in the nighttime for council and firm in his refusal to step one inch within the dread domain of the bushmen  as he said if his opinion had been asked when the goldhunters started he would have foretold their disastrous end  there was only one thing that happened to any one who ventured into the bushmens territory and that was that he was eaten  and he would further say without being asked that if sheldon went up into the bush he would be eaten too  sheldon sent for a gangboss and told him to bring ten of the biggest best and strongest poongapoonga men  not saltwater boys sheldon cautioned but bush boysleg belong him strong fella leg  boy no savvee musket no good  you bring m boy shoot musket strong fella  they were ten picked men that filed up on the veranda and stood in the glare of the lanterns  their heavy muscular legs advertised that they were bushmen  each claimed long experience in bushfighting most of them showed scars of bullet or spearthrust in proof and all were wild for a chance to break the humdrum monotony of plantation labour by going on a killing expedition  killing was their natural vocation not wood cutting and while they would not have ventured the guadalcanar bush alone with a white man like sheldon behind them and a white mary such as they knew joan to be they could expect a safe and delightful time besides the great master had told them that the eight gigantic tahitians were going along  the poongapoonga volunteers stood with glistening eyes and grinning faces naked save for their loincloths and barbarously ornamented  each wore a flat turtleshell ring suspended through his nose and each carried a clay pipe in an earhole or thrust inside a beaded biceps armlet  a pair of magnificent boar tusks graced the chest of one  on the chest of another hung a huge disc of polished fossil clamshell  plenty strong fella fight sheldon warned them in conclusion  they grinned and shifted delightedly  spose bushmen kaikai along you he queried  no fear answered their spokesman one koogoo a strapping thicklipped ethiopianlooking man  spose poongapoonga boy kaikai bushboy  sheldon shook his head laughing and dismissed them and went to overhaul the dunnageroom for a small shelter tent for joans use     chapter xxivin the bush   it was quite a formidable expedition that departed from berande at break of day next morning in a fleet of canoes and dinghies  there were joan and sheldon with binu charley and lalaperu the eight tahitians and the ten poongapoonga men each proud in the possession of a bright and shining modern rifle  in addition there were two of the plantation boatscrews of six men each  these however were to go no farther than carli where water transportation ceased and where they were to wait with the boats  boucher remained behind in charge of berande  by eleven in the morning the expedition arrived at binu a cluster of twenty houses on the river bank  and from here thirty odd binu men accompanied them armed with spears and arrows chattering and grimacing with delight at the warlike array  the long quiet stretches of river gave way to swifter water and progress was slower and more dogged  the balesuna grew shallow as well and oftener were the loaded boats bumped along and halflifted over the bottom  in places timberfalls blocked the passage of the narrow stream and the boats and canoes were portaged around  night brought them to carli and they had the satisfaction of knowing that they had accomplished in one day what had required two days for tudors expedition  here at carli next morning halfway through the grasslands the boats crews were left and with them the horde of binu men the boldest of which held on for a bare mile and then ran scampering back  binu charley however was at the fore and led the way onward into the rolling foothills following the trail made by tudor and his men weeks before  that night they camped well into the hills and deep in the tropic jungle  the third day found them on the runways of the bushmennarrow paths that compelled single file and that turned and twisted with endless convolutions through the dense undergrowth  for the most part it was a silent forest lush and dank where only occasionally a woodpigeon cooed or snowwhite cockatoos laughed harshly in laborious flight  here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred  binu charley had dropped behind for a time and koogoo the poongapoonga man who had boasted that he would eat the bushmen was in the lead  joan and sheldon heard the twanging thrum and saw koogoo throw out his arms at the same time dropping his rifle stumble forward and sink down on his hands and knees  between his naked shoulders low down and to the left appeared the bonebarbed head of an arrow  he had been shot through and through cocked rifles swept the bush with nervous apprehension  but there was no rustle no movement nothing but the humid oppressive silence  bushmen he no stop binu charley called out the sound of his voice startling more than one of them  allee same damn funny business  that fella koogoo no look m eye belong him  he no savvee little bit  koogoos arms had crumpled under him and he lay quivering where he had fallen  even as binu charley came to the front the stricken blacks breath passed from him and with a final convulsive stir he lay still  right through the heart sheldon said straightening up from the stooping examination  it must have been a trap of some sort  he noticed joans white tense face and the wide eyes with which she stared at the wreck of what had been a man the minute before  i recruited that boy myself she said in a whisper  he came down out of the bush at poongapoonga and right on board the martha and offered himself  and i was proud  he was my very first recruit  my word  look m that fella binu charley interrupted brushing aside the leafy wall of the runway and exposing a bow so massive that no one bushman could have bent it  the binu man traced out the mechanics of the trap and exposed the hidden fibre in the tangled undergrowth that at contact with koogoos foot had released the taut bow  they were deep in the primeval forest  a dim twilight prevailed for no random shaft of sunlight broke through the thick roof of leaves and creepers overhead  the tahitians were plainly awed by the silence and gloom and mystery of the place and happening but they showed themselves doggedly unafraid and were for pushing on  the poongapoonga men on the contrary were not awed  they were bushmen themselves and they were used to this silent warfare though the devices were different from those employed by them in their own bush  most awed of all were joan and sheldon but being whites they were not supposed to be subject to such commonplace emotions and their task was to carry the situation off with careless bravado as befitted big fella marsters of the dominant breed  binu charley took the lead as they pushed on and trap after trap yielded its secret lurkingplace to his keen scrutiny  the way was beset with a thousand annoyances chiefest among which were thorns cunningly concealed that penetrated the bare feet of the invaders  once during the afternoon binu charley barely missed being impaled in a staked pit that undermined the trail  there were times when all stood still and waited for half an hour or more while binu charley prospected suspicious parts of the trail  sometimes he was compelled to leave the trail and creep and climb through the jungle so as to approach the mantraps from behind and on one occasion in spite of his precaution a springbow was discharged the flying arrow barely clipping the shoulder of one of the waiting poongapoonga boys  where a slight runway entered the main one sheldon paused and asked binu charley if he knew where it led  plenty bush fella garden he stop along there short way little bit was the answer  all right you like m go look m along  walk m easy he cautioned a few minutes later  close up that fella garden  spose some bush fella he stop we catch m  creeping ahead and peering into the clearing for a moment binu charley beckoned sheldon to come on cautiously  joan crouched beside him and together they peeped out  the cleared space was fully half an acre in extent and carefully fenced against the wild pigs  pawpaw and banana trees were just ripening their fruit while beneath grew sweet potatoes and yams  on one edge of the clearing was a small grass house opensided a mere rainshelter  in front of it crouched on his hams before a fire was a gaunt and bearded bushman  the fire seemed to smoke excessively and in the thick of the smoke a round dark object hung suspended  the bushman seemed absorbed in contemplation of this object  warning them not to shoot unless the man was successfully escaping sheldon beckoned the poongapoonga men forward  joan smiled appreciatively to sheldon  it was headhunters against headhunters  the blacks trod noiselessly to their stations which were arranged so that they could spring simultaneously into the open  their faces were keen and serious their eyes eloquent with the ecstasy of living that was upon themfor this was living this game of life and death and to them it was the only game a man should play withal they played it in low and cowardly ways killing from behind in the dim forest gloom and rarely coming out into the open  sheldon whispered the word and the ten runners leaped forwardfor binu charley ran with them  the bushmans keen ears warned him and he sprang to his feet bow and arrow in hand the arrow fixed in the notch and the bow bending as he sprang  the man he let drive at dodged the arrow and before he could shoot another his enemies were upon him  he was rolled over and over and dragged to his feet disarmed and helpless  why hes an ancient babylonian joan cried regarding him  hes an assyrian a phoenician  look at that straight nose that narrow face those high cheekbonesand that slanting oval forehead and the beard and the eyes too  and the snaky locks sheldon laughed  the bushman was in mortal fear led by all his training to expect nothing less than death yet he did not cower away from them  instead he returned their looks with lean selfsufficiency and finally centred his gaze upon joan the first white woman he had ever seen  my word bush fella kaikai along that fella boy binu charley remarked  so stolid was his manner of utterance that joan turned carelessly to see what had attracted his attention and found herself face to face with gogoomy  at least it was the head of gogoomythe dark object they had seen hanging in the smoke  it was freshthe smokecuring had just begunand save for the closed eyes all the sullen handsomeness and animal virility of the boy as joan had known it was still to be seen in the monstrous thing that twisted and dangled in the eddying smoke  nor was joans horror lessened by the conduct of the poongapoonga boys on the instant they recognized the head and on the instant rose their wild hearty laughter as they explained to one another in shrill falsetto voices  gogoomys end was a joke  he had been foiled in his attempt to escape  he had played the game and lost  and what greater joke could there be than that the bushmen should have eaten him  it was the funniest incident that had come under their notice in many a day  and to them there was certainly nothing unusual nor bizarre in the event gogoomy had completed the lifecycle of the bushman  he had taken heads and now his own head had been taken  he had eaten men and now he had been eaten by men  the poongapoonga mens laughter died down and they regarded the spectacle with glittering eyes and gluttonous expressions  the tahitians on the other hand were shocked and adamu adam was shaking his head slowly and grunting forth his disgust  joan was angry  her face was white but in each cheek was a vivid spray of red  disgust had been displaced by wrath and her mood was clearly vengeful  sheldon laughed  its nothing to be angry over he said  you mustnt forget that he hacked off kwaques head and that he ate one of his own comrades that ran away with him  besides he was born to it  he has but been eaten out of the same trough from which he himself has eaten  joan looked at him with lips that trembled on the verge of speech  and dont forget sheldon added that he is the son of a chief and that as sure as fate his port adams tribesmen will take a white mans head in payment  it is all so ghastly ridiculous joan finally said  anderromantic he suggested slyly  she did not answer and turned away but sheldon knew that the shaft had gone home  that fella boy he sick belly belong him walk about binu charley said pointing to the poongapoonga man whose shoulder had been scratched by the arrow an hour before  the boy was sitting down and groaning his arms clasping his bent knees his head drooped forward and rolling painfully back and forth  for fear of poison sheldon had immediately scarified the wound and injected permanganate of potash but in spite of the precaution the shoulder was swelling rapidly  well take him on to where tudor is lying joan said  the walking will help to keep up his circulation and scatter the poison  adamu adam you take hold that boy  maybe he will want to sleep  shake him up  if he sleep he die  the advance was more rapid now for binu charley placed the captive bushman in front of him and made him clear the runway of traps  once at a sharp turn where a mans shoulder would unavoidably brush against a screen of leaves the bushman displayed great caution as he spread the leaves aside and exposed the head of a sharppointed spear so set that the casual passerby would receive at the least a nasty scratch  my word said binu charley that fella spear allee same devildevil  he took the spear and was examining it when suddenly he made as if to stick it into the bushman  it was a bit of simulated playfulness but the bushman sprang back in evident fright  poisoned the weapon was beyond any doubt and thereafter binu charley carried it threateningly at the prisoners back  the sun sinking behind a lofty western peak brought on an early but lingering twilight and the expedition plodded on through the evil forestthe place of mystery and fear of death swift and silent and horrible of brutish appetite and degraded instinct of human life that still wallowed in the primeval slime of savagery degenerate and abysmal no slightest breezes blew in the gloomy silence and the air was stale and humid and suffocating  the sweat poured unceasingly from their bodies and in their nostrils was the heavy smell of rotting vegetation and of black earth that was acrawl with fecund life  they turned aside from the runway at a place indicated by binu charley and sometimes crawling on hands and knees through the damp black muck at other times creeping and climbing through the tangled undergrowth a dozen feet from the ground they came to an immense banyan tree half an acre in extent that made in the innermost heart of the jungle a denser jungle of its own  from out of its black depths came the voice of a man singing in a cracked eerie voice  my word that big fella marster he no die  the singing stopped and the voice faint and weak called out a hello joan answered and then the voice explained  im not wandering  i was just singing to keep my spirits up  have you got anything to eat  a few minutes saw the rescued man lying among blankets while fires were building water was being carried joans tent was going up and lalaperu was overhauling the packs and opening tins of provisions  tudor having pulled through the fever and started to mend was still frightfully weak and very much starved  so badly swollen was he from mosquitobites that his face was unrecognizable and the acceptance of his identity was largely a matter of faith  joan had her own ointments along and she prefaced their application by fomenting his swollen features with hot cloths  sheldon with an eye to the camp and the preparations for the night looked on and felt the pangs of jealousy at every contact of her hands with tudors face and body  somehow engaged in their healing ministrations they no longer seemed to him boys hands the hands of joan who had gazed at gogoomys head with pale cheeks sprayed with angry flame  the hands were now a womans hands and sheldon grinned to himself as his fancy suggested that some night he must lie outside the mosquitonetting in order to have joan apply soothing fomentations in the morning     chapter xxvthe headhunters   the mornings action had been settled the night before  tudor was to stay behind in his banyan refuge and gather strength while the expedition proceeded  on the far chance that they might rescue even one solitary survivor of tudors party joan was fixed in her determination to push on and neither sheldon nor tudor could persuade her to remain quietly at the banyan tree while sheldon went on and searched  with tudor adamu adam and arahu were to stop as guards the latter tahitian being selected to remain because of a bad foot which had been brought about by stepping on one of the thorns concealed by the bushmen  it was evidently a slow poison and not too strong that the bushmen used for the wounded poonga poonga man was still alive and though his swollen shoulder was enormous the inflammation had already begun to go down  he too remained with tudor  binu charley led the way by proxy however for by means of the poisoned spear he drove the captive bushman ahead  the runway still ran through the dank and rotten jungle and they knew no villages would be encountered till rising ground was gained  they plodded on panting and sweating in the humid stagnant air  they were immersed in a sea of wanton prodigal vegetation  all about them the hugerooted trees blocked their footing while coiled and knotted climbers of the girth of a mans arm were thrown from lofty branch to lofty branch or hung in tangled masses like so many monstrous snakes  lushstalked plants largerleaved than the body of a man exuded a sweaty moisture from all their surfaces  here and there banyan trees like rocky islands shouldered aside the streaming riot of vegetation between their crowded columns showing portals and passages wherein all daylight was lost and only midnight gloom remained  treeferns and mosses and a myriad other parasitic forms jostled with gaycoloured fungoid growths for room to live and the very atmosphere itself seemed to afford clinging space to airy fairy creepers light and delicate as gemdust tremulous with microscopic blooms  palegolden and vermilion orchids flaunted their unhealthy blossoms in the golden dripping sunshine that filtered through the matted roof  it was the mysterious evil forest a charnel house of silence wherein naught moved save strange tiny birdsthe strangeness of them making the mystery more profound for they flitted on noiseless wings emitting neither song nor chirp and they were mottled with morbid colours having all the seeming of orchids flying blossoms of sickness and decay  he was caught by surprise fifteen feet in the air above the path in the forks of a manybranched tree  all saw him as he dropped like a shadow naked as on his natal morn landing springily on his bent knees and like a shadow leaping along the runway  it was hard for them to realize that it was a man for he seemed a weird jungle spirit a goblin of the forest  only binu charley was not perturbed  he flung his poisoned spear over the head of the captive at the flitting form  it was a mighty cast well intended but the shadow leaping received the spear harmlessly between the legs and tripping upon it was flung sprawling before he could get away binu charley was upon him clutching him by his snowwhite hair  he was only a young man and a dandy at that his face blackened with charcoal his hair whitened with woodashes with the freshly severed tail of a wild pig thrust through his perforated nose and two more thrust through his ears  his only other ornament was a necklace of human fingerbones  at sight of their other prisoner he chattered in a high querulous falsetto with puckered brows and troubled wildanimal eyes  he was disposed of along the middle of the line one of the poongapoonga men leading him at the end of a length of barkrope  the trail began to rise out of the jungle dipping at times into festering hollows of unwholesome vegetation but rising more and more over swelling unseen hillslopes or climbing steep hogbacks and rocky hummocks where the forest thinned and blue patches of sky appeared overhead  close up he stop binu charley warned them in a whisper  even as he spoke from high overhead came the deep resonant boom of a village drum  but the beat was slow there was no panic in the sound they were directly beneath the village and they could hear the crowing of roosters two womens voices raised in brief dispute and once the crying of a child  the runway now became a deeply worn path rising so steeply that several times the party paused for breath  the path never widened and in places the feet and the rains of generations had scoured it till it was sunken twenty feet beneath the surface  one man with a rifle could hold it against a thousand sheldon whispered to joan  and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows  they came out on the village situated on a small upland plateau grass covered and with only occasional trees  there was a wild chorus of warning cries from the women who scurried out of the grass houses and like frightened quail dived over the opposite edge of the clearing gathering up their babies and children as they ran  at the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders  at sheldons command the tahitians and poongapoonga men got into action with their rifles  the spears and arrows ceased the last bushman disappeared and the fight was over almost as soon as it had begun  on their own side no one had been hurt while half a dozen bushmen had been killed  these alone remained the wounded having been carried off  the tahitians and poongapoonga men had warmed up and were for pursuit but this sheldon would not permit  to his pleased surprise joan backed him up in the decision for glancing at her once during the firing he had seen her white face like a glittering sword in its fighting intensity the nostrils dilated the eyes bright and steady and shining  poor brutes she said  they act only according to their natures  to eat their kind and take heads is good morality for them  but they should be taught not to take white mens heads sheldon argued  she nodded approval and said if we find one head well burn the village  hey you charley  what fella place head he stop  spose he stop along devildevil house was the answer  that big fella house he devildevil  it was the largest house in the village ambitiously ornamented with fancyplaited mats and kingposts carved into obscene and monstrous forms halfhuman and halfanimal  into it they went in the obscure light stumbling across the sleepinglogs of the village bachelors and knocking their heads against strings of weird votiveofferings dried and shrivelled that hung from the roofbeams  on either side were rude gods some grotesquely carved others no more than shapeless logs swathed in rotten and indescribably filthy matting  the air was mouldy and heavy with decay while strings of fishtails and of halfcleaned dog and crocodile skulls did not add to the wholesomeness of the place  in the centre crouched before a slowsmoking fire in the littered ashes of a thousand fires was an old man who blinked apathetically at the invaders  he was extremely oldso old that his withered skin hung about him in loose folds and did not look like skin  his hands were bony claws his emaciated face a sheer deathshead  his task it seemed was to tend the fire and while he blinked at them he added to it a handful of dead and mouldy wood  and hung in the smoke they found the object of their search  joan turned and stumbled out hastily deathly sick reeling into the sunshine and clutching at the air for support  see if all are there she called back faintly and tottered aimlessly on for a few steps breathing the air in great draughts and trying to forget the sight she had seen  upon sheldon fell the unpleasant task of tallying the heads  they were all there nine of them white mens heads the faces of which he had been familiar with when their owners had camped in berande compound and set up the polingboats  binu charley hugely interested lent a hand turning the heads around for identification noting the hatchetstrokes and remarking the distorted expressions  the poongapoonga men gloated as usual and as usual the tahitians were shocked and angry several of them cursing and muttering in undertones  so angry was matapuu that he strode suddenly over to the firetender and kicked him in the ribs whereupon the old savage emitted an appalling squeal piglike in its wildanimal fear and fell face downward in the ashes and lay quivering in momentary expectation of death  other heads thoroughly sundried and smokecured were found in abundance but with two exceptions they were the heads of blacks  so this was the manner of hunting that went on in the dark and evil forest sheldon thought as he regarded them  the atmosphere of the place was sickening yet he could not forbear to pause before one of binu charleys finds  me savvee black mary me savvee white mary quoth binu charley  me no savvee that fella mary  what name belong him  sheldon looked  ancient and withered blackened by many years of the smoke of the devildevil house nevertheless the shrunken mummylike face was unmistakably chinese  how it had come there was the mystery  it was a womans head and he had never heard of a chinese woman in the history of the solomons  from the ears hung twoinchlong earrings and at sheldons direction the binu man rubbed away the accretions of smoke and dirt and from under his fingers appeared the polished green of jade the sheen of pearl and the warm red of oriental gold  the other head equally ancient was a white mans as the heavy blond moustache twisted and askew on the shrivelled upper lip gave sufficient advertisement and sheldon wondered what forgotten bechedemer fisherman or sandalwood trader had gone to furnish that ghastly trophy  telling binu charley to remove the earrings and directing the poonga poonga men to carry out the old firetender sheldon cleared the devil devil house and set fire to it  soon every house was blazing merrily while the ancient firetender sat upright in the sunshine blinking at the destruction of his village  from the heights above where were evidently other villages came the booming of drums and a wild blowing of warconchs but sheldon had dared all he cared to with his small following  besides his mission was accomplished  every member of tudors expedition was accounted for and it was a long dark way out of the headhunters country  releasing their two prisoners who leaped away like startled deer they plunged down the steep path into the steaming jungle  joan still shocked by what she had seen walked on in front of sheldon subdued and silent  at the end of half an hour she turned to him with a wan smile and said  i dont think i care to visit the headhunters any more  its adventure i know but there is such a thing as having too much of a good thing  riding around the plantation will henceforth be good enough for me or perhaps salving another martha but the bushmen of guadalcanar need never worry for fear that i shall visit them again  i shall have nightmares for months to come i know i shall  ughthe horrid beasts  that night found them back in camp with tudor who while improved would still have to be carried down on a stretcher  the swelling of the poonga poonga mans shoulder was going down slowly but arahu still limped on his thornpoisoned foot  two days later they rejoined the boats at carli and at high noon of the third day travelling with the current and shooting the rapids the expedition arrived at berande  joan with a sigh unbuckled her revolver belt and hung it on the nail in the livingroom while sheldon who had been lurking about for the sheer joy of seeing her perform that particular homecoming act sighed too with satisfaction  but the home coming was not all joy to him for joan set about nursing tudor and spent much time on the veranda where he lay in the hammock under the mosquitonetting     chapter xxviburning daylight   the ten days of tudors convalescence that followed were peaceful days on berande  the work of the plantation went on like clockwork  with the crushing of the premature outbreak of gogoomy and his following all insubordination seemed to have vanished  twenty more of the oldtime boys their term of service up were carried away by the martha and the fresh stock of labour treated fairly was proving of excellent quality  as sheldon rode about the plantation acknowledging to himself the comfort and convenience of a horse and wondering why he had not thought of getting one himself he pondered the various improvements for which joan was responsiblethe splendid poongapoonga recruits the fruits and vegetables the martha herself snatched from the sea for a song and earning money hand over fist despite old kinrosss slow and safe method of running her and berande once more financially secure approaching each day nearer the dividendpaying time and growing each day as the black toilers cleared the bush cut the canegrass and planted more cocoanut palms  in these and a thousand ways sheldon was made aware of how much he was indebted for material prosperity to joanto the slender levelbrowed girl with romance shining out of her gray eyes and adventure shouting from the longbarrelled colts on her hip who had landed on the beach that piping gale along with her stalwart tahitian crew and who had entered his bungalow to hang with boys hands her revolverbelt and baden powell hat on the nail by the billiard table  he forgot all the early exasperations remembering only her charms and sweetnesses and glorying much in the traits he at first had disliked mosther boyishness and adventurousness her delight to swim and risk the sharks her desire to go recruiting her love of the sea and ships her sharp authoritative words when she launched the whaleboat and with firestick in one hand and dynamitestick in the other departed with her picturesque crew to shoot fish in the balesuna her superinnocent disdain for the commonest conventions her juvenile joy in argument her fluttering wildbird love of freedom and mad passion for independence  all this he now loved and he no longer desired to tame and hold her though the paradox was the winning of her without the taming and the holding  there were times when he was dizzy with thought of her and love of her when he would stop his horse and with closed eyes picture her as he had seen her that first day in the sternsheets of the whaleboat dashing madly in to shore and marching belligerently along his veranda to remark that it was pretty hospitality this letting strangers sink or swim in his front yard  and as he opened his eyes and urged his horse onward he would ponder for the ten thousandth time how possibly he was ever to hold her when she was so wild and birdlike that she was bound to flutter out and away from under his hand  it was patent to sheldon that tudor had become interested in joan  that convalescent visitor practically lived on the veranda though while preposterously weak and shaky in the legs he had for some time insisted on coming in to join them at the table at meals  the first warning sheldon had of the others growing interest in the girl was when tudor eased down and finally ceased pricking him with his habitual sharpness of quip and speech  this cessation of verbal sparring was like the breaking off of diplomatic relations between countries at the beginning of war and once sheldons suspicions were aroused he was not long in finding other confirmations  tudor too obviously joyed in joans presence too obviously laid himself out to amuse and fascinate her with his own glorious and adventurous personality  often after his morning ride over the plantation or coming in from the store or from inspection of the copradrying sheldon found the pair of them together on the veranda joan listening intent and excited and tudor deep in some recital of personal adventure at the ends of the earth  sheldon noticed too the way tudor looked at her and followed her about with his eyes and in those eyes he noted a certain hungry look and on the face a certain wistful expression and he wondered if on his own face he carried a similar involuntary advertisement  he was sure of several things first that tudor was not the right man for joan and could not possibly make her permanently happy next that joan was too sensible a girl really to fall in love with a man of such superficial stamp and finally that tudor would blunder his lovemaking somehow  and at the same time with true lovers anxiety sheldon feared that the other might somehow fail to blunder and win the girl with purely fortuitous and successful meretricious show  but of the one thing sheldon was sure tudor had no intimate knowledge of her and was unaware of how vital in her was her wildness and love of independence  that was where he would blunderin the catching and the holding of her  and then in spite of all his certitude sheldon could not forbear wondering if his theories of joan might not be wrong and if tudor was not going the right way about after all  the situation was very unsatisfactory and perplexing  sheldon played the difficult part of waiting and looking on while his rival devoted himself energetically to reaching out and grasping at the fluttering prize  then again tudor had such an irritating way about him  it had become quite elusive and intangible now that he had tacitly severed diplomatic relations but sheldon sensed what he deemed a growing antagonism and promptly magnified it through the jealous lenses of his own lovers eyes the other was an interloper  he did not belong to berande and now that he was well and strong again it was time for him to go  instead of which and despite the calling in of the mail steamer bound for sydney tudor had settled himself down comfortably resumed swimming went dynamiting fish with joan spent hours with her hunting pigeons trapping crocodiles and at target practice with rifle and revolver  but there were certain traditions of hospitality that prevented sheldon from breathing a hint that it was time for his guest to take himself off and in similar fashion feeling that it was not playing the game he fought down the temptation to warn joan  had he known anything not too serious to tudors detriment he would have been unable to utter it but the worst of it was that he knew nothing at all against the man  that was the confounded part of it and sometimes he was so baffled and overwrought by his feelings that he assumed a superjudicial calm and assured himself that his dislike of tudor was a matter of unsubstantial prejudice and jealousy  outwardly he maintained a calm and smiling aspect  the work of the plantation went on  the martha and the flibbertygibbet came and went as did all the miscellany of coasting craft that dropped in to wait for a breeze and have a gossip a drink or two and a game of billiards satan kept the compound free of niggers  boucher came down regularly in his whaleboat to pass sunday  twice a day at breakfast and dinner joan and sheldon and tudor met amicably at table and the evenings were as amicably spent on the veranda  and then it happened  tudor made his blunder  never divining joans fluttering wildness her blind hatred of restraint and compulsion her abhorrence of mastery by another and mistaking the warmth and enthusiasm in her eyes aroused by his latest tale for something tender and acquiescent he drew her to him laid a forcible detaining arm about her waist and misapprehended her frantic revolt for an exhibition of maidenly reluctance  it occurred on the veranda after breakfast and sheldon within pondering a sydney wholesalers catalogue and making up his orders for next steamerday heard the sharp exclamation of joan followed by the equally sharp impact of an open hand against a cheek jerking free from the arm that was all distasteful compulsion joan had slapped tudors face resoundingly and with far more vim and weight than when she had cuffed gogoomy  sheldon had halfstarted up then controlled himself and sunk back in his chair so that by the time joan entered the door his composure was recovered  her right forearm was clutched tightly in her left hand while the white cheeks centred with the spots of flaming red reminded him of the time he had first seen her angry  he hurt my arm she blurted out in reply to his look of inquiry  he smiled involuntarily  it was so like her so like the boy she was to come running to complain of the physical hurt which had been done her she was certainly not a woman versed in the ways of man and in the ways of handling man  the resounding slap she had given tudor seemed still echoing in sheldons ears and as he looked at the girl before him crying out that her arm was hurt his smile grew broader  it was the smile that did it convicting joan in her own eyes of the silliness of her cry and sending over her face the most amazing blush he had ever seen  throat cheeks and forehead flamed with the rush of the shamed blood  hehe she attempted to vindicate her deeper indignation then whirled abruptly away and passed out the rear door and down the steps  sheldon sat and mused  he was a trifle angry and the more he dwelt upon the happening the angrier he grew  if it had been any woman except joan it would have been amusing  but joan was the last woman in the world to attempt to kiss forcibly  the thing smacked of the back stairs anywaya sordid little comedy perhaps but to have tried it on joan was nothing less than sacrilege  the man should have had better sense  then too sheldon was personally aggrieved  he had been filched of something that he felt was almost his and his lovers jealousy was rampant at thought of this forced familiarity  it was while in this mood that the screen door banged loudly behind the heels of tudor who strode into the room and paused before him  sheldon was unprepared though it was very apparent that the other was furious  well tudor demanded defiantly  and on the instant speech rushed to sheldons lips  i hope you wont attempt anything like it again thats allexcept that i shall be only too happy any time to extend to you the courtesy of my whaleboat  it will land you in tulagi in a few hours  as if that would settle it was the retort  i dont understand sheldon said simply  then it is because you dont wish to understand  still i dont understand sheldon said in steady level tones  all that is clear to me is that you are exaggerating your own blunder into something serious  tudor grinned maliciously and replied  it would seem that you are doing the exaggerating inviting me to leave in your whaleboat  it is telling me that berande is not big enough for the pair of us  now let me tell you that the solomon islands is not big enough for the pair of us  this things got to be settled between us and it may as well be settled right here and now  i can understand your fireeating manners as being natural to you sheldon went on wearily but why you should try them on me is what i cant comprehend  you surely dont want to quarrel with me  i certainly do  but what in heavens name for  tudor surveyed him with withering disgust  you havent the soul of a louse  i suppose any man could make love to your wife  but i have no wife sheldon interrupted  then you ought to have  the situation is outrageous  you might at least marry her as i am honourably willing to do  for the first time sheldons rising anger boiled over  you he began violently then abruptly caught control of himself and went on soothingly youd better take a drink and think it over  thats my advice to you  of course when you do get cool after talking to me in this fashion you wont want to stay on any longer so while youre getting that drink ill call the boatscrew and launch a boat  youll be in tulagi by eight this evening  he turned toward the door as if to put his words into execution but the other caught him by the shoulder and twirled him around  look here sheldon i told you the solomons were too small for the pair of us and i meant it  is that an offer to buy berande lock stock and barrel sheldon queried  no it isnt  its an invitation to fight  but what the devil do you want to fight with me for  sheldons irritation was growing at the others persistence  ive no quarrel with you  and what quarrel can you have with me  i have never interfered with you  you were my guest  miss lackland is my partner  if you saw fit to make love to her and somehow failed to succeed why should you want to fight with me  this is the twentieth century my dear fellow and duelling went out of fashion before you and i were born  you began the row tudor doggedly asserted  you gave me to understand that it was time for me to go  you fired me out of your house in short and then you have the cheek to want to know why i am starting the row  it wont do i tell you  you started it and i am going to see it through  sheldon smiled tolerantly and proceeded to light a cigarette  but tudor was not to be turned aside  you started this row he urged  there isnt any row  it takes two to make a row and i for one refuse to have anything to do with such tomfoolery  you started it i say and ill tell you why you started it  i fancy youve been drinking sheldon interposed  its the only explanation i can find for your unreasonableness  and ill tell you why you started it  it wasnt silliness on your part to exaggerate this little trifle of lovemaking into something serious  i was poaching on your preserves and you wanted to get rid of me  it was all very nice and snug here you and the girl until i came along  and now youre jealousthats it jealousyand want me out of it  but i wont go  then stay on by all means  i wont quarrel with you about it  make yourself comfortable  stay for a year if you wish  shes not your wife tudor continued as though the other had not spoken  a fellow has the right to make love to her unless shes yourwell perhaps it was an error after all due to ignorance perfectly excusable on my part  i might have seen it with half an eye if id listened to the gossip on the beach  all guvutu and tulagi were laughing about it  i was a fool and i certainly made the mistake of taking the situation on its assumed innocent facevalue  so angry was sheldon becoming that the face and form of the other seemed to vibrate and oscillate before his eyes  yet outwardly sheldon was calm and apparently weary of the discussion  please keep her out of the conversation he said  but why should i was the demand  the pair of you trapped me into making a fool of myself  how was i to know that everything was not all right  you and she acted as if everything were on the square  but my eyes are open now  why she played the outraged wife to perfection slapped the transgressor and fled to you  pretty good proof of what all the beach has been saying  partners eha business partnership  gammon my eye thats what it is  then it was that sheldon struck out coolly and deliberately with all the strength of his arm and tudor caught on the jaw fell sideways crumpling as he did so and crushing a chair to kindling wood beneath the weight of his falling body  he pulled himself slowly to his feet but did not offer to rush  now will you fight tudor said grimly  sheldon laughed and for the first time with true spontaneity  the intrinsic ridiculousness of the situation was too much for his sense of humour  he made as if to repeat the blow but tudor white of face with arms hanging resistlessly at his sides offered no defence  i dont mean a fight with fists he said slowly  i mean to a finish to the death  youre a good shot with revolver and rifle  so am i thats the way well settle it  you have gone clean mad  you are a lunatic  no im not tudor retorted  im a man in love  and once again i ask you to go outside and settle it with any weapons you choose  sheldon regarded him for the first time with genuine seriousness wondering what strange maggots could be gnawing in his brain to drive him to such unusual conduct  but men dont act this way in real life sheldon remarked  youll find im pretty real before youre done with me  im going to kill you today  bosh and nonsense man  this time sheldon had lost his temper over the superficial aspects of the situation  bosh and nonsense thats all it is  men dont fight duels in the twentieth century  itsits antediluvian i tell you  speaking of joan  please keep her name out of it sheldon warned him  i will if youll fight  sheldon threw up his arms despairingly  speaking of joan  look out sheldon warned again  oh go ahead knock me down  but that wont close my mouth  you can knock me down all day but as fast as i get to my feet ill speak of joan again  now will you fight  listen to me tudor sheldon began with an effort at decisiveness  i am not used to taking from men a tithe of what ive already taken from you  youll take a lot more before the days out was the answer  i tell you you simply must fight  ill give you a fair chance to kill me but ill kill you before the days out  this isnt civilization  its the solomon islands and a pretty primitive proposition for all that  king edward and law and order are represented by the commissioner at tulagi and an occasional visiting gunboat  and two men and one woman is an equally primitive proposition  well settle it in the good old primitive way  as sheldon looked at him the thought came to his mind that after all there might be something in the others wild adventures over the earth it required a man of that calibre a man capable of obtruding a duel into orderly twentieth century life to find such wild adventures  theres only one way to stop me tudor went on  i cant insult you directly i know  you are too easygoing or cowardly or both for that  but i can narrate for you the talk of the beachah that grinds you doesnt it  i can tell you what the beach has to say about you and this young girl running a plantation under a business partnership  stop sheldon cried for the other was beginning to vibrate and oscillate before his eyes  you want a duel  ill give it to you  then his commonsense and dislike for the ridiculous asserted themselves and he added but its absurd impossible  joan and davidpartners eh  joan and davidpartners tudor began to iterate and reiterate in a malicious and scornful chant  for heavens sake keep quiet and ill let you have your way sheldon cried  i never saw a fool so bent on his folly  what kind of a duel shall it be  there are no seconds  what weapons shall we use  immediately tudors monkeylike impishness left him and he was once more the cool selfpossessed man of the world  ive often thought that the ideal duel should be somewhat different from the conventional one he said  ive fought several of that sort you know  french ones sheldon interrupted  call them that  but speaking of this ideal duel here it is  no seconds of course and no onlookers  the two principals alone are necessary  they may use any weapons they please from revolvers and rifles to machine guns and pompoms  they start a mile apart and advance on each other taking advantage of cover retreating circling feintinganything and everything permissible  in short the principals shall hunt each other  like a couple of wild indians  precisely cried tudor delighted  youve got the idea  and berande is just the place and this is just the right time  miss lackland will be taking her siesta and shell think we are  weve got two hours for it before she wakes  so hurry up and come on  you start out from the balesuna and i start from the berande  those two rivers are the boundaries of the plantation arent they  very well  the field of the duel will be the plantation  neither principal must go outside its boundaries  are you satisfied  quite  but have you any objections if i leave some orders  not at all tudor acquiesced the pink of courtesy now that his wish had been granted  sheldon clapped his hands and the running houseboy hurried away to bring back adamu adam and noa noah  listen sheldon said to them  this man and me we have one big fight today  maybe he die  maybe i die  if he die all right  if i die you two look after missie lackalanna  you take rifles and you look after her daytime and nighttime  if she want to talk with mr tudor all right  if she not want to talk you make him keep away  savvee  they grunted and nodded  they had had much to do with white men and had learned never to question the strange ways of the strange breed  if these two saw fit to go out and kill each other that was their business and not the business of the islanders who took orders from them  they stepped to the gunrack and each picked a rifle  better all tahitian men have rifles suggested adamu adam  maybe big trouble come  all right you take them sheldon answered busy with issuing the ammunition  they went to the door and down the steps carrying the eight rifles to their quarters  tudor with cartridgebelts for rifle and pistol strapped around him rifle in hand stood impatiently waiting  come on hurry up were burning daylight he urged as sheldon searched after extra clips for his automatic pistol  together they passed down the steps and out of the compound to the beach where they turned their backs to each other and each proceeded toward his destination their rifles in the hollows of their arms tudor walking toward the berande and sheldon toward the balesuna     chapter xxviimodern duelling   barely had sheldon reached the balesuna when he heard the faint report of a distant rifle and knew it was the signal of tudor giving notice that he had reached the berande turned about and was coming back sheldon fired his rifle into the air in answer and in turn proceeded to advance  he moved as in a dream absentmindedly keeping to the open beach  the thing was so preposterous that he had to struggle to realize it and he reviewed in his mind the conversation with tudor trying to find some clue to the commonsense of what he was doing  he did not want to kill tudor  because that man had blundered in his lovemaking was no reason that he sheldon should take his life  then what was it all about  true the fellow had insulted joan by his subsequent remarks and been knocked down for it but because he had knocked him down was no reason that he should now try to kill him  in this fashion he covered a quarter of the distance between the two rivers when it dawned upon him that tudor was not on the beach at all of course not  he was advancing according to the terms of the agreement in the shelter of the cocoanut trees  sheldon promptly swerved to the left to seek similar shelter when the faint crack of a rifle came to his ears and almost immediately the bullet striking the hard sand a hundred feet beyond him ricochetted and whined onward on a second flight convincing him that preposterous and unreal as it was it was nevertheless sober fact  it had been intended for him  yet even then it was hard to believe  he glanced over the familiar landscape and at the sea dimpling in the light but steady breeze  from the direction of tulagi he could see the white sails of a schooner laying a tack across toward berande  down the beach a horse was grazing and he idly wondered where the others were  the smoke rising from the copradrying caught his eyes which roved on over the barracks the toolhouses the boatsheds and the bungalow and came to rest on joans little grass house in the corner of the compound  keeping now to the shelter of the trees he went forward another quarter of a mile  if tudor had advanced with equal speed they should have come together at that point and sheldon concluded that the other was circling  the difficulty was to locate him  the rows of trees running at right angles enabled him to see along only one narrow avenue at a time  his enemy might be coming along the next avenue or the next to right or left  he might be a hundred feet away or half a mile  sheldon plodded on and decided that the old stereotyped duel was far simpler and easier than this protracted hideandseek affair  he too tried circling in the hope of cutting the others circle but without catching a glimpse of him he finally emerged upon a fresh clearing where the young trees waisthigh afforded little shelter and less hiding just as he emerged stepping out a pace a rifle cracked to his right and though he did not hear the bullet in passing the thud of it came to his ears when it struck a palmtrunk farther on  he sprang back into the protection of the larger trees  twice he had exposed himself and been fired at while he had failed to catch a single glimpse of his antagonist  a slow anger began to burn in him  it was deucedly unpleasant he decided this being peppered at and nonsensical as it really was it was none the less deadly serious  there was no avoiding the issue no firing in the air and getting over with it as in the oldfashioned duel  this mutual manhunt must keep up until one got the other  and if one neglected a chance to get the other that increased the others chance to get him  there could be no false sentiment about it  tudor had been a cunning devil when he proposed this sort of duel sheldon concluded as he began to work along cautiously in the direction of the last shot  when he arrived at the spot tudor was gone and only his footprints remained pointing out the course he had taken into the depths of the plantation  once ten minutes later he caught a glimpse of tudor a hundred yards away crossing the same avenue as himself but going in the opposite direction  his rifle halfleaped to his shoulder but the other was gone  more in whim than in hope of result grinning to himself as he did so sheldon raised his automatic pistol and in two seconds sent eight shots scattering through the trees in the direction in which tudor had disappeared  wishing he had a shotgun sheldon dropped to the ground behind a tree slipped a fresh clip up the hollow butt of the pistol threw a cartridge into the chamber shoved the safety catch into place and reloaded the empty clip  it was but a short time after that that tudor tried the same trick on him the bullets pattering about him like spiteful rain thudding into the palm trunks or glancing off in whining ricochets  the last bullet of all making a double ricochet from two different trees and losing most of its momentum struck sheldon a sharp blow on the forehead and dropped at his feet  he was partly stunned for the moment but on investigation found no greater harm than a nasty lump that soon rose to the size of a pigeons egg  the hunt went on  once coming to the edge of the grove near the bungalow he saw the houseboys and the cook clustered on the back veranda and peering curiously among the trees talking and laughing with one another in their queer falsetto voices  another time he came upon a workinggang busy at hoeing weeds  they scarcely noticed him when he came up though they knew thoroughly well what was going on  it was no affair of theirs that the enigmatical white men should be out trying to kill each other and whatever interest in the proceedings might be theirs they were careful to conceal it from sheldon  he ordered them to continue hoeing weeds in a distant and outoftheway corner and went on with the pursuit of tudor  tiring of the endless circling sheldon tried once more to advance directly on his foe but the latter was too crafty taking advantage of his boldness to fire a couple of shots at him and slipping away on some changed and continually changing course  for an hour they dodged and turned and twisted back and forth and around and hunted each other among the orderly palms  they caught fleeting glimpses of each other and chanced flying shots which were without result  on a grassy shelter behind a tree sheldon came upon where tudor had rested and smoked a cigarette  the pressed grass showed where he had sat  to one side lay the cigarette stump and the charred match which had lighted it  in front lay a scattering of bright metallic fragments  sheldon recognized their significance  tudor was notching his steeljacketed bullets or cutting them blunt so that they would spread on strikingin short he was making them into the vicious dumdum prohibited in modern warfare sheldon knew now what would happen to him if a bullet struck his body  it would leave a tiny hole where it entered but the hole where it emerged would be the size of a saucer  he decided to give up the pursuit and lay down in the grass protected right and left by the row of palms with on either hand the long avenue extending  this he could watch  tudor would have to come to him or else there would be no termination of the affair  he wiped the sweat from his face and tied the handkerchief around his neck to keep off the stinging gnats that lurked in the grass  never had he felt so great a disgust for the thing called adventure  joan had been bad enough with her baden powell and longbarrelled colts but here was this newcomer also looking for adventure and finding it in no other way than by lugging a peace loving planter into an absurd and preposterous bushwhacking duel  if ever adventure was well damned it was by sheldon sweating in the windless grass and fighting gnats the while he kept close watch up and down the avenue  then tudor came  sheldon happened to be looking in his direction at the moment he came into view peering quickly up and down the avenue before he stepped into the open  midway he stopped as if debating what course to pursue  he made a splendid mark facing his concealed enemy at two hundred yards distance  sheldon aimed at the centre of his chest then deliberately shifted the aim to his right shoulder and with the thought that will put him out of business pulled the trigger  the bullet driving with momentum sufficient to perforate a mans body a mile distant struck tudor with such force as to pivot him whirling him half around by the shock of its impact and knocking him down  hope i havent killed the beggar sheldon muttered aloud springing to his feet and running forward  a hundred feet away all anxiety on that score was relieved by tudor who made shift with his left hand and from his automatic pistol hurled a rain of bullets all around sheldon  the latter dodged behind a palm trunk counting the shots and when the eighth had been fired he rushed in on the wounded man  he kicked the pistol out of the others hand and then sat down on him in order to keep him down  be quiet he said  ive got you so theres no use struggling  tudor still attempted to struggle and to throw him off  keep quiet i tell you sheldon commanded  im satisfied with the outcome and youve got to be  so you might as well give in and call this affair closed  tudor reluctantly relaxed  rather funny isnt it these modern duels  sheldon grinned down at him as he removed his weight  not a bit dignified  if youd struggled a moment longer id have rubbed your face in the earth  ive a good mind to do it anyway just to teach you that duelling has gone out of fashion now let us see to your injuries  you only got me that last tudor grunted sullenly lying in ambush like  like a wild indian  precisely  youve caught the idea old man sheldon ceased his mocking and stood up  you lie there quietly until i send back some of the boys to carry you in  youre not seriously hurt and its lucky for you i didnt follow your example  if you had been struck with one of your own bullets a carriage and pair would have been none too large to drive through the hole it would have made  as it is youre drilled cleana nice little perforation  all you need is antiseptic washing and dressing and youll be around in a month  now take it easy and ill send a stretcher for you     chapter xxviiicapitulation   when sheldon emerged from among the trees he found joan waiting at the compound gate and he could not fail to see that she was visibly gladdened at the sight of him  i cant tell you how glad i am to see you was her greeting  whats become of tudor  that last flutter of the automatic wasnt nice to listen to  was it you or tudor  so you know all about it he answered coolly  well it was tudor but he was doing it lefthanded  hes down with a hole in his shoulder  he looked at her keenly  disappointing isnt it he drawled  how do you mean  why that i didnt kill him  but i didnt want him killed just because he kissed me she cried  oh he did kiss you sheldon retorted in evident surprise  i thought you said he hurt your arm  one could call it a kiss though it was only on the end of the nose she laughed at the recollection  but i paid him back for that myself  i boxed his face for him  and he did hurt my arm  its black and blue look at it  she pulled up the loose sleeve of her blouse and he saw the bruised imprints of two fingers  just then a gang of blacks came out from among the trees carrying the wounded man on a rough stretcher  romantic isnt it sheldon sneered following joans startled gaze and now ill have to play surgeon and doctor him up  funny this twentiethcentury duelling  first you drill a hole in a man and next you set about plugging the hole up  they had stepped aside to let the stretcher pass and tudor who had heard the remark lifted himself up on the elbow of his sound arm and said with a defiant grin  if youd got one of mine youd have had to plug with a dinnerplate  oh you wretch joan cried  youve been cutting your bullets  it was according to agreement tudor answered  everything went  we could have used dynamite if we wanted to  hes right sheldon assured her as they swung in behind  any weapon was permissible  i lay in the grass where he couldnt see me and bushwhacked him in truly noble fashion  thats what comes of having women on the plantation  and now its antiseptics and drainage tubes i suppose  its a nasty mess and ill have to read up on it before i tackle the job  i dont see that its my fault she began  i couldnt help it because he kissed me  i never dreamed he would attempt it  we didnt fight for that reason  but there isnt time to explain  if youll get dressings and bandages ready ill look up gunshot wounds and see whats to be done  is he bleeding seriously she asked  no the bullet seems to have missed the important arteries  but that would have been a pickle  then theres no need to bother about reading up joan said  and im just dying to hear what it was all about  the apostle is lying becalmed inside the point and her boats are out to wing  shell be at anchor in five minutes and doctor welshmere is sure to be on board  so all weve got to do is to make tudor comfortable  wed better put him in your room under the mosquitonetting and send a boat off to tell dr welshmere to bring his instruments  an hour afterward dr welshmere left the patient comfortable and attended to and went down to the beach to go on board promising to come back to dinner  joan and sheldon standing on the veranda watched him depart  ill never have it in for the missionaries again since seeing them here in the solomons she said seating herself in a steamerchair  she looked at sheldon and began to laugh  thats right he said  its the way i feel playing the fool and trying to murder a guest  but you havent told me what it was all about  you he answered shortly  me  but you just said it wasnt  oh it wasnt the kiss  he walked over to the railing and leaned against it facing her  but it was about you all the same and i may as well tell you  you remember i warned you long ago what would happen when you wanted to become a partner in berande  well all the beach is gossiping about it and tudor persisted in repeating the gossip to me  so you see it wont do for you to stay on here under present conditions  it would be better if you went away  but i dont want to go away she objected with rueful countenance  a chaperone then  no nor a chaperone  but you surely dont expect me to go around shooting every slanderer in the solomons that opens his mouth he demanded gloomily  no nor that either she answered with quick impulsiveness  ill tell you what well do  well get married and put a stop to it all  there  he looked at her in amazement and would have believed that she was making fun of him had it not been for the warm blood that suddenly suffused her cheeks  do you mean that he asked unsteadily  why  to put a stop to all the nasty gossip of the beach  thats a pretty good reason isnt it  the temptation was strong enough and sudden enough to make him waver but all the disgust came back to him that was his when he lay in the grass fighting gnats and cursing adventure and he answered  no it is worse than no reason at all  i dont care to marry you as a matter of expedience  you are the most ridiculous creature she broke in with a flash of her oldtime anger  you talk love and marriage to me very much against my wish and go mooning around over the plantation week after week because you cant have me and look at me when you think im not noticing and when all the time im wondering when you had your last square meal because of the hungry look in your eyes and make eyes at my revolver belt hanging on a nail and fight duels about me and all the restandand now when i say ill marry you you do yourself the honour of refusing me  you cant make me any more ridiculous than i feel he answered rubbing the lump on his forehead reflectively  and if this is the accepted romantic programmea duel over a girl and the girl rushing into the arms of the winnerwhy i shall not make a bigger ass of myself by going in for it  i thought youd jump at it she confessed with a naivete he could not but question for he thought he saw a roguish gleam in her eyes  my conception of love must differ from yours then he said  i should want a woman to marry me for love of me and not out of romantic admiration because i was lucky enough to drill a hole in a mans shoulder with smokeless powder  i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot  i dont like it  tudor is a sample of the adventure kindpicking a quarrel with me and behaving like a monkey insisting on fighting with meto the death he said  it was like a penny dreadful  she was biting her lip and though her eyes were cool and levellooking as ever the telltale angry red was in her cheeks  of course if you dont want to marry me  but i do he hastily interposed  oh you do  but dont you see little girl i want you to love me he hurried on otherwise it would be only half a marriage  i dont want you to marry me simply because by so doing a stop is put to the beach gossip nor do i want you to marry me out of some foolish romantic notion  i shouldnt want you    that way  oh in that case she said with assumed deliberateness and he could have sworn to the roguish gleam in that case since you are willing to consider my offer let me make a few remarks  in the first place you neednt sneer at adventure when you are living it yourself and you were certainly living it when i found you first down with fever on a lonely plantation with a couple of hundred wild cannibals thirsting for your life  then i came along  and what with your arriving in a gale he broke in fresh from the wreck of the schooner landing on the beach in a whaleboat full of picturesque tahitian sailors and coming into the bungalow with a baden powell on your head seaboots on your feet and a whacking big colts dangling on your hipwhy i am only too ready to admit that you were the quintessence of adventure  very good she cried exultantly  its mere simple arithmeticthe adding of your adventure and my adventure together  so thats settled and you neednt jeer at adventure any more  next i dont think there was anything romantic in tudors attempting to kiss me nor anything like adventure in this absurd duel  but i do think now that it was romantic for you to fall in love with me  and finally and it is adding romance to romance i think    i think i do love you daveoh dave  the last was a sighing dovecry as he caught her up in his arms and pressed her to him  but i dont love you because you played the fool today she whispered on his shoulder  white men shouldnt go around killing each other  then why do you love me he questioned enthralled after the manner of all lovers in the everlasting query that for ever has remained unanswered  i dont knowjust because i do i guess  and thats all the satisfaction you gave me when we had that mantalk  but i have been loving you for weeksduring all the time you have been so deliciously and unobtrusively jealous of tudor  yes yes go on he urged breathlessly when she paused  i wondered when youd break out and because you didnt i loved you all the more  you were like dad and von  you could hold yourself in check you didnt make a fool of yourself  not until today he suggested  yes and i loved you for that too  it was about time  i began to think you were never going to bring up the subject again  and now that i have offered myself you havent even accepted  with both hands on her shoulders he held her at armslength from him and looked long into her eyes no longer cool but seemingly pervaded with a golden flush  the lids drooped and yet bravely did not droop as she returned his gaze  then he fondly and solemnly drew her to him  and how about that hearth and saddle of your own he asked a moment later  i wellnigh won to them  the grass house is my hearth and the martha my saddle andand look at all the trees ive planted to say nothing of the sweet corn  and its all your fault anyway  i might never have loved you if you hadnt put the idea into my head  theres the nongassla coming in around the point with her boats out sheldon remarked irrelevantly  and the commissioner is on board  hes going down to san cristoval to investigate that missionary killing  were in luck i must say  i dont see where the luck comes in she said dolefully  we ought to have this evening all to ourselves just to talk things over  ive a thousand questions to ask you  and it wouldnt have been a mantalk either she added  but my plan is better than that  he debated with himself a moment you see the commissioner is the one official in the islands who can give us a license  andtheres the luck of itdoctor welshmere is here to perform the ceremony  well get married this evening  joan recoiled from him in panic tearing herself from his arms and going backward several steps  he could see that she was really frightened  i    i thought    she stammered  then slowly the change came over her and the blood flooded into her face in the same amazing blush he had seen once before that day  her cool levellooking eyes were no longer levellooking nor cool but warmly drooping and just unable to meet his as she came toward him and nestled in the circle of his arms saying softly almost in a whisper  i am ready dave     footnotes   1  eaten  2  food  3
