winter had begun and snow blew about the lonely telegraph shack where jim dearham studied an old french romance  he read rather by way of mental discipline than for enjoyment and partly with the object of keeping himself awake  life is primitive in the british columbian bush and jim sometimes felt he must fight against the insidious influence of the wilds  although he had chosen the latter when the cities palled he had studied at mcgill with a view of embarking on a professional career  want of money was the main obstacle but love of adventure had counted for much  his adventures had been numerous since he left the university and he now and then tried to remind himself that he was civilized  outside the shack the stiff dark pines rolled back to the frozen north where a new city fed the mining camps  jim had been up there and had found some gold besides a copper vein but when he got his patent for the latter his funds ran out and he returned to the south and followed a number of occupations  some were monotonous and some exciting  none paid him well  now his clothes were old and mended with patches cut from cotton flourbags his skin was browned by wind and frost  he was thin and muscular and his eyes had something of the inscrutable calm that marks the indians but the old french romance and one or two other books hinted at cultivated taste  as a matter of fact jim was afraid of getting like an indian  life in the wilds was good but one ran some risks  the shack was built of logs notched where they crossed at the corners and caulked with moss  there was a stone chimney and a big wood fire snapped on the hearth  jim sat close to the blaze in a deerhide chair with his old skin coat hung over the back to keep off the stinging draughts  he could see the telegraph instrument  his and his comrades duty was to watch it day and night because theirs was a bad section and accidents happened  jake had gone hunting and since the gale outside was freshening jim wondered why he stopped so long  after a time jim put down his book and mused  by comparison with the ragged tents in which he had lived in the northern barrens the shack was comfortable  axes and tools for mending the line stood in a corner old clothes slickers and long boots that must be mended occupied another  a good supply of provisions was stowed on some shelves a rifle and a shotgun hung on the wall  he had all a man needed in the woods and admitted that he was lucky to have so much but the rudeness of his surroundings sometimes jarred  this was strange because he had never known luxury  he wondered whether he had inherited his dislike for ugliness and the instincts of which he was now and then vaguely conscious  it was possible for his father who died when jim was young had come from the old country  then he dwelt with languid enjoyment upon something that happened when he was a waiter at a fashionable restaurant at montreal  a party of english tourists came in one day for lunch  jim remembered the scene well the spacious room with the sunshine on the pillars and the reflections on glass and silver the flies about the tables the monotonous throb of the electric fan and the strangers looking for a place  there were two men one older than the other and a girl  jim had often pictured her since and always with a curious satisfaction it was not that she was beautiful although her face was finely molded and her movements were graceful  it was her delicate fastidiousness and the hint one got of refinement and cultivation  although she smiled now and then jim remembered her calm and the tranquillity of her voice  he had not met a girl like that before but she went away with the others one of whom gave him a dollar and it was ridiculous to imagine he would see her again  this however was not important and he got up and went to the telegraph instrument  he called the next station and was satisfied when he got an answer  some government messages that must not be delayed were to be sent north and the line was working well  jim went back to his chair and soon afterwards leaned forward listening  he heard the wind in the pinetops and the thud of snow shaken from the tossing branches on the roof  that was all but he had trained his senses in the woods until they worked unconsciously  somebody was coming and he knew it was not jake  a minute or two afterwards he heard steps in the snow  the steps were heavy as if the men were tired  somebody knocked and jim opened the door  two men came in and throwing down their packs shook the snow from their ragged furs  their boots were broken their leggins badly worn and their faces were pinched with cold  i dont suppose youll turn us out  its what our packers call pretty fierce tonight one remarked  certainly not said jim  come right up to the fire  how did you make the shack  the strangers advanced and jim hid his surprise although they were the men whose lunch he had served at the montreal restaurant  he had learned in the wilds something of the indians reserve  we hit the wire at dusk one replied  we had been climbing with a party of the canadian alpine club and stopped among the high ranges longer than we meant  in fact the snow rather surprised us  the others had gone before we started and we had a rough time coming south  you didnt make it without packers said jim who knew they were english  we left the boys some distance back  there was not much shelter at the camp and although they were satisfied we resolved to follow the line and try to find a shack  the boys will no doubt arrive in the morning  jim nodded because a line was cut through the forest for the telegraph wires  you ran some risk  if you camped at sundown its a while since you had supper  i can give you coffee and a hot bannock  he put the kettle on the fire and when the meal was over studied his guests as they lighted their pipes  one was about thirty years old and in spite of his ragged clothes jim thought him a man with cultivated tastes and wide experience  the other was young and looked frank  he had a refined intelligent face and was like the girl whom jim had seen at the restaurant she was perhaps a relation  for a time the strangers talked about their journey and then one looked at jim rather hard  havent i seen you before  jim smiled  at cibbleys as you go to the new postoffice at montreal  oh yes  it was a very wellserved lunch said the other and picked up the french romance  a curious book but rather fine in parts  do you understand the fellow  on the whole  i like him you feel he has a grip  still hes puzzling now and then  these french writers are puzzling always trying to work off an epigram the younger man remarked  however i suppose theres as much french as english spoken at montreal and quebec  not french like this the other said with a smile  i doubt if an uptodate boulevardier would own it for his mothers tongue  you would be surprised if you heard our cumberland farmers use chaucers english  i dont know they go back beyond him now and then  when they count their sheep i imagine they talk like alfred or canute  but suppose you give us an example of ancient french  the older man opened the book and after turning a number of pages read a passage with taste and feeling  then he looked at jim  hes primitive our thoughts run in another groove  but i daresay theres something archaic about quebec french and you perhaps know the latter  have i struck the right note  hit it first time  anyhow youve got my notion of what he meant jim replied  then he paused and added thoughtfully but i dont know if were as different as you think  in the north men get back to primitive things  the other nodded  its possible  one certainly gets a primitive hunger and learns something about bodily needs  jim lighted his pipe and mused  he had not talked to cultivated people since he left mcgill  he felt rather moved and quietly excited the strange thing was their english voices and manner were not new  in a way it was ridiculous but he felt as if he had known them or others of their kind before  you are from the old country and your friend seems to know cumberland he said  do you know langrigg hall  he thought the older man gave him a keen glance but next moment his face was inscrutable and with a little gesture of satisfaction he stretched his legs to the fire  his companion however looked interested  why yes said the latter  but there are a number of langriggs in the north of england  at the place i mean there is a marsh  then i do know the hall  it stands upon a low ridgewhat we call a knowewith the big fells behind and the sands in front  at lowwater a river winds about the flats  its a fine old house although its small  isnt there a square tower with a battlement  the roof beams in the older part are bent not straight  the other looked surprised  have you been there  no said jim thoughtfully  ive never left canada but a man i knew used to talk about langrigg  i expect he told me about these things he is dead now  he glanced at the older man  the latters eyes were halfclosed and his pose was slack as if he were languidly enjoying the warmth but jim thought he had been listening  then he wondered why the others short description had given him so distinct a picture he could see the rugged blue hills in the background and the river winding among the sands  after all his father had not talked about langrigg often in fact only once or twice when he was ill  moreover jim reflected that he himself had used no western colloquialisms he had talked to the strangers like an englishman  then your friend must have been at langrigg  it looks as if he knew the hall well remarked the younger man  his companion roused himself with a jerk  i was nearly asleep  give me your pouch my tobaccos out  he filled his pipe and turned to jim  hope i didnt interrupt  i forget what we were talking about  it looks as if you didnt like a waiters job  jim laughed and went to the telegraph which began to click  he read the message and calling the next station waited for a time and then turned to his guests  lines broken and ive got to leave you  you can use the bunks my partner must sit up and watch the instrument when he comes back  you can tell him ive gone to look for the break  do you know where the break is the younger man asked  i dont know said jim putting on his fur cap and old skin coat it maynt be far off and it may be some distance  all i know is its between here and the next shack  we found it hard to face the wind and theres more now  jim smiled  one gets used to storms up here and the line must be mended  some important messages from ottawa are coming along  he picked up some tools and when he opened the door the others heard the scream of the gale  the flames blew out from the snapping logs and an icy draught swept the room and roared in the chimney  then the door shut the fire burned steadily and all was quiet in the shack  our host excites ones curiosity said the younger man  you mean he excited yours  youre an imaginative fellow dick  richard halliday had remarked that since they reached the shack mordaunt had not called him dick and vaguely wondered why  lance mordaunt generally had an object  dick doubted if he had been as sleepy as he pretended when he asked for his tobacco pouch  oh well he said if we were in england you wouldnt expect to find a fellow like this using his leisure to study oldfashioned french  we are not in england mordaunt rejoined  when you judge canadians by english standards youre likely to get misled  the countrys so to speak in a transition stage they havent developed schools of specialists yet and an intelligent man can often make good at an unaccustomed job  this fellow for example was a waiter  he picked up the romance and put it on a shelf  mordaunt was generally neat and dick noted that he replaced the book in the spot from which it had been taken and put the rest against it  anyhow its curious he knew about langrigg dick insisted  i dont think so said mordaunt carelessly  a number of our farmers sons have emigrated  he stated he had not left canada and the man who told him about langrigg was dead  the man who ought to own langrigg vanished in canada  on the whole i imagine thats lucky  the trustees spent a large sum in trying to find him and were satisfied he was dead  his age made this probable  but he might have had a son  of course mordaunt agreed  suppose he had a son  the fellow obviously knows nothing about his inheritance and for that matter langrigg is not worth much  i expect hes engaged in some useful occupation chopping trees or keeping store for example and is no doubt satisfied with his lot  i dont suppose he is the kind of man you would like to see at langrigg  besides if he turned up a number of people would suffer  that is so dick said thoughtfully  after all however if franklin dearham had a son he ought to be at langrigg  joseph left the hall to franklin and his heirs  mordaunt smiled  it was as illogical as other things joseph did  he was not a good business man and spent the most part of his money after he quarreled with franklin and turned him out  then shortly before he died when franklin had vanished and the estate would hardly pay its debts he left him langrigg  however the things done with and if i found franklins heir i doubt if id feel justified in meddling matters like this are better left alone  he got up and stretched himself  now im going to bed  he got into the nearest bunk which was filled with sprucetwigs and wild hay and soon went to sleep but for a time dick sat by the fire the linesman had excited his curiosity it was strange the fellow knew about langrigg  then he was obviously a man with rather unusual qualities and character his books indicated this  dick resolved to find out something about him when he returned  by and by the other linesman came in with a muletail buck and when dick gave him jims message sat down by the telegraph  dick went to bed and did not wake until his packers arrived at daybreak  the linesman was watching the telegraph but the finger had not moved and he owned that he was getting anxious about his comrade  dick suggested that they should look for him but on the whole the linesman hardly thought this necessary  he said the man from the next post would have started to meet jim  then mordaunt wanted to get off the snow had stopped the wind had fallen and if they missed this opportunity they might be held up by another storm while their food was getting short  dick hesitated but mordaunt generally led him where he would and after some argument he agreed to start  half an hour later they left the shack and pushed on down the line     chapter ii  in the snow  when jim left the shack the cold pierced his furs like a knife  for a few moments he heard nothing but the roar of the gale and could hardly get his breath  his eyes ran water and the snow beat his smarting face  then he braced himself for he had gone out to mend the line on other bitter nights and could not lose his way  where the telegraph runs through the forests of the north a narrow track is cut for packhorse transport to the linesmens posts and one could not push between the trunks that lined the gap without finding thickets and tangles of fallen logs  the track however was not graded like a road  outcropping rocks broke its surface short brush had grown up and although the snow had covered some of the obstacles its top was soft  for a time the trees broke the wind and jim pushed on hoping that he might soon find a trailing wire but the posts loomed up undamaged out of the tossing haze  luck was obviously against him and he might be forced to walk halfway to the next shack from which the other linesman would start  the snow was loose and blew about in a kind of frozen dust that was intolerably painful to his smarting skin although his cap had earflaps he could not cover his mouth and nose and the fine powder dried by the cold clogged his eyelashes and filled his nostrils  his old coat did not keep out the wind and although he was in partial shelter he was now and then compelled to stop for breath  the gale was getting worse and as sometimes happens when a blizzard rages the temperature was falling  jims flesh shrank from the arctic blast but he knew that in the north bodily weakness must be conquered  in the stern battle with savage nature prudence is a handicap one must risk all and do what one undertakes since there is no place in the wilderness for the man who counts the cost  moreover jim had fought harder fights when his strength was lowered by want of food and he went forward conscious of one thing the line was broken and must be mended  there was no other way  he must give up his post if he could not make good  in the meantime his physical senses developed in the wilds worked with mechanical regularity and guarded him  he could not hear much through his fur cap and often for some moments could not see but he stopped when a tossing branch broke off and struck the snow in front and sprang forward when a fir plunged down a few yards behind  he could not have stated that he knew the danger but he avoided it where a stranger to the woods would have been crushed  perhaps the going was the worst  plowing through the loose snow he struck his feet against outcropping rocks and sometimes stubbed them hard on a fallen log  in places he sank deep the labor was heavy and wind and cold made it awkward to breathe  his lungs seemed cramped the blood could not properly reach his hands and feet  it was a comfort that they hurt because when he no longer felt the painful tingling the real trouble would begin  one cannot feel when ones flesh is frozen  he could not have seen his watch had he taken it out and doubted if there was warmth enough in his body to keep it going because watches and gunlocks often freeze in the north  for all that he knew how long he had left the shack and how much ground he had covered  men like dearham learn such things and by the halfinstinctive faculties they develop canadian traffic is carried on in winter storms telegraph linesmen in the bush and railroad hands on mountain sections use powers beyond the imagining of sheltered city men  they make good giving all that can be demanded of flesh and blood the wires work and montrealvancouver expresses keep time in the snow  one thing made jims task a little easier  the wire was overhead and when he reached the break he would see the trailing end  the trees had been chopped back there was nothing to help the currents leap to earth and he would not be forced to cut and call up the next shack with his battery  he wanted to find a fallen post but as he struggled forward the halfseen poles came back out of the icy mist in an unending row  he had been out two hours and had not reached the worst spot  the line had no doubt broken at silvers gulch  some time afterwards he stopped and leaned against a post  the woods broke off behind him and in front a gap filled with waves of snow opened up  he could not see across indeed for a few moments he could hardly see at all but the turmoil that came out of the dark hollow hinted at its depth  he heard the roar of tossing trees far below and his brain reproduced an accurate picture of the gulch that pierced the high tableland  it was wide just there but narrowed farther on and a river fed by a glacier flowed through the defile the river was probably frozen although it ran fast  the wires went down obliquely and in one place there was a straight fall of a hundred feet  the rest of the rugged slope was very steep and one needed some nerve to follow the row of posts when the light was good  jim did not hesitate when he had got his breath  with a blizzard raging his job would not bear thinking about  he let go the post and slipped down some distance  when he stopped he got up badly shaken and crawled down cautiously trying to keep the line in sight but it was not a logical sense of duty that urged him on he only knew he must not be beaten  he fought instinctively because this was a region where to give ground in the battle generally means to die  he reached a bend of the line where a post stood on a broken pitch that was almost a precipice  twenty or thirty yards below it became a precipice and jim met the full force of the wind as he crept round the corner  then he saw a trailing wire and a little farther on a broken post that had slipped down some distance  crouching in the snow behind a rock for a few minutes he thought hard  although the post was short and not very heavy he could not drag it back while the wire was attached  the latter must be loosed and fixed again when the post was in its place but it would be enough if the line was lifted a foot or two from the ground  proper repairs could be made afterwards the important thing was the government messages should not be held up  for all that it would be hard to reach the spot  he crawled down and stopped beside the post  the snow was blinding the wind buffeted him savagely and since he was near the top of the precipice it was risky to stand up  his fur mittens embarrassed him but he could not take them off because when the thermometer falls below zero one cannot touch steel tools with unprotected hands  after some trouble jim loosed the wire and then saw the broken ends would not meet  however since the line curved a post could be cut in order to shorten the distance and he crawled back to the spot where he had left his ax  had he not been used to the snowy wilds he could not have found the tool  he cut the post and with numbed and clumsy hands joined the wire but it must now be raised from the ground  it was impossible to get the fallen post on end and had he been able to do so powder would have been needed to make a hole  he could however support the post on a rock and he floundered up and down in the snow looking for a suitable spot when he found a place it was some way from the post which was too heavy to move and he went cautiously down hill for the other although this was lighter he did not see how he could drag it back to the level he had left and he sat down behind a rock and thought  his coat and cap were heavy with frozen snow that the wind had driven into the fur in spite of his efforts he was numbed and the gale raged furiously  the snow blew past the rock in clouds that looked like waves of fog he had been exposed to the icy blast for three or four hours and could not keep up the struggle long  the warmth was leaving his body fast  yet he did not think much about the risk  his business was to mend the line and his acquiescence was to some extent mechanical  to begin with he must get the post up the hill and he braced himself for the effort  he could just lift the butt and getting it on his shoulder faced the climb staggering forward a few steps while the thin end of the post dragged in the snow and then stopping  it was tremendous labor and he knew he would need all the strength he had left to reach the shack but in the meantime this did not count  getting home was a problem that must be solved after the line was mended  at length he reached the spot he had fixed upon fastened the wire to the insulator and lifted the top of the post a few feet  the job was done but his body was exhausted and his brain was dull  he had made good and was conscious of a vague satisfaction  he could not however indulge feelings like this he must now nerve himself for the effort to get home  he went down hill a little in order to shorten the curve and it was then when he had conquered his luck failed  his foot slipped and when he fell he started a small snowslide that carried him down  he could not stop the dry snow flowed about him like a river and he knew there was a precipice not far below  the snow carried him over a ledge he plunged down a few yards and brought up against a projecting rock  the blow shook him he felt something snap and for a minute or two nearly lost consciousness  then he was roused by a sharp prick and a feeling that something grated in his side  he knew what had happened one or perhaps two of his ribs had broken and an incautious movement had driven the broken end into the flesh  the mechanical injury however was the worst since jim was too hard to collapse from shock and he lay quiet trying to think  one could walk in spite of a broken rib jim had known badly injured men walk two or three hundred miles to reach a doctor but the blizzard would try his strength  it was a long way to the shack and farther to the next post but on the whole he thought it prudent to make for the latter the linesman finding the line broken would set out to look for the break and when jim met him his help would be useful  in fact it might be necessary  he felt a sharper prick as he got up but he followed the posts down the gulch and toiled up the other side  his breathing was labored and painful as he climbed the rugged slope  at the top the ground was roughly level and the tossing pines gave some shelter from the wind jim coughed now and then and thought there was a salt taste in his mouth  this looked ominous and the stabs caused by his jolting movements hurt but he would not think about it  it was pain not blood that gave him the salt taste  he had done his job and begun a harder fight  the claim of duty had been met and now he was fighting for his life  the pines roared as he struggled on and at times a blinding haze of snow filled the gap  he had thrown away his tools but his coat was getting heavy  now and then he tried to brush off the snow and wiped his lips  the salt taste was plainer but he was not going to admit he knew what it meant and was glad he could not see his mittens when he took them from his mouth  speed was important and he labored on  he could not remember afterwards how long he stumbled forward but at length he stopped and stood swaying dizzily when an indistinct object loomed through the snow  it was like a man and came towards him  hallo  why pete he gasped and with an effort reached and leaned against a pine  the other stopped  its pete all right but what dyou allow youre doing on my piece of the section  reckoned i might meet you coming along jim replied leaning hard against the tree  you can take the back trail  the lines fixed  thats good  but why are you heading this way  i dont get you yet  i fell down the gulch  some ribs broke  ah said pete  which side  jim indicated the spot where he felt the stabs and pete went to his other side  its a blamed long hike to my shack but youve got to make it  if we stop here we freeze  put your arm on my shoulder  they set off and jim was glad to use such help as the other could give  he was getting dull and began to doubt if he could reach the shack but although both would freeze if they stopped pete would not leave him  it was not a thing to argue about  pete was a white man and in the north the white mans code is stern  one here and there might have a yellow streak but as a rule such a man soon left the wilds  anyhow pete was going to see him through  both would make the shack or both would be buried in the snow  it was not a matter of generous sentiment one did things like that  they made it somehow at a cost neither afterwards talked about for at length a pale glimmer pierced the blowing snow  then the dark bulk of a building loomed up ahead and pete pushed open a door  he was forced to use both hands to shut the door and jim left without support staggered into the room  his head swam his eyes were dim and his chin was red  there was a chair if he could reach it but it seemed to be rocking about and when he stretched out his hand it had gone next moment he fell with a heavy thud  he felt a horrible stab a fit of coughing shook him and he knew nothing more     chapter iii  the third partner  some weeks after he mended the line jim sat by a window in a small frame house at vancouver city  he had been very ill and knew little about his journey on a handsledge from the telegraph shack to the railroad  there was no doctor in the woods and jake winter his helper engaging two indians wrapped jim in furs and started in a snowstorm for the south  it was an arduous journey and once or twice jake thought his comrade would succumb but they reached the railroad and he put jim on the cars  now jim was getting better and had left his bed for a rockingchair the house stood on the hill and he looked down across tall blocks of stores and offices on the inlet  plumes of dingy smoke from locomotives burning soft coal moved among the lumber stacks a tug with a wave at her bows headed for the wharf the water sparkled in the sunshine and there was a background of dark forest and white mountains  the picture had some beauty that was not altogether spoiled by the telegraph wires giant posts and advertisement signs  these emphasized the contrast between the raw and aggressive civilization that is typical of western towns and the austerity of the surrounding wilds  in the foreground were steamers sawmills and streetcars in the distance trackless woods and untrodden snow  the house stood in a shabby street and on the ground floor jakes mother and sister sold drygoods and groceries  the business was not remarkably profitable but mrs winter was a widow and carrie had sacrificed her ambitions for her sake  now she sat opposite jim whom she had nursed  carrie did not know much about sickness when she began but she was capable and jim liked to have her about  she knew when to stimulate him by cheerful banter and when he needed soothing carrie could be quiet although she could talk  jim imagined all girls were not like that  he studied her with languid satisfaction  carrie was tall and vigorous he had seen her handle heavy boxes the transfer men dumped on the sidewalk  she did such things when jake was not about and jim knew she baked the cakes and biscuit mrs winter sold  for all that her strength was not obtrusive her movements were graceful and when not occupied she was calm  she had some beauty for her face was finely molded and her color was warm and jim liked her level glance he liked her voice it was clear without being harsh and she seldom used smart colloquialisms  in fact carrie was not the girl one would expect to meet at a secondclass store  you are looking bright this afternoon she remarked  i feel bright said jim  for one thing ive got up and then you have been here some time  you brace one  i felt that when i was very sick  carrie laughed  youre trying to be polite  no said jim whose brain did not work quickly yet i dont think i tried at all  the remark was so to speak spontaneous  you helped me get better you know you did  oh well said carrie smiling you needed some control  you wouldnt take the doctors stuff and we couldnt keep you quiet  i reckon you are pretty obstinate  one has got to be obstinate in the north  thats possible  its a hard country and jake took some chances when he brought you out across the snow  do you remember much about what happened when you were on the trail  i dont said jim in a thoughtful voice  all i do remember is the talk i had with two englishmen who made the shack just before i went to mend the line  ive been bothering about the fellows since  but why  jim pondered languidly  if he kept on talking carrie might stop moreover he wanted to formulate his puzzling thoughts and carrie was intelligent  he would like to see if he could make her understand  to begin with they were people who had traveled and knew the world i know the north and some canadian cities but there i stop  the curious thing was they didnt talk like strangers i felt id got their point of view  did you like them  i dont know  i might have hit it with the younger man he was frank and i reckon he meant well though you got a hint of something careless and weak  there was more to the other fellow you couldnt tell right off if youd trust him or not  but im afraid i make you tired  oh no said carrie and was silent for a few moments  she was frankly interested by jim  for one thing she had helped him to get well and this gave her a motherly curiosity  then his remarks seemed to promise a clue to something she had found puzzling  in a way jim was different from the young men she knew  the difference was elusive but she felt it now and then  well she said why dont you go on  id met the men before jim resumed with a laugh  handed them their lunch at the montreal restaurant they had a girl with them then  id certainly not met a girl like that but somehow id a notion i could get in touch with her  what kind of a girl was she carrie asked with keener curiosity  the kind we call a looker but it wasnt that  she was finedrawn if you get me clever and fastidious  i think fastidious is the word i want  she belonged to clean quiet places where everything is right thats what made my notion i understood her strange  you see i have had to struggle in the dust and mud  carrie imagined jim had so far come through the struggle without getting much hurt or soiled  he wore no obvious scars  she smiled and he resumed perhaps the strangest thing was they knew a place in the old country my father sometimes talked about  did you tell them your father knew the place carrie asked for the clue was leading her on  i did not they were strangers jim replied and she saw he had a reserve that was not common in canada  besides my father didnt talk about langrigg much  still i had so to speak got the place i could see it  i wonder whether one remembers things ones parents knew  it doesnt look possible carrie replied  but do you know your fathers people  i dont said jim with a touch of dryness  there was a joseph dearham who lived at langrigg  i imagine he was my grandfather but he and the others left my father alone and we cut out the lot  were your father and you like each other  not in a way  i reckon im like my mother but my father has kind of faded im often sorry i cant locate him well  he was not the man to go far in this country  things i do remember show he had fine grit but he hadnt punch enough  i think he was too proud to grab what was his  you are not like that  jim smiled  i take whats mine but i dont want more  you see i had to hustle for my mothers sake and id got the habit when she died and left me all alone  well thats all there is to my story and ive certainly made you tired  you are tired carrie replied  go to sleep  i have made you talk too much and must get busy  she went off and jim mused about her  carrie was not like the english girl but she had charm and he felt she was somehow wasted at the shabby store  she was pretty and clever although she was kind she was sometimes firm  then his eyes got heavy and he went to sleep when he woke carrie had come back and was lighting the lamp  jake had entered with her and put a tray on the table  suppers served he said  its better hash than you used to hand out in the woods and carrie has fixed some hot biscuit with magnolia drips in the way you like  well you better get busy and well play were in camp  ill locate at the bottom of the snow bank  jake sat down on a rug with his back to the wall and a plate on his knee and jims thoughts wandered  he had got the habit of remembering things when he was ill and the little shabby room with the cheap rug on the rough stained floor seemed to melt like a dissolving view  he saw black pines with the moon shining between their stiff branches wood smoke drifting past and a red fire snapping in the snow  jake wore ragged furs and his eyes twinkled as they twinkled now  jake was a humorous philosopher and if his humor was sometimes thin his philosophy was sound  he was white one could trust him  then jim came back to the room above the store  he liked the way jake waited on carrie although jake owned he had not been a success when he made a trip in the mount stephen diningcar  were going to talk business jake remarked presently  ive been getting after the telegraph department since we came home and one of the construction bosses was in town today  he allowed you made good the night they sent the government messages through and if we wanted the contract for the new line theyre going to run across the ranges hed back our tender  jim isnt well enough to go back yet  you mustnt bother him carrie said firmly  we cant do much until the thaw comes jake rejoined  its a fighting chance and i dont see many chances for us in this old town  carrie looked thoughtful  she knew the wilds would draw jake back and jim must soon go but the north was a stern country and she wanted to keep them for a time  she was honest and owned that she wanted to keep both  can you finance the job she asked  its going to come hard but we might put it over  our pay was pretty good and the construction boss could get us a check as we go on if the work was approved  of course if we were pushed we could sell out the bluebird  the assays all right and one or two of the big syndicates are looking up copper  still i dont want to sell  you mustnt sell  very well jake agreed  what you say about it goes  jim looked up with some surprise  jake and he had done enough work on the copper vein to get their patent but could develop the mine no further without capital  jim did not understand what carrie had to do with this  he doesnt know jake remarked and turned to jim with a smile  we put in the stakes and filed the record but carries a partner  she helped us out  ah said jim i begin to see  he felt disturbed  the placer gold they had found was all spent before they proved the copper vein  food cost much and nobody would let them have supplies  copper mines were hardly thought worth exploiting then since transport was expensive  when it looked as if they must give up the claim jake got some money from home and now jim knew who had sent the sum  he did not know how carrie had saved it but she must have used stern economy  you dont like my sending the money she remarked with a quick glance at jim  i dont like to think of your going without things you probably wanted and ought to have had  we could have let the mine go and worked for somebody else  carrie laughed  i dont know if youre nice or not  anyhow i had the money id been clerking for a time at the woolsworth store and they had given me a good job  why shouldnt i send jake the money i didnt know how to spend  youre exaggerating jim rejoined  a pretty girl can always spend money on hats and clothes  in fact i think she ought  now youre certainly nice but well let it go  your taking the money made me a partner and in the meantime the bluebird is not for sale if you wait long enough somebody will give you what the mine is worth  i think so  coppers hard to smelt and when transports expensive speculators stick to gold but things will be different now the countrys opening up  we will hold the patent until you are willing to sell  thank you said carrie  it cost you something to prove the vein up there in the melting snow and no greedy city man is going to get your reward  however well get on  if they give you the telegraph contract im going north  jim turned to his comrade  she cant go  you had better tell her its impossible  ill leave it to you  theres not much use in telling carrie she cant do a thing when she thinks she can  jim began a labored argument about the hardships and the ruggedness of the country and carrie listened with inscrutable calm  then she said you dont want me to go  it isnt that  you dont know what you are up against  i have a notion carrie remarked with some dryness  perhaps you imagine all goes smooth and i have a soft job here  jim was silent  he was sometimes sorry for carrie but she resumed you havent lived in a shabby street doing chores you dont like and trying to please people who are often rude  well ive stood for it a long time for mothers sake but now cousin belle is coming and she knows all there is to know about keeping store  do you think a girl ought to be kept at home  that she never hears the call of adventure like the rest of you  adventure palls  one soon gets enough said jim  then he saw jakes smile and added after all i dont know  i know said carrie  you are going back and i am going too  but you wont have to take care of me  i mean to manage things  she has some talent that way jake observed  if youre not very firm jim shell manage you  but whats your particular job carrie  supplies  when it comes to handling foodstuff menfolk dont know how to buy  then they waste and the hash a man campcook puts up is seldom fit to eat  theres some truth in that jake remarked with feeling  it looks as if you had got your program fixed  i have said carrie with resolute quietness  im going  jake smiled at his comrade  you had better agree  when carrie talks like that she cant be moved by argument  anyhow the trails broken to the wirehead and if she gets tired she can come back  i may get tired said carrie  but i shall not come back  theres another thing i have a share in the bluebird and want a stake on the telegraph line  well ive saved a hundred dollars  carries pile jake remarked  she means to throw it in thats the kind of girl my sister is  as a business proposition our ventures humorous  we havent capital enough to stand for one setback and if lucks against us well sure go broke  to begin with ive got to put up a big bluff on the construction department in order to get the job look as if i owned a bank roll and didnt care if we got paid or not well one takes steep chances in this country and i allow theres something to be said for the small man who goes out with an ax five dollars and a bag of flour to make a road or build a log bridge folks dont know how much he means and all he has to stand for  carries eyes sparkled you and jim know  im going to find out  then mrs winter came in  she was a pale quiet woman whom jim had thought dull until he saw her work  she listened making a few remarks while jake talked about their plans  well she said at length your cousin is coming and shell help me run the store  it has certainly got to be run youll need some money if you go broke  were not going broke carrie rejoined with a hint of emotion  jake has got to make good for your sake  some day well sell out the business and you shall rest as long as you like  mrs winter smiled rather wearily  i dont know if id like to do nothing ive hustled so long  still ive sometimes thought id like to find out how it feels just to sit quiet for a piece  now the ovens good and hot theres a batch of biscuit ready and youd better come and help  she took carrie away and when they had gone jake looked at his comrade  i allow the womens part is most as hard as ours and carrie hit it when she said i had to make good  jim nodded  i like your sister and your mothers very fine  i want to help you help them all i can  sure i know said jake and then his eyes twinkled for he had noted jims slight awkwardness  you went rather farther than you meant didnt you  your english streak makes you shy but you wont hurt my feelings im all canadian  now however you are going to bed  jim went to bed and soon went to sleep  he was not well yet and had had an exciting day     chapter iv  on the trail  heavy rain swept the valley the evening was cold and jim stood near the big rusty stove at tillicum house drying his wet clothes  he had eaten a very bad supper and imagined the wooden hotel on the north trail was perhaps the worst at which he had stopped  the floor was torn by lumbermens spiked boots burned matches and the ends of cheap cigars lay about  the board walls were cracked and stained by resin and drops of tarry liquid fell from the bend where the stove pipe went through the ceiling  a door opened on a passage where a small wet towel hung above a row of tin basins filled with dirty water  there was no effort for comfort and jake who was tired and did not like the hard chairs sat smoking on a box  outside shabby frame houses ran down hill to the angry green river where drifting icefloes shocked  dark woods rolled up the other bank and trails of mist crawled among the pines  patches of snow checkered the rocks above in the distance a white range glimmered against leaden cloud  the settlement looked strangely desolate in the driving rain but the small ugly houses were the last jims party would see for long the wagon road ended there and a very rough pack trail led into the wilds  there was another hotel to which the men jim had engaged had gone  wheres carrie he asked by and by  i guess shes tired jake replied  it has been pretty fierce for carrie since we left the cars  jim frowned  they had been some days on the road and the rain had not stopped  it was cold rain belts of road were washed away and the rest was full of holes in which the loaded wagons sometimes stuck  the men got wet and their clothes could not be dried and carrie was not sheltered much by a rubber sheet while when they struck a washout all were forced to carry their tools and stores across slippery gravel carrie had not grumbled but it was rough work and jim knew she must have felt some strain  she oughtnt to have come he said  why werent you firm  ive a notion you agreed but if you imagine i could have kept her back you dont know carrie yet  anyhow the bad weather wont last and we must make the head of the wire soon  summers short  jim nodded  they had grounds for speed that disturbed them both supplies and transport had cost more than they calculated wages were high and their money was running out  it was obviously needful to push on the work until enough of the line was finished to justify their asking for some payment  while jim mused a man came in  the stranger was big and looked rather truculent although he wore neat storeclothes and new long boots  his glance was quick and got ironical when he fixed his eyes on jake  been some time beating it from the railroad havent you he asked  i expect the trip has been made in better time jake admitted  we struck a number of washouts and didnt want to leave our truck along the road  you were short of transport  we had all we could pay for  transport comes high  when you leave the railroad everything comes high as youre going to find out  guess your trouble is you havent enough capital  the troubles pretty common jake rejoined  you dont find rich men hitting the trail to the woods  a sure thing said the other  well youre not going to get rich cutting the new telegraph line  your outfits not strong enough you havent stores and tools  tell you what ill do ill give you seven hundred and fifty dollars to let up  i dont know if youre generous or if youre rash jake remarked with a twinkle  the truck were hauling in cost us more than that  ill take it at a valuation and you can find the men to fix the price  jake looked at jim who pondered and hesitated  he was dispirited and tired and felt that the chance of their carrying out the contract was not good  it would be something of a relief to get their money back  i dont know who you are and why you want to buy us off he said  then ill put you wise  im probyn cartner and dawsons man  they wanted the new branchline job and if you get out it will go to them  anyhow you cant put it over  the bush is thick in the valley and theres loose gravel on the range that will roll down when you cut your track  loose gravels bad jake remarked  if theres much of it i dont see why cartner and dawson want the contract  for one thing they reckon its theirs  then they have money enough to get to work properly  you have taken up too big a job and nows your chance to quit  if youre prudent you wont let it go  jim pondered for he thought he had got a hint  cartner and dawson were contractors and with one or two more did much of the public work in fact it was said that the few large firms pooled the best jobs and combined to keep off outsiders  jim had been somewhat surprised when jake secured the contract and imagined this was because it was not large enough for the others to bother about  the branch line was short  oh well he said as carelessly as he could weve got to try to put it over  seven hundred and fifty dollars wouldnt pay us for the time weve spent  probyn leaned forward  you want to call me up  well ill stand for a thousand dollars but thats my best  jake looked at jim and both hesitated  a thousand dollars was a useful sum and in a way they would get it for nothing  cartner and dawson would pay but if the offer were refused their opposition must be reckoned on  it was obvious that they did not mean to allow poaching on the preserves they claimed  then jim thought about carrie and felt half ashamed of his caution  she was a partner and although she did not know the difficulties she would not hesitate  he did not know if he was weak or not but he did not want her to think he had no pluck while he mused carrie came in looking pale and tired but she stopped and gave probyn a direct glance  who is this she asked  he comes from cartner and dawson the big contractors and wants to buy us off jake replied  he offers a thousand dollars if well get out  ah exclaimed carrie  what did you say  we havent said much  we were thinking about it when you came in  carries eyes sparkled and her tired look vanished  it wont stand for thinking about  tell him you undertook the job and are going to make good  jake shrugged humorously and turned to jim  well i guess we needed bracing  what do you say partner  well hold on  probyn frowned  is the dame a member of the firm  she is jake said smiling  in fact when were up against it shes the boss partner  very well  i want you to get this miss  heres a thousand dollars theyre yours for picking up and you take no risk  if you refuse and hold down the contract youll certainly go broke  its possible said carrie  all the same we mean to hold it down  probyn shrugged  then i quit  if you can put the job over youre luckier than i think  he went off and carrie sat down  looks as if i came along when i was needed  the fellow talked in hints  what did he mean  its pretty obvious jake replied  his employers dont like our butting in  since they cant buy us theyll try to freeze us out  then i reckon we must fight  jake looked thoughtful  theyre strong antagonists but ive a notion theres somebody on our side  in fact i was puzzled when we got the contract  its not often a job of this kind goes past the others but the department may be using us to see if its possible to shake the combine  he paused and laughed as he resumed anyhow we have made the plunge and if were not going under have got to go ahead  jim agreed and for a time they talked about something else but next morning jake got a jar when he went to load the packhorses and found two of his helpers gone  they pulled out at sunup one of the rest explained  a stranger came along looking for choppers offered fifty cents more than you promised and steve and pete went off with him  hell probably shake them in a week jake replied  still fifty cents a days some inducement and all of you can chop  the packer laughed  thats a sure thing  we reckoned we were fixed well and had better stop with a boss we knew  besides now weve a dame for commissary the hash is pretty good  jake went back to the hotel disturbed about probyn but satisfied with his men  the two who had gone were strangers but two of the rest had been with him in the north and the others had worked upon the telegraph line  one could trust them  for all that he was quiet when they set off on the muddy trail that plunged into the bush  a cold wind blew the rain in their faces the horses stumbled in the holes and the wet men grumbled as they plodded through the mud  they knew the wilderness and felt themselves a small company for the work they must do moreover jake imagined they might have to meet the antagonism of rich and unscrupulous rivals  you dont say much he remarked to jim  one doesnt say much the morning one pulls out to start a big job anyhow ill own its not my habit  for one thing i know what were up against jim replied  then he saw jakes twinkle and smiled  my notion is you have been quieter than me  oh well said jake youre not always very bright but this trips a picnic after some weve made  if we go broke we can come down again the last time we took the north trail we had to make good or freeze  you hadnt your sister with you then  thats so jake agreed  i reckon it makes some difference  perhaps you had better go ahead and talk to her  carries rather fed up but she maynt be as frank to you  jim urged the packhorse he was leading and came up with carrie who was a short distance in front  he wondered what he had better talk about but found it easier to amuse her than he had thought  carrie did not look tired now she had a touch of color and her eyes were bright  she laughed at his remarks although he admitted that his humor was clumsy and did not seem to mind when the horse splashed her with mud  carrie had pluck but he imagined her cheerfulness was forced  by and by a knot on the packrope slipped and some tools and cooking pans fell with a clash  when jim began to pick them up carrie stopped a yard or two in front  you neednt hurry ill go on she said  its cleaner away from the horses and one can look for the dry spots  jim gave her a quick glance  although she smiled her voice had a note of strain  it had not been easy for her to pretend and he had forced her to the effort  im sometimes dull but i mean well he said apologetically  of course you meant well  jake sent you didnt he  he knows something about my moods  jim colored and seeing his embarrassment she laughed  you dont deserve that i get mad now and then  the things my fault any way  i started well but hadnt grit enough to keep it up however hadnt you better pick those pans out of the mud  jim replaced the articles and when he had refastened the load waited for jake  it looks as if carrie had turned you down the latter remarked  im not surprised jim rejoined  ive been talking like a drummer when she wanted to be alone  oh well said jake you havent a very light touch but i expect she saw your intention was good  she did not she saw you had sent me  your sister is cleverer than you think  jake grinned and pulled his horse round a hole  theyre all cleverer than we think  sometimes its an advantage and sometimes a drawback anyhow i guess i wont meddle again  carrie will make good if we leave her alone  he turned for the horse behind them pushed forward and bit the animal he led  watch out he shouted  drive your beast on  jim did so and then stopped a few yards off while the animals plunged round each other and a man behind ran up  jake sticking to the bridle was dragged about his horses load struck against a tree and a flourbag burst  while he tried to stop the white stream running from the hole the other horse seized his arm and shook him savagely  its driver joined in the struggle with a thick branch and the men and animals floundered about the trail while the flour ran into the mud  let up with the club jake shouted  the dried apples have gone now you have hit the bag  hold your beast then gasped the other  this troubles not going to stop until mine gets in front  jake with an effort pulled the kicking animal between two trees and there was quietness when the other passed  it looked round for a moment and then plodded forward steadily while the desiccated apples ran down on the trail  now well stop and fix those bags jake remarked  why in thunder did you let the brute go bill  he was mushing along good and quiet and i wanted to light my pipe reckon he forgot he wasnt in his place  then they heard a laugh and saw carrie close by  jake was covered with mud and flour and his hat which had been trampled on hung over his hot face  you look the worse for wear she said  i guess i feel like that jake replied indicating his torn overalls putting some of the damage right will be a job for you but my hats past your help  you wouldnt think it cost three dollars not long since  but what was the kicking and biting about  you heard the explanation  bills cayuse forgot he wasnt in his proper place  when he remembered he tried to get there  i dont understand yet  a packhorse knows his place in the row  hes a creature of habit and hates to see another animal where he ought to be but bill was late in loading up and we didnt stop for him  if id known what was coming to me id have waited  now you have got the thing  carrie laughed and jim noted there was no reserve in her amusement her moodiness had vanished  its ridiculous but you must indulge him another time she said food is dear  they went on with lighter hearts  the struggle and carries laugh had braced them and by and by bright sunbeams touched the trunks beside the narrow trail     chapter v  carries weak moment  the rain had stopped and big drops fell from the dark firs about the camp  daylight was going all was very quiet but for the distant sound of falling water and the smoke of the sulky fire went straight up white chips and empty provision cans lay beside the freshlychopped logs  jake had left camp after supper the men had gone to fish and carrie had taken off her wet boots and sat by the fire trying to dry her clothes  for the last three or four days the party had traveled across very rugged country and had now reached the spot where the new line would branch off  carrie was cold and depressed  one of the men who joined probyn was cook and although she had undertaken his duties cheerfully she found them harder than she thought  then when they pitched camp the wood the men brought was wet the fire would not burn well and the extra good supper she had meant to cook was spoiled  this was the climax of a number of small troubles and hardships and carries patience had given way  by and by jim came out of the gloom and stopped by the fire  crying carrie  why is that  carrie who had not heard his steps started and tried to hide her feet behind her draggled skirt  i wasnt she said rather sharply  anyhow if i was you oughtnt to have noticed  perhaps not  jake told me not long since my touch wasnt light  but what has gone wrong  its all gone wrong she answered drearily  i oughtnt to have come  supper was the last thing  the supper was quite good jim declared  quite good  well i suppose thats all you can say for it honestly if you liked it its curious you didnt eat very much  then you see i can cook and i wanted to make a little feast to celebrate your beginning the job  nobody could cook at a fire like that  besides folks are not fastidious in camp  when youre chopping and cutting rock all day you can eat whatever you get  your touch is certainly not light id sooner you were fastidious carrie rejoined  looks as if id taken the wrong line jim said gently  i hate to see you disturbed  do you hate it very much  yes said jim  thats why im awkward  carrie gave him a quick glance and turned her head  the firelight touched his face and she noted his grave sympathy  oh she said im a silly little fool  i would comealthough i knew you didnt want me  i thought you would find things hard jim replied with some embarrassment  i do find them hard thats the trouble because theyre really not hard  the faults mine i havent enough grit  you are full of grit jim declared  ive known men knocked out by an easier journey  youre trying to be nice and i dont like that  i didnt want you to come just now but since you have come sit down and smoke  i meant to be a partner and help you both along  but you have helped  carrie looked up quickly  oh you are dull  you dont see i want to confess  its sometimes a comfort to make yourself look as mean as possible  afterwards you begin to imagine youre perhaps not quite so bad  i dont know if its worth while to bother about such things jim remarked  you dont bother  when youre on the trail youre occupied about the horses and how far you can go  nothing else matters and jake of course never bothers at all  he grins  but i insisted on coming and when the man at the hotel wanted to buy you off i made you refuse  you know i did  you were hesitating  on the whole im glad you were firm  it was easy to be firm at the hotel but i ought to have kept it up i was vain and sure of myself when id come up in a wagon over a graded road  the road was pretty bad said jim  anyhow it was a road and i sat in a wagon carrie rejoined  when the road stopped and we hit the real wild country i got frightened like a child  what use is there in starting out if you cant go on  you have gone on  i dont think many girls from the cities would have borne the journey with an outfit like ours  but i dont quite get your object for leaving home  ah said carrie you have done what you wanted although it was perhaps hard  you have tasted adventure seen the wild north and found gold  you havent known monotony done dreary things that never change and tried to make fifty cents go as far as a dollar  if you had talents you could use them but it wasnt like that with me  i dont know if i have talent but i felt i could do something better than bake biscuit and sell cheap groceries  i longed to do something different to go out and take my chances and see if i couldnt make my mark  then i wanted money for mothers sake  so i came but as soon as i got wet and tired i was afraid  jim pondered  carrie had pluck it meant much that she had owned her fears  she meant to conquer them and he imagined she looked to him for help  his business was to give her back her confidence but this could not be done by awkward flattery  in the meantime he looked about the fire had sunk the moon was rising and through a gap between the trunks one could see a dark gulf out of which thin mist rolled  the vapor streamed across long rows of ragged pines that ran up among the rocks until they melted in the gloom  in the distance a glimmering line of snow cut against the sky  the landscape had grandeur but not beauty  it was stern and forbidding  i think we are all afraid now and then he said  i never hit the north trail without shrinking  perhaps its instinct or something like that  in the cities man lives in comfort by using machines but hes up against nature all the time in the wilds  she must be fought and beaten and he must leave behind the weapons he knows  up north a small accident or carelessness may cost you your life an ax forgotten a bag of flour lost mean frostbite and hunger that may stop the march you have got to be braced and watchful its a grim country and it kills off the slack  but we are only on its edge and things are different here  if we are beaten we can fall back  the trail to the cities is open  would you fall back carrie asked  not unless im forced jim answered with a laugh  nor will i said carrie  ive been a fool tonight but if im up against silly old things like instincts im going to put them down  you will make good all right  but what did your mother think when you resolved to come with us  carrie hesitated and then gave jim a level glance  you didnt see mother much  she was busy shes always busy and you dont know her yet  shes quiet you dont feel her using control but one does what she wants and i cant remember when that was wrong well i suppose she felt on the surface i oughtnt to go  it was the proper conventional view but when its needful mother can go deep  i think she was willing to give me a chance of finding out and trying my powers she knew i wouldnt be so restless afterwards if i was happier or not  carrie paused and there was a touch of color in her face as she resumed besides she knew she could trust jake and i think she trusts you  jim said nothing  it looked as if the little faded woman who had been occupied about the store all day had qualities he had not imagined although he now remembered he had sometimes got a hint of reserved force  all was quiet for a minute or two while he mused and then they heard steps and jake came up  ive been prospecting up the line  we have got our job he said  whats the trouble  bush pretty thick  rocks  theyre lying loose right up the slope and its going to cost us high to roll them away  then its possible another lot will come down  jim frowned  they had undertaken to clear a track of stated width along which packhorses could travel as well as fix the telegraph posts and a bank of big loose stones would be a troublesome obstacle much depended on the steepness of the hillside and he had not yet seen the ground  if we have to build up and underpin the line it will certainly cost us something he said  however well find that out as we go on the main thing is to start  i allow thats so  when you start you finish jake remarked  still dollars will count in this fight and we may go broke  its possible  anyhow well hold on until we are broke  carrie laughed  and thats all there is to it jim  i like your way of looking at things  its simple and saves trouble  it puts it off jim rejoined dryly  the trouble sometimes comes at the end  but its rather curious how often you can make good by just holding on  oh well said carrie  i hear the boys coming  go and see if they have caught some fish  jim went off and presently returned with a string of big gray trout sitting down he began to sharpen his knife but carrie stopped him  leave them alone  how many will the boys eat for breakfast  to some extent it depends on how many they get  if theyre up to their usual form i reckon theyll eat the lot  but what has that to do with it  ill fix the trout  no said carrie  give me your knife  certainly not  do you like dressing fish  i expect ill hate it but im going to try  do you want me to struggle with a small blunt knife  jim looked hard at her  her mouth was firm and he knew what her touch of color meant  i undertook to help cook she resumed and smiled  its curious how often you can make good by just holding on  now however you and jake can go away  they went off but presently jim sat down and lighted his pipe although he approved carries resolve to be useful he felt annoyed she had pretty white hands he did not like her dressing trout  yet somebody must cook and now the gang was two men short he did not know whom he could spare  it was not a job for carrie but she was obstinate  there was no use in going back because she could beat him in argument and he went to his bed of fir branches in a bark shack the men had built  carrie had a tent with a double roof that would keep out rain and sun  jim had seen to this although the tent was expensive  he got up rather early but when he went out a big fire burned between the parallel hearth logs  aromatic woodsmoke hung about the camp in a thin blue haze  there was an appetizing smell of cooking and carrie got up from beside the logs as he advanced  she gave him a cheerful glance and then stood looking past him to the east  mist streamed out of the deep valley and rolled across the climbing pines in the distance snow cut softly blue against the dazzling sky  carrie looked fresh and vigorous  there was color in her face and her eyes were bright  how long have you been about jim asked  an hour she said smiling  i was often up at daybreak at home and it was different there  the street looked mean the store smelt stale and all was dreary  sunup is glorious in the bush  sometimes  i have wakened halffrozen and felt most too scared to look about  ah said carrie i was scared last night but last night has gone and cant come back  ill own i dont like the dark  jim studied her  her pose was unconsciously graceful her tall figure and plain gray dress harmonized with the background of straight trunks and rocks  her head was slightly tilted back as she breathed the resinscented air  jim thought she looked strangely virile and alert  you belong to the dawn he said  carrie laughed a laugh of frank amusement untouched by coquetry oh jim  youre not often romantic  i suppose that is so he agreed  anyhow my feeling was quite sincere  you are like the dawn  she turned her head for a moment and then said carelessly lets look if the bannocks i made are cooked  jim scattered a pile of wood ashes and lifted two or three large thick cakes from the hot stones beneath  he broke off a piece from one and when it cooled began to eat  i imagine this is the best bannock that was ever made in the bush he remarked  do you feel you must be nice  no said jim  in a way i dont care if im nice or not  the bannock is first grade i think thats all that matters  if you dont mind ill take another bit  carrie laughed  looks as if one could make you happy by giving you things to eat  but lets see if the trout are fried ive got the spider full  she put the fish on a big tin plate and while she made coffee jim beat a piece of iron that hung from a branch  the sharp ringing notes pierced the shadows and halfdressed men came out of the shack and plunged down the slope to the river  some of them would be mad if they knew id roused them out ten minutes early jim remarked  a breakfast like this however is too good to spoil  now if youll let me have the coffee ill take the truck along  he came back with the empty plates in about a quarter of an hour for canadian choppers do not loiter over meals and carrie sitting on the hearth log looked up anxiously  well she asked were the boys satisfied  they were  i dont think i could have stood for it if they were not one allowed he hoped probyn would keep the cook we lost  the others were enthusiastic  carrie blushed  im glad  i was tired when things went wrong last night  the trouble is you cant go on  its one thing to superintend and cook a meal now and then but quite another to cook all the time  but this is what i want to do  it cant be allowed jim declared  carrie put down the forks she was cleaning  you look very firm and solemn but you cant bluff me  are you and jake very rich  you know were not rich  if you want to put your contract over you have got to work and its obvious you cant work and cook  then if you bring in a man to cook he couldnt do much else and wages are high  arent they high  i suppose they are jim agreed  very well  i came because i wanted to be useful and if you wont let me ill go back  then jake and one of the boys would have to go down with me to the railroad  that would be awkward wouldnt it  it certainly would be awkward  do you mean youll insist on taking two of us away from the job unless i give in  carrie smiled  yes jim  if youre going to be obstinate theres no other plan  besides you see the trails rough and i couldnt go very fast  im beaten said jim  you will do what you like  youre a good sort carrie and if you find the job too hard you can stop  i may find it hard but i dont know if ill stop  anyhow your control is gone  if you are not very nice ill spoil the hash and then youll have trouble with the boys  jim got up moved by her pluck and yet half annoyed for he had meant to make things easy for her  before he went off she laughed and remarked youll find jake will understand why you gave way sometimes he bluffs mother he never bluffs me     chapter vi  rolling stones  sweet resinous smells drifted down the hill  the mists were melting and jim lighted his pipe and thoughtfully looked about  the sun had just risen above the distant snow and a streak of blue smoke drawn across the woods marked the camp  breakfast would not be ready for half an hour but he knew carrie had been occupied for some time although he had stolen out of camp without talking to her  jim did not like her working as she had worked for the last week or two and if he had stopped they might have begun an argument  he would have gained nothing by this for carrie was obstinate and he admitted that he was now and then impatient  carrie was plucky and they needed help but cooking for the hired men was not the kind of thing she ought to do  then he had been disturbed in the night by a rattle of stones and now saw he must grapple with a difficulty that was worse than he had thought  the hillside ran up steeply to a wall of crags split by frost and thaw  tall firs clung to the slope where they could find a hold but there were gaps in which broken trunks lay among the rubbish a snowslide had brought down  then for some distance large sharp stones rested insecurely on the slope and jim imagined that a small disturbance would set them in motion  below the spot where he sat the stones ran down into a gulf obscured by rolling mist  the turmoil of a river rose from the gloomy depths  a row of telegraph posts crossed the stony belt but one or two had fallen in the night and jim carefully studied the ground  his business was to put up the posts and clear a track in order to protect them from damage and enable packhorses to travel along the line  it was plain that the stones were an awkward obstacle but this was not all  as a rule the provincial government allowed the small ranchers to undertake the construction of telegraphs rude bridges and roads  the plan helped the men to stop upon their halfcleared holdings but it was not economical and rich contractors had recently got the large jobs  jim imagined they meant to keep the business in their hands and he knew something about political influence and graft  his contract was not important but he had grounds for believing the others resented his entering the field and if he got behind schedule the agreement might be broken  well he must not get behind and when he went back for breakfast he had made his plans  afterwards he got to work and rolled the stones down hill all day without returning to camp for dinner  it was getting hot and in the afternoon fierce sunshine beat upon the long slope  the shadow of the pines looked inviting and jim felt that half an hour might be occupied profitably by a quiet smoke and review of the undertaking but resisted the temptation  the argument was false he was a working boss and must set the pace for his men  his back began to ache he tore his old blue shirt and bruised his hands while as the shadows lengthened he got disturbed  rolling heavy stones was slow and expensive work  it kept him from getting forward and wages were high  when the sun was low he stopped to wipe his bleeding hand and saw jake leaning on his shovel  ive let up for a minute or two to think  sometimes it pays jake observed  it depends on what you think about jim rejoined  i dont know if theres much profit in wondering whats for supper  jake smiled  perhaps not  i reckon you thought how you could hit up the pace  my notion is youve put it most as high as the boys will stand for  in this country its usual to work as hard as the boss  something depends on the boss jake said dryly  when were up against a hard streak you are near the limit  jim gave him a sharp glance  do you mean anything in particular arent you satisfied with the boys  on the whole theyre a pretty good crowd  there are two im not quite sure about  jims eyes rested on two men who were languidly throwing stones down the hill  i think we agree but they have earned their pay so far and i mean them to go on  he stopped and the men put down their tools for a sharp ringing noise rolled across the woods  when they reached camp jim was surprised to note two hobbled horses among the springing fern  the big packsaddles stood near the fire and a man was helping carrie to fill the tin plates  he stopped when jim advanced and carrie said this is mr davies he was at the woolsworth store with me  jim said he was glad to see him and studied the fellow when they sat down  davies was young and rather handsome  he wore overalls long leggings and an expensive buckskin jacket but although his skin was brown he did not look like a bushman  in fact jim thought him a type that is common in western towns superficially smart and marked by an aggressive confidence  he was somewhat surprised the fellow was a friend of carries jim had not expected her to like that kind of man but hospitality is the rule in the bush and he tried to be polite when supper was over and they lit their pipes he asked  have you come to see the country mr davies  im out on business going through to the new settlement  i belong to the martin outfit and were bidding on the construction of a new bridge  ah said jim for martin was a contractor and one of the ring  this is not the shortest way to settlement he added  it is not davies agreed  i reckoned id go in up the vaughan river and hired two indians who know the way  wanted to look at the country theres some talk about making a new wagon road  then you see i knew miss winter and heard she was at your camp  something about davies manner hinted that the girl and he were good friends and jim was sorry carrie was not there since he wanted to see how she accepted the fellows statement  for no very obvious reason davies jarred him  looking for a wagon road line is a different job from keeping store he remarked  i did keep store but ive had other occupations and know the bush if i didnt know it they would have no use for me in the martin gang  jim nodded  the fellow was plausible and in british columbia a man often puts his talents to very different uses  he thought davies had talent although perhaps not of a high kind  by and by the latter got up  if the boys are going fishing ill try my luck with them he said id like a few gray trout and have brought a pole  two or three of the men picked up rods they had made from firbranches and when the party set off jim walked across to the fire where carrie was sitting  davies has gone off to the river he remarked  its curious  why do you think this curious  jim hesitated feeling that tact was needful  he was not jealous about davies  carrie and he were friends he liked her much but she had not inspired him with romantic sentiment  his imagination dwelt upon the girl he had met at the montreal restaurant  for all that he was puzzled  well he said it looks as if he had come out of his way in order to see you  did he tell you this  no said jim  he hinted at something like it  i suppose you knew him well  carrie gave him a quick glance  his face was thoughtful and he frowned  she was quiet for a moment or two and then smiled  i do not know him well  he was at the woolsworth store but his was a better post than mine and we didnt often meet  in fact i dont think i liked him much  ah said jim whose satisfaction was plain  well of course it is not my business  but youre rather glad i didnt like him  of course said jim  the fellows a poor type not your type  he stopped with some embarrassment and carrie laughed  well let that go  you are puzzled jim  i am  why did the fellow hint hed come because he wanted to see you he said something about looking for a line for a wagon road but hed have struck the valley the road will go through sooner if hed pushed on east  i cant see what he did want  perhaps he had some reason for stopping at our camp and felt he must account for his coming out of his way  yes said jim  i believe youve hit it  well now you know i dont like davies and you have found out why hes here you ought to be satisfied  but i havent found out why hes here thats the trouble jim rejoined and was silent for a few moments  however perhaps you have put me on the track he went on  i was something of a fool when i wanted to leave you behind  you have helped us all the time  but you havent enough wood for morning ill go and chop some  he went off and carrie sat quietly by the fire  there was faint amusement in her eyes but they were soft  by and by the light began to fade and rousing herself she made some bannocks for breakfast  when davies came back with a string of fish she had vanished and the light that had burned in her tent was out  next morning davies left the camp and jim sent three or four men to build a wall to protect the line while he and some others put up the posts  their progress was slow because it was necessary to make the wall strong and jim was occupied for a week before he was satisfied with the length he had built  he thought it ought to stand but felt disturbed when he calculated what the extra work had cost  it was however a comfort to know he had covered the worst ground and soon after supper one evening he went off in better spirits than usual to a little bark shelter he had built for himself  he was tired and soon went to sleep but after some hours awoke  he supposed he was rather highly strung after working hard because he did not feel sleepy and lifting his head he looked about  the end of the shelter was open and the pines outside rose like vague black spires their tapered tops cutting against the sky  although there was no moon the first row of trunks stood out against the deeper gloom behind  one could smell the resin and the warm soil damped by heavy dew  all was very quiet but after a few moments jim began to listen he had lived in the wilds his senses were keen and sometimes he received unconsciously impressions of minute noises  although the stillness was only broken by the turmoil of the river far down in the valley he imagined it was not for nothing he had wakened  then he raised himself on his elbow as he heard another sound  it was very faint but somehow definite although he could not tell what it was  a few moments afterwards he knew a stone was rolling down hill and disturbing others as it went  then there was a sharp crash and a rattle that began to swell into a roar and jim leaping up ran along the hill  the bank he had built had broken and the stones behind it were plunging down  when he reached the line he struck his foot against a rock and stumbled  the ground was rough the night was dark but it was unthinkable that he should stop  he clenched his hands and ran although he did not know what he could do  when trouble threatened he must be on the spot  in the meantime the noise got louder  he heard great blocks strike the ledges down the slope and smash trees broke and branches crashed while behind the detached shocks there was a steady dull roar of small gravel grinding across the rocks and tearing up the brush  the wall had obviously gone and its collapse had started a slide that might not stop until all the stones above the line had run down  if so they might plane off a wide belt of hillside and carry the soil and broken timber into the valley  then jim would be forced to dig out another line  he gasped as he labored on but the uproar had begun to die away when he reached an opening in the thin forest  at sunset straggling trees had dotted the slope but they had gone and so far as he could see nothing but a few stumps broke the smooth surface of the hill  the wall had vanished with the line it was meant to protect  now and then a big stone rolled by but jim did not think about the risk  he must try to find out if much of the surface was left and if there was rock beneath  when he left the end of the line small stones slipped away from his feet and plunged down into the dark  this was ominous since gravel is awkward stuff to work among when it does not lie at rest  however with plenty of stakes and some underpinning he might be able to build up a new bank  by and by his foot struck something sharp and he looked up  he had kicked the edge of a large ragged stone and an indistinct broken mass ran up the hill  the blocks had obviously come down from the bottom of the crags and since they had gone no farther the pitch was easy enough for them to lie  this would enable him to clear a line across the mass and build a fresh bank  jim sat down and took out his pipe  he had lost his labor and money he could not spare but it was possible to run the line across the treacherous belt although he was half afraid to count the cost  when he struck a match jake came up and indistinct figures moved in the gloom behind  have you any use for us boss one asked  nothing doing now said jim  well get busy in the morning  the man looked about and then remarked  something started the blamed wall off and i guess she didnt stop until she hit the river  its surely bad luck  it is said jim  anyhow we took this job and are going to make good  i dont want you and youll probably need some sleep  i reckon thats so if you mean to speed us up the other agreed with a laugh and when he went back to the others jim lighted his pipe  a nasty knock but not a knockout jake remarked  at sunup well have a better notion  oh yes said jim rather impatiently and added ive been wondering why i wakened  i reckon thats plain enough  the noise would have roused me three miles off  it was before the noise began jim replied in a thoughtful voice i think something woke me but dont know what it was  tom remarked that something had started off the wall  i allow he maynt have reflected much but perhaps its significant he and you agree  jim was silent for a minute or two and then asked did all the boys come along  so far as i remember  i didnt count  well said jim  its too soon to state what i think  after all i dont know very much  jake said nothing  he knew his partner was generally marked by a grim reserve after a bad setback  when jim was ready he would talk and in the meantime jake imagined his brain was occupied  crossing the track of the landslide cautiously they returned to camp but when they reached it jim lighted his pipe again and did not go to sleep     chapter vii  a council  jim got up at daybreak and went to the spot where the landslide had carried away the line  a hundred yards had gone and a great bank of soil and gravel ran down at an even slant to the river where the current foamed about the rubbish that blocked its channel  the slope was dotted by broken trees and rocks and in one place farther up a belt of smaller stones rested loosely at the top of a steep pitch  jim thought a slight disturbance would start another slide  he had wasted a week or twos labor and saw it would cost him some time to clear the ground before he could get to work again  even then there would be a risk of the new lines being swept away  this was daunting because money was short and he had no margin to provide against expensive accidents  when he took the contract he had trusted much to luck and now his luck was bad  moreover the thing was puzzling and his curiosity was aroused  he imagined he had made the line secure and had worked among treacherous gravel in shallow mines long enough to know something about the job the wall had obviously broken and started the landslide when it gave way but he could not see why it had broken  this however must wait he meant to solve the puzzle but to begin with the line must be run across the gap and he occupied himself with the necessary plans  his habit was to concentrate and sitting absorbed he studied the ground until he felt a touch on his arm  then he looked up with a start and saw carrie  im sorry jim she said  is it very bad  its bad enough said jim who began to get up but she stopped him  never mind sit still  youre very polite but i dont know if you need always use your best manners  i dont know if i do jim rejoined  sometimes im too savage im rather savage now  but dont you like me to be polite  if you get what i mean i want you to feel im a working partner  you are a partner jim declared  in fact youre a remarkably useful member of the firm  carrie gave him a smile  thank you  but you mustnt feel this bad luck too much  youve met worse  much worse but it was in the north where we knew what we were up against and had nothing to lose  its different now ive staked all ive got on this undertaking  so has jake and then you have joined us  i hate to think about your going back to the city broke  oh said carrie smiling that doesnt count at all  besides were not going broke  we may have some setbacks but well make good  well try but thats another thing  i dont know why youre so confident  carrie studied him with a twinkle of amusement  i am confident youre not a quitter and its wonderful what one can often do by just staying with a thing  the trouble is you cant stay with this particular job when your moneys gone  thats the difference between it and placer mining in the north  up there we had no wages to pay and could stop and root up the tundra until we froze and when our money is spent the boys will light out  but youll stay until every dollar is gone  jim laughed  it might be prudent to pull out before but i rather think ill hold on  ah said carrie thats what i like  youre bracing up i knew you would  however i must go back  breakfast must be cooked  jim went with her feeling comforted  carrie did not know much about the mechanical difficulties but her confidence was inspiriting  in a sense the thing was illogical the difficulties would not vanish because she did not see them  it was ridiculous for him to feel cheered but he was cheered and he glanced at carrie as they went along  she was pretty and her impulsive frankness was often charming but somehow he did not think of her as an attractive girl  she was a partner whom he trusted and a staunch friend  yet he had been annoyed by davies stopping at the camp and had felt relieved when she told him she did not like the fellow  this was strange but jim gave up the puzzle and helped carrie with breakfast when they reached the camp  when the meal was over he got to work and did not come back until supper was ready  jake and he had not time for quiet talk all day but there was something to be said and when the men went off to fish jim sat down opposite carrie while jake lay among the pineneedles close by  the shadows had crept across the camp and the hollows between the rows of trunks were dark  the snow had changed from white to an ethereal blue and the turmoil of the river hardly disturbed the calm  have you any notion yet what started off the wall jake asked  i have said jim  the trouble began at the underpinning  a king post broke and let down the stones  so far we are agreed  but do you know why the post broke  we used good logs  i dont know  although it may take some time im going to find out we cant have this kind of thing happening again  jake nodded  perhaps i have got a clew  when davies was here he said hed like to go fishing and some of the boys went along  that is so jim said with a puzzled look  the two who moved first were the boys we allowed we were not quite sure about  i dont know if it means anything but when they got to the river they and davies lost the others  it may mean much jim said quietly  the clews worth following  carries eyes sparkled as she interrupted do you imply davies hired the boys to wreck the line  i allow its possible jim replied in a thoughtful voice  and i cooked an extra good supper for him carrie exclaimed  im beginning to understand why folks get poisoned  but now you know what are you going to do about it  we dont know said jim  thats the trouble  we have got to wait  jake made a sign of agreement and carrie said nothing  she knew her brother and imagined she understood jims quietness  after a time the latter resumed ive been thinking and the matter puzzles me  were up against the big contractors  theyd be glad to see us broke and probyn took two of our outfit when we stopped at the hotel  but he was willing to buy us out and his offering the boys higher wages was in a way a fair deal  i allow he left two we didnt trust  the two who went fishing with davies carrie remarked  that is so jim agreed  davies however works for another boss its possible the big men would pool their resources to freeze us off but i know something about martin and doubt if he would play a lowdown game  davies might said jake  i think he did carrie interposed and her voice was sharp  in fact its obvious  hes poison mean i knew this at the store  i didnt like him jim replied and added thoughtfully after all the contracts not important from the big mens point of view  no doubt theyd sooner we let up but somehow i cant see their finding it worth while to get after us  it is puzzling jake admitted i think well let it go  if we have any fresh bad luck our money will run out long before we can make good  this would leave us without resources except for the bluebird claim  jim frowned  ill hold on while i have a dollar but i dont want to sell the mine  for one thing we couldnt get a price that would help us much although i expect northern copper claims will soon be valuable  the countrys fast being opened up and some day therell be a railroad built  perhaps its significant that baumstein made us another offer for the bluebird  when did he make the offer jim asked sharply  when you were ill i refused  thought id told you  he raised his limit a thousand dollars  shucks said jim  does the fellow think well give him the mine anyhow id sooner not sell to baumstein at all  hes a crook and has made his pile by freezing poor men off their claims  jake smiled  poor men with mines to sell get used to freezing and if we refuse to deal with anybody whose character isnt first grade were not going to progress much  i doubt if rich folks who like a square deal are numerous  there are some said jim  for all that the unscrupulous graball financier is a blight on the country  the prospector risks his life in the struggle with halffrozen tundra bog rotten rock and snow and the other fellow with his net of bribes and graft gets the reward but we wont stand for that kind of thing  lets be practical  were not running a purity campaign and it looks as if nobody but baumstein is willing to buy the mine  then my proposition is we hold tight until the combine come into the field  theyll be forced to get busy before long and while i dont know if all their deals are straight theyre better than baumsteins in the meantime we have got to stay with this telegraph contract while our money lasts  there was silence for a moment or two and carries eyes rested on jim he looked tired and his brown face was thin but his mouth was firm jim was resolute she sometimes doubted if he was clever but he could hold on  had he been weak or greedy he would have sold the copper vein and taken probyns offer to let the telegraph contract go perhaps this would have been prudent but she was glad jim had refused she wanted to think he would not give way  well  you claim youre a partner jake remarked with a twinkle  jims plan is my plan she said quietly  then it goes jake agreed and gave her a curious glance when jim got up and went off across the hill  i dont know if youre rash or not but youre playing up to jim  since ive known you to be cautious your object isnt very plain  carrie hesitated although she was generally frank with jake  oh well she said i feel he ought to take a bold line thats the kind of man he is  rather a romantic reason  particularly as his boldness may cost us much  im tired of thinking about what things cost carrie rejoined sometimes its fine to take ones chances  im going to be rash if i want  after all it may pay as well as the other plan  however if you mean to sketch a leadingcharacter part for jim and see he plays it as you think he ought perhaps he deserves some sympathy and you may get a jolt  jims not theatrical  i hate theatrical people carrie declared  jake laughed  you hate posers  you feel youd like jim to play a romantic part without his meaning it  well i expect hell miss his cues and let you down now and then but he certainly wont pose  youre rather clever sometimes carrie admitted with a blush  but i think we have talked enough and i want some wood  she sat for a time thinking while the thud of jakes ax rang across the bush and then went off to her tent with an impatient shrug  i mustnt be a romantic fool she said  for the next eight or nine days jim and the men were occupied running the line across the gap  when he had done so he stole quietly out of camp for three or four nights and returning before daybreak imagined nobody had remarked his absence  then one morning carrie came up as he was lighting the fire  you look tired jim she said  if you mean to work hard you must get some sleep  jim gave her a sharp glance and she smiled  you see i know your step  ah said jim who did not grasp all her statement implied you are very smart carrie and its plain that i am clumsier than i thought but do you think anybody else heard me  no  i listened and all was quiet  however if its needful for somebody to watch you must let jake go  jim shook his head  ive got to see this thing through  somehow i imagine i can do so better than jake  but you cant keep it up after working hard all day  it wont be for long  well break camp soon and move to the next section  youre a good sort carrie but you really mustnt meddle  carrie blushed  i wont meddle if you forbid it  all the same id hate to see you worn out and ill  youre boss and it would be awkward if you lost control  its only for another night or two  the fellow im watching for will have to try again or let up before we move camp  but if you caught him you and he would be alone  yes said jim whose face got hard thats what i want  if im on the right track the thing must be fixed without the boys knowing  carrie hesitated and then made a sign of acquiescence  i dont like it jim but reckon you cant be moved  anyhow youll be cautious  jim promised he would not be rash and went off half amused to get some water  carrie was very staunch but he did not want her to be disturbed about him  he was sorry she had heard him steal out of camp  in the evening jake came for a gun he kept in the tent  the game laws that limit the time for shooting are seldom enforced against bush ranchers and prospectors who kill deer and grouse for food  id better oil the barrels to keep off the damp he said  its a pretty good gun  carrie watched him push across the top lever and open the breech  is that where you put the cartridges she asked  you push the shells forward with your thumb and then shut the gunlike this  then all you have to do is to pull the trigger  not with this type of gun  you see the hammers have rebounded half way but you must pull them farther back before it will go off  suppose you miss and want to shoot again  you push the lever sideways the barrels swing down and the empty shells jump out  thats all  it looks easy carrie remarked  ive sometimes wondered how one used a gun  theres nothing more to shooting than there is to making bread  maybe not jake agreed with a grin  i reckon a bad cook is as dangerous as a bad shot  if you miss with a gun you have done no harm but ive eaten bannocks that get you every time  when he had finished he hung the gun to the tent pole and went off but carrie took it down and carefully opened and shut the breech  after doing so once or twice she was satisfied and put back the gun  then she went to a little bark store where their food was kept and picking up a bag of flour that had been opened weighed it in her hand  it was lighter than it ought to be and this had happened before  next she examined a piece of salt pork and imagined that some had gone while when she carefully looked about she noted a few tea leaves on the floor  carrie did not think she had spilt the tea and knitted her brows somebody had been stealing food but the man had not taken much and had tried to do so in a way that would prevent its being missed  for example he had gone to the flour bag twice and had cut the pork from both sides of the slab  carrie thought this significant but resolved to say nothing     chapter viii  jim keeps watch  the night was not cold and jim had some trouble to keep awake as he sat with his back against a tree a short distance above the mended line he had dug out a track and built a new wall to hold up the stones and in the morning the camp would be moved  now he was very tired but he meant to watch for another night  there was a half moon and puzzling lights and shadows checkered the hill  in some places the trees rose like scattered spires in others they rolled down the slope in blurred dark masses  behind the woods snowy mountains cut against the sky  the dim landscape was desolate and savagely grand  it had the strange halffinished look one notes in canada  in order to banish his drowsiness jim gave himself up to wandering memories  he knew the north where he had risked and endured much  he had seen the tangled pines snap under their load of snow and go down in rows before the arctic gales he had watched the ice break up and the liberated floods hurl the floes into the forest  he had crossed the barren tundra where only moss can live and the shallow bog that steams in summer rests on frozen soil  raging blizzards snowslides crevassed glaciers and rotten ice were things he knew there were scars on his body he had got in stubborn fights  so far he had conquered but he owned that he had had enough and tried to picture the old country his father talked about  its woods were not primitive jungles wrecked by gales and scorched by fires men planted and tended them and the trees had room to grow white farmsteads with gardens and orchards dotted the valleys the narrow fields were rich with grass and corn  then there were wonderful old houses stored with treasures of art  well he meant to see england some day and he began to think about the girl he had met at montreal  she seemed to stand for all that was best in the old country its refinement its serenity and ancient charm one did not find girls like that in canada they were the product of long cultivation and sprang from a stock whose roots went deep into the past  jim wondered with a strange longing whether he would see her again  perhaps it was the contrast that presently fixed his thoughts on carrie  carrie was a type that throve in virgin soil she was virile frank and unafraid  her emotions were not hid by inherited reserve one could imagine her fighting like a wildcat for the man she loved yet she had a fresh beauty and a vein of tenderness  jim was fond of carrie but not in love with her  he wondered whether he might have loved her had he not met the english girl but pulled himself up  this kind of speculation led to nothing and he began to look about  the shadows of the pines had got shorter and blacker as the moon rose the hill was checkered by their dark bars  he could not see far down the valley because it was full of mist  the great hollow looked like a caldron in which the river boiled  its hoarse roar echoed among the rocks and made a harmonious background for smaller and sharper notes a faint breeze sighed in the pinetops and now and then there was a tinkle of falling stones  jim saw some stones roll down and stop at the wall he had built  this ran in a gentle curve across the slope and shone like silver in the moonlight  in places it was broken by shadows that seemed to tremble and melt  jim knew he was getting sleepy and tried to rouse himself it was something of an effort because he had not slept much for a week but by and by the strain slackened and he got suddenly alert  an indistinct object moved where a shadow fell across the wall and jim knew it was a man  he was conscious of a grim satisfaction he had watched for the fellow when brain and body needed rest and now he had come  moreover his object was plain  the wall was underpinned supported by timbers and if a log that bore much weight were cut the stones would fall and bring down the rest  one could not hear an ax at the camp the falling wall would sweep away the chips and the fellow stealing back would join the men the noise brought out  jim thought he could get near him by using the rocks and trees to cover his advance but the other could hide among them if he were alarmed and it might be prudent to let him get to work  the stealthy figure avoided the moonlight  the thud of the ax echoed across the woods and jim taking care that he had a dark background went cautiously down hill  he did not carry a pistol  on the whole he thought one was safer without a gun but he had brought a thick wooden bar with an iron point that they used for rolling logs  getting behind a tree he stopped near the wall  the regular strokes of the ax indicated that the other was not disturbed and jim looking down from higher ground could see the upper part of his body as he swung the tool  the sharp blows implied that he was chopping hard  after measuring the distance jim sank down and crawled to the top of the wall  since the other had an ax surprise would be a useful and perhaps necessary advantage in the attack  jim meant to attack there was no use in talking before the fellow was in his power  as he crept forward a few stones rolled down the hill  he wondered what had disturbed them but thought it imprudent to turn round and lay quiet for a few moments when the chopping stopped  he could not see the man now because he was hidden by the top of the wall  the chopping began again and jim crawling a few feet seized the stones on the edge and threw himself over just after the ax came down he fell upon the man and tried to seize him but although both were shaken by the collision the other avoided his grasp and staggered back  jim followed and swinging his bar struck with all his strength  the other caught the blow on the curved shaft of the ax and jims hands were badly jarred  the vibration of the hard wood numbed his muscles his fingers lost their grip  it looked as if he had been clumsy and rash for the advantage was now with his antagonist because the ax was longer than the bar  moreover the canadian bushman is highly skilled in the use of the dangerous tool  for all that jim had begun the fight and meant to win  the fellow had taken a bribe to ruin him  he lifted the bar struck hard and missed as his antagonist stepped back  then the latter swung his ax and jim bent from the waist as the shining blade swept past  they were now in the moonlight and he saw the others face it was the man who had gone fishing with davies and he gave way to a fury that banished caution  the fellow had a longer reach and looked cool indeed he seemed to be studying jim with ironical humor  while the latter breathing hard watched for an opening he lowered his ax  suppose we quit fooling and talk about the thing he said  im not fooling jim rejoined  anyhow youd better quit  i could get you with the ax if i wanted but ive not much use for that  id sooner you stopped here while i light out  youd starve before you made the settlement  i guess not  theres enough flour and pork in a cache to see me through  the trouble is you cant make the cache said jim  ive watched for you since the first wall broke and you earned the money davies promised  put down the ax and start for camp  davies said the other  do you mean the guy who came along with the indian packers  are you pretending you dont know the man  it doesnt matter anyhow the other rejoined  im not going back to camp and theres something coming to you if you try to take me  jim meant to take him and wondered how far he could trust to bluff  if he could get near enough he might knock out the fellow with the bar and yet not do him a serious injury  the ax was dangerous but it was possible the other would hesitate about using it  in canada crimes of violence are generally punished and even in the wilds offenders seldom long escape the northwest police  yet there was a risk  you are coming with me he said and advanced with lifted bar  the other cut at him and he narrowly missed the blow  he tried to run in before the fellow could recover from his swing but was not quick enough  the ax went up and he met the blade with the bar  the keen steel beat down the wood and went through when it met the ground and jim was left with a foot or two of the handle  stepping back he hurled it at his antagonist and heard it strike with a heavy thud  the fellow staggered but did not fall and getting his balance advanced on jim  the blow had roused him to fury and he saw that caution was useless  they must fight until one was disabled  jim gave ground breathing hard and watching for a chance to grapple while he kept out of reach  the sweat ran down his face he was savage but cool  the worst was he must move backwards and could not see the holes in the uneven slope  when he had gone a few yards he heard a shout and his antagonist looked round  stop right there said somebody and jim saw carrie standing above them on the wall  she was in the moonlight and balanced a gun  her face was white but resolute  put down your ax  i mean to shoot she said  jim thought quickly  the distance was short but he had not seen carrie use a gun  she might miss and have some trouble to reload besides he must save her the need for shooting and the others hesitation was his opportunity  pulling himself together he leaped upon the fellow who stumbled and dropped his ax  jim seized him round the waist and a savage grapple began  they swayed to and fro kicking the ax that neither durst stoop to reach  the choppers face was bleeding jim labored for breath but he was moved by anger that gave him extra strength  the chopper felt his resolve in his tightening grip and knew it would go hard with him if he were beaten  it was plain that the boss meant to exact stern justice and he fought with instinctive fury for selfpreservation  the primitive passions of both were unloosed  they strained and grappled like savage animals and for a time their strength and stubbornness seemed evenly balanced  then luck gave jim an advantage for as the other trod upon the ax the long handle tilted up and got between his legs  he stumbled and jim with a tense effort lifted him from the ground  then gathering all his strength he tried to throw him backwards but lost his balance and both plunged down the slope  the pitch was steep and they rolled for some distance until they struck a rocky ledge  the chopper let go slipped across the ledge and vanished  jim jarred by the shock lay still for some moments and when he got up awkwardly saw nothing among the rocks and trees below a rattle of gravel came out of the gloom but it sounded some distance off  then he heard a step and saw carrie  she held the gun and was breathless  her look was strained and her face white  are you hurt jim she asked  no not much anyhow  go back to the track  give me the gun  why do you want the gun  jim made an impatient gesture  he had forgotten that carrie had come to his help and although he noted mechanically that she was highly strung and bearing some strain he did not dwell on this  his antagonist had got away  he wanted to go after him not to talk  the brutes not far off and unless im quick hell light out  give me the gun  i wont said carrie  she stood a few yards above jim and jerked out the cartridges stooping swiftly she picked them up and threw them among the trees then she laughed a strained laugh and held out the gun  you may have it now she added  you cant find the shells  then ill go without them jim rejoined and plunged down the hill  when he had gone a short distance he stopped  his leg hurt and he had a dull recollection of a blow  his leg was not cut perhaps the chopper had hit him with the flat of the ax or he had struck it on the rock  anyhow he was lame and could hardly keep his balance on the rough slope  there was no use in going on like that particularly as he heard a faint rattle of gravel some distance off  it was obvious that the chopper had got away and jim awkwardly climbed back  now he was getting cool he began to see what carrie had done and when he joined her he felt embarrassed  im sorry i expect i was very rough he remarked  oh she said that doesnt matter  i think i understand  besides you are hurt  legs stiff thats all  i ought to have remembered  but you see  carrie smiled  you mean you didnt think about me at all  you had concentrated on catching the fellow  something like that jim admitted  i ought to have thought and after a few minutes i did think  when you found you couldnt walk  well said jim awkwardly i now see how mean i was  he paused and resumed with sincere emotion if you hadnt come the brute would have cut me down  carries rather ironical amusement vanished and she colored  it doesnt matter jim  all thats important is i did come  but you are lame and mustnt stand  i can stand as long as you can stand said jim who pulled off his jacket and threw it on the ground  youll find this softer than the stones  he sat down opposite her and resumed now how did you happen  i found some flour and pork had gone  since one cant get food between here and the settlement it looked as if somebody meant to pull out before we broke camp  jim nodded  the fellow said hed made a cache  youre very smart but why didnt you tell jake  i suppose i ought to have told him carrie replied  he mused for a few moments and then broke out we have taken you for granted  when a thing needs doing you dont talk but get to work perhaps this has drawbacks it doesnt always strike one how fine you really are  carrie said nothing and he went on  now i come to think of it ive been strangely dull  you have cooked for us and cared for us in ways we didnt know  id sometimes a notion my clothes were wearing longer than they oughtthere was a jacket i meant to mend and when i got it out one evening i couldnt find the hole  he paused and spread out his hands  well thats the kind of fool i am and the kind of girl you are  the hole had bothered me for a long time  it was getting bigger and one doesnt like untidiness  ive been very dull but so has jake jim declared  i saw a neat patch on his overalls and thought hed made a better job than he generally does when he starts sewing  i imagine he doesnt know how that patch got there  i dont think he knows there is a patch carrie rejoined  its possible jim agreed and studied her for the moon was bright her plain dress was very neat and seemed to have stood rough wear well besides it was remarkably becoming carrie was tall and graceful  in fact she was prettier than he had thought  the way you keep your clothes is rather wonderful he went on  one never sees you untidy all you wear looks just as it ought to look one feels it wouldnt look half as well if it was worn by anybody else yet youre generally occupied and your works not clean  i cant touch a cooking pot without getting black and jake gets blacker  carrie laughed to hide a touch of embarrassment  jim was not trying to flatter she saw he was naïvely following a new line of thought  well we must get back to camp she said  can you walk  jim got up quickly and gave her a suspicious glance  i can walk to camp  i ought to have gone right off and sent the boys after that chopper  looks as if you meant to keep me  i did mean to keep you  let him go jim  he wont come back and we have had trouble enough  he has not had much trouble jim rejoined  however i doubt if we could catch him and i want the boys to move our truck at daybreak then in a way id sooner they didnt know  of course ive got to tell jake  you mustnt tell him i came carrie said firmly  why not jim asked with some surprise  carrie hesitated  oh well i dont want him to know  for one thing he might think i was rash  you were splendidly plucky jim declared  of course i wont tell jake if youd sooner not  for all that i dont understand  it isnt worth puzzling about carrie answered with a smile and they set off     chapter ix  an honest antagonist  it was very hot on the rocky hill and jim stopped in the shade of a stunted pine for he had gone far through the bush  his hudsons bay blanket and a bag of food made up in a pack with straps for his shoulders and a small ax were a rather heavy load  when he had lighted his pipe he looked about  tangled forest rolled up the hills wherever the stiff dark pines could find soil in which to grow  some were charred by fire and the tall rampikes shone silvergray in the strong light some were partly uprooted by storms and leaned drunkenly against each other  at the head of the valley there was a faint blue haze and jim knowing this was the smoke of a camp fire began to muse  now he would soon meet the man he was looking for he doubted if he had been wise to come and wondered what he would say  he had set off when an indian reached the telegraph line and stated that a white man with a number of packers was camped in the valley  jim imagined the man was martin davies employer and meant to see him  he did not know if davies was with martin or not  by and by he set off avoiding fallen trees and scrambling across roundtopped rocks  it was rough work and he was tired but he could get forward without using the ax which he had been forced to do when he fell among the horrible devils club thorns  for all that dusk was falling when he came to an opening by a creek where a big fire burned and a doubleskinned tent stood at the edge of the trees  six or seven sturdy packers lounged beside the fire and jim saw this was not a poor mans camp  for a few hot weeks a traveler need suffer no hardship in the north if he can pay for packers and canoes  a doubleroofed tent will keep out sun and rain and a mosquito bar will keep off the flies but packers who carry comforts cannot carry tools and a utilitarian journey is another thing  jim was not traveling for pleasure and had gone alone  he was mosquitobitten and ragged and his boots were broken  the packers looked up with languid curiosity as he advanced and when he asked for the boss one indicated the tent  jim stopped in front of the tent and a man came out  he wore clean summer flannel clothes and looked strangely neat but he was sunburnt and strongly made  something about him indicated that he knew the bush and had not always traveled luxuriously  are you prospecting he asked  if you have struck us for supper you can see the cook  i came to see you and got supper three or four miles back  im dearham of winter  dearham  you have probably heard about us  sure said martin rather dryly  you hold the contract for the new telegraph line  somebody told me there was a dame in the firm  my partners sister i expect davies told you but dont see what this has to do with the thing  sit down said martin indicating a campchair and then beckoned one of the men  bring some green bark and fix that smudge  the man put fresh fuel on a smoldering fire and pungent blue smoke drifted about the tent  better than mosquitoes theyre pretty fierce evenings martin remarked  will you take a cigar  no thanks said jim  ill light my pipe  he cut the tobacco slowly because he did not know where to open his attack  martin was not altogether the man he had thought and looked amused  he was a bushman jim knew the type which was not as a rule marked by the use of small trickery  yet martin could handle money as well as he handled tools  wont you state your business the contractor asked  i expect you and the cartner people didnt like it when we got the telegraph job  that is so  we thought the job was ours martin admitted  and you got to work to take it from us  how do you mean  to begin with probyn cartners man offered us a thousand dollars to quit  a pretty good price said martin  since you didnt go i dont see why you are bothering me  it looks as if you and cartner had pooled your interests  when we got to work your man davies came along and tried to hold us up  it was not his fault he didnt the fellows a crook  i havent studied his character  in some ways hes useful martin rejoined coolly  well you reckon i sent him  how did he try to embarrass you  dont you know  its for you to state your grievance  martins face was inscrutable one could not tell if he knew or not it was curious but jim could not take it for granted that he did know and he told him about the broken wall  you imagine davies paid the fellow to cut your underpinning the contractor remarked  the things obvious  then i dont understand why you came to me  theres not much advantage in telling your antagonist he has hit you pretty hard  i wanted you to understand that you hadnt hit us hard enough  your blow was not a knockout and we mean to guard against the next  we have taken the contract and are going to put it over i want you to get that  you cant scare us off and while i dont know if you can smash us or not it will certainly cost you high  hadnt you better calculate if the things worth while  you were far north for some time martin said carelessly  i was jim admitted with surprise for he could not see where the remark led  so were you  martin nodded  a blamed hard country  looks as if we were both pretty tough since we made good yonder and i think i get your proposition  your idea is we had better make terms than fight  something like that jim agreed  very well said martin who paused and smiled  now ill tell you something  i dont like your butting in but i did not put davies on your track  jim looked hard at him and although he was surprised did not doubt his statement  then i imagine he made the plan himself wanted to show you he was smart but said nothing when it didnt work as smoothly as he thought  martin was silent for a few moments and jim imagined he was thinking hard  then he said its possible thats all  perhaps the cartner people sent him without telling you jim suggested  cartner made you a square offer and you cant grumble much because probyn hired your men  cartner is hard and i allow hed like to break you but i havent known him play a crooked game  then i cant see a light at all  its puzzling martin agreed  jim filled his pipe again and pondered  there was something strange about his talking confidentially to a man he had thought an unscrupulous antagonist but he was persuaded that martin was honest the latter seemed to be considering for jim saw his brows were knit when the firelight touched his face  it had got dark but the fire leaped up now and then and threw a red glow upon the rows of trunks the creek shone and faded sometimes the smoke curled about the tent and sometimes blew away  you struck copper up north martin resumed after a time  has anybody tried to buy your claim  baumstein gave us an offer twice  ah said martin thoughtfully i suppose you wouldnt sell  not at his price  we thought we had better hold on some day the combine might buy  a pretty good plan martin agreed  therell be a demand for northern copper before long  well i see you have a blanket  youll find a bed in the tent  i picked a spot to camp a piece back jim said rather awkwardly as he got up  martin laughed  since you reckoned cartner and i were on your track you felt youd sooner not stop with me  well i dont think that ought to count  if we could have bought you off or scared you off we might have done so but since you are resolved to put the contract through well be satisfied with seeing you dont get another  if you stop youll get a better breakfast than you can cook  jims hesitation vanished and he went into the tent  next morning he got breakfast with martin and when he was going the latter remarked i guess you understand you neednt bother about our getting after you  go ahead and finish the job  thanks said jim smiling  unless we go broke we mean to finish  very well said martin if you have to choose between quitting and selling your copper claim you had better let the telegraph contract go  he paused and gave jim a level glance  looks like interested advice but i guess its sound  jim strapped on his pack and started down the valley  he reached the telegraph camp three or four days afterwards and in the evening told jake and carrie about his interview  perhaps its strange but i really dont think were up against cartner and martin he concluded  were up against somebody who hasnt many scruples said jake  that is so jim agreed  i suggested that davies might be playing a lone hand  martin admitted that it was possible but didnt look satisfied  in fact i imagined he was thinking hard  of course the obvious line was to doubt his honesty but somehow i didnt  the obvious lines not always best carrie interposed  my notion is its a foolish habit to take it for granted your antagonist is a cheat  but what is he like jim  big and rather quiet although he had a twinkle  weighs all he says and you feel that if hes satisfied he doesnt mind if you are or not we know he was up north for some time he looks like it if you get me  jake nodded for the men who push far into the frozen wilds conform to a type  struggles with cold and hunger leave their mark endurance breeds stubbornness and fronting perils gives a quiet courage that makes for candor  the man who has conquered fear is not tempted to be mean  there are bad men in some of the big camps but no smooth rogues he said  martin is certainly not a smooth rogue jim declared  i thought it curious he told me to hold on to the copper and let the contract go if we couldnt stick to both  he admitted it looked as if he was playing for his side when he gave me the advice  well said jake thoughtfully if he meant to gain his object that way it was a fool plan but we know martins clever  to jump at a shallow suspicion is a blamed lazy habit that often puts you wrong  if he didnt mean well i cant see what he did mean  i cant see jim agreed  better let it go carrie interposed  i like that man  if you have drawn him right i think he could be trusted  however you look as if you had been among the devils club  what are you going to do with your clothes  if you insist i meant to hide them jim owned with a laugh  so i thought said carrie  bring them to the tent instead  if you dont ill come for them in the morning  jim promised to bring the clothes and lighted his pipe feeling somewhat moved  he knew now how much he and jake owed carrie and the thought she gave their comfort  if things went smoothly it was because carrie made them go but this was not all  she was not satisfied with controlling the camp jim was beginning to see that now and then she controlled their talk and helped their decisions  she was a girl and had for the most part lived at a shabby store but he admitted that her judgment was often sound  carrie had qualities then he started for she looked at him with a smile  what are you thinking about jim she asked  i was wondering how we would have got on if we hadnt brought you he replied  carrie laughed  i know  yet you wanted to leave me  if i did i was a fool  no said carrie thoughtfully you are not a fool but sometimes youre rather dull  now youre half asleep and had better go to bed  jim knocked out his pipe and went  a few days afterwards he started for the settlement with two of his men  they were good workmen and jake was unwilling to let them go but they had been with jim in the north and he needed helpers whom he could trust for he was going to make a bold experiment  he needed food powder and tools and it was hard to keep the camp supplied packhorses could not carry much over the mountaintrail and the freighters charges were high  jim imagined he could bring up the goods cheaper by canoe although the plan had drawbacks  he reached the settlement and after waiting a few days sat one evening on the hotel veranda  burned matches and cigarends lay about the dirty boards the windows of the mean shiplap house were guarded by fine wire net  the door had been removed and a frame filled in with gauze and held by a spring slammed noisily when one went in or out for all that the hotel was full of dust and flies and mosquitoes hummed about the hot rooms at night  the snow had melted below the timber line and a long trail of smoke floated across the somber forest a fire was working through the trees and a smell of burning came down the valley  three or four men in ragged overalls lounged about the veranda and the landlord leaned against a post  he wore a white shirt with gold studs and his clothes were good  now you have got your truck i reckon youll pull out he remarked  we start up river at daybreak  then youre surely foolish  if you cant make it theres trouble coming to you next time  jim understood the hint  the packhorse freighters had enjoyed a monopoly of transport to the mining camps  the river was off the regular line and its navigation was difficult except when the water reached a certain level but if jims experiment proved that supplies could be taken by canoes transport charges would come down  there are some awkward portages but i think i can get through he said  i wasnt figuring on the portages the landlord rejoined meaningly somas charlies a tough proposition to run up against  he indicated a man coming along the road  somas has his tillicums and around this settlement what he says goes  in the chinook jargon tillicum means something like a familiar spirit and jim thought he saw what the other implied  he had had trouble to get articles he needed and had met with annoying delays and he studied the advancing freighter with some curiosity  somas was big and powerful and walked with the packhorse drivers loose stride  he had a dark face cunning black eyes and very black hair  it looked as if indian blood ran in his veins  he came up the veranda steps and gave jim an ironical glance  got your canoes loaded up he asked  not yet the truck is ready said jim who had thought it prudent to put his goods in a store  its a sure thing youre not going to take your canoes through  say i dont want to see you lose the grub and tools  drop the fool plan and ill take off a cent a pound  if you had offered that before we might have made a deal  youre too late  thought you were bluffing i guess youre crazy now  you cant make it anyway  im going to try  the freighter shrugged  tryings going to cost you something youll feel pretty mean when you meet the bill  fools like you make me tired  he beckoned the landlord  get on a move i want a drink  he went into the hotel and when the door slammed jim was thoughtful     chapter x  the rapid  in the morning jim started with three canoes and a few indians whom he had engaged at the settlement because the siwash are clever river men sometimes they tracked the canoes floundering along the rough bank with a line round their shoulders sometimes they poled against the rapid stream and now and then carried the craft and cargo across a rocky portage  the canoes were of the siwash type cut out of cedar logs and burned smooth outside  the high bow was rudely carved like a birds head the floor was long and flat  they paddled well and a strong man could carry one upside down on his bent shoulders  jim had loaded them heavily and the tools and provisions had cost a large sum  his progress was slow and he was tired and disturbed when one evening he pitched camp after toiling across a long portage  speed was important and he had been longer than he thought while he did not know if he could force his way up the dark gorge ahead  besides an indian had shown him the print of somebodys foot on a patch of wet soil there was only one mark and in a sense this was ominous since it looked as if the fellow had tried to keep upon the stones  moreover he wore a heavy boot and jim could not see why a white man had entered the lonely gorge where there were no minerals or timber worth exploiting  after supper he got ready to start again at daybreak  this was his usual plan because ones brain is dull when one rises from a hard cold bed at dawn and in the wilds to leave tools or food behind has sometimes disastrous consequences  he saw he had forgotten nothing and when dusk was falling rested for a time on the bank although he thought it prudent to sleep on board  up stream the water threw back faint reflections but its surface was dull and wrinkled where it narrowed at the top of the rapid round which he had carried the canoes  then it plunged down into gloom that was deepened by a cloud of spray and its hoarse turmoil echoed among the hills  a few charred rampikes rose behind the camp and jim sat beneath one with his back against a stone  he had thrown off his jacket and his thin overalls were wet  his back and arms ached and his feet were bruised  he pondered about the footstep  the packhorse trail running north was not far off and while he slowly poled up stream the freighter could have reached the river in front of him  when they talked at the hotel the fellows manner was threatening but jim hardly thought he would meddle  his party was strong and if the other had meant to do him some injury it was hardly probable he would have uttered his dark hints while the landlord was about  after all the hints might forecast the difficulty jim would have to engage transport another time  still somebody had passed the spot not long since  the gloom deepened and although some light would linger in the sky all night it was nearly dark at the bottom of the gorge  the packers lay about the fire and by and by jim calling one of the siwash hauled the first canoe to the bank  when they got on board he let the craft swing out with the eddy and the row curving as the current changed rode behind a halfcovered rock a short distance from the stones blurred rocks and trees loomed in the mist up stream below the foaming rapid glimmered through the spray  the river swollen by melting snow and stained green by glacier clay was running fast  there was not much room in the canoe for bags of flour occupied the bottom and a grindstone and small forge were awkward things to stow jim however found a spot where he could lie down and the indian huddled in the stern  he was a darkskinned man dressed like the white settlers except that he wore no boots  as a rule he did not talk much but by and by he put his hand in the water as if to measure the speed of the current  contox hiyu chuck he said in chinook  jim imagined he meant the river was rising and did not know if this was a drawback or not  a flood might make poling harder but it would cover the rocks in the channel and probably leave an eddying slack along the bank  he agreed with the indian because the rock to which they had moored the canoe was getting smaller  it made a kind of breakwater but it would be covered soon and the craft would feel the force of the current  still they ought to ride safely and an angry wash now beat against the bank of gravel where they had landed  there was no other landing for below the camp the river ran in white waves between the rocks  although jim was tired he could not sleep  for one thing he had lost time at the settlement and on the river jake was waiting for the tools and since wages were high delay was costly  then the gorge echoed with pulsating noise  the roar of the rapid rose and fell he heard the wash of the eddy against the bank the sharp ripple where the current split upon the rock and the rattle of gravel striking the stones  the canoes rocked swung to and fro and brought up with sudden jerks  he did not know if the indian slept but if he did a new note in the confused uproar would waken him  after a time the fellow moved and as his dark figure rose jim became alert  the indian was looking fixedly ahead but jim could see nothing in the gloom  he noted mechanically that the rock had vanished its location was marked by a wedgeshaped streak of foam  he signed to the indian who grunted but did not speak  then there was a crash as something struck the rock and a vague dark mass rebounded from and swung round the obstacle  it rolled and halfseen projections vanished and appeared again  jim got on his knees and seized a pole because he imagined a big log with broken branches was driving down on them  a river canoe is unstable and to stand on the cargo might capsize her  he found bottom with the pole and saw the indian paddling hard  the row of canoes swung towards the bank but the backwash caught them and it looked as if they would not swing far enough  jim felt the veins on his forehead tighten and the pole bend as he strained with labored breath  the log came on its butt under water its ragged top riding high and swinging round  there was a heavy shock the canoe lurched and a broken branch began to drag her down  jim could not push off the grinding mass and letting go the pole seized an ax  he cut the mooring line to ease the strain but when the rope parted and the log swung clear he was faced by another risk unless they could reach the gravel bank they would go down the rapid  he could not find bottom now and while he tried the log struck the next canoe  his canoe swerved outshore the row was drifting fast and he shouted as he felt for the ax  it was however obvious that the men in camp could not help much and he nerved himself to make a hard choice  if he held on all the canoes would go down the rapid if he let two go one might be saved  he cut the line made fast astern the log and canoes vanished and he and the indian strained their muscles  they had lost ground they could not recover the gravel bank was sliding past and angry waves leaped about the rocks below  somehow they must make the bank before they were carried down  there was some water in the canoe jim heard it splash about  she was horribly heavy and his pole would not grip the bottom when it slipped the current washed its end under the craft  he threw the pole on board and found a paddle  the canoe rocked on a white eddy but he got her head round and the revolution carried her towards the shore  they must drive her in before the backwash flung her off and for some moments he labored with weakening arms and heaving chest  then a packer plunged in the bow struck ground and jim jumped over  he was up to his waist in the white turmoil but another packer seized the canoe and the indian thrust hard on his bending pole  the bow went farther into the gravel and with a savage effort they ran her out  jim leaned against a rock trying to get his breath and when he looked about the other canoes had vanished  his tools and stores had gone for good  now there was no need for watchfulness he could sleep and he lay down by the fire  when he wakened day was breaking and beckoning the indian he set off up the gorge  he had an object for his dangerous climb across the slippery rocks and he noted that the stream flowed evenly along the bank  this implied that if a log were rolled into the water on his side of the straight reach it would probably strike the rock behind which the canoes had been tied  after a time when the roughness of the ground forced them high above the water the indian indicated a clump of willows through which somebody had pushed  he declared two white men had gone through and one had carried an ax  jim had been looking for a white mans tracks and his face got stern as they climbed a neighboring gully  at the top he sat down and sent the indian to look about  it the other men had gone down again to the water they must have had some grounds for doing so and jim thought he knew what the grounds were  the indian found steps in a boggy patch and jim descending a ravine farther on came back to the river bank  here and there a tree had fallen into the ravine and two or three battered trunks lay on the gravel at the bottom  a hollow in some disturbed gravel at the waters edge indicated that another log had rested there and jim let the indian examine the ground  by and by the latter began to talk  he said the marks had been made by a trunk with branches broken short one could see where it had rolled into the stream  the ravine was steep but the other logs had not slipped down the missing trunk had been helped on its way  in one place the top had been lifted in another a pole had been pushed under the butt  some of the gravel was scratched as if it had been trodden by nailed boots  a man using a lever would push it back like that  jim nodded because he knew something about woodcraft and thought the indian had read the marks correctly  now and then the fellow said contox and jim understood the chinook word which roughly means to know rather implied supposition than certainty  for all that if the indian doubted he did not  he knew the log had been launched where the current would carry it down on the canoes and when he went back to camp his mouth was set hard  after breakfast he broke up the party and sending the indians off started again with the two white men  the canoe would not carry all but this did not matter since for the most part she must be tracked from the bank and when they poled her one man could travel through the bush and overtake them at the next rapid  it was a strenuous journey and jim was worn out when he climbed the hill to the telegraph camp it was about six oclock in the evening and the men had not returned from work but carrie was cooking and got up with a cry of welcome when he came out of the woods  she stopped however when she saw his gloomy face  whats the matter jim she asked  are you hurt or ill  he dropped the heavy bag of flour he carried and forced a smile  does it look as if i were ill  ive lost two canoes and their loads  oh jim said carrie and added after all it isnt so very important  not important jim exclaimed  carrie hesitated  oh well never mind  where are the boys  you havent lost them  theyre coming said jim who sat down on a log feeling embarrassed  he was dull  carrie had been disturbed about him because he had been away longer than he thought and her obvious relief when she saw he was not injured was soothing  he needed soothing since the loss of the canoes and stores weighed heavily but carrie had made him feel this did not matter much so long as he was safe  although he could not agree it was a comfort to know her satisfaction was sincere  carrie always was sincere  she was quiet and he resumed in an apologetic voice i felt mean about coming back like this losing the truck is going to make things harder for you  then i bought some new cookers the steam went through a row of pans and i thought theyd save you work  there was a piece of stuff at the dry goods store the girl told me would make a dress but it went down the rapid with the cookers  carrie gave him a gentle glance  you bought them the rest was an accident  it was not an accident but well talk about that again  im glad to get back im always glad to get back now though i didnt bother about it much when we camped in the bush before  carrie took off the lid of a cookingpot and while she was occupied the packers arrived with their loads  soon afterwards jake and the other men came up and they got supper  when the meal was over jim told his story and jake looked thoughtful  the obvious explanation is the freighter tried to stop you by turning loose the log he said  i dont know if we ought to count on this but well take it first  im doubtful jim replied  somehow i feel the fellow was bluffing he wanted to scare me so id agree to his terms  although i reckon he meant to charge me high when i came to him next time i dont think he sent the log down  i havent much ground for the conclusion but there it is  in some ways youre not a fool jake remarked with a twinkle  ive known judgments you hadnt much ground for turn out sound  very well we come to the big contractors  did they hire somebody to stop you  it looks like that but i imagine martins playing straight and he declared the cartner people wouldnt use a crooked plan  then who did try to stop you  jim shrugged and his face got hard  i dont know yet  we must wait  very well said jake  well trust our luck and hold on while we can although i expect it wont be very long  jim did not answer  he was tired and now the reaction from the strain had begun was glad to indulge his bodily and mental lassitude  the springy branches on which he lay were comfortable and the camp with the red firelight flickering on the trunks and carrie sitting by the hearthlogs had a curious charm  she so to speak dominated the tranquil picture and gave her rude surroundings a homelike touch  on other expeditions when carrie was not there jim had thought about his camp as a place at which one slept  now it was something else a place from which one drew strength and cheerfulness  there was something strangely intimate about it he was glad to get back     chapter xi  a confidential talk  shortly after jims return a prospector stopped one evening at the camp  there was some mail for you at the settlement and as i figured on using your line to get into the bush i brought the packet along he said  carrie gave him supper and when he joined the other men jim opened the packet  in the evening they had leisure for rest and talk and after the strain and bustle of the day jim enjoyed the quiet hour  the air got sharp when the sun sank the fire they gathered round drove back the creeping shadows and the pungent smoke kept the mosquitoes off sometimes he bantered carrie and sometimes lounged in contented quietness watching her while she sewed  carrie was generally occupied  how is your mother getting on he asked when she put down the letter he had given her  carrie smiled  she is getting on very well  my cousin keeps store satisfactorily and i dont know if im pleased or not  its nice to feel youre wanted and people miss you when youre gone  if theres much comfort in the thought you are certainly wanted here  the trouble is ones friends often say what they think one would like to know carrie rejoined  im not sure id have minded much if mother had owned that belle breaks things and sometimes forgets how many cents go to the dollar when she makes up a bill  spose im mean but belle does break things  you are never mean and i was quite sincere  perhaps you found new buttons on your overalls and that accounted for something  jim half consciously moved his hand to his jacket and then stopped im afraid i didnt know the buttons were there  after all it ought to persuade you of my sincerity  sometimes im not certain if you are nice or not  but is there anything important in your letters  one or two people want to know when we mean to pay our bills im sorry we cant satisfy their curiosity just yet  then theres a letter from baumstein  hell give us an extra five hundred dollars for the bluebird  ah said carrie  its strange he makes the offer when we need money so  it is strange jake broke in  almost looks as if the fellow knew how we were fixed  but were not sellers and for a clever crook baumstein is too keen  he states he has reached his limit and we wont get another chance jim remarked  jake pondered and then resumed the things puzzling  i cant see why baumsteins fixed on buying a claim that nobody else wants but you can reckon it a sure snap for him when he makes a deal  theres the puzzle  the ore is pretty good but thats all  we were kind of disappointed by the assay  the specimens looked better than the analysis proved  i was certainly disappointed and surprised jim agreed  suppose we ask the prospector about it  he has tested a good many mineral claims  they waited until the prospector returned to the camp when jake gave him some bits of broken rock  feel those and tell me what you think about the metal they carry he said  the other examined the specimens and weighed them in his hand  if youve got much rock like that its a pretty good claim  do you reckon the stuff would come up to assay jake asked giving him the analysts report  the prospector looked at him rather hard  come up to assay  if the bulks like these specimens it ought to pan out better than the figures show  he stated his grounds for believing this and jake knitted his brows i expect you know the big mining men and what theyre doing  have you heard if baumstein is looking for northern copper  he bought a claim called the darien not long since  jim smiled  the darien  the next block to ours but the vein begins to peter out before it crosses their boundary  when baumstein gets the next block you want to sell him your lot or watch out the prospector rejoined  if he cant buy you up hell make trouble for you  i reckon he knew what kind of ore the darien boys had got  yes said jim i imagined something like that  he said no more about the mine and next morning the prospector resumed his journey  after this for a week or two nothing broke the monotony of their strenuous toil until one day martin and his packers arrived  im going down to the settlements and thought id strike your camp and stop a night he said  the woods get lonesome and your lines a pretty good route to the pack trail  jim was somewhat surprised but he took martin to jake and went to tell carrie  i wanted to see that man and you had better leave him to me she said  to begin with ill give him the best supper i know how to cook  get busy and fix the fire while i see what weve got thats extra nice  if you get after him hes bound to give in jim remarked  however i want you to study the fellow and tell me what you think  then you would trust my judgment  of course  in many ways its as good as ours  carrie laughed  sometimes she said youre very modest jim  martin ate a remarkably good supper and afterwards talked to carrie with obvious satisfaction  like the most part of the men who venture much in the wilds he was marked by a grave quietness but he had for all that a touch of humor  by and by he turned to jim and asked how are you getting on  have you struck fresh trouble since i saw you  jim related his adventure at the rapid and martin gave him a keen glance  i reckon you had an object for telling me but i dont quite get it  you think i hired the man who sent down the log or you know i didnt  he knows you didnt carrie declared  thank you said martin  i imagine what you say goes at this camp  some way  i belong to the firm  it goes all the way said jim  i often think miss winter is really the head of the firm  martins eyes twinkled  well youre both making good ive been looking at the line youve cleared and ive not often struck a supper like this in the bush  makes me feel i want to fire my cook  then his tone got grave  anyhow i had nothing to do with wrecking your canoes and dont think the freighter had  you see i sometimes hire somas hell put the screw to you if he reckons you can be bluffed but hes not a crook  then we can rule him out said carrie  i imagine you dont make mistakes  making mistakes about trusting folks sometimes costs you high martin remarked  he looked at her thoughtfully and then smiled  one could trust you all the time  well said carrie i suppose i gave you a lead but theres no use in our trying who could be nicest because id certainly beat you  i expect you dont often try and its a girls business  in the meantime jim had studied both  he thought he knew carries worth but somehow the others approval made it plainer  although martins humorous frankness jarred jim recognized its note of sincerity  on the whole he liked martin but he would sooner carrie did not play up to the fellow  by and by martin turned to him  when i was last at vancouver a man called mordaunt asked some questions about you  mordaunt said jim with a puzzled look  he stopped at your telegraph shack  oh yes i only met him once before and didnt learn his name  what did he want to know  all i could tell him about you  he was something of a highbrow englishman and used tact but i reckoned he was keen on finding out what kind of man you were  you couldnt tell him much  that is so said martin rather dryly  in fact i didnt try  oh well its not important jim replied  perhaps my books roused his curiosity  they were not the books hed imagine a telegraph linesman would read  but did he tell you much about himself  he did not  an englishman like that doesnt talk about himself  jim agreed carelessly but was thoughtful afterwards and when martin went off with jake stopped by the fire and mused  after a time he looked up and saw carrie sitting in the shadow  now and then the flickering light touched her face and he thought she studied him  i suppose youre thinking about that englishman she said  yes  its rather strange he asked martin about me  perhaps he knows your relations  it looks like that jim agreed  and he was with the girl you met at the restaurant  i expect she was a relation of his  arent you curious  jim imagined carrie was curious but one could be frank with her and he wanted to formulate his thoughts  in a way i am curious he admitted  i would like to see the girl again  still i think its really as a type she interests me  carrie smiled  it isnt as a type a girl gets interesting jim  it would be ridiculous to think about her in any other way  ive had nothing to do with girls like that shes the first ive met  oh well said carrie  dont you want to learn something about your english relations  no said jim in a thoughtful voice  in a sense im half afraid  afraid said carrie  he was silent for a few moments and then resumed on the whole ive been happy  i feel ive got my proper job and am satisfied  for all that when those englishmen talked to me at the shack i had a strange notion that i knew things they knew and belonged to a world i hadnt lived in yet  sometimes at mcgill i got a kind of restlessness that made me want to see the old country  i fought against it  why did you fight  for one thing its obvious i belong where i am i can make good in this country i know my job  something pulls another way but i dont want to go  ah said carrie i think i understand  still theres the adventure jim  and if you didnt like it in england you could come back  theres a risk  i expect its hard to get back when you leave your proper place  then i have much i value you and jake and the boys who work for me  i stand on firm ground here ground i know and like  in the old country it might be different  do you mean you might be different  you are clever carrie  i think i do mean something like that  i feel now and then as if there was another jim dearham who so to speak hadnt developed yet  in a way im afraid of him  carrie looked thoughtful but her eyes were soft  jake and i are satisfied with the jim we know  still perhaps you ought to give the other his chance  she paused and her voice had a curious note when she resumed if i were a man id let nothing stop my development  you have grit jim said smiling  grit that would carry you anywhere and makes you something of an aristocrat  so long as youre not afraid you must be fine  well i suppose i made good when i was up against rotten ice and sliding snow but when i think about what i have and what id risk my pluck goes  sometimes youre rather nice jim and youre a better philosopher than i thought carrie remarked  she got up and stopping a moment gave him a halfmocking glance  but i wonder what youd get like if you went to the old country and met that english girl  she went off and jim sat by the fire with his brows knit  perhaps he had talked too much and bored carrie but he suspected that she had led him on  by and by he roused himself and went to chop some wood martin did not start in the morning as his hosts had expected  he said his packers needed a rest and loafed about the camp sometimes talking to carrie and sometimes watching jake and jim at work  next morning however he said he must go and while they were at breakfast turned to jim  in the bush one often runs up against obstacles one did not expect if you find you cant put your contract over id like you to send me word  i dont see why we should bother you jim replied with some surprise  martin smiled  for one thing you had a notion the cartner people and i were playing a crooked game  then youre making a good job and i wouldnt like to see you beat  we imagined you wouldnt like our butting in on jobs you thought were yours jake observed  that is so said martin  if i help ill make a proposition to which i guess youll be able to agree  in the meantime we can let it go  looks as if youd make good anyhow  he began to talk about something else and when he set off jake and jim went with him down the line  after a time he stopped them  i must hit the trail and not keep you from your job he said  i reckon youll put it over but if you want some backing remember my offer stands  he paused and gave jake a steady glance  i like the way you have treated me your sister is a queen  then he went on with his packers and jake and jim returned quietly to camp     chapter xii  fire  the light had got dim and carrie put down her sewing and looked about a belt of yellow sky glimmered above the distant snow but the valley was dark and the pines rolled in blurred masses up the hill  thin mist crept out of the deep hollow and carrie shivered when a cold wind shook the trees  she was beginning to know the wilds and now and then their austerity daunted her  by and by a red twinkle in the distance drew her glance and she turned to jim  what is that  jim looked and frowned  ah he said id begun to think our luck was too good  but what is the light  a bush fire  jake indicated the drift of the smoke from their cooking fire  as a rule the valleys of british columbia that open to the west form channels for the chinook wind from the pacific but now and then a dry cold current flows down them to the coast  it wont bother us unless the wind changes he remarked  in this country however the wind generally does change when youd sooner it did not and its not safe to trust your luck much  looks as if nature had put up her shingle on the mountains warning the white man off  but white men do live in the mountains carrie objected  men who are strong enough  they must fight for a footing and then use the best tools other men can make to hold the ground theyve won were scouts carrying axes saws and giantpowder but the main body must coöperate to defend its settlements with civilizations heavy machines  its sure a hard country and sometimes it gets me scared  carrie laughed  youre romantic when you talk about the north  could the fire bother us  that depends  it couldnt burn the line though it might burn the posts  if it spread and rolled up the valley it might put us off the ground and stop the job  while we waited the boys would have to be fed and wages would run on carrie said in a thoughtful voice  how do the fires start  nobody knows  i allow it looks ridiculous but my notion is some fires start themselves youll find them burning in belts of woods the indians and prospectors leave alone  some are probably started by cooking fires  the man who knows the bush is careful the tenderfoot is not  then you dont think somebody may have had an object for lighting this fire  on the whole i reckon not  the chances against its bothering us are too steep  for all that id like it better if the blaze went out  carrie said nothing and for a time they watched the light  sometimes it leaped up and sometimes it faded but it got larger and when they went to bed a red reflection played about the sky  in the morning there was no wind and a heavy trail of smoke stretched across the hills  in places a bright flicker pierced the dark trail and carrie noted a smell of burning when she filled the kettle  then she saw jim watching the smoke  its nearer and bigger isnt it she asked  yes said jim quietly  its bigger than i like  well go along and look at it after breakfast  they ate quickly and when the meal was over jim and carrie set off while jake went to work  it was not easy to push through the tangled bush and now and then jim was forced to clear a path with his ax after a time he stopped behind a trunk and touched carrie who saw an animal leap out from the gloom  it cleared a big fallen branch with a flying bound vanished almost silently in a brake of tall fern and shooting out with forelegs bent sprang across a thicket  carrie thought it hardly touched the ground  it was wonderfully swift and graceful and although the forest was choked with undergrowth and rotting logs all was very quiet when the animal vanished  oh she said im glad you stopped me  i havent seen a wild deer before  they are hard to see jim replied  if theyre standing they melt into their background at a very short distance  however i didnt like the way that deer was going  it passed pretty close without seeing we were about  noting that the scramble had tired her he began to rub his ax with a sharpening stone and carrie mused while she got her breath  by and by she looked up and saw his twinkling glance  yes she said i was thinking rather hard i thought it was good for me to come north  all was always just the same at the store the dull street the mean frame houses and the stale smell of groceries  there was nothing different you knew you would do tomorrow what you did today and you had made no progress when the reckoning came  if there was money enough to pay the bills you were satisfied and sometimes there was not  but i really mean you felt you had made no progress of any kind you were slipping back  slipping back  im not sure i get that  sometimes its hard to put you wise but perhaps slipping back wasnt altogether right  i meant things were moving on and leaving me behind the time i could be happy was going and soon id be old and sour  i didnt want to feel id done nothing and had never tasted life  well my chance came and i pulled out  im afraid you havent had your good time yet jim remarked  carries eyes sparkled  one always wants something better jim but ive begun to live  ive seen the woods and the wild back country im helping at a big job  your help is worth much and if we put the job over you can have the things a girl is supposed to like for example pretty clothes opera tickets a holiday at a fashionable summer hotel  theyre things you ought to have  i do like pretty clothes and think id like to meet smart people  the trouble is they would know i didnt belong where they belonged and might leave me out  do you think that would happen jim  certainly not jim declared  girls of your type dont get left out i dare say pretty girls are numerous but you have a calm and a confidence that make their mark  carrie smiled but there was some color in her face  i suppose you mean to be nice  yet you have seen me serving at the store and cooking for the boys  ive seen you nursing me when i was ill and hope im going to see you wear the smartest clothes money can buy  but theres much to be done first and im bothered about the fire  they pushed on while the smell of burning got stronger and presently came to a rocky hill  its top cut off their view but a dingy cloud rolled up behind it and as they climbed the air got hot  when they reached the summit carrie gasped and her eyes opened wide  the spur commanded the valley and the fire that had run through the woods below  in the foreground a wall of tossing flame threw out clouds of sparks and leaping up here and there ran in yellow trails to the top of the tall firs  it advanced slowly with an angry roar licking up the dry brush and branches before the big trunks caught  in front they were hung with streamers of flame farther off they glowed red and in the distance smoldering rampikes towered above a wide belt of ash  now and then one leaned and fell and showers of sparks shot up as if the log had exploded  the shock of the fall hardly pierced the confused uproar and carrie shielding her scorched face with her hand was appalled by the din green wood split with detonating cracks the snapping of branches was like musketry and the flames roared in a deep undertone  her dress fluttered for eddying draughts swept the rocks  she was dazzled but fascinated unconscious of heat and fear for she had not seen or imagined a spectacle like this  its tremendous she said in an awed voice  pretty fierce jim agreed  a bushfires a big thing but it doesnt grip you like the break up of the ice  when the river bursts the jam the floes grind the rocks smooth and rub out the pines  you can hear the wreck drive down the channel a days journey off  i thought it a silent country  its often so quiet it makes one halfafraid  jim nodded  something forbidding in its quietness thats like a threat  well it wakes up and gets busy in a dramatic way now and then  if you want to live in the mountains youve got to be watchful  a wave of smoke rolled about them and sparks drove past like hail  a fiery shower fell on carries thin dress and jim seizing her beat them out  this was needful and he began without embarrassment but presently thrilled and carries scorched face got red as he ran his smarting hands across the thin material  keep still he said roughly  its light stuff and will soon catch fire  then picking off a glowing cinder he took her arm and they started down hill  when they came out of the smoke he was breathless and carrie gasped  oh jim you have burned your hands she said  not much  theyre hard and i have often hurt them worse  its your dress that bothers me  look at the charred spots  but youre not to blame for that  i am to blame  i oughtnt to have let you stay  i wanted to stay  that doesnt matter jim declared  my business was to take care of you  in fact its my business all the time  something of a responsibility jim carrie remarked  however i think well go on  they stopped again before they reached the camp for pushing through tangled bush is hard work and carrie sat down on a fallen trunk  isnt the fire moving up the valley she asked  it is jim said frowning  fires sometimes do move against a light wind  however we wont talk about this yet  he paused and touched her dress  heres another big hole  you cant mend the thing  im afraid not carrie agreed  and the blue one has a nasty tear besides the stain where jake spilt the coffee  i must make a trip to the settlement when the fire burns out  you mustnt go said carrie firmly  you cant leave your job its much more important than my clothes  for all that i am going as soon as i can  when we were talking not long since i began to think  we have taken your help for granted without reckoning what it cost but it has hurt me to see you occupied with the cookingpots  carrie gave him a level smiling glance  its for jake and you and the boys  in a way youre all mine and im rather proud of my family  we are yours jim declared  in fact we were lucky when you so to speak took us under your wing  you have a kind of protective instinct that makes you look after folks and makes them trust you but you oughtnt to be cooking for a crowd of hungry men  ive seen your face scorched and sometimes you burn your hands  then your being forced to wear those faded and mended dresses makes me angry  she laughed but the careless note in her voice was rather forced dont be foolish jim  if i had lots of smart clothes i couldnt wear them while i work about the fire  that is so he said frowning  you oughtnt to work about the fire  oh well its too late to bother now  for one thing i have educated the boys they wouldnt eat the hash you or jake could cook  but i expect you want to get to work and we had better make the camp  when they reached the camp jim got to work  he was anxious but admitted that the fire might die out on a stony belt where the bush was thin and perhaps he need not fear much trouble unless a chinook wind drove the flames up the valley  moreover since there was a risk of his being stopped it was prudent to push on  for two days he strained his muscles and urged the men and then one evening sat in his usual place listening rather moodily while jake and carrie talked  the evening was calm and the smoke had not advanced although it now covered much of the sky  the men had not gone to fish and lounged about the shack  they were tired and quiet for jim had driven them hard all day  he let his pipe go out and pondered  perhaps his disturbance was not logical but his habit was to concentrate on the work he undertook and it would hurt to own himself beaten and let the contract go  he had not been badly beaten yet and he had a vein of rather grim tenacity  after a time carries laugh banished his moody reflections and he looked up  the firelight touched her and although her eyes sparkled her pose was slack  now he studied her carefully her face was getting thin  she was obviously playing up to jake and he imagined their banter was meant to cheer him  carries clothes were shabbier than he had thought but they did not spoil her unconscious grace  it was unconscious grace because carrie did not pose  she looked at home and somehow made the camp look homelike  she was unembarrassed in the woods as she was at the store  jim wondered whether if they carried out the contract and earned the pay she would hold her own in different surroundings among fashionable women at summer hotels for example  somehow he thought she would  then a curious feeling of tenderness moved him  carrie looked tired and he owed her much  i wish you would put down that sewing he said  you are hurting your eyes  very well carrie agreed  i wasnt getting on fast and when you are bothered you have to be indulged  looks as if you were bothered jim  i suppose ive got the habit he replied  anyhow i dont like your sewing when you have hustled round all day  carrie laughed  you and jake are rough on clothes and somebodys got to mend  no said jim  in this country mendings not economical  its cheaper to throw away the things and buy another lot  where are you going to buy new clothes jim  that is something of a difficulty  i was talking about the principle youre too practical  oh well said carrie i suppose im not romantic  unless youre romantic in the right way youre ridiculous  i expect its easier to be useful  jim will agree jake remarked  he judges people by their talent for doing things but you cant fix a standard for everybody  he reckons i do too little i allow he does too much  he stopped and looked about  there was something oppressive in the heavy calm  the smoke went straight up and the pine twigs did not move  for a minute or two he waited with a feeling of tension and the others were silent  then the pine tops shook and were still again jim got up abruptly  that draughts not from the east  jake struck a match  the flame burned upright and then flickered and slanted  no he said its blowing up the valley  the flame went out the pinetops shook and did not stop  the air got hot and a smell of burning stole into the camp  i reckon its a chinook jake remarked  jim nodded and his face got stern  i have expected it all day  the fire will roll up the valley and i dont know where it will stop  we must break camp tomorrow and pitch farther along  he turned to carrie  can you be ready to start for the settlement in the morning  no but this doesnt matter because im not going  you must  the bush will burn like a furnace  do you and jake mean to quit  you ought to see we cant quit  carrie smiled  i do see it but if you have good grounds for stopping so have i  your grounds in fact  shucks  youre ridiculous  in a way of course i dont want you to go  thank you  was it hard to own that jim  however you wont have to make the effort to send me off because i mean to stay  jim turned to jake  this job is yours i dont see why you put it on to me  shes your sister and you ought to have some control  my control doesnt count for much jake admitted with a grin besides i allow you are the head of the firm  if im head some responsibility goes with the post  i suppose i am rather a responsibility carrie interposed  after all you are not very old and dont know much about managing an obstinate girl  i dont want to manage you jim rejoined  my notion is you have quietly managed us  ah said carrie it looks as if youre really cleverer than i thought  jim tried to hide his annoyance  i wish i was clever or somebody else had my job  anyhow you cant stop  in a day or two the line will be smothered in smoke and we may be forced back among the rocks where we cant take your tent  i dont see how were going to get provisions through  after all said carrie i dont think id catch fire sooner than you and jake and i certainly dont eat as much  then i can save where you would waste  she paused and gave jim a halfmocking smile  i imagine you mean well but ive resolved to stay  jim made a resigned gesture  then i expect theres no more to be said  well im tired and we must get busy again at sunup  he rose stretched his arms and went off     chapter xiii  jims luck turns  when the others went off carrie did not move  the smoke was getting thick the air was hot and now all was quiet she heard the roar of the fire  she pictured it creeping through the bush the flames leaping from branch to branch the red glow among the trunks that cracked and tottered and the crash when one fell  now and then she thought she heard the shock but it was scarcely distinguishable through the dull roar  the noise was strangely daunting  carrie meant to stay  she must hide her fears and smile  this was not a new line life was not easy for a girl who must work for all she got and she had known care  now and then unsatisfied creditors had threatened to close the store but when tears were near her eyes she had forced a laugh  there was much she could do in camp she could see the men were fed and try to cheer them when they came back gloomy and tired  sometimes a joke was strangely encouraging  by and by she got up and went to her tent  in the morning they broke camp and moved up the valley but although the fire was advancing jim did not go far  they might soon be driven back among the rocks where there were no trees to burn and he meant to work as long as possible  besides transport was difficult and he must have an open trail behind him  jim was getting anxious about this because if the fire followed them up provisions must be brought across the burning belt  it was characteristic that he took command  although jake had banteringly called him the boss they had no agreement about the matter  when things were normal each did what he thought needful and they seldom jarred  now however jim half consciously assumed firm control with his comrades support  he made all plans and the men seeing he had a leaders talent obeyed cheerfully  for some days their resolution was hardly tried  the fire rolled up the valley and for the most part they worked in thick smoke  at times the heat was intolerable and when the wind freshened showers of ash and sparks fell about them  although the fire did not advance fast their progress was slow  heavy stones must be rolled away treacherous gravel must be walled up and the line roughly graded  ashes stuck to the mens wet skin and they were often scorched by the hot wind  then at the close of each exhausting day the camp must be moved to the end of the cleared track  there was not much grumbling  the men were hard and stubborn but jim doubted if they could bear the strain long  he himself was worn out he could not relax at night and did not sleep  jakes scorched face was getting pinched  carrie alone was cheerful and tried to ease the crushing strain when they rested for an hour after the evening meal the meal was always ready and jim noted that the bill of fare was better than before  yet sometimes when carrie did not know he was studying her he thought her figure drooped and her eyes were dull  he said nothing but he was moved by pity and gratitude  at length one day when the wind was fresh and the fire had got ominously close he made a hard decision  since he could not keep in front he would follow the blaze which would lick up the brush and do some part of his work  the trouble was he must wait until the conflagration passed and the burned ruin cooled while wages mounted up and food got short  he said nothing to the others but when evening came and the tired men struck the tent he indicated a bare rocky slope  well make the big stones yonder boys  keep this side of the juniper scrub  the mens grim faces relaxed and one laughed  they saw the struggle was over for a time and the boss had made another plan  all had had enough and badly needed rest  carrie however looked at jim thoughtfully  i know youre not giving up but i dont understand  jim smiled  i may have to give up but not yet  in the morning the fire will reach the line  we are going to lie off and let it pass  ah said carrie with a hint of relief  can we wait  it will cost us something and we cant wait long but perhaps this wont be needful  now give me that bundle  the ground is rough  i wont said carrie moving back as he tried to take the bundle she had made of some clothes  you have an ax and a big bag of flour would it hurt very much to own that you sometimes get tired  jim laughed but did not answer and they went up the hill  they pitched camp among the rocks and in the morning jim climbed the range behind the spot  he did not come back until dusk but saw no way of bringing the supplies he would soon need across the rugged hills  one could not get up the valley for looking down from the heights he could see behind the fire and the ground was strewn with fallen trees some would burn for long and the ashes and hot stones would not cool soon while the rampikes that stood above the ruin would come down when a strong gust shook them  a brulée is dangerous when the wind blows and sometimes in a calm  for the next few days the fire raged below the camp and when jim ventured down hill he was driven back by heat and smoke  the fire was rolling up the valley but the wreckage it had left smoldered and now and then broke into flame  halfburned underbrush suddenly blazed and blackened logs glowed in the wind  there was nothing to be done but use patience and in the meantime the wages bill was mounting up and food was getting short  then one day the wind dropped  the distant peaks got hazy the shining glaciers faded and the outline of the rocks was blurred although the sun was dim it was very hot and jim felt morose and gloomy as he loafed about the camp  there was no use in going down to the line and he durst not hope for rain  after a few hours the wind might freshen and the sky clear  he had nothing to do and the reaction from the strain he had borne had begun  we miss the trout carrie remarked as she cooked supper  jake tried to get down to the river but couldnt make it  im afraid well soon miss the flour and salt pork  when theyre gone the boys will pull out said jim and then forced a laugh  anyhow if jake had got down i doubt if hed have caught much fish  i dont know a good bait for boiled trout  the flours not gone yet carrie rejoined  well hold on while it lasts and its going farther than you think  somehow i dont feel as if wed be beaten  we have come near it said jim with rather grim humor  one gets used to that and resolution counts when youre fighting a snowslide or a flood but were up against another proposition now  its so to speak mathematical nothing coming in and much going out  when we have no stores and money left we must quit  i suppose we must but id hate to see you let the job go and would feel mean myself  after all something may happen before we are forced to quit carrie replied and added with calm confidence something is going to happen  you have an optimism that cant be cured jim rejoined  however i dont know if id like it cured  he knocked out his pipe and began to cut some tobacco but stopped abruptly and looked up  whats that he asked as something pattered on the stiff foliage of a juniper  big drops said carrie  i felt a few before  jim got up  the light was going and it felt cool but the sky up the valley was not clouded much he could not see the other way  then a few large cold drops fell on his upturned face and next moment there was a quick splashing on the dusty juniper  he drew a deep breath and shook off his languidness  its coming heavy rain he cried  well make good after all  but lets move the stores  carrie laughed happily  you said i was too practical  whos practical now  but sometimes you get things mixed you reckoned not long since i was an optimist  i did jim admitted  practical planning and optimism make a strong combine and i imagine they are going to carry us through  but lets move the stores  he called the men and as they got all that would spoil covered there was a rush of cold wind and the rain beat upon the camp  it rains hard in british columbia and often rains long  they knew that by morning the rocks would run water and the deluge would quench the smoldering wreckage it might even quench the fire  after a day or two jim moved his camp to the line and one afternoon when he was working in the rain stopped and straightened his aching back  fine ash that had turned to mud smeared his wet slickers his face was thin and gloomy  his money was nearly gone and although the fire had burned out he did not see how he could finish his contract  the tangled brush had vanished and wet ashes covered the ground halfburned logs lay about and here and there small trees leaning at sharp angles with blackened branches locked held each other up  in places big charred rampikes stood in rows like colonnades  the nearer rows looked black farther off they shone in the rain with a curious silver gleam  the fire had helped to clear the ground but wet men were at work with axes and saws  by and by jim looked round  somebody had shouted and it was not one of his gang  the shout came from some distance off and while he tried to locate the spot a rampike slanted over and broke off  the burned trunk struck the ground with an echoing crash and a cloud of ash rolled up like smoke  there was now a gap in the row and as the ashes blew away jim saw packhorses in the opening  who is it he asked jake  a government outfit i expect  prospectors dont load up with tents and stores like that  if theyre government men it means somebody from the telegraph department is coming to look at our job  yes said jake  i reckon well soon know our luck  he waited for a few moments and added its the boss surveyor  the surveyor presently joined them and remarked as i have business at the new settlement i thought id see how you were getting on  we might have got on faster but we have had trouble all the time said jim  looks like that  i examined the work youve done as i came along and on the whole allow its a pretty good job  however well talk about that later the boys are tired and im glad to make your camp  the packhorses were unloaded and when the tents were pitched the surveyors cook helped carrie to prepare an unusually good meal  when it was over the party sat outside the surveyors tent which had a double top stretched on poles beyond its front  the surveyor studied their faces with understanding for he knew the wilds and noted signs of strain  he thought all had a finedrawn look  its obvious that you have been up against it he remarked  the big landslide must have made you trouble and no doubt the fire cost you something  running a camp is expensive when transports high  that is so carrie agreed feelingly  its curious but i think the boys eat most when they have nothing to do  the surveyor gave her a sympathetic smile  i imagine you dont stint them if this supper is a good example  he turned to jim  youre behind schedule but if you have no more bad luck i reckon you ought to finish on time  jim said nothing  he doubted if he could finish the job at all and wondered whether the other suspected his embarrassment  he meant to ask for some payment but it might be risky to admit that money was urgently needed  jake gave him a warning glance although he was silent and the surveyor looked about and noted much  jims long boots were broken and his slickers were torn winters carelessness was obviously forced but the surveyors study of carrie gave him the plainest hint  although she was neat he thought an attractive girl would not without good grounds wear clothes that had shrunk and faded and been mended as often as hers  well he resumed i expect you know payment in part is sometimes allowed before a job is finished but when we made our agreement nothing was stated about this  the custom has drawbacks for the people who let the contract jake remarked  very true agreed the surveyor  then you dont mean to bother us for money  it would of course be useful jake admitted in a thoughtful voice however if the office doesnt see its way  you would be satisfied to wait  jim frowned  jakes pretended indifference was prudent but he had overdone the thing  while jim wondered how he could put the matter right carrie interposed  my brother is generally hopeful  in a way thats good but sometimes hes rash  the surveyors eyes twinkled  do you mean hes rash just now  yes said carrie i really think i do mean this  i didnt know if it was rashness or common bluff  jake grinned rather awkwardly and jim colored but carrie fixed her eyes on the surveyor  it was all bluff from the beginning  we hadnt the money we needed when we took the contract and since then we have never had proper tools and help enough  in fact you had nothing much but obstinacy and grit  they sometimes go far in the bush but i dont know if theyll go far enough to carry you through  perhaps you had better be frank  i generally am frank  bluffings dangerous and my brother didnt know when to stop  anyhow unless we get some money soon im afraid well go broke  perhaps its strange but i rather suspected this the surveyor rejoined  well id like you to put the contract over  you have done good work uptodate and ill risk giving you an order on the pay office  if youll wait while i get a form ill do it now  he went into the tent and carrie smiled at the others  jim was conscious of keen relief and a touch of annoyance  although carrie had saved the situation he had let her undertake an awkward task that was properly his  then the surveyor came back and gave her a document  i imagine you are sometimes rash he remarked  didnt you see the line you took was risky  no said carrie smiling i wasnt rash at all  i know when i can trust people and didnt think you would let us down  all the same i knew you wouldnt give us a pay order unless you saw wed make good well we are going to make good and now thats done with well talk about something else  the surveyor laughed and began to talk about his journey but jim noted that he gave carrie an approving glance  next morning he went on and the others resumed their work with quiet confidence  the financial strain had slackened and they were not afraid of the physical difficulties that must yet be grappled with  rocks and trees could be moved so long as the men were paid and fed  still the fight was not over and their courage was tried when they carried the line along the moraine by a shrunken glacier and across a broken range  at length one evening jim took carrie up a hill and when they reached the top indicated a river that sparkled among the trees below  follow it down and look across the big pines on the flat he said  carrie looked and saw a thin blue haze floating about the trees  oh she cried its smoke  the high smear against the rocks is from a mine stack and i think i see the steam from a sawmill by the river jim said quietly  the line will soon be finished and you have helped us out  the color came into carries face and her eyes shone  perhaps i have helped some if i have im glad  now im proud of my family  you have put it over  we came near being beaten jim replied with some emotion  i think if you had not been with us we would have been beaten  carrie gave him a level glance  its done with jim  i wanted you and jake to make good for your sake and mine  you see if you couldnt have stood for it id have lost confidence in myself  im not sure i do see jim replied as they started down hill  its good to concentrate but perhaps you concentrate too much carrie resumed by and by  you see things right in front you dont look about  i suppose i am like that jim admitted  i dont know if its good or not  carrie smiled rather curiously  we didnt choose our characters they were given us  i wonder what would have happened had we been different  she stopped as they climbed across a fallen tree and said nothing more until they reached the camp     chapter xiv  the reckoning  when the line reached the settlement jim and his party returned to vancouver  shortly after their arrival martin came to see them  ive been in town some time and seeing a notice in the colonist that you had finished the job thought id like to tell you i was glad he said  carrie thanked him and by and by he asked have you had a fresh offer from baumstein for your copper claim  jim said they had not and martin smiled  i reckon the offer will arrive and now he knows you have got your pay hell put up his price  if it does arrive we wont reply said carrie firmly  i dont know if thats a good plan martin remarked  baumstein will offer about half as much as hes willing to give but id take hold and negotiate until i thought hed reached his limit  it will be under what the claim is worth  then id go along and try the combine  would they buy jim asked  go and see  although baumsteins pretty smart he doesnt know theyre quietly investing in northern copper i do  theres another thing if you have got specimens send some for assay to a different man  jim pondered  the analysis of the ore was not as good as he had expected and the miner who had examined the specimens at his camp agreed  for all that assayers were generally honest and skillful  whats the matter with the man i went to he asked  hes sometimes soused and you cant trust a tanker  then hes extravagant  ah said jim  is that all  martin gave him a dry smile  i happen to know baumstein lent him money  its possible he meant to get value for a risky loan  the others said nothing but they saw the significance of the hint and jims face got stern  theres something else  martin resumed  davies has left me and gone back to baumstein  gone back jake exclaimed  sure said martin quietly  i didnt know hed worked for the fellow when i hired him  now ive a notion hes been baumsteins man not mine all the time  jim clenched his fist and carries eyes sparkled  were up against a poisonous crook she said and looked at jim  you see why he made us trouble  he wanted to break us so wed sell him the bluebird cheap  its pretty plain  all the same i dont see what i ought to do about it  martins plan doesnt quite meet the bill id sooner try something a little more vigorous  carrie shook her head  you mustnt be a fool  the best way to play that kind of man is to use him  when he finds out it will hurt most  jim hesitated  he remembered the blow they had got at the beginning of the struggle and all that carrie had borne  baumsteins plot had drained their resources and made her suffer  martins plan is best you must agree she urged  very well said jim  jake can see the fellow and begin the negotiations ill come in afterwards  jakes something of a philosopher but id probably spoil the plot if i met baumstein before i cool  martin gave them some useful advice and then went away and a few days afterwards baumstein sent a message  jake played his part well indulging the others pretended indifference and arguing for better terms  sometimes he seemed on the point of yielding and then on his next visit found grounds for delay  at length when baumstein was getting impatient jake took jim to the office  baumstein occupied a revolving chair in front of a fine hard wood desk and gave the others a sharp glance as they came in  the office was very well furnished and baumstein wore fashionable clothes  there was a fine diamond in his ring  this annoyed jim who knew that while hardbitten prospectors braved the risks of starvation on the snowy trail greedy companyfloaters often got the reward  i hope you have come to clinch the deal baumstein remarked  ive met your partner as far as i can but the bargaining has gone on long enough  then you cant raise your price jim asked  baumstein studied him  winter had been compliant and apparently anxious to sell but there was something puzzling about his partner baumstein got a hint of sternness that he did not like  for all that bluff paid when one dealt with poor men  no he replied dryly  your partner has raised me to my limit and ive got to stop  you can agree right now or quit  oh well said jim  if you have gone as far as you are able may i use your telephone  certainly said baumstein and when jim picking up the instrument on the desk called the exchange suddenly straightened himself  he knew the number for which jim asked  winter and dearham said the latter  mr lamson  all right ill come along and fix things  well record the transfer when you like  baumstein swung round his chair and his face got red  whats that you told lamson  what does it mean  it means ive sold the bluebird claim  then you have been negotiating with the combine all the time  why in thunder did you come to me  for one thing we wanted to find out how much you would bid  it would be safe to ask another party more than you would give  we didnt know how much we ought to get  baumstein clenched his fist  you used me for a base to bluff from reckoning youd fall back on me if you couldnt put it over  no said jim  we didnt mean to deal with you at all  you helped us get a proper price that was your job  they looked at one another with mouths set hard and then baumstein broke out you swine  stop there said jim with ominous quietness  im back from using the ax in the bush and feel very fit  to put you out of your office would give me the keenest satisfaction and would be cheaper than getting after you through the court  shucks exclaimed baumstein  what are you giving me  i reckon you know  you put davies on our track he broke the line and sent a log down on our canoes  hes smart and both plots worked before we found him out  but we did find him out  baumstein hesitated wondering how much was supposition and how much jim really knew  youll be blamed foolish if you go to law with a tale like that  we dont propose to bother because i think were even  you helped us sell our claim and the combine know what you were willing to pay  we raised them some one could take it for granted you wouldnt reach just value  you told them what i offered baumstein shouted  we did jim said smiling  i expect they got a useful hint  in fact if you want to control northern copper you had better get busy it looks as if the combine were on your track  he paused and beckoned jake  well perhaps theres enough said  we mustnt keep you  they went off and left baumstein sitting very still with his fist clenched  a few days afterwards jim and jake waited for carrie one evening on the veranda at the store  mrs winter had refused to sell the business but jake had engaged extra help and they had arranged for a long holiday  the store standing back from the rough board sidewalk was small and shabby the street was torn by transferwagon wheels  a chinese laundry and a poolroom occupied the other side  sawmill refuse and empty coaloil cans had been dumped in a neighboring vacant lot  mean frame houses ran on from the store some surrounded by a narrow yard and some with verandas covered by mosquito gauze so that they looked like meatsafes  the neighborhood was strangely unattractive but one could see the sparkling inlet and the dark forest that rolled back to the shining snow  jim sitting in an old rockingchair was quietly satisfied  after taking mrs winter and carrie to lunch at a smart hotel he had loafed about the city without feeling bored  it was nice to know he had nothing to do and had money to spend  in fact he had relished a novel enjoyment when he visited some shops and bought presents for his hosts without thinking what they cost  now he languidly looked back on the years that had gone so quickly since his parents died  they were strenuous years marked by hardship toil and adventure for jim had not known monotonous quietness  even when he studied at mcgill he had worked between the terms in order to pay the fees  afterwards finding no field for such talent as he had he had sold his labor where he could  he had seen much and learned much but he was young and had a curious feeling that there were fresh experiences in store  by and by he banished the memories and looked at jake  i smile when i think about the time i hit martins camp pretty hungry and ragged and got after him about his sending davies on our track he said  jake laughed  after all i guess you took a useful line  made him feel hed got to show us he wasnt a crook  why did he want to show us  what we thought wouldnt matter a hill of beans  the fellows white jake replied  martin is white jim agreed looking at jake rather hard  we were getting pretty near the rocks when he gave us a lift  jake nodded  when their money was very low after the fire martin had suggested an arrangement that had worked for the benefit of all  jake hoped his comrade would be satisfied with his vague assent but doubted  why did he help jim resumed  the profit he got wasnt worth his bothering about  if you mean to know i reckon he thought carrie would like it  ah said jim frowning i suspected something like this  well we owe martin much but id sooner not think we let him give us a lift for your sisters sake  you ought to have refused  i didnt know  the things got obvious since  but you know now  yes said jake my notion is carrie could marry him when she liked  do you think she sees it  jake smiled  carries not a fool  if you and i see it the thing is pretty plain  all the same i imagine she is quietly freezing him off  jim was conscious of a rather puzzling satisfaction  martins a good sort and hes rich but theres no reason carrie should take the first good man who comes along he said  she ought to get the very best however its not my business and i dont know if its yours  its carries said jake rather dryly  shes generally able to manage her affairs  in fact i allow she was successful when she managed ours  he stopped for the door opened and carrie came out  she held a newspaper and looked excited  you had better read this advertisement jim she said  jim saw the newspaper was printed at montreal two years before  he glanced at the place carrie indicated started and then looked straight in front  how did you get the thing he asked after a moment or two  mother bought some old paper for packing  she took this piece just now to light the stove and saw the notice  but are you the man they want  yes said jim quietly  franklin dearham was my father  jake picked up the newspaper and they were silent for a few moments then carrie asked what are you going to do about it  to begin with ill write to the lawyers at montreal said jim who knitted his brows  after that i dont know  the advertisement is cautious but it looks as if joseph dearham was dead  i dont think my father expected to inherit his property  its puzzling  was joseph dearham rich jake asked  he had some land and money and the old house at langrigg  ive often thought about langrigg but id sooner the lawyers had left me alone  why  ive been happy in canada  ive friends i trust im making good and dont want to be disturbed  carrie gave him a quick glance but he went on then we meant to take a holiday and it looks as if i might be wanted in the old country  if you go they may keep you  i feel i have got to go although i dont like it jim replied with a puzzled look  something pulls and i resist  however come along were going to the park  they set off and jim tried to talk  carrie helped him and for a time they laughed and joked but the jokes got flat and all were rather quiet when they went home  they felt a disturbing change was coming things would not be the same  next morning jim wrote to the lawyers who asked him to meet a member of the firm at winnipeg  he grumbled and hesitated but went and did not return for some time  on the evening after his arrival he and the others sat talking in a little room behind the store  the room was cheaply furnished  the rough black pipe from the basement stove went up the middle and a threadbare rug covered half the floor mrs winter looking worn and faded occupied a rockingchair  she was better dressed than when jim first came to the house and he thought the rather expensive material had been chosen with taste  the quiet woman had a touch of dignity although she wore the stamp of toil  carrie sitting opposite had been occupied in the store all day and had refused to change her working clothes  since jims return was something of an event mrs winter was puzzled by her obstinacy  im glad to be back jim remarked  winnipeg is a fine city but i feel vancouvers home  mrs winter smiled but the look carrie gave jim was half ironical  you are glad to get back here  after stopping at a big hotel  i am glad  the hotel was crowded and never quiet  they had noisy electric elevators that went up and down all night and it wasnt much better when i dined at smart restaurants  thought id find this amusing but i didnt  had to push for a place at the tables and the waiters were slow  i felt i wanted to hustle round with the plates  sometimes youre rather clever jim carrie said meaningly  but i expect you liked the cooking  it was tolerable but no food ive got was half as good as the trout and bannocks we picked out of the hot spider in a valley of the north then theres no drink as refreshing as the tea with the taste of wood smoke i drank from a blackened can  it didnt often taste of smoke carrie objected  carrie can cook she owes that to me mrs winter interposed  she was ambitious when she was young and declared she had no use for studying things like that but i was firm  i wonder whether shes ambitious now jim remarked  ive got wise said carrie  i know where i belong  mrs winter looked at them as if she were puzzled and jim knitted his brows  i dont know where i belong  thats the trouble because it may hurt to find out  but how have you been getting on while i was away  trades pretty good thank you carrie replied  we have sold as much sweet truck as i could bake  the groceries have kept belle hustling  shucks said jim impatiently and turned to jake  you ought to make your mother sell out  he tried said mrs winter  i wont sell  jake has some money now but hes not rich and may hit a streak of bad luck  my children must go out and fight for all they get but i want them to know theres a little house in the home town where they can come back if theyre hurt and tired  besides ive kept store so long ive got the habit anyhow you have told us nothing about your business and were curious  jake and carrie dont look curious jim remarked dryly  well i went to the lawyers room mornings and answered his questions read the nightletters the montreal office sent him and waited for replies to their english cablegrams  but what did he say about your claim  i dont know if it will interest your son and daughter but ill tell you  there are some formalities yet but the fellow seems satisfied im joseph dearhams heir and im going to england soon  whether ill stay or not is another thing  well we had arranged for a long holiday and i dont mean to be cheated  im going to take you all to the old country  carrie colored but jake smiled  did you tell the lawyer about this plan  i did not said jim with a rather haughty look that carrie thought was new  langrigg is mine  its my pleasure to show it to my friends  mrs winter looked disturbed  you are kind jim but im an old woman and have never gone far from home  your relations mightnt like me  i dont know yet if my relations will like me  anyhow they have got to approve my guests  i wanted you to sell the store because if im satisfied with langrigg you maynt come back  theres no real difficulty about your coming  in fact you have got to come  mrs winter hesitated as if she were thinking hard and then her gentle face got resolute  very well  id like carrie to see the old country  jim turned to the others with a triumphant smile  its fixed  your mother will need you carrie and ill need my partner  we have put over some hard jobs and i imagine im up against another now  i want you jake you have got to see me out  since i dont know your folks and their habits it isnt plain how i could help jake replied  i dont know much  what about it  we made good prospecting when we had never used the rocker and thawnout gravel  we graded the packtrail across snowy range when we didnt know how to drill and start off giantpowder  well were going to make good at langrigg if i stay  then ill come for a time jake agreed and looked at carrie  i wouldnt like to be left alone she said and smiled  jim was satisfied  he had carried out his plan and it was significant that carrie was willing to go if martin had attracted her she would sooner have remained behind  in a way he thought it strange that mrs winter from whom he had expected most opposition was the first to agree but this was not important  after a time they went to the stanley park where jake and mrs winter met somebody they knew  carrie sat down on a bench under a giant fir and jim lighted a cigarette  you and jake rather puzzled me he remarked  you werent curious id a feeling that things were not the same  carrie gave him a steady look  im afraid we were very meanbut there was a difference  you were one of us when you went away you came back an english landowner  ah said jim i think i see  you wanted to give me a chance to drop you  did you think i would  no said carrie blushing  but it was possible  cutting the line was different it was a business proposition  she paused and added with a hint of regret its finished now  sometimes i think youre sorry  carrie said nothing and he went on was jakes throwing up his job and bringing me down from the shack a business proposition  your nursing me and our long talks by the camp fire  did you think i could forget these things  did you want me to forget  she looked up with some color in her face  not in a way jim but we took the proper line  we felt you ought to have a chance to let us go  and now i hope youre satisfied since you have found out im not as shabby as you thought  oh well said carrie smiling i suppose we do feel some satisfaction  then jake and mrs winter returned and they went to the canadian pacific station where jim asked about the steamship sailings     part iithe landowner    chapter i  jim comes home  the car ran out from the tall hedgerows that bordered the narrow road and at length jim could look about  he had not been able to see much on his way from the station where mordaunt had met him and now he had an unbroken view he studied the english landscape with keen curiosity on one side rugged mountains rose against the lowering sky but a moving ray of sunshine touched the plain below  in front the road ran across a marsh between deep ditches where tall sedges grew  beyond the marsh wet sands stretched back to the blurred woods across a bay and farther off low hills loomed indistinctly in the mist  jim noted that the landscape had not the monotony he had sometimes felt in canada  the fields behind the marsh looked ridiculously small but some were smooth and green and some dotted by yellow stocks of corn then there was a play of color that changed from cold blues and grays to silver and ochre as the light came and went  white farmsteads standing among dark trees were scattered about but the country was not tame  the hills and wide belt of sands gave it a rugged touch there had been some rain and the wind was cold  as the car jolted along the straight road between the ditches jim began to muse  he had felt a stranger in london where he had stopped a week  he knew the canadian cities but london was different  yet since he left the station the feeling of strangeness had gone it was as if he had reached a country that he knew  he wondered whether he unconsciously remembered his fathers talk or if the curious sense of familiarity was so to speak atavistic  this however was not important and he glanced at carrie who sat behind with mrs winter and jake  carrie had frankly enjoyed her holiday indeed jim thought she had felt more at home than he when they were in town  somehow she did not look exotic among the englishwomen at the hotel and when mordaunt met them at the station she had with a kind of natural tact struck the proper note  she knew mordaunt was a relation of jims but she met him without reserve or an obvious wish to please  if either were conscious of surprise or embarrassment jim thought it was mordaunt presently the latter indicated a low ridge that broke the level marsh it rose against the background of misty hills and a creek that caught the light and shone wound past it to the sands  in one place a gray wall appeared among stunted trees  langrigg he said  well arrive in a few minutes  he blew the horn a boy ran to open a gate and as they climbed the hill jim saw a stripped cornfield a belt of darkgreen turnips a smooth pasture and a hedge  then a lawn with bright flowerborders opened up and on the other side a house rose from a terrace  its straight front was broken by a small square tower pierced by an arch and old trees spread their ragged branches across the low roof  the building was of a type not uncommon in the north of england and had grown up about the peel tower that had been a stronghold in the scottish wars  there were barns and byres in the background and it was hard to tell if langrigg was a wellkept farm or a country house  the strange thing was jim knew it well  he felt as if he had come to a spot he often visited in fact he had a puzzled feeling that he had come home  then he saw people on the terrace and the car stopped  he jumped out and after helping mrs winter down got something of a shock for as the group advanced he saw the girl he had met at the montreal restaurant  for a moment he forgot mrs winter and fixed his eyes on the girl  she moved with the grace he remembered and her white dress outlined her figure against the creeper on the wall  she was rather tall and finely but slenderly proportioned and when she looked up he knew she was as beautiful as he had thought  then he roused himself and went forward with his friends  mordaunt presented him to mrs halliday who gave him her hand with a gracious smile  i knew you when the car came up the drive  you look a dearham she said  since bernard is unwell we thought we ought to come and welcome you  then she beckoned the others  my daughter evelyn and my son dick  the girl glanced at jim curiously as if puzzled but her brother laughed  this is something of a romantic surprise he said  perhaps its curious but ive thought about you since the night of the blizzard when we came to your shack  jim indicated his party  i want you to know my canadian friends i owe them much  mrs and miss winter from vancouver city and my partner jake  mrs halliday had studied the group but she gave them another glance she thought mrs winter was not important  the thin tired woman was of a common type and had obviously come from a rude canadian town mrs halliday did not know much about vancouver  the girl however had individuality and a touch of beauty mrs halliday felt she must be reckoned on  the young man puzzled her because she could not place him  in some ways he looked like a rather superior workman but he was unembarrassed and although he waited calmly she imagined he was amused  on the whole they were not the guests one generally received at an english country house but mrs halliday knew her duty and welcomed them with a gracious air  they went in and jim heard with satisfaction that the others meant to dine with him because he wanted to talk with evelyn  he came down as soon as he could hoping he might find her in the hall but nobody was there and for some minutes he looked about  the hall occupied the lower story of the tower  it was square and roughlyhewn beams slightly curved crossed the ceiling  the spaces between were paneled with dark wood and an oak wainscot ran round the wall  half of one side was occupied by a big fireplace and its old handforged irons the carved frame and mantel were jacobean and obviously newer than the rest  the old windows however had been enlarged and a wide casement admitted a cold light  by and by mordaunt came in  the latter was thin and dark his face was rather inscrutable but he had a superficial urbanity  jim wondered what lay beneath this and imagined it might be long before he found out  until he got down from the train they had not met since mordaunt came to the telegraph shack and jim did not know if he liked the fellow or not  after a time there was a step on the stairs that went up the wall and jim looked up half expecting to see evelyn  at first he was conscious of some disappointment for carrie was coming down  by george said mordaunt softly  jim understood the exclamation for he had not until now realized that carrie was beautiful  her color was rather high and her face looked strangely cleancut against the background of dull brown oak  her eyes were a curious gray that changed to sparkling hazelbrown with the light her hair was brown with a coppery gleam and her dress a soft green  jim had not seen the dress before and did not know if it was the latest fashion but he felt that carries choice was good  it was not that the harmonious color gave her beauty the effect was deeper the girl had a touch of dignity that was rather natural than cultivated  she lifted her head and smiled as she went up to jim and asked as if mordaunt was not there how do you like me  in a way youre wonderful jim replied  of course i knew that beforewhen you nursed me and in the woodsbut somehow i hadnt expected this  when did you get the dress  when we were in london  i hadnt long but i wanted to be just right carrie answered with a blush  then she laughed  youre very nice jim but do i really fit in  marvelously mordaunt interposed  if my opinion is worth much you look as if you belonged to langrigg  that is you go back beyond our times to the folks who built the peel to keep out the scots  jim nodded  mordaunt had said what he himself had vaguely thought the fellow was sensitive and had felt the girls virility  jim was a little surprised that carrie who knew nothing about the border wars seemed to understand for she gave mordaunt a quiet but rather piercing look  well she said  i have been up against nature where shes raw and savage in the woods  perhaps that accounts for it mordaunt replied smiling  nature is savage in the frozen north perhaps jim told you i have been there but i imagine you made good  jim made good  i like to think i helped  i expect your help was worth much said mordaunt  carries glance rested on him calmly and he felt that she needed study she did not speak however and mrs halliday and the others came in after a few minutes they went to the paneled diningroom and jim forgot carrie when he sat down by evelyn  her color was subdued her skin for the most part ivory white and she had black eyes and hair although rather tall she looked fragile but she was marked by a fastidious grace and calm that jim thought patrician  this was not the word he wanted but he did not know another  its curious but i seem to know you she said presently  i dont think it is very curious jim replied  you see i met you at the restaurant near the postoffice in montreal  yes said evelyn with a puzzled look i remember our going there but we didnt talk to anybody  i brought your lunch said jim fixing his eyes on her face  then you were the waiter she remarked tranquilly  jim smiled  he felt that she had passed a rather awkward test and he was satisfied  since you must have waited on a large number of people it is strange you remembered me she resumed  no he said  i hadnt met an english woman of your kind before and for that matter i havent met one since  he paused and added i expect this accounts for it  evelyns eyes twinkled  he was obviously sincere and she felt amused he was a new and rather good type she thought  his figure was athletic his face was thin and brown his glance was steady but searching and she liked his quiet manner  but you had other occupations besides waiting hadnt you she asked  i was a miner in the north for some time  that must have been interesting  were you successful  i found a copper vein and was lucky enough to sell it rather well  then is it difficult to sell a mine  as a rule its much harder than finding one jim answered with a smile  in general the miner struggles with halfthawn gravel that often fills up his shallow shaft and sometimes nearly starves in the tundra bogs while the man with money enough to work the vein gets the profit  it cost us something to hold on until we got a just price  evelyn did not know much about the canadian north but she could imagine his holding on  i expect you will find langrigg different from the british columbian wilds she said  do you feel strange here  jim looked about  the long room was paneled the ceiling was low and the wide casement commanded a view of the level marsh and shining sands  it was different from the dark pine forests and snowy peaks of british columbia  the fine old china and silver tall candlesticks and the flowers on the table were in marked contrast with the rude furniture of camp and shack  no he said thoughtfully  when one has wandered about a new country meeting all kinds of people and doing all kinds of jobs i imagine one would not feel very strange anywhere  besides ive a curious notion that i have come home  after all you are a dearham perhaps this accounts for something evelyn remarked and glanced at carrie  did you meet your friends when you were at montreal  jim met us in vancouver  jake brought him to the store when he was ill mrs winter replied  the store said evelyn  mrs winter means a shop mordaunt explained  oh said evelyn that is interesting  what did you sell  most everything people wanted  dry goods groceries sweet biscuitsyoud call it cakeand we had quite a trade in sundaes  what is a sunday  mordaunt laughed  a little delicacy you consume on the spot  i imagine its sometimes an ice and sometimes a sweetmeat or a cleverly mixed drink  perhaps its oftenest enjoyed on sundays and holidays but they dont spell it with a y  i must try to remember  but who made these nice things  carrie said mrs winter with a look of pride  she baked the biscuit too  i dont think i should like baking  one must get so hot evelyn remarked and turned to carrie  was it hard work  carrie was talking to dick halliday but she looked up and laughed although there was a touch of color in her face  oh no she said  anyhow it was not as hard as cooking for the boys in the woods  i did all the cooking and they liked the hash i put up  jim thought carries western accent was rather marked and wondered why she had said hash  evelyns questions had been asked with languid good humor as if she meant to draw carrie into the talk but somehow jim got a hint of antagonism between the girls  this puzzled him and he was glad when mrs halliday began to talk about something else evelyn did not support her much but mrs halliday was firm  you must tell us about your adventures evelyn said as they got up but when they went on the terrace jim followed carrie  although he wanted to talk to evelyn carrie must not feel neglected  she gave him a rather curious smile when he stopped by the stone bench she occupied  i allow your english relations have first claim on you tonight she remarked  you can talk to me when you like  a new claim doesnt wipe out older ones jim replied  i suppose that is so carrie agreed  youre rather obvious jim but you mean well  then she got up and joined dick halliday and jim felt puzzled     chapter ii  jims guests  after breakfast next morning jim and his friends went out on the terrace  the tide was full and the woods across the bay looked like islands  a line of white surf marked the edge of the marsh which ran back broken by winding creeks to the foot of the rising ground sometimes a gleam of sunshine touched the lonely flats and they flashed into luminous green silver and yellow  then the color faded and the light moving on forced up for a few moments the rugged blue hills against their misty background  the landscape had not the sharp distinctness common in canada it was dim and marked by an elusive charm  jim began to think about evelyn  she was somehow like the country her charm was strong but not obtrusive  one could not so to speak realize evelyn at a glance she was marked by subtle refinements and delicacies that one rather felt than saw  her english reserve was fascinating because it hinted at the reward one might get if one could break it down  carrie too was thinking about evelyn mrs winter was sewing and jake occupied himself by cleaning an old pipe  its some time since we broke camp on the telegraph line carrie remarked  do you find having nothing to do comes easy jim  i dont expect to be idle long  its prudent to consider before you begin to move  carrie felt that jim was getting english  he had of course been to mcgill but since they reached the old country he was dropping his western colloquialisms  she thought it significant that he did so unconsciously  perhaps id better tell you how things are so far as i understand them he went on  to begin with running a house like langrigg is expensive and i doubt if i am rich enough to loaf in proper style  if you want to loaf in proper style you must be born and raised for the job jake observed  thats true to some extent jim agreed  i was brought up to work and have got the habit  well my farm rents amount to something but when you have paid taxes and repaired the homesteads they dont leave very much  it seems there are people in england willing to pay for owning land but that plans not sound  then you have another  its not worked out  the leases of two good farms soon fall in and i may manage them myself  then i own the marsh which feeds some sheep and cattle in summer  the soils good alluvial like the gumbo on the manitoba plains and would grow heavy crops if one could keep out the water  well we have seen small homesteaders draining canadian muskegs a long haul from a railroad while we have a good market for all farming truck in two hours ride  the proposition however needs some thought  it might cost me all ive got  jakes eyes twinkled  i reckon that wouldnt stop you if you resolved to dyke the marsh  you didnt get much money when you got the estate  i did not  i understand joseph dearham was not rich and when he found his health was breaking down he gave some money to his relations people here try to get out of the inheritance duties like that besides he had not meant to give my father much  however i have a rich relation from whom i want nothing but whom the others think i ought to satisfy  bernard dearham  dick halliday talked about him  jim nodded  bernard is my grandfather josephs brother  joseph was satisfied to live quietly at langrigg like a small country gentleman bernard got rich by opening some iron mines not far off  joseph married twice and mrs halliday and mordaunts mother were his second wifes daughters  she was a widow with two children when she married joseph  so you see mrs halliday is not my aunt  then evelyn halliday is not your cousin carrie remarked  i suppose shes not said jim  anyhow since im a dearham a descendant in the male line it seems ive a stronger claim on bernard than the others  i dont mean to urge the claim  he didnt give me langrigg he left my father alone and if i keep the place im going to run it as i like  do you mean to keep langrigg carrie asked  jim looked thoughtful  i imagine so i dont know yet  there are drawbacks but something pulls  ill wait a bit before i decide  he got up and beckoned jake  lets go and see the farms  they went off and carrie turned to mrs winter  hell stay well lose him soon  i think i knew we would lose him when you found the advertisement  she paused and mrs winter remembered that when she had shown the girl the old newspaper carrie had hesitated for a moment or two  she however said nothing and carrie resumed  well i wanted to see the old country and you needed a rest  the life they live here is fuller than ours its something to enjoy it for a time but we wont stay long although jim is kind  mrs winter gave her a keen glance but carries face was calm  then she picked up her sewing and carrie studied the old house  langrigg meant much to jim and she thought would presently mean more  she vaguely understood his feelings and tried to sympathize although the effort cost her something  in the meantime jim went to see his tenants  he dined with one at noon in an old farm kitchen and afterwards occupied himself by examining horses buildings and agricultural machines  on the whole he puzzled the small farmers to whom a landlord of his type was new although they liked his frankness and answered his direct questions since it was obvious that this was a man who knew how things were done some of the tenants who had known his grandfather talked about jim afterwards and agreed that he had not much in common with the country gentleman he was like bernard dearham who opened the famous iron mines  when they returned in the afternoon across the small turnip and stubble fields jim said to jake ive seen enough of the plow land  lets go across the marsh  jake agreed and by and by jim leaning against a gate indicated the long rows of hedges that ran down the slope and melted into an indistinct mass on the level plain  theres nothing much to be done here in the meantime  these folks are wasting labor and money plowing their little fields but i reckon theyre slow and stubborn  it wouldnt pay to hustle them yet  no said jake with a twinkle  i expect it hurts to feel you must keep your hands off but you seem to know when youve got to allow for the idiosyncrasies of human nature  its harder to use men properly than horses and machines  some day perhaps ill grub out these hedges and make room for the tractors to rip a furrow right across the farms  ive no use for wasting land on weeds and thorns  you think so now jake rejoined  you havent been here very long and theres something insidious about the country its oldtime customs get hold of one  then i dont know if the tractors picturesque and cutting down trees and hedges might spoil the landscape  it wouldnt be quite so english after you had done  jim looked at him rather hard  sometimes youre pretty smart anyhow i cant spoil the marsh by covering it with good grass and corn and if the thing could be done economically it ought to pay  its possible  are you keen about the profit  or do you want a new big job  im not going to philosophize thats your proper line jim answered with a laugh  lets see if the creeks could be dyked  they went down the hill and plunged into a belt of tall dry grass crossed a broad tract of smooth green turf dotted by thrift and silver weed and pushed on to the lower flats where the sealavender and samphire grew  then they skirted miry creeks that gradually filled with weeds as they neared dry ground and went home to langrigg by the causeway road  jim was muddy but happy although he told himself he had not decided yet halfformed plans floated through his brain  a day or two afterwards dick halliday and mordaunt came over to langrigg and were shown into the hall  jim was not there but his pipe and some books lay about and the others sat down  presently dick picked up a book and saw it was the old french romance from which mordaunt had read a passage at the telegraph shack  he opened it carelessly and then started when he saw franklin dearham written in faded ink on the first blank page  he looked across at mordaunt and hesitated with a vague suspicion in his mind  it was possible the latter had seen the writing when he opened the book at the shack and if he had  you look as if you have found something interesting mordaunt remarked  it is interesting said dick and felt relieved when he heard a step in the passage  he did not think mordaunt sitting some distance off knew the book  next moment jim came in and stated that he was alone  mordaunt lighted a cigarette jim gave him and asked if his friends were staying long  i dont know said jim  we have made no plans yet but i imagine i shall keep langrigg  do you mean you had thought about selling the estate mordaunt asked rather sharply  i did think about it but dont know if i went much farther  the matters complicated  langrigg is rather an expensive house to manage and the farm rents are low mordaunt answered in a thoughtful voice  have you any money perhaps im blunt but im a relative  i have some  not enough to help me do all i want  you mean to do something then  if i stay im going to put up the farm rents though i mean to help my tenants pay  im going to enlarge the small fields alter boundaries and fix things so the land can be worked on the economical canadian plan  the drawback is it may cost me much and i must wait for the return  dick laughed  there are other drawbacks and it may cost you more than you know  in this country you cant do what you like and we resent experiments  if you meddle with oldfashioned customs youll raise the neighborhood against you  in a sense the trees and hedgerows youd cut down are your neighbors  i believe theyre mine jim rejoined dryly  however i dont suppose id bother anybody if i dyked and drained the marsh  drain the marsh  mordaunt exclaimed  thats frankly ridiculous its a favorite haunt of the lag geese and in a dry autumn i dont know a better spot for snipe  there you are you see dick interposed with a twinkle  perhaps you dont understand that its a serious matter to disturb a few sportsmen  looks as if i might disturb a number of people before im through jim replied  anyhow i havent made my calculations yet and dont know if my money will go round  i wonder whether you understand that you are bernard dearhams nearest relation and his approval is important mordaunt remarked  jim pondered  he liked dick and thought he trusted him but he was not certain if he trusted mordaunt  on the whole he thought the fellow meant to give him good advice but he was a type jim did not know much about  although he was highly cultivated jim thought he had conservative prejudices and an exaggerated pride  the pride was of course not obtrusive but it was there  the lawyers hinted something like that and mrs halliday made it plainer he answered cautiously  mordaunt saw he would say nothing more and they were silent for a few moments until dick got up and said he would ask the gardener for some plants the man had promised his mother  he wanted the plants but he wanted to think for he was curious about the french romance  if lance had seen franklin dearhams name he must have known jim was his son and had meant to let him stay in canada  lances manner when they talked about jim at the shack to some extent justified the supposition moreover while lance had gone to langrigg with the object of giving jim good advice there was something curious about his tone  he was urbane but one noted a hint of superiority or perhaps patronage that the other might resent  all the same it was not dicks business and he went to look for the gardener  in the meantime mordaunt said to jim you suggested that your canadian friends might make a long visit  i did id like them to stay for good  do you think its prudent mordaunt asked quietly  jim looked hard at him with a touch of haughty surprise and mordaunt resumed in a conciliatory voice perhaps im getting on dangerous ground but i mean well and if you dont see  to begin with have you thought about marrying miss winter  i have not  im certain she has not thought about marrying me  no doubt you know mordaunt agreed with some dryness  for all that my inquiry was perhaps justified  the girl is unformed but shes beautiful and i think shes clever  you can leave miss winter out  now i suppose you have cleared the ground and theres something else  mordaunt made a deprecatory gesture  ill be frank because i dont want you to make mistakes  if you are going to stay at langrigg you owe something to the family and yourself  a country gentleman has social duties and much depends on what your neighbors think about you at first  very well  your canadian friends wear the stamp of the rank to which they belong it was hardly necessary for mrs winter to state that she had kept a small store  these are not the kind of people your neighbors would like to receive  then bernard dearhams family pride is known i imagine he largely persuaded your grandfather to alter his will  jim got up and his face was quietly stern  langrigg is mine my grandfather gave it to me without my asking for the gift he said  i owe my relations nothing and dont acknowledge bernard dearhams rule  none of you bothered about my father you were glad to leave him and me alone  i had no claim on my canadian friends and they had nothing to gain but they nursed me when i was ill and my partner stood by me in the blizzards and cold of the north  now you ask me to turn them down because theyre not the people neighbors i dont know would like to meet  do you think i will agree  mordaunt shrugged and forced a smile  oh well in a sense i suppose your attitude is correct  there is obviously nothing more to be said  dick came in soon afterwards and mordaunt went off with him but he had given jim a jar and the latter walked about the terrace until mrs winter and the others returned from a drive  carrie gave jim a quick glance as she advanced  she knew his moods and saw he was disturbed the drive had brought the color to her skin she looked very fresh and her step was light  jim felt savage as he remembered mordaunts patronizing remark  carrie was beautiful  has something been bothering you jim she asked  it is not important he replied  if you own land in this country it seems you must submit to a number of ridiculous rules and folks wont leave you alone  however did you like the town  we were charmed  its a quaint old place and the country round is so green and quiet  everythings smooth and wellkept the trees look as if somebody had taught them how they ought to grow  you feel as if all the rough work had been done long since and folks have only to take care of things  i like it all  then you will be satisfied to stay at langrigg  for a time  if you want us  id be happy if youd stay for good  carrie said nothing for a moment and then smiled  thats impossible though youre very nice  well make the most of our holiday but its only a holiday  she turned rather quickly and joined mrs winter who was going into the house     chapter iii  mordaunt ponders  it was raining and mordaunt stood by an open window in mrs hallidays drawingroom at whitelees  a smell of stocks came in and across the lawn rows of dahlias phlox and autumn lilies made a belt of glowing color against a dark yew hedge  the hedge was neatly clipped and the turf was very smooth  by and by mordaunt turned and glanced about the room which he knew well  whitelees was modern and although mrs halliday sometimes grumbled about her poverty its furniture and decoration indicated extravagance  mordaunt however thought there was too much ornament and doubted if some of the pottery was genuine the room was pretty but he was a connoisseur and was not satisfied with prettiness  he liked langrigg better than whitelees  langrigg was austere and dignified  mordaunt was not at all austere although he was not effeminate or luxurious  he was a good sportsman something of an artist and a traveler  he had talent and might perhaps have made his mark if he had not had just enough money to meet his needs and exaggerated dislike for competitive struggle  it had been a bitter disappointment that he had inherited very little of joseph dearhams property although none of his relations suspected this for mordaunt knew how to hide his feelings  he was stubbornly conservative and held tenaciously the traditions of his class  presently mrs halliday came in  mordaunt who knew his aunt well thought she harmonized with her room  she was a handsome gracious woman but one felt now and then that her charm was forced and artificial  after telling mordaunt to sit down she remarked  i understand you went to langrigg  i did go said mordaunt  my visit was not a success  perhaps its curious but evelyns judgment was better than ours  she doubted if you would succeed  i believe she said you ought to go because the thing needed a lighter touch than mine  mrs halliday smiled  your touch is not often clumsy lance  but what line did jim take  i suppose we must call him jim  a significant concession but he certainly shows the dearham vein  he used some warmth and indulged a little raw sentiment  expediency doesnt count for much with him  you mean his canadian friends are going to remain  yes said mordaunt  as long as they like  i imagine they will stay some time  mrs halliday waited for a moment  she thought lance understood there was something else she wanted to know but he was silent and she remarked  after all they might be left in the background  besides the girls mother is there  it is hard to keep a canadian in the background and jim wont try still he made an interesting statement he has not thought about marrying the daughter  that is some relief  well something depends on bernard  mordaunt agreed  much depended on bernard  the old man was rich and mordaunt had much less money than he would like indeed he had long reckoned on an improvement in his fortune when bernard died  his claim however was not as strong as jims and bernard was eccentric but mrs halliday resumed  is jim able to keep up langrigg properly  he was not remarkably frank about this  he stated he might not be able to do all he would like  well i have no doubt you gave him good advice and your trying to persuade him was generous  mordaunt thought he had been generous because if he had persuaded jim to rule in a way bernard approved and the latter made him his heir all that jim got would be taken from the others  to some extent he had been sincere but he could not claim that he had done his best  a feeling of antagonism had sprung up and perhaps he had let this influence him  its unfortunate jim was obstinate mrs halliday went on  his keeping these people is awkward but after all it will cost him most and he is one of us  jim has langrigg said mordaunt smiling  our duty is to acknowledge and if needful indulge him  i dont like you when youre ironical mrs halliday rejoined and looking up saw that evelyn had come in  she wondered how long the girl had been there  you dont look as if you were satisfied with your visit to langrigg lance evelyn said as she sat down  im resigned  thats different from being satisfied  but you were plucky  the matter must have needed tactful management miss winter is attractive  jim is not going to marry her if that is what you mean he stated he had not thought about it mordaunt said bluntly  evelyn laughed  then its probably true  if he had meant to marry miss winter he would have said so even if he thought you disapproved jim is very much of a dearham  is this an advantage or a drawback  i dont know said evelyn  it marks the difference between him and us  were fastidious and complex the dearhams are simple and firm  a cruder type  not altogether  strength and simplicity are dignified  youre an artist and know the value of bold austere line  my notion is jim is not as simple as he looks  thats rather cheap evelyn remarked  i meant the simplicity of the old greeks  theirs was cultivated jims is not  there are things one does better by instinct than study said evelyn smiling  but im getting bored  lets talk about something else  soon afterwards mordaunt drove back to dryholm where bernard had built his ambitious house  mordaunt had no occupation and generally stopped at dryholm  there was plenty of room and although the old man was often ironical mordaunt imagined he liked to have him about  the rain had stopped the wet road was smooth and as the car ran past the yellow stubble fields he gave himself to thought  it was plain that mrs halliday meant to make a friend of jim and her object was not hard to see since langrigg gave its owner some importance  evelyn was curious about jim mordaunt did not know if he attracted her but the possibility of ruling at langrigg had no doubt some charm  she would toy with the idea  mordaunt was not in love with evelyn but they agreed in many ways and he had for some time weighed the advantages his marrying her would bring  she was his cousin but cousins did marry now and then and since the marriage would consolidate family interests he imagined their relations would approve  in fact he had imagined mrs halliday knew his views and he could count on her support  now however he suspected she had gone over to jim  for all that mordaunts dissatisfaction was not quite selfish  jim was something of a savage and meant to manage the estate on business lines  the fellow was going to farm and make his farming pay  if he had been a sportsman and made experiments in agriculture when he had nothing else to do it would have been different but this was not jims plan  the strange thing was jims notion of dyking the marsh annoyed him more than all the annoyance was perhaps illogical but he could not conquer it  mordaunt was a naturalist and a wildfowler and did not think there was in england such a haunt of the lag and black geese as langrigg marsh  now jim with rude utilitarian ideas was going to drive the geese away  the car lurched on the grass by the roadside as it took a corner and mordaunt roused by the jolt concentrated on his driving  when he reached dryholm he crossed the lawn and stopped by a wheeled chair in which bernard dearham sat with his foot propped up  the old man was tall and strongly made but had got thin and his pinched face was marked by deep lines  he had worked with consuming energy and sometimes indulged for bernard had nothing of the fastidiousness that marked his relatives  now his strength was broken and he was bothered by gout  he dismissed the man who had pushed the chair and gave mordaunt a quick glance  bernards brows were white but his eyes were keen  take me to the bench out of the wind he said and looked down when mordaunt began to move the chair  it will give creighton a job to roll out these marks  the fellow grows fat and lazy and i hate the crunching gravel  mordaunt thought the remark was characteristic  the wheeltracks could hardly be seen on the fine turf but bernard disliked untidiness  when they reached the sheltered bench and mordaunt sat down bernard looked up and asked where have you been  i was at whitelees  i expect you had something to talk about just now  you and janet halliday understand each other well  i dont know if you are confidants or accomplices  perhaps we have made a few innocent plots mordaunt admitted with a smile  however i imagine it has generally been for the advantage of the family  bernard nodded  well i suppose your objects are sometimes good as far as you see though i doubt if you always see far enough  but i wondered whether you had gone to langrigg  its possible janet has made some plot for jims advantage  i hardly imagine him a promising subject for experiments  you mean hes not compliant  what else  i havent known him very long and would sooner reserve my judgment  bernard gave him an ironical smile  you dont want to prejudice me against him  well youre always tactful and its comforting to feel youre sometimes just  however i want to form an opinion  write and ask him to come  he has friends at langrigg  perhaps you know  i do know  ask his friends  you may state that im an old man and am unable to go to him  i can leave you to strike the right note you have some talent for that kind of thing  mordaunt said he would write  he was used to bernards bitter humor and on the whole thought it advisable that he should see jims friends it was possible he would get a jar but one could not tell  the old man was capricious and hard to understand  didnt evelyn join the party that went to welcome jim bernard resumed  rather a happy thought of janets  do you know how he impressed evelyn  i do not  she did not give me her confidence said mordaunt as shortly as he durst  bernards eyes twinkled  was it necessary  with your talent one ought not to find it difficult to read a girls mind  i havent always found it easy mordaunt rejoined  well i suppose evelyn is really a woman now when one gets old one forgets that the young grow up bernard remarked  besides she has an admirable model in janet  but take me in i soon get cramped in this confounded chair  mordaunt set off and on his way to the house carefully skirted a spot where a tree had been uprooted and the turf relaid  to his surprise bernard made an impatient sign  go straight across  they crossed the freshlysodded belt and when mordaunt stopped on the terrace bernard said it will not be your job to roll out our tracks  i thought it would bother you if i went across mordaunt replied  bernard gave him a sour smile  i well know my relations views about my character and in the main theyre just but they sometimes go wrong when they imagine their rules are mine  probably you have not felt it would be a relief to plow through things without bothering about the marks you left  no said mordaunt i dont think i have felt this  youre  a logical fellow bernard rejoined  well for the most part i have been a slave to my notions of efficiency and order since i was a boy but at times other feelings rebelled  then i so to speak ran loose and broke things like the rest of mankind  moreover im not repentant when i look back on the shortlived outbreaks  they gave me some satisfaction after all the dearham blood is what canadian jim would probably call red  i dont know what color yours is unless you like to think it blue  mordaunt said nothing  bernard was often bitter particularly when he had gout  when a servant came to help the old man in mordaunt went to the library where he wrote a note to jim  he paused once or twice during its composition  now he had time to ponder he began to doubt if it was advisable to let jim visit dryholm and imagined he could so turn a polished phrase that it would keep him away  mordaunt was clever at delicate implication and jims blood was red  perhaps however it was not prudent to use his talent since bernard might want to see the note     chapter iv  an old mans caprice  jim went to dryholm although when he opened mordaunts note he meant to refuse  a line added in a shaky hand persuaded him for bernard had written i am lame and cannot come to you  besides the invitation was extended to his party and jim wanted bernard to see the winters they were his friends and he rather hoped mrs winter would talk about the store  the evening was calm and the sun setting when the car rolled past a lodge half hidden by tall evergreens  a screen of ironwork cut in fine black tracery against the light and jake remarked thats a noble gate  handforged in belgium i believe jim replied and they rolled on down an avenue where sunshine and shadow checkered the smooth grass  the avenue had been planted before the new house at dryholm was built the spreading oaks were darkly green but the beeches had begun to turn and their pale trunks glimmered among splashes of orange and red  on the hillside above the hollow the birches hung sprays of shining yellow against a background of somber firs  all was very quiet and carrie sensed a calm she had not remarked in the forests of canada there one heard the chinook in the pinetops and the rapids brawl  they sped past a tarn where swans floated among the colored reflections of ancient trees and then dryholm broke upon their view across its wide lawn  for a moment carrie was vaguely disturbed  she had seen montreal and london but the buildings there were crowded with occupants and this was one mans home  jim whose clothes she had mended belonged to people who built such houses  she glanced at him but his face was inscrutable until he seemed to feel her gaze and gave her a smile  carrie felt braced  in some ways jim had got strangely english but he was for all that the jim she knew and she studied the house with a pleasant thrill as if she were embarking on a new adventure  dryholm was very large and modern but it had dignity and glimmered in the sunset between shadowy woods  the stone was creamy white with touches of soft pink and gray  cornices and pillars broke the long straight front and there were towers at the ends  carrie knew nothing about architecture but she got a hint of strength and solidity somehow she felt relieved mordaunt and mrs halliday would not have built such a house  on the whole she distrusted them but it looked as if the head of the family was different  its very fine jim she said  theres something of langrigg about it something you dont feel at whitelees  the stone is curious  i believe it was brought from a distance but in a sense bernard dearham built dryholm of iron  somehow it looks like that carrie remarked  the car stopped in front of a plain arch and bernard received the party in the hall where they found mrs halliday evelyn mordaunt and some others  bernard gave jim his hand and for a minute or two kept mrs winter and carrie by him  when they went to dinner mrs winter was put next to bernard and carrie sitting near looked about with frank curiosity  the room was lofty and spacious  she had not seen such a room except when she dined at a big montreal hotel but it had not the lavish decoration she had noted there  at dryholm one got a sense of space and calm nothing glittered and forced itself on ones glance carrie thought it was somehow like a church but rather the big quiet cathedral than the ornate notre dame  she had only seen big churches in montreal  the west window commanded distant hills that rose colored darkblue against the yellow sky  shining water touched their feet and one could hear the sea  it was getting dark however and soon electric lights began to glow on the paneled ceiling and along the deep cornice  the lamps were placed among the moldings and one scarcely noticed them until the soft light they threw on the table got stronger  then carrie remarked that mrs winter was talking and bernard laughed she had wondered whether she ought to give her mother a hint and might have done so for jims sake although it would have hurt her pride but she was glad she had not  bernard dearham did not smile politely as mrs mordaunt smiled he laughed because he was amused  carrie did not know much about english people but the dinner was obviously a formal acknowledgment of the new owner of langrigg and she studied her host  she had at first remarked a puzzling likeness to somebody she knew and now she saw it was jim  the likeness was rather in bernards voice and manner than his face although she found it there  then he looked up and asked  do you like dryholm  oh yes said carrie  almost as much as i like langrigg  bernard smiled and nodded  langrigg has a touch that only time can give  a house matures slowly  i think that is so carrie agreed  one feels it in england  a house matures by being used the people who live there give it a stamp and perhaps when they go they leave an influence  its different in canada  when our houses get out of date we pull them down  bernard looked at her rather keenly  he was a shrewd judge of men and women and saw that she could think  you are something of a sentimentalist i dont know if you are right or not  when i built dryholm we tried to get the feeling langrigg gives one as far as it could be expressed by line  but do you like whitelees  whitelees is pretty carrie replied with caution  bernards eyes twinkled  very pretty  something new in fact after canada  yes said carrie who saw he wanted her to talk  she knew he was studying her but he was not antagonistic like mordaunt and mrs halliday  this is why id sooner have langrigg because i dont find langrigg new in the way you mean she resumed  one gets the feeling you talk about in canada not in our houses but in the woods  theyre different from the woods you have planted and trimmed  the big black pines grow as they want sometimes theyre charred by fire and smashed by gales  when its quiet you hear the rivers and now and then a snowslide rolling down the hills  rugged and stern  well i imagine the men who built langrigg long since were rather like your pioneers  carrie thought bernard had something of the spirit of the pioneers this was why he was like jim  she felt his strength and tenacity but he did not daunt her  why did you make dryholm so big she asked  you dont think an old man needs so large a house he said  well i built for others whom i thought might come after me but that is done with  he paused and looked down the table at mordaunt and evelyn and then carrie imagined his eyes rested on jim as he added sometimes i am lonely  he began to talk to mrs winter who presently remarked oh yes i like it in england  i knew it would be fierce in the jolting cars and on the steamer but jim insisted and now im glad i let him persuade me  then jim insisted on your coming  why yes  i meant to stay at home  ah said bernard i think jim took the proper line  anyhow i needed a holiday mrs winter resumed  its quiet and calm at langrigg and ive worked hard  you folks dont get busy all the time like us in canada  bernard laughed  there are a large number of busy people in this country and for a long time i myself worked rather hard  he paused and looked down the table with ironical humor  i was thought eccentric and my relations did not altogether forgive me until i got my reward  all approved then  mordaunts face was inscrutable but mrs halliday smiled and evelyn looked at jim with faint amusement  i imagine he meant mother they sometimes clash she said  you dont know bernard yet  when you do you will try to make allowances like the rest of us  in the meantime it does not seem needful  he is kind  remarkably kind evelyn agreed  in fact his kindness is puzzling how far would you go to keep his favor  it would depend said jim  upon how much i liked him for one thing  of course i would go no distance if he tried to drive  evelyn smiled  well i suppose you can take a bold line  if one has pluck it sometimes pays  at all events its flattering to feel one can be oneself  no doubt you all develop your individuality in canada  we are rather an independent obstinate lot jim owned  i expect this comes from living in a new country  when you leave the cities you have nobody to fall back on  you have got to make good by your own powers and trust yourself  ah said evelyn one would like to trust oneself  to follow ones bent or perhaps ones heart and not bother about the consequences she was silent a moment and then resumed with a soft laugh but unless one is very brave its not often possible there are so many rules  jim felt sympathetic  she had laughed but he thought the laugh hid some feeling  she was generous and strangely refined mrs halliday was conventional and calculating and the girl rebelled  i expect our host broke a number of the rules he remarked  he did and he paid  bernard was not rich and when he opened the brunstock mines nobody would help him  when he sold his farms to buy pumps and engines there was a quarrel with your grandfather and perhaps bernard has some grounds for bitterness  i dont know if its strange but while joseph dearham was a plain country gentleman bernard after getting rich in business wears the stamp of the old school  jim agreed  bernard was obviously not fastidious like his relatives but he had the grand manner  this was not altogether what jim meant but perhaps it got nearest  i think its because hes fearlessone sees that he said shabbiness and awkwardness come when ones afraid  its possible evelyn answered with a curious smile  one hates to be shabby but sometimes one is forced  pluck costs much  then mrs halliday got up and some of the party went to the drawingroom and some to the terrace  jim stayed in the hall and mused while he smoked a cigarette  evelyn had stirred his imagination by a hint that she was dissatisfied and struggled for free development well he had seen whitelees and was getting to know mrs halliday  to some extent he liked her but he could understand the girls rebellion  however it was strange she had given him a hint unless of course she had done so unconsciously  when the cigarette was finished he went to the terrace  the evening was warm and a faint glow lingered in the west  all was very quiet except when a herd of cattle moved about a pasture across the lawn  the party had broken up into small groups and jim joined evelyn  bernard got up stiffly when carrie came near his bench  tell me about wild canada  i understand you were in the woods he said  yes said carrie sitting down  i went north with jim and my brother and the boys when the ice broke up  the boys  the rockcutters and choppers carrie explained  i see said bernard  was there no other woman  what did you do  the nearest woman was a hundred miles off  i cooked and looked after the stores  sometimes i mended the clothes  and how were the others occupied  carrie hesitated  although bernard had asked her to tell him about canada she imagined he wanted to hear about jim but after a few moments she began to relate the story of their cutting the telegraph line  she could not have told it to mrs halliday but she felt bernard would understand and he helped her by tactful questions  she wanted him to know what kind of man jim was and she made something of an epic of the simple tale mans struggle against nature and his victory  indeed for bernard was very shrewd she told him more than she thought  but when you were nearly beaten you could have sold the copper vein you talked about and used the money he remarked  in a way we couldnt sell  baumstein was putting the screw to us he meant to buy for very much less than the claim was worth  we would have starved before we let him and for a time we hadnt as much food as we liked  after all you might have been beaten but for the contractor  why did he help  no doubt he knew it was a rash speculation  oh well said carrie i think he liked jim  but we wouldnt have been beaten  wed have made good somehow  still it looks as if the contractor was a useful friend  did he stop at vancouver  does he write to you  carrie hesitated because she imagined she saw where bernards questions led  we wont forget him but he doesnt write and i dont know where he is she said and added with a touch of dignity i dont see what this has to do with the rest  perhaps it has nothing to do with it bernard replied  thank you for telling me a rather moving tale  he let her go and when she passed a bench where mrs halliday and mordaunt sat the former looked at her companion  i suppose you have remarked that bernard has been unusually gracious to the girl and her mother  is it his notion of a hosts duty  or is it something else  i imagine its something else mordaunt replied  but what  does he want to annoy us  its possible he thought he might do so  are you annoyed  i am certainly surprised  oh well said mordaunt perhaps he had another object  i dont know  hes rather inscrutable  mrs halliday got up  i thought we could be frank lance  after all our habit is to take bernards cleverness for granted  he has a bitter humor and the thing may only be an old mans caprice  she went off and when soon afterwards the party began to break up bernard gave jim a cigar in the hall  i note that you and your young relations are already friends he said  dicks a fine lad hes generous and honest although i doubt if he will go far  evelyn of course has no rival in this neighborhood  that hardly needs stating jim replied  bernard twinkled and his glance rested on a beautiful painted vase your taste is artistic it looks as if you had an eye for color and line  in a sense evelyn is like this ornament  shes made of choice stuff costly but fragile  common clay stands rude jars best  jim was puzzled and halfannoyed because he could not tell what bernard meant but the latter began to talk about something else  you were a miner for a time i think he presently remarked  one would expect you to know gold when you see it  its sometimes difficult said jim  as a rule gold is pure  it doesnt form chemical alloys but its often mixed with other substances  so that the uninstructed pass it by bernard rejoined  one might make an epigram of that but perhaps it would be cheap  well i must wish the others good night  i hope youll come back soon and bring your friends  jim put his party in the car and drove off feeling strangely satisfied  evelyn had been gracious and although he did not altogether understand bernard he liked him better than he had thought     chapter v  shanks dabbin  shortly after his visit to dryholm jim returned one morning from the market town where he had gone to see his lawyer and banker  when he reached langrigg he found jake on the terrace  doing nothing makes me tired the latter remarked  i know you want to keep us and mother and carrie like it here but we cant stay for good  your mother and sister can stay until they have had enough and i hope that wont be soon but i know you jake and think youre mean anyhow you can get rid of your scruples because im going to give you a job  ive decided to drain the marsh  labors cheap in this country but i reckon its some job  however now theres something doing  youll stay and see me out jim suggested  thank you partner doesnt seem much use in stating that what is mine is yours but i wish youd get it  another thing this draining is a business proposition and were partners in that sense too  now well tell your mother  they told mrs winter at lunch and jim saw that she hesitated and looked at carrie  the girls face was however inscrutable and she gave no sign  jim felt puzzled  he thought mrs winter liked langrigg and she had developed since she came  she was not so thin she had lost her careworn look and gained a certain ease of manner  at the store she had been highlystrung and restless now she was happily calm  moreover she was making her influence felt and quietly taking control  jim had noted that things were done better and cost him less he wanted her to stay because he thought she needed a rest and he would miss her if she went  well she said doubtfully if you are all satisfied  i am satisfied jim declared  i imagine jake is but carrie hasnt told us yet  carrie gave him a quick glance and he thought her color was rather high  you are kind she said  mother looks younger than she has looked for long and perhaps we had better accept  but it is a big undertaking to drain the marsh  when do you begin  i thought we might begin this afternoon  however i dont expect to drain it all right off  theres a pretty dry piece where i mean to start  i reckon ive money enough for the experiment and can develop my plans afterwards when i see what the first lot costs  carrie laughed and the hint of strain all had felt vanished  you are certainly the hustling jim we knew she said  i feel as if we were back in the woods  after lunch jim crossed the marsh with jake and stopped where a ridge of higher ground broke off at the edge of a muddy creek  in the corner partly sheltered by a bank of gorse stood a small white house with a roof of rusty iron where the thatch had been  the whitewash had fallen off in places exposing a rough granulated wall for the house was a dabbin built of puddled clay  a window was broken and the door hung crookedly  except for a few rows of withered potatoes the garden was occupied by weeds  three or four shellducks hatched from wild birds eggs paddled about the creek  shanks dabbin his father squatted here jim remarked  i reckon im going to have trouble with the fellow  he opened the broken gate and two men came out  one was bent and moved awkwardly but jake imagined that rheumatism rather than age had stiffened his joints  he looked at jim with sullen suspicion  the other was young and strongly made  ive come to give you an offer shanks jim began  this house is not fit to live in i want you to use the cottage at bankend instead theres a good piece of garden and a row of fruit trees  dabbins bad but its mine said shanks  you canna put me oot  i dont want to put you out i want you to go  anyhow the dabbin isnt yours  you have no title to the ground and i understand have been warned off but we wont bother about that  bankend cottage is dry and comfortable and you can have it for your lifetime  i willunt gan  jim turned to the younger man  this place is damp and falling down cant you persuade your father  im none for trying  he has t right o it  there was silence for a few moments and then shanks asked  what for do you want the bit hoose  i want to pull it down  the dyke im going to build starts here and the new cut for the creek must go through your garden  shanks looked at his son and remarked with dull surprise hes gan t dyke marsh  the other said nothing and shanks turned to jim  if you were letten dry out marsh t wild geese and ducks wad gan  its possible  well raise good grass and corn instead  dairy cows are worth more than shellducks  but youll niver be letten shanks replied doggedly  shucks said jim  the marsh is mine  although you have no claim to this place ill give you bankend the garden and if needful the small field  you and your son can make pretty good pay there if you like to work  if youd sooner loaf and shoot theres the creek and sands  t lag geese follow marsh shanks insisted  jim pondered and jake studied the others  he had not seen men like these in canada where some of the indians owned good farms and those who hunted had firstrate guns and canoes  shanks and his son were ragged and dirty  they slouched and looked slack and dull although now and then the younger mans eyes gleamed cunningly  then jim said  we wont argue about it  the dabbin must come down and when youre ready to move to bankend you can tell my teamster to take your household fixings along  if this doesnt meet the bill ill give you a hundred pounds and you can go where you like  shanks said nothing and jim went off  when they were out of hearing jake remarked i allow you had to be firm but i dont like it jim those fellows are what we call bad men  i imagine we have been up against worse  thats so  all the same i wish you had been able to leave them alone  i cant leave them alone because the dyke must cross that corner of the creek  theyre about the meanest whites ive met and i certainly dont want them at bankend  id sooner they took the hundred pounds and quit  how do they live  by wildfowling and fishing though im told they snare rabbits and poach pheasants  well i suppose youre giving shanks his chance of making good  the trouble is hes forced to take the chance whether he wants or not some folks would sooner live like dogs than decent citizens  do you think one ought to indulge their prejudice  i dont jake admitted  it would be bad economy  for all that id watch the fellows  they let it go and talked about jims plans as they crossed the short grass where the silverweed spread its carpet of yellow flowers  they trampled through belts of withered thrift and skirted winding creeks where tall reeds shook their bent leaves in the searching wind  light and shadow sped across the marsh and a flock of plover shining white and black circled above the sands  jake got a sense of space and loneliness he had not expected to feel in england but he smiled as he noted jims brisk step and the sparkle in his eyes  he knew his comrade and saw he was happy  the marsh was something to conquer and the struggle would absorb his energies  next day jim returned to the market town  he was occupied for some time ordering tools and driving back in the afternoon hesitated as he got near the cross road that led to whitelees  he wanted to see evelyn and mrs halliday had told him to come when he liked but it was perhaps significant that he wanted also to get on with his draining plans  seeing evelyn was a satisfaction he unconsciously reserved for his leisure she was not like carrie to some extent his working partner and critic  he took the road to whitelees and smiled  perhaps carrie was patient when he thought her keen it was possible that she was sometimes bored  mrs halliday received him in a room that looked full of ornaments and flowers and gave him tea in beautiful china  he was halfafraid to handle the fragile cup and plate and hesitated about eating his slice of dainty cake  he had been examining machines and thought his clothes smelt of oil somehow he felt big and awkward  by and by mrs halliday asked what had occupied him in town and he told her about his plans evelyn looked interested  if you begin your dyke where you propose wont shanks dabbin be in the way  the dabbin must come down jim replied  a question from mrs halliday led to his relating his interview with shanks and evelyn said could you not have left the old man his cottage  after all it is picturesque  it isnt picturesque when you are near  does beauty go with dirt and neglect  perhaps it does not  i suppose the old greeks gave us our standard of beauty and they attained it by careful cultivation  for all that they rather conventionalized their type and one likes people with pluck enough to strike an independent note  to some extent one can sympathize with shanks because he wont be clean by rule  jim unconsciously looked about the room and evelyn laughed  oh she said we dont copy the greeks  their model was austere simplicity the bold flowing line but we are luxuriously modern  however it would have been a graceful plan to leave shanks alone  it wouldnt have been sound  you cant neglect a job that ought to be put over because youd like to be graceful  youre not greek said evelyn  youre roman  then if i get your meaning shanks is a barbarian and the barbarians who stood up against roman order and efficiency were crushed  its probably lucky for europe the legions marched over them  i suppose one must agree  it looks as if i must try again  what about the king who coveted the vineyard  to begin with the other man owned the vineyard but the ground shanks occupies is mine  then it was a vineyard while the shanks homestead is a hovel in a weedchoked garden lot  anyhow if youd like it ill see if it is possible to leave his place alone  evelyn was flattered  she enjoyed the sense of power but she hesitated  jim was easy to understand and had gone farther than she had thought  to let him make a concession that might cost him extra work would give him a claim and she did not want him for a creditor yet  oh no she said carelessly you mustnt change your plans  i was indulging a romantic sentiment and expect you know what you ought to do  but you were nice when you were willing to think about the thing  then mrs halliday began to talk and presently jim got up  i must go he said  i didnt know i had stayed so long  evelyn gave him her hand and smiled  i expect you will be occupied but if you have time to come back you will find us at home  thank you said jim  i was halfafraid id bored you  ill certainly have time  he went out and mrs halliday looked at evelyn thoughtfully  on the whole i imagine you were tactful  i expect you saw jims offer to leave shanks alone was not made without an effort  i did see evelyn admitted  i dont know if it was flattering or not  she paused and resumed with a touch of color for all that i did not refuse because i was tactful one sometimes gets tired of acting  besides it would be thrown away on jim  hes not accomplished and critical like lance hes frank and strong  he is worth cultivating mrs halliday remarked picking up a book she knew when to stop and evelyn now and then developed a rebellious mood  for a week jim was occupied bringing tools and materials from the town and clearing the ground  shanks gave no sign that he meant to move until one morning jims teamster asked am i to gan t dabbin and tak a load to bankend  jim told him to go and turned to jake  thats fixed  ive been holding back for a day or two and now we can push ahead  the dabbin must come down before we stop tonight  in the evening jake and carrie went with him across the marsh  the workmen had gone but wheelbarrows spades and planks lay about and a bank of fresh soil touched the edge of the neglected garden  gray clouds drifted across the gloomy sky a cold wind tossed the reeds and the dabbin looked strangely forlorn in the fading light  carrie shivered as she entered with jim who carried a coil of fuse and a tin box  the clay walls were stained by damp and the broken window was grimed by dirt  a few peats occupied a corner and a pile of ashes on which tealeaves and scraps of food had been thrown stretched across the floor from the rusty grate  jim went to the window and began to cut the fuse  ive got things ready and might have waited until tomorrow but the jobs been bothering me and i want to put it over he said  do you think im harsh  no said carrie firmly  shanks is white trash and lives like a hog  they wouldnt have stood for him a month at our settlements  but how do you think hell use bankend  jim smiled  i expect ill have to burn down the cottage when he has done with it his son is certainly not going to stop there afterwards i dont know if a rich man is justified in loafing or not  well leave that to the economists but ive frankly no use for the fellow who wants to loaf at other folks expense  however ill fix the powder and well pull out  i dont like the job  carrie nodded  you are a builder jim but before one builds one must clear the ground  things must be pulled down  youre a staunch friend said jim  you always understand and generally approve  perhaps its because we often agree but if i were really staunch id tell you when i thought you wrong  this needs some pluck  id weigh what you told me  carrie was silent for a moment thinking about evelyn  the girl had so to speak dazzled jim  carrie did not approve but could not meddle  i wonder she remarked  anyhow you must hustle  its getting dark  after a few minutes jim lighted the fuse and they went out and stood some distance off  the light had nearly gone and the dabbin loomed dark and desolate against a belt of tossing reeds  jim thought an indistinct figure stole through the gloom of the hedge and he shouted a warning  the figure vanished  there was a flash behind the broken window and the shock of an explosion  for a moment the hovel was filled with light then it tottered and a cloud of smoke rolled about the falling walls  blocks of hard clay splashed in the creek and fell about the marsh  the smoke cleared and carrie saw the dabbin had gone  a pile of rubbish round which thin vapor drifted marked the spot it had occupied  a man stood on the end of the ridge of high ground his bent figure outlined against the sky holding up his arms as if in protest then he vanished and jim and the others started silently for langrigg     chapter vi  the thorn hedge  mist drifted about the hollows and the new moon shone between the motionless light clouds  the air was damp and jim buttoned his drivingcoat as he talked to bernard on the steps at dryholm  his small car stood near the arch with its lights glistening on the dewy lawn  your lamps are dim said bernard  if you will wait a minute ill send them to the garage  jim said he knew the road and the lamps would burn until he got home and bernard resumed i expect you know that what you are doing at the marsh wont make you popular  lance mordaunt hinted something like that but i dont see why people should grumble jim replied  the marsh is mine  your titles good bernard agreed  since the ground is not enclosed joseph didnt bother about sporting rights and your neighbors took it for granted they could shoot a few ducks and snipe when they liked  the sports rough for men who shoot handreared pheasants but theres some satisfaction in killing birds that are really wild  there is some satisfaction  the game ive shot was certainly wild in fact i sometimes took steep chances when i missed  when you get after a bull moose or a cinnamon bear its prudent to hold straight  well id sooner my neighbors liked me but dont mean to keep my land waste for them to play on  bernard nodded  you are not afraid of unpopularity  however i think id have got rid of shanks instead of sending him to bankend  the fellows cunning and theres some ground for believing him revengeful  it doesnt look as if he could injure me  it might pay to watch him bernard rejoined  some time since jones my gamekeeper caught tom shanks and another netting partridges it was obvious that old shanks had helped but there was some difficulty about the evidence  bernard paused and smiled as he resumed i imagine my friends on the bench used their best efforts to convict but folk seemed to think it prudent not to tell all they knew and while tom shanks went to jail his father got off  afterwards jones had a remarkable run of bad luck  the young pheasants died about the coops his own ferret killed his hens and he lost a fine setter he was training  then he had an adventure one night in a shootingpunt that ought not to have leaked  ill watch out said jim as he started his car  he did not think about shanks as he drove up the avenue where the leaves were falling and down a long hill  in the distance he saw the whitelees lights and now and then farther off the faint shining of the sea  mist that melted and gathered again drifted about the low ground  jims thoughts sometimes dwelt on evelyn and sometimes on the marsh  evelyn was friendly and he had undertaken a big job that he liked  he was carrying out a duty honoring a claim his inheritance made on him he wanted to leave langrigg better than he found it  jim sprang from a landowning stock and felt that since he had got the estate for nothing he must justify his ownership and prove he was worthy of the gift and the woman he hoped to marry  when he ran out upon the low ground the mist got thicker and rolled in low belts across the fields  the carbide in his lamps was exhausted and the feeble beam that leaped up with the jolts flickered puzzlingly he knew where he was however when he reached the marsh road that ran like a causeway across the boggy ground  tall stiff reeds bordered the straight track  the lights were sinking fast and since he must reach langrigg before they went out he let the engine go  the fog streamed past him the wind whipped his face and he clenched the wheel as he rocked with the jolts  he was not far from home now and looked for the curve where his road branched off  the curve was sharp and ran between two rows of old thorn trees jim remembered that he had meant to cut them down  there was a deep ditch between the trees and a belt of rough grass then the narrow road and a ditch on the other side  after a few minutes a dark mass loomed in the haze and jim knew it would be prudent to slacken speed but his lamps were nearly out and a little farther on he must avoid an awkward gatepost  a shadowy tree came out of the fog and he felt the wheels sink in boggy soil  he was obviously taking too wide a sweep and he turned inwards the damp road was indistinct but he could see the white reeds that grew along its edge and the trunks of the thorns across the ditch  he was going round the corner looking for a triangular patch of grass when he felt a violent jolt and fell forward on the wheel  the car swerved and the front wheels plunged into the soft ground between the road and ditch  jim was badly shaken but he got the car straight while she plowed up the grass  then the wheel was torn from his grasp the car swerved the other way and he jambed transcribers note jammed on the brakes knowing it was too late  he felt her run across the road she rocked as she took the grass and then he was thrown out and knew nothing more  in the meantime jake and carrie stood on the steps at langrigg talking to halliday and mordaunt  the latter had brought a car from dryholm and it stood close by with its lamps burning  the night was calm the noise of the sea came out of the distance and presently they heard the throb of a car running across the marsh  thats jim carrie said to dick  since you wanted to see him you had better come in again  dick hesitated  he had not come to see jim and carrie noted his irresolution with some amusement  after all its not important and i want to get home for dinner he said and turned to mordaunt  start your engine lance  as mordaunt went down the steps the throb of the other car stopped suddenly and they heard a faint crash  hallo dick exclaimed  what was that  i imagine jim has cut the corner too fine said mordaunt  come on  he ran down the steps and as he started the car the others jumped up mordaunt had not meant to take carrie but he did not stop and the car sped away  he let her go fullspeed down the hill dashed through the awkward gateway touching the post and drove furiously to the bend where the road ran on to the marsh  then there was a violent jerk as he put on the brakes and the beam of the headlamps touched and stopped upon a tilted car that lay with the wheels on one side in the ditch  bring a lamp said mordaunt coolly and next moment they were all out of the car and running across the grass  a soft hat lay in the road and broken glass was scattered about but for a minute or two they could not see jim  he was not in the car and the grass and rushes were long  then jake stooped down holding out the lamp  this way he shouted  hes in the ditch  the others gathered round him as the light searched the ditch  jim lay with his legs in the water and the upper part of his body pressed against the bank by the front wheel of the car  his eyes were shut his face was white and stained by blood  jakes hand shook so that he could hardly hold the lamp  we must get him out right now he said hoarsely  the wheels on his chest  if she slips down shell break his ribs  for a few moments they hesitated standing in the strong illumination of the lamp on mordaunts car that picked out their faces against the dark  jake wore an american dinnerjacket carrie a thin evening dress and she had no hat  dick noted that her hands were clenched and her mouth worked  she had of course got a shock winter ought not to have let her see jim but the keenness of her distress was significant dick however could not dwell on this just then  they must get jim out and it was going to be difficult  the car rested insecurely on the edge of the bank and the broken branches of the thorns  if they disturbed it rashly it might slip down and crush the unconscious man mordaunt was the first to see a way and jumped into the ditch  come down and get your backs under the axle he said  they obeyed and standing in the water tried to lift the car  for a few moments it looked impossible because the weight above forced their feet into the mud then while they gasped and strained the wheel rose an inch or two from jims chest  lift him carrie  lift him now jake shouted in a breathless voice  carrie seized jims coat and tried to drag him up  he was heavy she choked with the tense effort and did not know afterwards how it was made  for all that she dragged him up a foot and then to one side the strain was horrible but she held on and thought she saw the car tilt and the back wheel tear the peaty soil from the top of the bank  jake shouted something dick fell back and she saw that jim was clear of the wheel  for a moment mordaunts face stood out against the gloom  it was dark with blood his teeth shone between his drawnback lips and the veins on his forehead were horribly swollen  then there was a crash among the thorns and the car seemed to go right over mordaunt staggered and fell and somebody helped her to drag jim up carrie did not know if it was dick or jake  next moment mordaunt crawled out of the ditch and joined them  he gasped and the water ran from his clothes  are you hurt carrie asked  you got all the weight at the last  mordaunt smiled  it looked as if he could not speak and while carrie wiped jims face jake beckoned dick  bring your car  we must get him home  dick turned the car and they put jim on the floor with his head against carries knee  when they started she bent and held his shoulders and in a few minutes they rolled up the drive  then carrie pulled herself together gave orders and took control and when they had carried jim to his room gave mordaunt her hand  you saved him she said  we wont forget  i happened to see a plan before the others thats all mordaunt replied  ill get off now and send a doctor  he ran downstairs and carrie heard his car start while she stood with her mother by jims bed  her face was white but it flushed when jim opened his eyes  whats the matter  where am i he asked  youre at home said carrie  you mustnt talk  i dont want to talk  things are all going round jim rejoined and shut his eyes  after a time he began to breathe regularly and mrs winter bent over him  hes stunned something hit his head  i dont think its worse than that she remarked  i guess we cant do much until the doctor comes  mordaunt sent a doctor from the town and when he had seen him start went with dick into the smokingroom at a quiet hotel  there was nobody else about until a waiter came and mordaunt sat down by the fire  i feel we need a drink he said  it was a near thing when the car went over  i can hardly bend my back and it will no doubt be worse in the morning  you held her long enough for miss winter to pull jim out dick replied  its lucky you were able  my feet slipped and although winter is pretty strong i imagine he was beaten  all the weight came on you i dont understand how you held on  one can sometimes borrow a little extra strength from keen excitement and i remembered that if i let go the wheel would come down again on jims chest  he might not have stood another shock  he was badly knocked out dick agreed  i expect you saved his life  mordaunt smiled  now im cool i begin to think i was rash  rot dick exclaimed  you dont mean this and its a bad joke  we dont owe jim much if he had stopped in canada langrigg would have been yours and mine  then it begins to look as if bernard approved the fellow and im willing to admit i had rather counted on getting a good share of his money  you and evelyn would have got the rest  after all bernards money is his  hes just and i dont imagine hell leave us out  were not rich but if he does give jim some of my share i wont miss it very much  i shall miss mine mordaunt rejoined  dick was quiet for a minute or two and then looked up  you remember reading the french romance the night we reached the telegraph shack did you see franklin dearhams name in the book  yes said mordaunt very coolly i did see it  he paused looking hard at dick and went on of course i know what this implies  there was some doubt but the probability was the telegraph linesman was our relation and the owner of langrigg  well i thought he was not the man to have the estate and might be happier if we left him in the woods it was not altogether because i wanted my share of what was his  dick did not doubt lances sincerity but he had got a jar  in a way lance had tried to rob jim  what do you think about him now he asked with some awkwardness  what i thought then he is not the man to own langrigg and ought to have stayed in canada  id have been resigned had you got the estate but this fellow will make us a joke  he has the utilitarian ideals of a western lumberman  bernard is the head of the house and i doubt if hed agree  you admitted he approved jim  i did i dont like his approving  oh well said dick  since you held up the car i suppose youre entitled to criticize jim  if you hadnt made an effort he would probably have been killed  you can grumble about him as much as you like well remember what you did  mordaunt smiled rather curiously and drained his glass  we are late for dinner and my clothes are wet he remarked  they went out and both were quiet as they drove to whitelees     chapter vii  the fencing wire  next morning carrie getting up early because she had not slept much heard jims step in the passage outside her room  he went rather unsteadily downstairs and a few minutes afterwards she found him sitting on the terrace wall  he was pale and his face was cut but he had taken off the bandage  you oughtnt to be out she said  why not he asked  you were badly shaken  the doctor said we must keep you quiet  he probably didnt state how long and ive been quiet all night  i certainly got a knock imagine my head went through the glass but i feel my proper self again and dont see any reason for staying in bed  carrie gave it up  she knew jim pretty well and asked where he was going  i want to look at the car he said  i dont know why she left the road  but how did you find me and bring me home  carrie told him and he looked thoughtful  i was in the ditch with the wheel on me  this accounts for my sides feeling sore  how did you lift the car  the others got into the ditch  a wheel began to slip and i thought the weight would overpower them but lance mordaunt made a tremendous effort and held up the axle until we pulled you out  jim knitted his brows and looked across the lawn while he mechanically felt for his pipe  the morning was clear with scattered clouds and the grass was silvered by dew  the hills were sharp and belts of light and shadow checkered the marsh  in the distance the sea sparkled  if jake or dick had held her up i could have understood he said  it was lance carrie insisted  why are you puzzled  for one thing i imagine he doesnt like me jim replied and indicated by a gesture the old house and the sweep of smooth pasture and yellow stubble that rolled down the hill  perhaps its not strange  i have taken all this from him  but you took it as much from dick  that is so jim agreed  dicks different  hes careless i dont think he feels things  however i must thank lance  he paused and resumed the boys were in the ditch and i was under the car  who pulled me out  i did said carrie blushing  there was nobody else  jim took her hand  my dear  when i needed help before you were about  but that ditch is four feet deep and im heavy  carrie pulled her hand from his and smiled  you are heavy jim and it was something of a strain  however ill come with you if you are going down the hill  to take care of me said jim with a twinkle  if you dont mind id sooner go alone  he got up and seeing that his step was firm she let him go  it was not a caprice that he would not take her but when she returned to the house she sent jake after him  as he went down the hill jim thought about mordaunt  the man was something of a puzzle and jim admitted that he had perhaps not been just when he accounted for his antagonism  lance no doubt felt that he ought to have got langrigg but he was not altogether moved by disappointed greed  their antagonism went deeper than that  lance was a conventionalist he clung instinctively to traditions that were getting out of date  in fact jim thought he would have been a very fine country gentleman had he inherited langrigg sixty years since lance was what horseranchers called a throwback in a sense he belonged to an older generation  there was another thing  jim imagined lance felt evelyns charm and although they were cousins he understood cousins sometimes married with their relatives approval when the marriage would advance the interests of the family  it was possible that he might hurt lance worse than by robbing him of langrigg  yet lance had held up the car for him and run some risk of being killed  after all this did not clash with jims notion of his character  lance might dislike the man he rescued but he had the instincts of an english gentleman  then jim stopped and looked about for he had reached the thorn hedge  a belt of peat checkered by white tufts of wild cotton ran back from the road and a wire fence joined the hedge at a right angle  some of the posts had fallen and lengths of wire lay about  jim looked at the wire thoughtfully and then went on to the spot where broken glass and torn up soil marked the scene of the accident  then he stopped again and lighted his pipe  in the canadian woods he had now and then trusted to his rifle to supply his food and tracking large game trains ones observation  one must guess an animals movements by very small signs  a  broken twig or a disturbed stone tells one much  jim looked for some such clew that might help him so to speak to reconstruct the accident  he remembered a sudden jolt and the front wheels skidding  they had obviously struck something and when he got the car straight had skidded again the other way  the marks the tires had made indicated this and he examined the neighboring ground  the silverweed that covered the peaty soil between the road and ditch was not much crushed he had as he remembered not gone far on that side before he for a moment recovered control of the car  the real trouble began when it swerved again and ran across the road  something had caught the wheels and interfered with the steering  jim looked for a big stone but could find none besides it was improbable that he had hit the stone twice and sitting down by the overturned car he thoughtfully finished his pipe  the car must be got out of the ditch but this was not important and he dwelt upon the fencing wire he had a hazy notion that the obstacle he had struck was flexible  by and by he heard a step and jake came up  i dont know if you ought to be about the latter said  it will be an awkward job to get the car into the road  im not bothering about the car jim replied  i want to find out why she ran into the ditch  you dont know then  jim indicated the wheelmarks and told jake about the skidding  she went off at an angle and i couldnt pull her round he concluded  do you expect to find the steeringgear broken  not unless it broke after she skidded  jake gave him a keen glance  i begin to see  well people sometimes find trouble coming to them when they wont leave things alone  but what kind of a clew do you expect to get  a mark on a thorn trunk well look for one said jim  suppose you take the other side  he walked a few yards along the ditch examining the bottom of the trunks and presently stopped and put his foot on the other bank  then he beckoned jake and indicated a few scratches on the bark of a thorn the rough stem was tufted with dry moss and for an inch or two this was crushed  i reckon something has been fastened to this tree he said  if we can find another mark on the opposite row ill be satisfied  they went across and after a few moments jake said here it is  jim studied the mark and nodded  very well  i think well get into the field and look at the old fence wire  i want a piece seven or eight yards long  after pulling about the wire that lay in the grass they found a piece one end was bent into a rough hook and although the other was nearly straight jim noted a spot where the galvanizing was cracked  it has been bent here twice he said  pulled over into a hook and then pulled back  you can see how the zinc has flaked  they sat down on a bank and jake remarked i think you ought to be satisfied  but what are you going to do about it  lie low and watch out  thats all in the meantime  i want the man who fixed the wire across the road to give himself away  dont you know who he is  i think i know  its not quite enough  perhaps its not jake agreed  you want to be able to show other folks he did the thing  the trouble is he may try again  then it will be my fault if he gets me  ive had fair warning  your nerve is pretty good i knew this before jake remarked  well i suppose nothings to be said about it until you have some proof  now well go back to breakfast  they returned to langrigg and after breakfast jim went to the marsh where the men he had engaged were at work  soon after he had gone a car from dryholm came up the drive and carrie met bernard dearham on the steps  i came to ask how jim is  lance told me about the accident he said i expect you wont let me see him yet  you might see him if you crossed the marsh  he is getting busy there carrie replied  but he was unconscious when lance left  carrie smiled  yes  he got up at seven oclock this morning and went out  thats the kind of man he is  then we neednt be disturbed about him bernard replied and indicated a stone bench in the sun  i cannot walk far and there is no road across the marsh  can you spare a few minutes to talk to me  why of course said carrie and bernard waited until she sat down although he thought she knew his importance she was not anxious to please him but she did not assert her independence  the girl had an ease of manner he approved and if she remained at langrigg would soon acquire the touch of polish she needed  but he pulled himself up  in the meantime he was going too fast  i understand you nursed jim once before he said  did you not use your authority to keep him in the house this morning  i did not carrie replied with a twinkle  looks as if you didnt know jim yet  besides if you have some authority you dont want to strain it  that is no doubt true bernard agreed  none of his relations had so far disputed his firm rule but he knew when it was prudent not to exercise his power  you are a philosopher he went on  it is sometimes an advantage to use a light hand  jim can be led  bernard bowed  i imagine you have led him where he ought to go  i wonder said carrie with thoughtful frankness  the trouble is i dont know much and only understand simple things  still perhaps i did lead him in the woods  the right way was generally plain there but at langrigg  youre sometimes puzzled bernard suggested  well we are all puzzled now and then and perhaps to trust your instincts is a good plan  this however is not advice i would give to everybody  carrie said nothing  she liked bernard and was not afraid of him  he talked to her with the politeness of the old school and when he looked amused she thought his amusement was goodhumored  jim was under the car when you got to the spot i think he resumed you had some trouble to lift it  lance really lifted the car at the dangerous moment though the others helped  he saw the wheel was slipping they were all in the ditch  then who pulled jim out  i did said carrie with a touch of embarrassment  bernard pondered  lance had not told him about this and it was possible he had an object for not doing so  well he said i expect jim has had other accidents as you remarked he is that kind of man  did he get hurt when you were with him in the woods  he took some chances now and then but he did not get hurt much  although he came near it  i heard something about your going to his rescue one night with a gun  carrie blushed and bernard fixed his eyes on her face as he went on did you mean to use the gun  she lifted her head her mouth went hard and her glance got steady yes  if id thought the other fellow could reach jim with his ax i would have shot him  bernard nodded  sometimes the primitive plan is the only plan  one can see that you have pluck enough to meet a crisis  but i have kept you and have some other calls  he got up and when she went with him down the steps gave her his hand may i come back another day  of course but unless he knows youre coming jim will be occupied at the marsh  i wont mind if jim is occupied  then come when you like said carrie smiling  i think you mean to be nice  in the meantime jim had got to work and under his superintendence a gang of men piled barrowsful of peat soil on the wreck of the dabbin by noon a bank had advanced across the piles of broken clay and a cut that was to make a new channel for the creek began to open  once or twice jake imagined an indistinct figure lurked among some clumps of gorse as if watching the work but he was not certain and said nothing  jim and he did not go home for lunch and when the men stopped at noon found a sheltered hollow and opened a basket of food jim had sent for the day was bright but a cold wind flecked the advancing tide with foam and swept the empty flats  dry reeds rustled in the creek and a flock of circling plover gleamed against a cloud that trailed its shadow across the marsh  for all that the sun was warm in the corner where they ate their lunch  did shanks send you notice that he had gone to the cottage jake asked presently  he told the teamster to come for his truck  i expect he thought this enough  wouldnt own up that hed given in jake remarked  the fellows a blamed obstinate old tough  i wonder whether he felt curious if you were hurt  i reckon he knew said jim  however i thought this morning there was somebody about  he stopped abruptly and jake heard a step  they were quiet for a few moments and then tom shanks came round a corner of the bank and stood looking at them  jims face was cut and rather white but the stains on his clothes indicated that he had been working among wet soil  jake gave shanks a keen glance and thought he looked surprised as if he had not expected to see jim there  do you want a job the latter asked  i want nowt fra you  you can give your job to them as will ca you maister shanks rejoined and went off  a sullen hog jake remarked  id like to know when he or the old man moved the wire  so would i  its rather important said jim  if he was hanging about and came for the thing as soon as the car took the ditch he probably saw me under the wheel and meant to leave me there  how long were you in making the spot after you heard the smash  perhaps five minutes  mordaunts car was at the steps and we jumped on board while he started her  if you had lost much time i imagine youd have found me dead  then why did you offer shanks a job  jim smiled  in order to have him where he could be watched  a fellow like that is dangerous when hes out of sight  shanks and his son are bad men jake agreed  we have sandbaggers and gunmen in canada but they get after you for money and their methods are up to date  shanks savageness is halfinstinctive like the indians  i cant so to speak locate him he goes too far back  jim got up  its not important just now  tell the teamster to bring his horses and well get busy     chapter viii  jims relapse  jim made progress at the dyke until it began to rain  for some weeks a strong west wind drove dark clouds across the sea the hills were wrapped in mist the creeks swelled and the tides rose high  floods spread about the marsh and the floundering teams could hardly drag their loads through the bog  sometimes jim felt anxious for the undertaking threatened to cost much more than he had thought  then came two fine days when although the sun shone heavy clouds rolled about the hills  jim knowing the fine weather would not last drove his men hard since there was work he must push forward before the next flood  the new bank had reached a creek where he must build a strong sluicegate and hold back the water by a rude cofferdam while he dug for the foundation  he came up from the dam one afternoon and stood on the slope of the bank looking down into the hole  his long boots shirt and trousers were stained by mud that had also splashed his face and hands for since the work was risky he had helped the men  now he was rather highlystrung  below him the water spirited transcribers note spurted through the joints in a wall of thick planks and ran into the excavation where a few men sunk nearly to the knees in mud were working  a forge stood on the top of the bank and the smith leaned on the crank of the blower  he was a short stronglybuilt man and looked sulky  theres too much water blowing through pressures heavier than i reckoned and i dont like the way that brace sags jim remarked as a shower of mud and water fell into the hole  then he shouted to the men get a thick plank across and wedge her up  looks as if the fastenings of the brace had slipped said jake  they oughtnt to slip  the plate and nut on the iron were meant to keep the beam in place  i dont think i saw a nut when the boys fixed the thing  jim beckoned the smith  although the fellow was a good workman he was obstinate and jim had not bothered him much until he needed some irons for the dam when he made careful sketches and insisted on the others working to his plans  this had caused some trouble and jim now meant to be firm  i reckon i told you to screw the ends of the bar and make nuts to turn back against the plates he said  did you screw the ends  i did not said the other  there was nae use for nuts  i punched hole for pin that wad stop her pulling oot  pulling out jim exclaimed  did you imagine i wanted to hold the frames together  if yon wasnt what you wanted you should have said  jim had meant to be calm but the men had run some risk from the fellows obstinacy and he lost his control  i told you to screw the ends  confound you  the dams in compression theres no pull at all  put a new bar in the vise and ill stand by while you cut the thread  stan if you like  ill not touch bar while youre aboot  are you gan t teach me my job  its plain you dont know your job  get out of my way and ill cut the thread myself  the smith stood square in front with a frown on his face  youll not touch my tools  vise and forge is yours screwing stocks is mine  oh shucks said jim  get out of the way  we want the bar right now  the smith did not move and although nobody afterwards remembered how the struggle began jake interfering a moment too late imagined jim tried to get past the smith and jostled him  they grappled and while they rocked to and fro the men in the pit stopped work  at first jim would have been satisfied to throw his antagonist back but after a moment or two he doubted if this would be enough  the fellow had defied him they had begun to fight and in canada a boss who could not enforce his authority lost his right to rule  jim imagined it was so in england and did not mean to stop until the smith was ready to submit  yet the fellow was powerful and fought with dogged pluck  while they floundered about striking and trying for a throwing hold jake heard steps and looked up  he was halfembarrassed and halfamused for it was obvious jim did not know mrs halliday evelyn and bernard dearham stood on the top of the bank  he could not separate the men and did not think jim would hear if he shouted besides to shout a warning would make the thing ridiculous  there was nothing to do but wait and after a few moments jim lifted his antagonist and threw him down the bank  it looked as if the sulky smith was not a favorite for some of the men laughed and some growled hoarse applause  jims muddy shirt was torn and his face was bruised he was looking down into the hole and did not see bernards party until he turned to go to the forge  then he stopped and stood with his head held back while jake studied the others  he thought bernard was quietly amused but mrs halliday looked pained and evelyns delicate face was flushed  we thought we would come to see how you were getting on said mrs halliday  it was an adventure your new road is very bad and the car nearly upset  there is not much to see and i did not expect you jim replied  that is obvious bernard remarked with a twinkle  i imagine you dont know much about cumberland wrestling but you are very quick when you threw him the other fellow was getting a hold that would have put you in his power  you gave him a bad fall anyhow  i suppose you are used to this sort of thing in canada said mordaunt who came from behind the others and glanced at evelyn  jake was interested he sensed something of a drama of which he thought his comrade was unconscious  there was a hint of a sneer in mordaunts voice and jake thought his remark was meant for the girl her eyes were fixed on jim and she looked disturbed  it was plain that mordaunt noted this  mrs halliday was rather ostentatiously careless bernard quietly looked on but jim gave no sign of embarrassment  why no he answered mordaunt  on the whole i didnt have much trouble with the boys in canada  this fellow wouldnt do his job as i wanted and through his stupidity we ran some risk of the dams caving in  ill show you  they went with him glad of something to banish the strain and he indicated the men working in the mud behind the wall of planks  if the timbering gave way the water would break through and perhaps drown the gang  im boss and accountable  i take no chances about the safety of my men  mordaunt smiled as he glanced at evelyn and jake imagined he knew what the smile implied  jim was breaking conventions his bold statement had a theatrical touch that no doubt jarred reserved englishmen did not talk like that  moreover he was wet and muddy and his tense pose had not relaxed  standing with head held back and body highlystrung he looked a stranger  jim did not belong to the others circle he came from outside  yours is a good rule and force is useful now and then bernard observed  however we came to take you to dryholm  i was feeling dull and the others have promised to help me through the evening  if you can come we will go on to langrigg for mrs winter  jim wanted to go because evelyn was going but he gave her an apologetic glance as he answered bernard im sorry i cant leave my job  evelyn said nothing although her color was rather high and mrs halliday interposed after all you would not lose much time  it will soon be dark  dark generally comes before ones ready but i have some plans to make for the morning when i get home said jim who turned to bernard  we must push on before the water gets too high  if you wouldnt mind taking mrs winter and carrie i think theyd like it  mrs hallidays look hinted that she was trying to hide her annoyance and evelyn turned her head  very well said bernard and beckoned the others  when they had gone jake laughed  i imagine you have given your relations a jolt  i felt something like that  i didnt mean to jolt them jim said with a frown  why didnt they come a few minutes earlier or later  i wasnt altogether thinking of your throwing the smith down the bank you have got rather english but sometimes you break away i think i mean break back  perhaps that is so i forget jim agreed  i was a miner and linesman before i was a landlord  confusing for your friends isnt it  they dont know which they have to reckon onthe canadian sourdough or the country gentleman  anyhow i expect your suggestion that they should take mother and carrie didnt help much  were you talking like a sourdough or an english landlord then  you have a confoundedly mischievous humor jim rejoined with a twinkle  do you want me to state that its a country gentlemans duty to insist on the proper acknowledgment of his guests  bernard likes your people and i dont know if mrs halliday and lance mordaunt count  i was not thinking about mrs halliday jake began but stopped when his comrade looked hard at him and a few moments afterwards the smith came up the bank  well said jim sharply  what do you want  noo i see how bars meant to gan mayhappen it wad be better screwed if youll wait while i gan for dies ill dot for you  all right  you can get busy said jim  when the smith went off he smiled and remarked i dont know if i expected this but the man will make no more trouble  however we have lost some time and must push ahead  they got to work and in the meantime bernard drove to langrigg and picked up mrs winter and carrie  the party at dryholm broke up soon but when evelyn returned to whitelees she felt that the evening had been too long  for one thing she had been kept occupied and she wanted to think  now she sat rather languidly in an easychair and knitted her brows  she had got a jar in the afternoon and she tried to recapture the scene on the bankthe smith scowling at the bottom and jims bruised face savage frown and muddy clothes  jim was a new type and she admitted that he attracted her but his attraction was largely physical and sometimes she felt repelled  he was handsome and forceful she liked his steady look his athletic figure and his clean brown skin  then she liked the respect he showed her and his obvious wish to please  this was flattering and his strength and candor made an appeal but she was highly cultivated and he was not rude  indeed when he stood on the bank hot and triumphant after the fight there was something barbarous about him  his virility moved her but to live with him would demand some pluck evelyn knew he could not so to speak be tamed  his refusal to come to dryholm when he knew she was going was a proof  it was significant that the dam he was building made a stronger claim  evelyn was drawn in different ways and on the whole it was a relief when mrs halliday came in  jim was not his best this afternoon the latter said  however he has not been long in england and no doubt the risk of such outbreaks will presently vanish  in the meantime one must make some allowances  for the owner of langrigg  oh well said mrs halliday i suppose i did mean this but perhaps not altogether in the way you think  there is a rude vein in the dearhams that comes to the surface now and then  one hardly noted it in joseph but in bernard its rather marked  i imagine he has some sympathy for jims extravagances  this may have its influence  bernard is inscrutable evelyn rejoined  one cannot foretell what he will do  mrs halliday saw that evelyn understood she had in fact expected her to understand and her voice was thoughtful as she resumed after all his approval is not essential  you have some money i do not know about jim but he is spending much  it may be all he has he is not afraid of a risk said evelyn with a touch of color for she was fastidious and her mother was blunt  then for a moment or two she mused  she was afraid of a risk this was the trouble  adventure romance and to some extent passion urged but caution deterred  the romance would vanish and jim might jar  langrigg gives its owner a firm position mrs halliday resumed even if he were poor his wife would take a leading place in the holm country  people pretend to scoff at such things but they count  much would depend on the owner  if he broke the family traditions defied our conventions and made himself a joke  much would be forgiven him because he is a dearham mrs halliday rejoined  still of course there is a limit and i see a risk  jim needs guidance for a time and its possible his canadian friends encourage his unenglish idiosyncrasies  the girl has some beauty i would sooner she did not stay long  if jim could be advised  evelyn smiled  i cannot advise him  besides hes very staunch and owes these people much  oh well said mrs halliday  in such a matter one cannot meddle unless it is certain ones advice would be well received  we must let it go  perhaps the winters do not mean to remain very long  i think jake means to stay until the marsh is drained and i dont suppose the others will go until he is ready  mrs halliday frowned  jim is rather annoying  sometimes he vexes me but in a sense it is our duty to protect him  it has been a disturbing day i think ill go to bed     chapter ix  jim is left out  the sun shone on the terrace at dryholm the house kept off the wind and a creeper made a glowing background for the group about the teatable  a row of dahlias close by hung their heads after a nights frost a gardener was sweeping dead leaves from the grass and the beeches round the tarn were nearly bare  bernard took a cup from mrs halliday and glancing at the long shadows that stretched across the lawn indicated a sundial on a pillar  in another few minutes its usefulness will be gone and it warns me that mine is going he said and quoted a tag of latin  i wonder why they carve such melancholy lines on sundials somebody remarked  perhaps there is a certain futility about the custom  you for whom the sun is rising dont heed the warning and we others in the shadow know our day is done  i do not think i am a sentimentalist but the news we got this morning proves the latin motto true  then it is hardly possible we shall have tea outside again and we cannot tell if all will gather round the table when summer comes back  mrs halliday began to talk about a neighbor who had died the day before  alan raine will be missed he was a good and useful english type she said  conscientious and publicspirited  one could depend on him for a subscription and a graceful speech  i have not known his equal for opening a village club or a flower show  then the hunt ball was always a success since he managed it and we have not had so good a master of otterhounds  it is something to be remembered for these things  alan will be missed bernard agreed and turned to carrie  you have heard our notion of an english gentlemans duty  what do you think about it  it is not my notion  if i were a man and rich i should like to leave a deeper mark  ah said bernard you come from a strenuous country that breeds another type  your men fight with blizzards on the snowy trail and drive their shafts through ground the sun never melts  sometimes they come to england and teach us to hustle by altering the landscape and destroying our old landmarks  perhaps there is something to be said for the others who carry out quiet duties conscientiously  oh yes said carrie with a sparkle in her eyes  but id sooner have cornfields running across a drained marsh than a hunt ball for my monument  you have a good apologist bernard said to jim  the others laughed and mrs halliday not liking the turn bernard had given the talk asked who will take the otterhounds  the matters important and cannot be decided rashly bernard replied with some dryness and addressed mordaunt  i imagine jim might fill the post  what do you think lance  the choice lies between langrigg and dryholm sir  the dearhams have a kind of traditional right to keep the hounds  joseph did so  i am too old  then jim ought to make a good master  that is if he doesnt think otterhunting an idle mans game  bernard turned to jim who laughed  lances shot was fair  when i first came over i had some prejudices but they are going and i dont see why i shouldnt play now and then  he paused and his look was serious when he resumed in a way its strange but your english customs have a grip they get hold of one  in fact im getting english fast but perhaps that is not quite right  i begin to feel i am english  mrs halliday gave him an approving smile  you inherited more than langrigg from the dearhams jim  i like to see you realize you got some duties when you got the estate  i dont know if keeping the hounds is a duty jim rejoined  perhaps lance was nearest when he called it a game  all the same i think id like the job  they began to talk about the advisability of moving the kennels and carrie sitting quiet studied the others  she saw mrs halliday was pleased and thought she understood this  mordaunt puzzled her  his rather dark face was hard to read but she had got a hint of disappointment when he said the choice lay between langrigg and dryholm and bernard declared he was too old  then she suspected a touch of bitterness in his next remark  the others had noted nothing except perhaps bernard who had looked at mordaunt hard  carrie did not like mordaunt he sometimes sneered politely at jim  it is something to know jim is willing but the post is not my gift bernard resumed  a meeting will no doubt be held to weigh the matter and if jim is chosen i should not be surprised  then he got up and shivered as the creeping shadow touched the bench he occupied  some of the others went off along the terrace and jim and evelyn crossed the lawn  they were talking animatedly and carrie felt a pang when jims laugh came back to her  in the woods she had cheered him and he laughed at her jokes  now he was always kind but he forgot her when evelyn was about  she turned rather moodily towards the arch and saw bernard standing in the gloom  his eyes were fixed on the figures on the lawn and carrie thought he looked annoyed but he smiled when he heard her step  they have left you alone he said  well we must amuse each other and there are some flowers in the hothouse that i dont think you have seen  carrie went with him thoughtfully  bernards remarks were often oracular he left one to guess what he meant but she imagined his glance was sympathetic  although this was to some extent embarrassing she began to talk and when they reached the hothouse he answered her questions about the flowers with oldfashioned politeness  by and by he glanced at a thermometer and pulling down a skylight turned to carrie who was looking at the patches of glowing color that broke the long banks of green  beautiful things but fragile and they have no smell he said  i suppose we grow them because they cost us much  the flowers of the bleak north are sweet  by and by jim came in and after a glance about exclaimed these are very fine  you have an eye for color bernard remarked  their beautys almost insolent i dont know if its strange that they are foulfeeders and thrive on rottenness  sometimes i think id give them all for the cloudberry bloom i trampled on the moors when i was young  it feeds on the melting snow and opens its chaste white cup nearest the sky  you declared you were not a sentimentalist said jim  oh well said bernard you must make allowances for an old mans inconsistency  he turned as a car began to throb and smiled at carrie  one mustnt keep the engine running and i expect the others are waiting  come back soon and cheer me up  he went with them to the steps and when they drove off jim was thoughtful for a few minutes  he was glad bernard liked carrie but perhaps it was strange he had not urged evelyn to come back  bernard however was puzzling one could not understand his moods  then jim forgot about it as mrs winter began to talk  a week later four gentlemen sat one evening in the smokingroom at a house on the rolling ground where the hills dip to the seaboard plain three were rather fat grayhaired and solemn and one was young  the latter indicated a siphon and decanter on the table when mordaunt came in  help yourself he said  wheres dick  i arranged to pick him up at the crossroads but he wasnt there mordaunt replied  dicks a careless fellow and i didnt want to be late  he filled a glass and when he sat down one of the others remarked alan raine has gone and it is our melancholy duty to fill his post this will not be easy alan was a keen sportsman and a man of tact  he commanded the farmers respect and had the interest of the hunt at heart  for all that the hunt is a useful institution and must be kept up  fish are getting scarce modern field drainage sends down the water in sudden floods and when between times the rivers run low the trout and salmon are the otters easy prey  it is our duty to preserve the fisheries and help as far as we are able a bracing english sport  he drained his glass while the others signed approval  hodson had cleared the ground neatly and the business could begin  our choice is somewhat limited said another  i think we have all found it a drawback to keep the hounds near the hills since the meets are generally held by the deep water in the flat holms  in fact one feels the hounds ought to go to dryholm or langrigg  mordaunt quietly lighted a cigarette and then replied im afraid you must rule out dryholm  bernard declares he is too old to take the hounds  but what about yourself  i am too poor said mordaunt smiling  the others hesitated  they were cautious and did not want to venture on dangerous ground but there was something to be said and herries the youngest man remarked after all an offer of the hounds is a compliment and its acceptance to some extent a public duty  if this view were put before bernard dearham some arrangement could perhaps be made  you mean i might fill the post and bernard provide the money mordaunt suggested  bernard however does not seem to see the advantage of the plan  herries gave him a keen glance  mordaunts face was calm but the other imagined he had felt some disappointment  then we must fall back on langrigg  the new owner is your relation what do you think about our asking him  i imagine you couldnt find a better site for the kennels mordaunt replied  langrigg is near the deep water where the big fish lie and you can generally find an otter  he stopped and herries said yes of course  but this is not altogether what we mean  do you think dearham would take the post  its possible said mordaunt very dryly  have you decided to ask him  the others were quiet for a moment or two  they felt they had got a hint but the hint was vague  somebody must take the hounds and they could not  they resolved to leave the thing to herries he was young and his remarks would not carry so much weight  besides he knew mordaunt well  lets be frank he said hiding some embarrassment by a twinkle meant for mordaunt alone  choosing a master of hounds is an important job would dearham fill the post properly  i think not mordaunt answered in a quiet voice  oh well remarked another  i suppose there is no more to be said  mordaunt lighted a fresh cigarette  i want you to understand  jim dearham is my relation but i feel my responsibility  he is a good sort and i am not stating much to his disadvantage when i admit that he is not the proper man to take the hounds  he has not yet cultivated our sense of sport and his notions are utilitarian  im afraid hed grumble about broken fences and trampled crops  then for example hes dyking the marsh  exactly said one  i imagine we do understand  well we must ask watson of red bank  hes rich enough and ambitious although hes not altogether the man id like  they agreed and soon afterwards dick came in and asked mordaunt why didnt you stop for me as you promised  i did stop  i waited some minutes  then you must have come before the time  look at your watch said mordaunt who took out his  i got the time at the station this afternoon  dick said it did not matter much and asked whom they meant to make the master of hounds  watson of red bank one replied and began to talk about something else when he had filled a glass for dick  the latter was young and sometimes indiscreet it was better he should not know what mordaunt had said  by and by two or three went off to the billiardroom and herries said to mordaunt sorry i had to urge you but i knew the others hadnt pluck enough and meant to leave the thing to me  their notion was i didnt count and you wouldnt resent my remarks  rather an awkward job but we felt we could trust you  all the same i like jim and expect hell be popular when we get to know him  in fact i imagine id have let him take the hounds  hed have jolted the others badly mordaunt rejoined  they belong to the old school he belongs to the new  one or two rather need a jolt but well let it go  i want to watch dicks game hes been playing well and using a new stroke  they went to the billiardroom and stayed until the party broke up then as the dryholm car rolled up to the steps dick said to mordaunt you got the wrong time after all  i compared my watch with hodsons his was a presentation from the farmers club you know the latest thing in watches and he declares its accurate  its not very important  in a way it is important dick objected  if id been here soon enough id have urged their choosing jim  he paused and looked at mordaunt hard  its curious but i imagined hodson was embarrassed when he said they meant to ask watson  why should they ask the fellow hes not our sort  after all jim is not our sort  rot exclaimed dick  bernard is satisfied and id sooner trust him than hodson  in fact bernards a better judge than anybody in hodsons stodgy lot  mordaunt shrugged but was glad the rattle of the engine covered his silence and the driver looked up as if to see if he were coming  he got into the car and pondered as he drove back to dryholm  dicks manner was curious and his annoyance was plain mordaunt wondered whether he suspected something  still except perhaps for herries the hunt committee were tactful he did not think they would enlighten dick     chapter x  bernard ponders  it was getting dark in the hall at langrigg and jim who had just returned from the marsh sat in the hollow of the big fireplace  rain beat upon the windows outside which the trees tossed their naked branches against the lowering sky and a cold wind wailed about the ancient walls  oak logs snapped in the grate and carrie sat on the rug in the flickering light  she was toasting muffins and a silver teapot and some cups stood on the low table in front of mrs winter  now the days were getting cold and short tea by the hearth was a popular function  carrie buttered a muffin and gave it jim on the end of the fork  jake must wait for the next  i cant toast the things fast enough for him she said  theyre quite nice if you eat them hot but theyre not like the flapjacks i made in the woods  after all we had some pretty good times on the new line hadnt we jim  mother doesnt know she wasnt there  i was not said mrs winter  if you had taken me along i wouldnt be with you now  a roof that keeps out the rain a warm room and a comfortable chair are good enough for me  youd have said for mine not long since  looks as if we were all getting english carrie replied  jim was very nice when he got you the chair  its up against all the other things  if i was jim id hate to have it around  jim laughed  he had sent to london for the american spring rockingchair that clashed with the old oak in the hall but it was a pattern mrs winter liked and he was satisfied  he ate his muffin silently for he was tired and carries remarks had wakened memories of other fires that burned among the tall straight trunks in the canadian wilds he thought he could hear the snowfed river brawl and smell the smoke that drifted in blue wreaths about the lonely camp carrie had laughed and bantered him then and he had been happy  he was happy now and hoped to be happier yet but carrie was often quiet and he had a puzzling feeling that he had lost something he could not recapture  presently she picked up a local newspaper and lighted a candle with a shade  the light only spread a yard or two but it touched the page she folded back and sparkled in her hair  they have got a master for the otterhounds she exclaimed and then her color rose and her eyes went hard  i dont know the committee but if the others are like hodson theyre solemn old fools  id rather have liked the post but it doesnt matter much said jim and added with a smile now youre like the carrie who went north with us  bernard meant you to have the hounds hes a dear although some stupid people are afraid of him carrie went on  hed certainly have fixed it if he hadnt got lame again  but i rememberdick went to their old meeting and was mad about something afterwards  i think it was something about lance mordauntnow i begin to see  i dont think its worth while your bothering about the thing  dont interrupt said carrie  im going to talk  lance doesnt like you and i imagine dick doesnt trust him  dick is smart sometimes and knows lance is mean  he is mean he has a yellow streak  she stopped for she saw jims frown  he was not vexed with her but her statement chimed with some vague doubts of his  she got up and made him a formal curtsy  im sorry jim  that was the carrie you knew in the woods  if you dont want her you oughtnt to burn logs and sit by the fire when its getting dark as we used to do  but she has gone back to the shadows that creep among the pines and i dont think she will come out again  she pulled up an easychair and when she sat down and shielded her face from the fire with her hand jakes eyes twinkled  he wondered whether jim saw she was cleverly imitating evelyns graceful languidness  after a few moments she indicated the dark oak paneling and old furniture  thats your proper background jim when you frown  its plain that you belong to langrigg  when you fought the scots and hunted wolves i expect you often looked like you looked just now  but i didnt fight the scots jim objected  your people did said carrie  sometimes youre very dull  jim laughed and glanced at her  flames leaped up round the logs and the red light played about her face  her color was rather marked she looked strangely alert and forceful and something about her dress gave her a touch of stateliness for carrie had well chosen her english clothes  jim knew her to be staunch and fearless and although her humor was sometimes puzzling he felt her charm  by george he said impulsively i think you belong to the old days as much as i belong  one could have trusted you to hold the tower against all comers when your man went off to hunt  carrie held her hand to her face a moment as if the fire were hot and then smiled as she looked up  if my man had gone off often i would have taken the wolfspear and gone with him  mrs winter who had quietly studied both began to talk about something else and presently a servant brought in some letters  jim moved the shaded candle and opened his but after a time put one down and looked straight in front knitting his brows  what is it partner jake asked  i have got a knock  i told my vancouver agent to sell some shares and send along a check  he says id better wait the markets very flat  then you bought the benchlands irrigation stock  i did  i have invested most of the money i got for the bluebird mine  all ours is at the merchants bank carrie remarked  jake wanted to buy irrigation stock but i wouldnt let him  however the company ought to make good  i hope so  jeffreys is doubtful  i bought because i know the bench country and martin was interested in the scheme  it seems they are having trouble about their water rights and an order has been granted to stop the ditches  jeffreys says nobody wants the stock just now and imagines the lawsuit may go against them  will this make things awkward for you  to some extent  langrigg costs much to run and the dykes are expensive  ill get my farm rents soon but they wont go very far for all that the dykes must be finished its the only way to get back the money i have spent  besides you want to finish them carrie suggested  that is so jim agreed  you cant leave a job half done  he began to ponder and struggle with a disturbing doubt  if the irrigation company failed he must use economy because the farm rents would not enable him to live at langrigg like a country gentleman  for himself this did not matter much he did not want a number of servants and gardeners  but evelyn was used to the extravagance at whitelees and he knew mrs hallidays views  well said carrie to begin with the dykes must be finished  when your money runs out you will use ours  carrie speaks for the rest of us jake declared  what she says goes  jim hardly understood the emotion by which he was moved and said awkwardly thanks  youre generous but i cant let you pay for my mistakes  we are partners jim said carrie  until you break the partnership all thats ours is yours  go on with the dykes and when you need money ask jake for a check  give him the book said mrs winter  jake can sign some forms  jim hesitated and smiled to hide his embarrassment  well wait  im not broken yet and since martin is backing the scheme things cant go very wrong  however its lucky they didnt make me master of hounds  in the evening he went to dryholm and dined with bernard at a small table in the spacious room  afterwards they sat by the fire talking quietly  flickering reflections played about the carved marble and bright steel electric lights halfhidden by the cornice threw down a soft light and bernard looked old and worn as he leaned back languidly in his big chair  since you have begun to drain the marsh we may take it for granted you are going to stay at langrigg he said  yes i mean to stay  then its obvious that you ought to marry  i dont know if its obvious or not jim rejoined  however since you are the head of the house i dare say you are entitled to feel some curiosity  bernard smiled  suppose you think about me as an old man who would like to be your friend  im sorry sir said jim  were an independent lot in canada and ive fought for my own hand since i was a boy  anyhow i mean to marry evelyn if she is willing  it looks as if you had not asked her yet  i have not im halfafraid  in one way it would be a rash plunge for a girl like evelyn  though ive inherited langrigg im a western adventurer ive lived with rough men in the wilds  shes refined and cultivated  well ive gone slow trying to persuade myself i was justified before i persuaded her  then i wanted her so to speak to get used to me  you are modest bernard remarked  you imply that evelyn does not know  i dont think she knows  i have been cautious  if i hinted at my hopes too soon she might get disturbed and alarmed  bernard smiled  well perhaps you have taken a prudent line  but do you imagine your reserve has deceived janet halliday  perhaps it has not mrs halliday is clever  i think she is my friend  its possible bernard agreed with a touch of ironical humor  how long do you think you must give evelyn in order to avoid the jar she might get if you prematurely revealed your hopes  jim knitted his brows  he was used to bernards cynical dryness and trusted him  it will be longer than i thought he answered grimly i have had a bad setback  he told bernard about the risk of his losing his money and the latter was silent for a minute or two  then he remarked i suppose you see that if i thought it a good plan i could help you out  that is not why i told you said jim  i could not take your help  i imagined you would not  well perhaps your frankness accounts for our friendship  you are unembarrassed because you have no grounds for indulging my caprices and expect nothing from me  jim made a little abrupt movement  he had once said something like that to mordaunt he thought  very well bernard resumed  if you think i can help i am willing but i will not insist  thank you said jim i must trust my own efforts  bernard lighted a cigar and pondered  he was satisfied and somewhat amused  it would not have cost him much to banish jims difficulties and he would have liked to earn his gratitude but was glad the other had refused  it was better that jims troubles about money should not be banished yet  he was something of a romantic fool but bernard knew evelyn was not  by and by he led jim into confidential talk about his investments in canada and his plans for developing his new estate and then let him go  when jim had gone he sat by the fire thinking hard and after a time sent a servant to the library for a bundle of architects drawings the drawings gave the plans and elevation of a new hospital and bernard thought the plain straight front looked mean  knowing something about building he saw how it could be altered and ornamented and the hospital enlarged if funds permitted  he was one of the founders and thought it might be advisable to augment his gift  next day he went to whitelees and was received by mrs halliday in her drawingroom which always annoyed him  he felt he wanted to clear out janets room and furnish it on another plan  bernard hated sensual prettiness and liked bold clean lines and subdued color  besides his gout was rather bad the fragile chair was uncomfortable and he could not rest his foot  when the pain gripped him he frowned and mrs halliday remarked that he was not looking well  i am getting old and have recently felt my age he replied  one must pay for a strenuous youth and its becoming plain that i ought to straighten my affairs while the opportunity is mine  mrs halliday looked sympathetic and felt curious  she had wondered when bernard would give her his confidence  well she said i suppose this is ones duty although i hope you have no particular grounds for imagining it needful just now  one cannot tell bernard remarked  anyhow i have responsibilities that must not be shirked  well evelyn and lance will get a share of my property in fact i have made some provision for them  i expect you have been generous said mrs halliday who wondered how far she durst go  but what about jim  his claim will need some thought  for that matter he has hinted that he is satisfied with langrigg  independence like his is not common and perhaps ought to be indulged  mrs halliday was disturbed but bernard did not seem to be curious about her feelings and resumed in the meantime ive been thinking about the new brunstock hospital and am going to see the committee since you promised us a donation i have brought the plans  he unrolled the elevation and gave it her  this is not the kind of building we want and i mean to propose some alterations  he indicated the alterations and mrs halliday said but it will cost a very large sum  i expect so  my money came from the iron mines the brunstock pitmen and furnace men earned the most part for me  a number get hurt and it is just that i should give them something back  then if we called it the dearham hospital as the committee suggest the building would keep my memory green and i am vain enough to prefer a handsome monument  in some ways it is a good ambition mrs halliday agreed although she was puzzled for she thought bernard had an object he had not stated  he certainly was not vain  of course he went on one must be just to ones relations and it would be harsh to leave out jim altogether  still you see hes rash we have an example in his dyking plan and i would not like my money squandered  i expect you know he has lost much of his in a canadian speculation  mrs halliday did not know and got something of a jar  she gave bernard a quick and rather anxious glance  but if he has lost his your gift would be more needful  bernard made a sign of disagreement  the drawback is jim might use it as rashly as he has used the rest  they sometimes waste money at hospitals  that is so but if i carry out my plans there will not be much waste at brunstock  i have been pondering some stipulations and if i give them a proper endowment the trustees must consent  do you mean to endow the new wards  we understood you would be satisfied with giving part of what they needed for the original building  of course said bernard  since im going to urge the extension i must find the money  the hospital is getting a hobby of mine and i may make the endowment much larger than i meant  he got up  its a long drive and i must not keep the committee  he went off and mrs halliday tried to brace herself  she had grounds for disturbance but she must think  if bernard carried out his plans it was obvious that she must change hers     chapter xi  evelyns adventure  after bernard had gone mrs halliday talked to evelyn  at first she was cautious and rather implied than stated her meaning but by degrees she threw off her reserve  although evelyn and her mother generally agreed mrs halliday felt she was antagonistic and this disturbed her  evelyn was not romantic as a rule her judgment was cool and sound but she was human and it began to look as if she were strongly attracted by jim dearham  on the whole it would be better if you did not go to langrigg tomorrow mrs halliday concluded  you can make an excuse  i think not said evelyn  you urged me not to disappoint jim the last time we went but we will let this go  now he has had bad luck it would look significant if you suddenly withdrew your approval  he knew it was his not long since  in a way i am forced to withdraw it  i like jim  but you do not like him to be poor evelyn interrupted with a smile well it seems to me a proper and tactful line for his friends to rally round him when he is in trouble  one can of course be sympathetic if one meets him  evelyn laughed  but one need not go too far  she paused and gave her mother a steady look  langrigg is a fine old house i dont suppose jim is ruined and i have some money  then you have taught me to expect that i may get some more  bernard is capricious  he has a bitter humor and may disappoint us all  you have come to think refinement needful you are extravagant and could not live with an impoverished husband  let me beg you not to be obstinate and rash  ah said evelyn i sometimes felt i would like to be rash but was not brave enough  i do not know if i have much courage now  mrs halliday got up  perhaps she had said enough and after all one could trust evelyn when she was cool  it looked as if the girls disappointment had been sharp and the wise plan was to leave her alone  yet she was puzzled evelyn had given signs of a recklessness her mother thought new  when mrs halliday went out evelyn tried to formulate her thoughts  to begin with her mothers calculating caution repelled her it had made her feel shabby  then she had no doubt taken much for granted  jim had perhaps had bad luck but this did not mean that he was impoverished and after all there were many expensive things one could go without  she was not as greedy as some people thought  indeed it would be rather fine to make a plunge to let cold caution go and play a romantic part  she mused about jim  he was marked by a certain roughness but he had dignity  he gave one pleasant thrillsthere was the scene on the dyke when she was halfshocked and yet strangely moved  his physical fineness appealed his figure was like an old greek athletes his face was sharply cut and somehow ascetic  he was hotblooded but one knew he was not gross  his was a clean virility  evelyn thought she loved him as much as she could love anybody for she had not been touched by passion and it counted for something that he loved her  the reserve he thought he used was of course ridiculous  evelyn resolved she would go to langrigg and sympathize with jim  then she would wait and by and by her feelings might get stronger and she would see her way  she would not admit that the possibility of learning whether jim would get over his difficulties had some influence  next evening she went to langrigg without mrs halliday who made an excuse  jim called for her with his car and for the most part she was quiet and he did not talk much  there were steep hills and awkward corners as they ran down from the rolling country to the plain  the evening was calm and the noise of the sea came softly out of the distance  now and then plover and curlew cried a halfmoon hung in the west and the black hills rose out of fleecy mist  evelyn was imaginative and liked the drive across the flat holms in the dark  it was romantic ground rich with traditions of the old border raids and now as she watched jim sitting absorbed with his hands on the wheel she felt he so to speak dated back  he drove the powerful modern car with ease and skill but somehow she imagined him wearing steel cap and leather jack and guiding a shaggy pony  perhaps it was the picture in a hall she knew that haunted her  one saw the shadowy horsemen and glitter of spears in the moonlight  meanwhile she gave herself to irresolute thought  jim had some advantages and some drawbacks evelyn saw the drawbacks plainly  he attracted her it would be exciting to let him carry her away and embark with him on a romantic adventure  she knew he had recently used a stern control but he was hotblooded and his reserve might be undermined  yet there was a risk she must give up much  she was drawn in different ways by romance and worldly caution and it looked as if caution would win  soon after she reached langrigg mordaunt arrived with dick  the latter declared that jim was a very good sort and evelyn knew his feeling was sincere but she imagined dick liked carrie and was sometimes disturbed  for all that she had been relieved to note that carrie liked dick  dinner was a cheerful function but when they went back to the hall evelyn was quiet  joseph dearham and others had made some renovations in the hall but they harmonized with the crooked roofbeams and dark oak  there were one or two tall lamps and another that hung by iron chains but jim generally used candles in old silver stands  evelyn wondered how jim knew that candles were right  it was strange that he often unconsciously she thought struck the proper note  she studied him and jake while she talked to mrs winter  jim seldom wore conventional evening clothes but he had put on an american dinnerjacket  he and his comrade were strangely agile their movements were quick their step was light like a cats and she noted how they lifted their feet  she did not know the prospector gets the habit by walking through tangled bush and across rough stones  they had a suppleness that came from using the long ax and toil in the wilds had given them a finedrawn look  in some ways both were modern but in some they belonged to the past when the fortress peels were built and the marshmen fought the scots  jim crossed the floor and when he began to talk to carrie evelyn felt a jealous pang  the girl had been in the woods with jim she had beauty and a curious primitive strength  jim leaned forward smiling as he talked to her they talked confidentially like tried comrades evelyn was moved to something near anger and went to the old grand piano jim had brought from the drawingroom when he found that carrie could play ragtime airs  evelyn had a talent for music and meant to make an experiment  if jim was what she thought he would respond  if somebody will light the candles i will sing she said  the candles had paleyellow shades and when jim struck a match the colored light touched her face and dress  except for this the corner was somewhat dark  amber was evelyns color  she struck a few chords that seemed to echo in the distance and then glancing at jim began a prelude with a measured beat  his face was intent he seemed to search for something in the music that sounded as if it were getting nearer she wondered whether he heard the call of trumpets and horses feet drumming in the dark  somehow she thought he did  perhaps she was debasing her talent this kind of thing was rather a theatrical trick than music  for all that it needed feeling and she knew the old border ballads and their almost forgotten airs  jim was very still when she began to sing for her voice and the music moved him strongly  the air was wild the rude words rang with something one felt when one battled with floods and snowslides  they told how the mosstroopers rode down ettrick water long ago but human nature did not change and hardbitten men now went out on the snowy trail carrying shovels and axes instead of spears  but how did evelyn surrounded by luxurious refinements understand  its fine he exclaimed when she stopped  you have got it just right horses feet and harness jingling  but you go back of that to the feeling one has when one braces up and sets ones mouth tight  evelyn laughed and looked at mordaunt who frowned  perhaps you are easily satisfied jim but music critical folks contemptuously call descriptive needs some talent  she paused and beat out a few bars imitating a horses gallop  it really does go back of this  never mind critical folks said jim  sing anotherthe song of flodden  im not sure the song you mean has really much to do with flodden but i know one that has  its old and rude like the borderers  you know a band would not fight but were too proud to run away  they stood fast by themselves and were shot down by the archers while the loyal scots fell round their wounded king  this however is shocking art its like writing what you are meant to see at the top of a picture  i know it annoys lance  i can endure much from you mordaunt rejoined  evelyn struck the keys and began to sing  words and air had a strange barbaric force and jim pictured the stern scots spearmen closing round their fallen monarch and their hate for the stubborn mutineers  the blood came to his skin when the music stopped and the girls voice flung out a dying soldiers curse  the curse was strangely modern one heard it often in the west  thank you  you have not sung like this before he said and turned to jake  how does it strike you partner  it hits me where i feel it and hits me hard  i reckon the men who fought that old battle meant to make good  i dont know how miss halliday knows what a man with red blood feels when hes got to put over a big hard job but she does know  im afraid you would make me vain said evelyn  she turned as she left the piano and gave carrie a quick glance  a sharp jealousy seized her for while she could imagine what a strong man felt carrie really knew  she had fronted danger with jim she had watched and helped his struggle in the lonely north  evelyn was suddenly afraid of carrie  she was a powerful rival  the party went to the billiardroom but evelyn would not play and sat in a corner thinking hard  she was highlystrung and her hesitation had vanished  jim loved her and nobody else should claim him  perhaps she was rash but she had begun to feel passion and saw she must embark upon her great adventure now when jim had had reverses and was smarting from the blow  he must see that she had pluck and was willing to bear his troubles  after all to have done with caution was exhilarating  yet she knew her lover  he would not ask her to make a sacrifice for him unless his luck changed he would keep up his reserve  well she must break it down and she knew her power  then she turned as mordaunt stopped by the bench she occupied  i think you did not like my song she said  you know i did not mordaunt rejoined  anyhow i didnt like your exaggerated rendering of a ballad that is probably genuine though one authority states it was written about an ancient football match  they played football before the scottish wars in the border towns  is this important  it is not  i thought you were putting your talent to a shabby use  art is imitation evelyn remarked with a mocking smile  why should one not imitate the drumming of horses feet or for example a storm at sea  i believe that kind of thing is popular at cheap concerts  mordaunt frowned  you well know what your gift is worth  its too fine to be used in order to rouse crude emotions in a handsome savage like jim  ah said evelyn with a sparkle in her eyes are the great emotions crude  courage and loyalty that led to deeds that live four hundred years  i dont know if our refinements would stand comparison with the big primitive things  jim is certainly primitive mordaunt sneered  and hes big  so big that he makes other men look small  i was disturbed when i saw him bruised and muddy that day at the marsh but i begin to understand i was ridiculous  he fought the smith because he was accountable for his men  oh well i expect he would value your approval said mordaunt who saw jim go out  it looks as if he were getting bored  evelyn smiled  he keeps some dyking plans in the hall  i dont think he will be bored if i join him  she got up languidly  since you are not very amusing i will go  she went off and found jim opening a drawer  you can study your plans i wont disturb you she said sitting down by the fire  i really dont care for billiards  he shut the drawer and leaned against a table opposite  you were not playing billiards you were talking to lance  that was why i went away  you flatter me said evelyn  but dont leave the plans  i expect they are important  they are important  the rain is giving us trouble and although i began the job to occupy my leisure im going to finish it because i must  i think i understand  i am sorry you have had bad luck in canada  thank you  how did you know  bernard told us  i wonder why jim remarked thoughtfully  although it doesnt matter much i didnt expect him to tell  evelyn pondered  bernard had no doubt had an object but she could solve the puzzle afterwards  she was alone with jim and in a few minutes the others might return  i was rather hurt when i found you had given bernard your confidence and left me out she said  but does this reverse in canada hit you hard  it was a nasty knock  i expect to get over it but it will be some time before i recover the ground ive lost  things will be better when we plow the land im reclaiming from the marsh  in the meantime you will have to struggle  yes said jim rather grimly it will be a struggle  but that is not all  he pulled himself up  there was a risk that he might say too much and while he hesitated evelyn listened  the door was open and the house was quiet but she could not hear the click of the billiard balls  it looked as if dick and carrie had finished their game there was no time for clever maneuvering she must be frank  she gave jim a quick glance and then looked away  jim she said i am not poor  he started and his face got red  evelyns meaning was obvious but he could hardly persuade himself that he had grasped it  much of my money has gone and i may not get it back he said with forced quietness  in one way this does not matter im not greedy but im proud  i must farm the reclaimed land and make my farming profitable i cant keep up langrigg as my friends expect  ive got to live and work as i lived and worked in canada  people do live in the woods and on the plains  do you think your countrywomen have less pluck than these others  are we dull and weak afraid of hardship and only willing to be amused  jim lifted his head and laughed  all this is ridiculous  i havent met many english girls but you are the finest thing in a womans shape i have known  ive thought about you always since that day at montreal  when they told me langrigg was mine i would have sold it had i not thought i might find you in the old country  then you didnt know i was here  i did not said jim who forgot his reserve and let himself go when i saw you on the terrace i got a thrill and a sense of triumph id never known before  but to find you was not enough i had got to claim and keep you  id got to have something to offer i had to justify myself  well thats why i began to drain the marsh  evelyn stopped him  i wasnt worth it jim she said with halfashamed sincerity  but i understand you are too proud to take you want to give  although youre foolish i like your pride  for a moment jim was silent and his face got hard  its done with he said rather hoarsely  i meant to make good before i claimed you and this loss has set me back  im not beaten but i must wait until i can give you all you ought to have  youre so fine and highlytempered that youre fragile rough jolts and jars are not for such as you ive got to work  she got up and looked at him shyly with color in her face and her eyes shining  and until you make good you mean to leave me out  will it cost you nothing jim  it will cost me much he said grimly  more than i durst reckon but i must brace up and pay  but suppose i will not let you leave me out  am i to give nothing evelyn asked  besides its my right to choose and you meant to rob me of my right  if i didnt know you well i should be angry langrigg is yours but if you had nothing do you think id keep our extravagance at whitelees and let you go  she turned her head and then looked up stretching out her hands  i cant let you go  i want to help  jim took her hands and next moment she was in his arms  then there were steps in the passage and she gently pushed him back  you must tell nobody just yet she said  the others came in and mordaunt looked at evelyn rather hard but she went to the piano and opening a musicbook beckoned dick  you know this she said  ill play it for you     chapter xii  the shooting punt  on the morning after her interview with jim evelyn sat in front of a writingtable by a window at whitelees  she had meant to tell a friend about her lover but now did not know if she would or not  for one thing the morning was cold and dreary and she felt dull  composition was difficult the glowing phrases she had thought to use would not come  it was raining outside the lawn was strewn with wet dead leaves and the bare trees tossed their branches in the wind  shallow pools spread about the terrace and the hills were blurred by mist winter had begun and evelyn did not like winter in the country  she put down her pen  last nights thrill had gone and she was languid  when she had broken his reserve jim was the ardent and romantic lover she had thought but she had been forced to break down his reserve and this carried a sting  for some hours she had been dazzled by the glamor of romance and had rejoiced in her rashness but the light was getting dim  things looked different in the morning  jim loved her and she was flattered by his exaggerated notion of her worth  she had meant to justify his confidence but she knew this would be hard because she knew herself  in a sense jim was not her kind and by and by they might jar  she had selfcontrol but she was not patient  moreover it looked as if jim were poor and although she had some money she was not rich  thrilled by keen excitement and halfconsciously acting she had told him that poverty did not daunt her but when she came to think it would be hard to go without the expensive refinements she enjoyed  with something of an effort she banished her disturbing thoughts  she was going to marry jim  perhaps she could mold him a little  yet she did not know she did not want to conventionalize him there was something rather fine about his ruggedness  then she began to wonder why she had asked him to tell nobody yet  girls she knew had found an obvious satisfaction in exhibiting their lovers but she had felt a need for concealment  this was not because she feared her mothers disapproval it looked as if she had unconsciously tried to leave open a way of escape  by and by a car rolled up the drive and mordaunt came in  i am going to the town and wondered whether you wanted anything i could get for you he said  evelyn said he might call for some goods her mother had ordered and he was silent for a moment or two  then he asked were you and jim quarreling in the hall last evening  no she said smiling  why do you imagine this  jim was preoccupied  i asked him for matches and he gave me his cigarette case  he is often preoccupied evelyn rejoined with a careless laugh  i expect he was thinking about his dykes he talked about the marsh  mordaunt studied her  she was calm and looked amused by his curiosity moreover her suggestion was plausible  jim is not always happy in his choice of subjects but i wont sympathize with you he said  you could have stopped him if you had liked  you often stop me  i suppose that is so evelyn agreed  for one thing it is not much trouble  you know when one is bored  your tastes are mine we belong to the same school  it makes for understanding  after all said evelyn one likes something new  mordaunt laughed and said he must go and when his car rolled away evelyn mused  lances remark was justified they did belong to the same school and in the main their views agreed  this had some drawbacks but it had advantages  novelty was stimulating for a time but soon lost its charm one was safe if one held fast by the things one knew and valued even if ones standard of value was not altogether just  evelyn admitted her cynically philosophic mood was strange but the dreary day accounted for something and perhaps a reaction from last nights thrill had begun  a few minutes afterwards mrs halliday came in and they talked about household matters  in the meantime mordaunt drove to the town and stopped at a lawyers office  there were three partners in the firm which managed bernard dearhams business two sober whitehaired gentlemen and one who was young  the others gave the house weight and respectability but holbrook supplied the driving force and mordaunt imagined his partners did not know where he was leading them  holbrooks room in a tall old house that looked across a quiet square was handsomely furnished and mordaunt sat down in a comfortable chair  i want to borrow some money for about six months he said  how much do you want holbrook asked and when mordaunt told him looked thoughtful  mordaunt had borrowed before and had punctually repaid principal and interest  we are not moneylenders you know he said  i negotiated the last loan rather as a favor than a matter of business  mordaunt smiled indulgently  for all that you lend money your clients i suppose  i dont know if your legal business would keep you going long  if we invest in anything outside the regular highclass securities we run some risk  i dont think the risk is great mordaunt replied  i sometimes speculate and you have grounds for knowing im generally lucky  well some friends floated a small private company to develop a west indian estate and we have spent much of our capital on new plantations  the value of our produce is rising but we need funds to carry us on until the crop is shipped and have agreed to a fresh levy  i must pay my share  the sum is large  you lent me nearly as much before  i did said holbrook  things were different then  he stopped and mordaunt gave him a keen glance  holbrooks hesitation was curious  how are things different mordaunt asked  you bought shares that seldom fluctuate much  you risked losing a small margin now you may lose the principal  the loss would be mine  i have always paid  that is so  the trouble is if this venture went wrong you might not be able to pay  mordaunt was silent for a few moments  holbrook had been willing to negotiate the other loans it looked as if the fellow had now less grounds for trusting him although it was not his honesty but his power to pay he doubted  why did holbrook think his power had got less  am i to understand you refuse to lend he asked  i would sooner not  however if a smaller sum  a smaller sum would not help mordaunt replied with a touch of haughtiness  well i will not urge you and dare say you are occupied  the lawyer let him go and mordaunt thought hard as he drove home holbrook had formerly been accommodating as if he wanted to satisfy a client whose business might by and by be valuable but his attitude was now different  there was no traffic on the road that went up a long hill and mordaunt could concentrate on the puzzle  when he was halfway up he began to see a light  bernard had gone to town and had stayed some time he had probably called on the lawyers who had made his will  the light got clearer and when mordaunt reached the top he thought he understood  bernard had altered his will and mordaunt would not get as much as he and no doubt holbrook had thought possible  the hospital would cost a large sum but this did not account for everything  although bernard often used the formal manners of the old school he had a rude vein he had broken down stubborn opposition and beaten determined strikers while he developed the famous iron mines  no doubt he saw in jim qualities like his and now meant to leave him the most part of his estate  all jim got would be taken from the others and mordaunt thought holbrooks caution indicated that his share had been severely cut down  jim was going to get money mordaunt had imagined was his  he let the engine go the car leaped forward and he drove furiously until he reached the dryholm lodge for he wanted to find out if his supposition was correct  when he put the car into the garage a man was cleaning a limousine  im afraid i have given you another job mordaunt said  you havent got the big car properly polished yet  she got very wet when i took mr dearham to town  it was a bad day  did he keep you waiting in the rain  i was outside the lawyers office for an hour the man replied  mordaunt frowned as he went to the house  the reason for holbrooks caution was plain and if janet halliday imagined bernard meant to leave jim nothing she was much deceived  bernard had probably meant to deceive her but mordaunt thought he would not meddle  he went to his room and stopped for some time smoking and pondering  a few days afterwards jim and jake wearing long waders and yellow oilskins crept up a hollow in the sands  it was about nine oclock in the evening they were a mile from land and light mist drifted about the bay but the moon shone through  the tide was flowing the water rippled noisily in the channel and flakes of muddy foam and trailing weed floated past  the harsh cry of a blackbacked gull rang across the flats and small wading birds whistled about the waters edge farther off the clanging call of black geese came out of the mist  jim carried a heavy tenbore gun and his feet sank in the mud as he crept quietly up the hollow  he liked this rough shooting and now and then jake and he went out at nights  when one had hunted fierce game in canada shooting driven pheasants was tame sport and the beaters found the birds but on the sands one must match ones intelligence against the instinctive cunning of the ducks and geese  besides there was some risk that gave the thing a spice  belts of sand were dangerously soft and the tides were treacherous  sometimes they rose faster than one reckoned  the brantgeese cant be far off he remarked presently  its a pretty big gaggle and i expect some of the fat graylag are feeding with them  jake looked at the water  if you want a shot i guess youll go on but if id been alone id have started home some time since  the tides rising fast  we have a quarter of an hour yet said jim  anyhow well shove on for the next bend  they went on  their waders and oilskins scarcely showed against the sand and the murmur of the current drowned the noise they made  as they came near the bend the calling of the geese got louder there was a creaking beat of wings and some of the harsh cries had a different note  greylag said jim  another lot is coming up  theyll fly across to the marsh when the tide moves them  it will move us soon jake rejoined  when they reached the corner jim was a short distance in front  the geese were obviously restless and he crouched as low as he could get jake found a hollow in the bank where the sand undermined by the current had fallen down and stood with the water creeping to his feet  he imagined it would nearly reach his waist in midchannel and they must soon get across  the beat of wings began again and harsh cries echoed in the mist  the geese were moving and jake balanced his gun when jim rose halfupright  the bank behind jim was low and his bent figure was outlined against the glimmering reflection of the tide  then although he did not know if he had heard a noise or not jake looked round and saw a long gray object slide out of the mist  it was indistinct and very low in the water but he knew it was a shooting punt  it drifted up the channel towards him a faint ripple indicating that somebody was steering it with a short paddle  a blurred figure lay in the well behind a bunch of reeds and the only bold line was the barrel of the big puntgun that would throw a pound of shot  jim could not see the punt because he was looking the other way but it was obvious that the gunner could see him although jake thought he himself was invisible against the bank  as a rule one cannot aim a puntgun one must turn the punt and jake noted that the craft swerved  the long barrel was now in line with jim and although the man on board was probably steering towards the bank for concealment jake thought there was something sinister about his quiet approach  he remembered that shanks owned the only punt on the lower bay  he waited a few moments unwilling to call out lest he should spoil his comrades shot but feeling disturbed  the punt was about fifty yards from jim and the heavy shot would not spread much jake admitted that his disturbance was perhaps illogical but he did not like the way the big gun pointed  when the punt was level with him he stepped out from the bank  the indistinct figure on board did not move but the craft swerved again and the gun pointed straight up the channel  jake did not know if this was significant or not because the current eddied but he imagined the fellow had seen him  then jim threw his gun to his shoulder and a red flash leaped from the muzzle  there was a splash but next moment jake saw a dark object overhead and pulled the trigger  the goose came down whirling over with long neck hanging limp until it struck the other bank and jake plunged into the channel  pick up your bird and get across he shouted while the current rippled about his legs  for the next minute or two they were occupied  the tide ran fast the bottom was soft and jims goose drifted away  he reached it however and they came out on the other bank  jake could see nothing but the glimmering water and a narrow belt of wet sand  the geese had flown off and the punt had vanished in the fog  we stopped long enough but weve got a brant and a graylag  you ought to be satisfied he said  id have got another if you hadnt been so anxious to get across jim rejoined  wasnt there a punt about  i thought i saw something as i threw up my gun  yes said jake dryly shanks punt  of course  nobody else keeps a punt on the low marsh  well we spoiled his shot and i expect hell feel he has a fresh grievance that is if he knew who i was  i reckon he knew all right jake remarked  nobody else has been on the sands for some weeks  jim looked at him rather hard  anyhow it doesnt matter  lets get home  theres a hole in my wader and the water has leaked through this sport is pretty good but you need a punt  ill order one from the fellow across the bay  they set off and jake could not tell if he had excited his comrades suspicions  jim was sometimes reserved  jake admitted that his own suspicions might not be justified but he wondered what would have happened had he not moved out from the bank     chapter xiii  mordaunts repulse  shortly after his visit to the lawyer mordaunt walked over to whitelees  it was about four oclock in the afternoon and it would soon be dark but although he had some distance to go he did not walk fast  tea was served early at whitelees and as a rule mrs halliday afterwards went to sleep  mordaunt wanted to arrive when she had done so and his leisurely progress gave him time to think  he meant to ask evelyn to marry him  he liked her and they generally agreed but he was not sure he would have thought about marriage had he been rich  for all that he knew no other girl who would suit him so well and it would be an advantage to consolidate the family property since both would inherit some part of bernards estate  mordaunt knew mrs halliday saw this for she had been his friend until jim came on the scene  it now looked as if she thought jim would get little or nothing and mordaunt did not mean to enlighten her  the loss of his west indian investment forced him to make a prudent marriage but he did not feel that he was doing a shabby thing  evelyn understood him and was rather calculating than romantic  it was disturbing that she had obviously been attracted by jim but mordaunt thought the attraction was not very strong  he did not mean to let jim rob him of his inheritance and the girl he hoped would be his wife  it was getting dark when he reached whitelees and found evelyn sitting by the fire in the drawingroom  the lamps were not lighted and the room was shadowy except for the reflection from the grate  evelyn did not get up and he stood opposite talking quietly while she rested her chin in her hollowed hand and listened  he did not pretend passion but she thought he struck the right note  he was sincere as far as he went and she admitted that he made the best of a not very strong appeal  one could trust lance to be graceful  if you had asked me before i might have married you  it is now too late she said  mordaunt moved abruptly but used some control  ah he said in a rather strained voice i suppose this means jim has claimed you first  yes she said calmly i have promised to marry jim  so far nobody else knows  he was silent for a moment or two knitting his brows and then looked up  im sorry and although your refusal hurts dont think im altogether selfish  jim is a good sort but hes not the man for you  evelyn colored and her eyes sparkled and then the firelight left her face  to some extent that is so lance  i expect jim has drawbacks but hes flesh and blood red blood i think they say in canada  you know what you and i are we have cultivated out our vulgar passions  at least i thought i had  has jim persuaded you that you were mistaken  he may persuade me  after all there is some satisfaction in being human  mordaunt made a sign of vague agreement  i thought i was a philosopher but im frankly savage now  however i dont imagine you will let passion guide you very long  he paused and after a few moments resumed if you find you were deceived and romance gets stale you will find me waiting  i think you know this and there is no more to be said  there is no use in waiting lance evelyn replied  i have made the plunge  it cost me an effort but i feel braced  jim is bracing like cold water or a boisterous wind  you would have kept me in an enervating calm  well im tired of artificial tranquillity im going to try my luck in the struggle of life with jim  she let him go and he started for dryholm in a thoughtful mood  her refusal had hurt him but he would not dwell on this  he was halfafraid to do so and wanted to think about her  she was pluckier than he had imagined and was obviously sincere since she did not know jim would be rich but he doubted if she could keep it up  jim was rude and tempestuous and she would not be satisfied with him long the trouble was the romantic impulse might sustain her until it was too late for jim would no doubt urge an early marriage  mordaunts face got hard as he thought about this and he was rather surprised by the anger that fired his blood  he had cultivated a philosophic selfishness but it no longer supported him  he hated jim and felt troubled about evelyn  luck was with the headstrong fool he had swept her off her feet but she would recover her balance and then she would pay  mordaunt clenched his fist and raged with helpless savageness  it was long since he had indulged his passions and now his control had gone the reaction was sharp  he got cooler and began to look about  there was a moon the evening was calm and the dew sparkled on the grass by the hedgerows  a thick wood bordered one side of the road which went up a long hill and pale birch trunks that caught the light stood out against dusky firs  now and then a rabbit ran across the road and plunged into the grass and presently there was a sharp rattle of wings  a flock of woodpigeons circled round in the moonlight and flew back into the frees  then a cockpheasant crowed  mordaunt stopped in the gloom where a nutbush hung over the gate of a ride  somebody had disturbed the birds one could trust the pigeons to give the alarm when an enemy was about  mordaunt was a sportsman and a good shot but he waited because he wanted to find some relief from his tormenting thoughts  he was just inside the langrigg boundary and imagined the gamekeeper began his round at the other end of the estate by and by dry underbrush rustled and there was a noise like a briar dragging across somebodys clothes  afterwards all was quiet for a few moments until a dark figure came out of the gloom close to the gate  mordaunt let the man get over and then touched his arm  the other started and stepping back struck the gate  the blow was soft as if something had eased the shock and the fellows shape was bulky about his hips  mordaunt knew a poacher has generally a large pocket in the lower lining of his coat  as the fellow lifted a short knotted stick he turned his face to the light and mordaunt saw it was tom shanks the old marshmans son  you can put down the stick he said coolly  i expect you have been smoking pheasants but theyre langrigg birds not ours  shanks leaned against the gate and looked at him with dull suspicion although his face was coarse and heavy his eyes were cunning he slouched but when he moved his step was light  theres nowt thats not langriggs he growled grasping his stick gentry stands by yan anodder  are you gan t tell  mordaunt pondered  they were alone and he knew shankss sullen ferocity  on the whole he thought he was in some danger unless he could satisfy the fellow  shanks did not mean to let him seize the heavy stick  ive not much ground for standing by mr dearham and its not my business to protect his game he said  if i thowt youd send keeper after me  put down your stick said mordaunt with haughty impatience  if i wanted to send the keeper id certainly do so  but how many pheasants did you get  nobbut two  t birds is varra scarce  then i dont see why you ran the risk of stealing langrigg pheasants when there are plenty in red bank woods  shanks was silent for a moment or two and then replied as if mordaunts carelessness had banished his doubts mr dearham put us oot o dabbin and blew t up  its possible hell put you out of bankend cottage soon  do you ken that shanks asked with a start  i heard something of the kind  dearham meant to let your father have the cottage but said nothing about your getting it and hes tired of you both  you are letting bankend go to ruin and people complain about your poaching  shankss sullen look changed to a savage frown  if he puts us oot theres nea place well can gan  mordaunt hesitated  he imagined shanks had had something to do with the accident to jims car and it was obvious that the fellow was bitterly revengeful  at the beginning mordaunt had not meant to work upon his vindictive feelings he had done so halfconsciously but now he meant to go on  nobody in the neighborhood would let you have a cottage  you might get a laborers job in the town but you would have to work hard and i dont know about your father  hes rheumatic and old  none of the farmers would engage you  toad man wouldnt could live away from marsh and im none for takin a job in town id sicken among thooses shanks replied  mordaunt thought the fellow did not exaggerate  shanks and his father would find no place in organized industry  they belonged to the open spaces the wide marsh and the wet sands  then its lucky i and not the gamekeeper caught you tonight he said  mr dearham is waiting for an excuse to turn you out  i imagine you will soon give him one  shanks did not reply  seizing the top of the gate he jumped over and vanished in the wood  for a few moments all was quiet and then mordaunt heard steps in the road  he left the gate and when he had gone a few yards met dick halliday who stopped and looked at him with surprise  i thought i saw two people dick remarked  you did see two mordaunt agreed  its curious the other fellow didnt hear you farther off because i imagine his ears are very good were you trying to get near us  not at first  theyre mending the road up the hill and i walked on the grass  when i saw you at the gate i suspected poachers and came on quietly  who was the other fellow  tom shanks  i caught him coming out of the wood with some pheasants and warned him hed have to leave bankend if jim knew  do you mean you promised not to tell jim  i imagined he understood something like that  he is a powerful fellow and carried a heavy stick  still my satisfying him doesnt bind you  i dont know perhaps it does bind me in a way dick replied  all the same shanks is a loafing thief id have turned him out of the neighborhood  mordaunt hesitated  he would have liked dick to tell jim since this might lead the latter to take the cottage from shanks  for all that he did not see how he could persuade dick to do so because he did not want him to think he had an object  well i must get on he said  bernard grumbles when im late for dinner  he felt rather angry with himself when he went off  luck had given him an opportunity and he had used it in a manner of which he was halfashamed  the thing was done however and he was not sure he was sorry  shanks was a savage brute and had already borne jim a grudge one or two of the farmers and country gentlemen had had grounds to regret they had not left him alone  he would not hesitate much if he saw a way to prevent jims turning him out but mordaunt shrank from wondering how far he would go  after all he had merely warned shanks about the consequence of his poaching  when dinner was over he told bernard he had been to whitelees and added i imagine evelyn would not like it publicly announced just yet but she has promised to marry jim  bernard was silent for a few moments and his face was inscrutable then she is pluckier than i thought he said dryly  but why does she not want people to know  its something of a puzzle  perhaps she felt telling people would bind her to her promise  jim is a handsome fellow i suppose the flesh is willing but the calculating brain weighs the drawbacks that may after all tip the beam bernard remarked and added with a sneer you ought to have married evelyn you would have got on with her  in fact if she had been willing id have seen that her prudence was properly rewarded the curious thing is i imagine you both knew this  i dont think either of us deserves the taunt sir mordaunt rejoined  anyhow i doubt if your generous plan altogether sprang from good will to us  youre clever said bernard with dry humor  much cleverer than jim but hell go far while you stand still  hustling is new to evelyn and at first she may find it exciting but i doubt if shell enjoy the effort to keep up with her husband when the novelty wears off  he mused when mordaunt went away  for a time at least his plot had failed and he was keenly disappointed  evelyn was not the wife for jim he ought to have married the girl from canada  carrie was frankly flesh and blood and although she had not much polish yet this would come she had a natural dignity and was staunch and fearless  she would keep pace with jim fronting troubles with her steady glance bernard smiled as he pictured evelyns stumbling gait when jim so to speak took a rough steep hill  the thought however did not amuse him much and he resigned himself moodily to wait     chapter xiv  footsteps in the sand  jim had a shootingpunt built and now and then when the tide served at night paddled up the creeks and shot a goose or duck although he did not use a big puntgun  he liked to pick out his birds and not throw a pound of shot into a flock  in the meantime he pushed on the draining of the marsh and although he spent anxious hours counting the cost resolved to hold out until the job was done  as a rule he was preoccupied and quiet and evelyn often found him dull  his talk about dykes and sluices did not amuse her  by and by he found it needful to engage some draincutters and one afternoon jake taking carrie with him started for a village on the other side of the bay  it was a long way round the sands and when they were near the village the car stopped and jake found a valve had broken  he engaged the men he wanted and afterwards resolved to leave the car and walk back across the sands  the few cottages were very small and their occupants had no room for strangers but the bay got narrow near its mouth and the distance across the sands was scarcely three miles  jake did not expect to find much water in the channels and when he had borrowed a pair of fishermens waders for carrie and they had got a meal at a cottage they set off  it was dark and fog drifted in from sea but the moon shone between slowlymoving clouds  the throb of the surf was unusually loud and a fisherman told jake to get across as soon as he could  he said there was wind outside and the tide often turned before its proper time when a fresh breeze was coming  when dusk fell jim returned from the marsh and found mrs winter in the hall  there was nobody else about and he thought the hall looked lonely  he was tired after a days hard work and sat down in an easychair when mrs winter asked if he would like some tea  ill wait until carrie comes he said  jake ought to have brought her back by now  the house feels empty when theyre not here  mrs winter mused  although jim had rather unwillingly agreed when evelyn insisted that nobody should be told about their engagement he took much for granted when he imagined that nobody knew  mrs winter was not deceived by his silence and knew that carrie understood  when do you reckon youll finish the dykes jim she asked presently  i dont know he said  it looks like a long job and moneys getting short  anyhow i have got to put it over because i cant stand for losing the sum ive already spent  but why do you ask  because we must go back when you have no more use for jake  oh said jim smiling ill always have some use for jake and langrigg wouldnt be the same if he took you away  you and carrie make the old house feel like home  mrs winter felt troubled  jim was obviously sincere and she had liked him from the beginning  she had been happy at langrigg after the strain of hard work and poverty it was nice to rest and control the wellordered english household  carrie too had been happy but mrs winter imagined she was not happy now  although the girl had grit and would play her part well mrs winter did not mean to let her wait for jims wedding  you know we cant stay very long she said  i dont see why its impossible  you may get married  well said jim  suppose i do  theres plenty of room at langrigg and my wife would be kind to my friends when she knew how much i owe them  the plan wouldnt work  when you marry your wife will have first claim on you  i reckon shell have all the claim there is and wont want to share it with anybody else  jim frowned  perhaps mrs winter was justified  now he came to think of it he had once or twice got a hint that evelyn did not altogether understand his friendship for carrie  i hate to think of your going he declared  anyhow you must stay for some time yet  jake promised to help me finish the draining scheme and i may go broke  then id need him more  he got up and was silent for a few moments  if he lost his money his engagement to evelyn must be broken off  this was obvious but if he had for example meant to marry carrie his embarrassments would not in one sense matter much  carrie would meet their troubles with a smile and help him to make good  still he must not indulge thoughts like this  i think ill take the punt and paddle up the big creek he said you can tell carrie she ought to have come back to give me tea  since she hasnt come ill wait for dinner  he went off and mrs winter mused  jim generally knew what he wanted but his attitude was puzzling now  although he meant to marry evelyn and imagined he loved her mrs winter doubted  she wondered whether evelyn had so to speak dazzled him by her grace and beauty  jim was resolute and practical but not clever  mrs winter sighed and imagined she had been foolish to let carrie stay so long but she could not see her way  jim would not be married until he had drained the marsh and jake would not go before the work was finished  mrs winter admitted that he could not go  in the meantime jim launched his shootingpunt in a muddy creek  the punt would carry two people and measured about eighteen feet long and nearly three feet wide  she was decked except for a short well and when loaded floated a few inches above the water  a bundle of reeds was fastened across the headledge of the well to hide the occupant when he lay down and used the short paddle  jim stood on the afterdeck and drove the punt down the creek with a pole  he could see across the bank and the wet marsh glistening faintly in the moonlight ran back into thin mist  in front the creek got wider until it melted into the expanse of sands  here and there a belt of smooth mud caught a silvery reflection but for the most part the sands were dark  the night was calm and the advancing surf rumbled in the distance like a heavy train  it was a good night for shooting and jim wondered whether anybody else was about  mordaunt and dick now and then went after the geese and shanks in his shooting punt generally haunted the channels when the gaggles came down to feed  it was some time after lowwater when jim reached the main channel and stopped to listen  he thought the surf was unusually loud but he could not hear the geese  the wild cry of a curlew came out of the dark and redshanks were whistling in the distance  the water so far as he could see was still and this meant the tide had not yet entered the channel  he thought he ought to have an hour before it did so but the current would run fast then  tides rise high when highwater comes at twelve oclock with a full moon  after a few minutes he set off again  there was no need for him to lie down and he stood on deck using the pole  it sank about a foot but presently the water shoaled and when the punt touched bottom he got over and dragged her by a line  he wore a yellow oilskin long waders and thin canvas shoes  at length the punt would float no farther and putting her on rollers he pulled her a short distance up the bank and afterwards carried a small anchor as far as the line would allow  he was a mile and a half from land the tide would soon flow and if the geese were about he might be away some time  then picking up his gun he set off up the nearly dry channel  there was a saltwater lake bordered by a weedy scar not far off and he might find some brant geese or ducks  in the meantime dick halliday called at langrigg and was received by mrs winter  are you all alone he asked  mrs winter told him where jake and carrie had gone and that jim was shooting  dick inquired when jake had started and looked thoughtful when mrs winter replied  they ought to have been back some time since he remarked  the road is very bad where it runs across the head of the bay and high tides cover the causeway for an hour or two  i dont think jake would wait until dark the car has probably broken down  then they would have to stop all night  i doubt if anybody could take them in  there are only a few cottages and the musselgatherers and farmhands have swarms of children  i rather imagine jake would walk across the sands  he stopped and looked at the tall clock and then crossing the floor pulled back the windowcurtains and opened a light  mrs winter noted that his movements were quick and thought him anxious  dick came rather often to langrigg and she imagined carrie attracted him although she knew the girl had not meant to use her charm  its nearly fullmoon he remarked when he came back  i dont think jim will mind if i borrow one of his guns  i know where they are dont bother to ring  are you going to shoot mrs winter asked  i might get a shot dick replied carelessly  anyhow ill walk across the sands  i may find jim or perhaps meet jake and carrie coming back  he went to the gunroom and took down a heavy tenbore that would make a loud report for the fog he had seen from the window was getting thick  then he put some cartridges in his pocket and finding a pair of waders went back and smiled when he met mrs winters curious glance  carrie may be glad of the waders he said  theres sometimes a little water in the hollows and i dont expect jake knows the driest way  now ill get off  mrs winter let him go  she was beginning to feel alarmed but dicks quick resolute movements comforted her  he had been careful not to hint there was a risk but if there was he would know the best way of meeting it  dick did not hurry when he went down the freshlyraked gravel drive but when he reached the road he walked as fast as the heavy gun would let him  carrie was on the sands it was past lowwater and jake did not know much about the gutters through which the tide ran up the bay  dick did know and had sometimes seen a whitetopped bore roll like a wall of foam across the flats when the moon was full  tonight when wind was coming the tide would rise fast  it was rough walking across the marsh where he was forced to jump ditches and wind about among deep holes and he was glad to reach the sands  stopping for a few moments he took off his boots  the sand was cold but he meant to strike the shortest line across the bay and in places the mud was soft  he knew one can pull ones naked foot loose where ones boots would stick moreover carrie would like the waders dry  dick began to think about carrie as he set out across the flats  he liked her much and admitted that it cost him an effort not to fall in love with her carrie had made him feel that this could not be allowed sometimes he wondered why and sometimes he thought he knew but then he suspected that jim would marry evelyn  dick approved jim but doubted if he was altogether the man for evelyn  perhaps however when he came to think about it he really meant that evelyn was not the girl for jim  there was a difference  he pulled himself up  he was fond of evelyn although he knew her faults besides the fog was thick and he must keep his proper course he ought to strike the big gutter soon and was anxious about the tide it would soon run up the hollows in the flats  he wondered where mordaunt was because lance had told him he was going out on the sands and he had not heard his gun  shortly afterwards dick went down the bank of the gutter and began to wade across  the water did not come much above his ankles but it was moving slowly yet although it would soon run fast  he got across and saw jims punt on the muddy sand  the fog was low and drifted about in belts clearing now and then and when he stopped by the punt the moon shone through  dick was puzzled  the punt had been moved since jim pulled her up the bank  it was prudent to leave her where one could get on board when the tide rose but dick could not see why jim had afterwards moved her down  he had however done so because the rollers he used had made a rut in the sand in advance of her present position  then the anchor had been carried up to higher ground for one could see where the line had dragged although it now lay close to the punt  dick began to examine the footsteps about the spot  he was something of a naturalist and a good wildfowler and had studied the tracks of animals and birds  jim had obviously come up the gutter and another man had joined him the other was barefooted and the marks seemed to indicate that he had helped jim to run down the punt  then a third man had arrived and dick thought this was lance because he wore nailed fishing brogues  lance often used brogues he was cautious and did not like soft mud  dick imagined lance had reached the spot after the others and was somewhere about he would not go far from the gutter when the tide was rising the thing was strange but since jim had moved the punt back there was no reason why dick should meddle  jim had probably gone to the scar and no doubt knew how long he could stay  moreover dicks business was to find carrie and he set off again  he followed a small creek that joined the big gutter  its channel was narrow and cut rather deep into the sand  although a belt of fog rolled up he could see fifty or sixty yards and presently distinguished a hazy figure near a bend of the creek  he thought it was about lances height and shouted but the fellow did not answer and vanished next moment  it looked as if the fog had rolled nearer and hidden him although he might have gone down into the creek  dick went to the edge but saw nobody although he crossed a row of steps this was puzzling  he imagined the other had heard his shout and was in the hollow where his shootingclothes would melt into the background  the sand however was soft and the marks had begun to fill up  dick did not see why he should follow them since the man might have meant to hide until the geese flew over  he gave it up and pushed on  the fog crept towards him and did not look as if it would soon roll away  for all that he knew the sands and had the noise of the advancing surf for a guide which was lucky because speed was important  a stream ran through the flats near the other shore and if carrie and jake had started they would have crossed its channel and now be on the long peninsula of sand that went up the middle of the bay when the water rose they could not get across the main gutter and it would be hard to reach the land from the end of the peninsula because it was traversed by a number of little creeks up which the tide forced its way  after a time dick stopped and fired the gun  he heard nothing but the echoes that rolled across the waste and the roar of the sea  the latter was ominously loud and he began to run  when he had gone some distance he tried another shot and disturbed two blackbacked gulls that made a noise like hoarse laughter as they flew overhead  this was all and he felt that the gulls were mocking him  he was getting anxious and ran on until he was forced to stop for breath as the fog began to lift  it rolled back before a little puff of wind the moon shone through and he saw glittering water in front  dick began to run the other way  he could do no more and it looked as if jake and carrie were not on the middle sand  after all he had not much ground for imagining they had meant to cross the bay if there was no room at the village they might have walked to a station four or five miles off and gone to the market town  he must save himself and since he hardly thought he could reach jims punt before she floated he headed up the middle sand  one could cross the gutter farther on if one knew the right spot but it would mean wading some distance and he must be quick  he got through and then ran back along the edge of the channel  he wanted to see if jim had returned to the punt     chapter xv  jims enlightenment  jim waited for some time behind a bowlder by the saltwater pond and then shot a duck  the report echoed among the belts of fog and after the noise died away the roar of the advancing tide was ominously loud but jim thought he heard something else  he listened and in a few moments a cry came faintly across the sands  somebody was calling for help and jim began to run  he might have to go some distance and his punt would soon float  after a few minutes he plunged into a belt of mist  the sand was soft and his waders and heavy gun embarrassed him but he heard the call again and thought he knew the voice  he labored on breathing hard until by and by the tog melted and he saw two figures not far off  jake he shouted  is it you and carrie  jake answered and jim was conscious of a relief that shook him when the others came up  carrie was splashed by mud and breathless with haste  what are you doing on the sands he asked  car broke down we tried to get across jake replied  saw the langrigg hill when we started and then the fog came on  they told us to head for some stakenets but we couldnt find them  then we met the water and reckoned we were lost  is your punt about  she is not far off said jim who turned to carrie  we must hustle can you run  carrie said she would try and they set off but when they had gone a few hundred yards a wave of thick fog rolled up blotting out the moonlight  this is awkward jim gasped taking carries arm and helping her on still if we keep going well soon strike the gutter  the roar of the surf gave him some guidance but sound is puzzling in a fog there was very little wind and he could not see the moon  he knew the tide was now running up the channel and hoped he was heading the right way  shortly afterwards a dull report rolled across the sands  a tenbore he exclaimed  mordaunt uses a twelve  i expect dicks shooting and since the waters rising hes on the shore flat  where do you locate the shot  a little to the left said jake  they swerved and presently heard the gun again  thats for us gasped jim  dick has found the punt i reckon shes afloat  let me go jim said carrie  hurry on and get the punt  jim pressed her arm and urged her forward  im going to stick to you until youre safe on board  water shouted jake from a few yards in front and something glimmered in the fog which was getting thin again  they could see for a short distance but when they stopped at the edge of the channel the punt was not about  she was however painted an inconspicuous gray and jim thought she was not far off  while he hesitated wondering which way to turn a heavy report came out of the melting fog  hallo jake shouted  wheres our punt  on your side somebody answered  saw her five minutes since and then the water drove me back  the voice came from their left and after running a short distance they stopped  a low indistinct object floated about thirty yards off and jim dropping carries arm stood for a moment with his hands clenched the wavelined sand was level and this meant much because the bank of the gutter was steep  the tide had filled the hollow and he could not see across  he was not disturbed about the depth but the current rippled across the sand carrying along clumps of weed and flakes of foam that showed how fast it went  give me your knife he said to jake as he pulled off his oilskin ive got to swim  you must stay with carrie i swim better  he slit the waders and tore them off with his canvas shoes then he ran along the sand heading up stream and when he judged he had gone far enough plunged in  after he had taken a few steps the water frothed about his waist and next moment swept him off his feet  he swam savagely swinging his left arm out and steering obliquely against the current that carried him along  the water was horribly cold and cut his breathing and cramped his muscles but if he missed the punt he might be swept some distance up the channel before he could land  he must not miss the punt because he would be too exhausted to try again and did not think jake could reach her  after a minute or two he saw the punt she was swinging about in the rush of tide and seemed to forge towards him  a rippling line marked her painter  he stopped swimming and let himself drift  he must not be carried past and presently he made a quick stroke and felt a triumphant thrill when his numbed fingers clutched the crafts low side  for all that he had not conquered yet  he was tired and it is hard to get on board a floating punt  the current swept his legs under the boat and when he tried to lift himself she rolled down with his weight and threatened to capsize  but he must not be beaten  he was fighting for carries life and remembering this gave him extra strength  sliding his hands along the side of the punt he let the current take him aft and then with a desperate effort lifted the upper of his body above the pointed stern next moment he fell forward on the deck and crawled to the well  he had won  he tried to shout but could not  his heart beat like a hammer and he choked  pulling himself together he seized the line at the bow and in a few moments the anchor was on board and he picked up the pole  the punt drifted fast up channel while he headed for the bank but he saw jake running along the sand and presently threw the light anchor as far as he could  jake caught the line and jim springing overboard ran through the water and picked up carrie  he felt her tremble and kissed her as she put her arms round his neck it did not matter it jake saw or not  after putting her on board he jumped in and grasped the pole  shove us off he said to jake  ill come back for you  they lost the bank in the fog and soon the pole did not touch bottom and jim used the paddle  after a few minutes he saw an indistinct figure apparently in the water and then his paddle struck sand jumping over he held out his arms and did not put carrie down until he had carried her some distance from the channel  he had afterwards a hazy notion that he kissed her again  when he turned back dick was pushing off the punt  ill bring jake you have had enough he said  jim shoved him back  its my job hes my partner  look after carrie  start for the marsh  he got on board and when the punt vanished in the fog dick turned to carrie  they may be ten minutes the tides running fast  you are wet and perhaps we had better get off  no said carrie  i wont move until theyre safe across  dick gave her a quick glance  she looked resolute her voice had a strange exultant note  he was anxious to start since he thought they might find some water in a gutter between them and land but it was obvious that carrie could not be persuaded  presently the punt came across and the others got out  have you been here long jim asked when he had driven the anchor into the sand  no said dick  i fired the gun as soon as i arrived  the punt was on your side i imagined you were about and i cant swim much  id seen the punt before  i went to meet jake and carrie but met the water  no doubt they crossed the channel that stopped me farther up  jim nodded  looks like that  it was a big relief when we heard you shoot  but im puzzled the punt was some distance from the bank and the anchor was covered  i thought id carried it far enough back  then you didnt move her after you pulled her up  certainly not jim rejoined with some surprise  if id wanted her to float i wouldnt have bothered to drag her up over the steep mud  oh well we must get off said dick who did not want to talk about the punt  the tides running fast across the flats i think well make for the shell ridge  although the fog was thick they reached the marsh where dick left them  he was wet and it was some distance to whitelees but he would not go to langrigg and put on dry clothes  when jim got calm he might feel curious about the punt  dick was not ready to satisfy his curiosity yet  he was disturbed and wanted to get away  the others went on and when they came down to dinner nobody looked much the worse  jim however was quiet and although carrie talked and sometimes laughed he imagined her cheerfulness was forced  jake alone seemed to have a good appetite and jim was annoyed when mrs winter remarked that he did not eat much  she declared the dinner was pretty good although it had been served an hour or two late  when it was over jim looked at the clock and proposed that they should play cards he would sooner have gone off to the library by himself but jake might speculate about this and so long as they were occupied he need not talk  the others would go to bed soon and then he could grapple with an awkward situation  at length jake put down his cards  i cant make it you have beaten us he said and pushed back his chair  if you want to see the men start tomorrow we had better go to bed  he brought mrs winter a candle and they left the hall but carrie stopped to pick up the cards and jim waited  he heard jake say good night to his mother on the landing and their steps died away  it was very quiet in the hall except for the snapping of the fire and jims hand trembled as he struck a match and lighted carries candle  she heard him move and looked up  there was some color in her face which cut sharply against the dark oak  jim put the candle on the carved newelpost at the bottom of the stairs  i was badly scared when we found the water was round the punt he said  in fact i rather lost my control  you were not scared for yourself and were very cool and quick carrie replied and forced a smile  perhaps some people do lose control when they are strongly moved but you are not that kind  jim gave her a keen glance  it looked as if she meant to persuade him that he had acted normally but this was ridiculous  perhaps she meant to hint that his rashness must not be talked about  coolness was hard but he was honest and there was something to be said  i wonder whether you know i am going to marry evelyn he remarked  she met his glance  yes jim i knew some time since  it doesnt matter that you told nobody  well shes beautiful and very charming she moved and taking the candle from the post calmly looked back at him  of course youre going to marry evelyn  but the others have gone and im tired  good night  he let her go and when she went up the shallow stairs crossed the floor to the hearth  there was a lookingglass close by and he started as he saw his face  his brows were knitted and his mouth was set carrie was clever and while he talked to her he had looked like that he began to see what she had meant when she said he was of course going to marry evelyn  he sat down and gazed savagely at the sinking fire  what a fool he had been  evelyn had moved him to romantic admiration  her beauty her high cultivation and refinement had made a strong appeal but he had not known that they appealed mainly to his intellect and it counted for much that she was the first englishwoman of her type he had met he knew now and saw he had deceived himself  enlightenment had come when carrie ran some risk of being drowned and he had taken her in his arms  evelyn was so to speak a model of perfection worthy to be admired but really out of his reach  in a sense she left him cold but carrie was warm and loving flesh and blood  she had worked with him and cheered him in the lonely north her small failings had a curious charm  she appealed to all that was human in him it was ridiculous that he had imagined his love for her was brotherly  he began to think about their last interview when he had lighted the candle  she had said little but she had meant much  his kissing her must be forgotten and he must marry evelyn  carrie wanted him to understand that she saw this and was jealous for his honor  if he drew back and broke his faith with evelyn she would have nothing to do with him  moreover it was unthinkable that he should draw back  he sat still for some time with his hands clenched and then got up abruptly and went out  the wind the surf had threatened had come and blown back the fog  its rude buffet braced him the roar of the sea and wail of the trees that rolled down the slope were soothing  the moon was bright and when he saw the foam glitter in the bay his sense of rebellion began to melt carrie was safe he had saved her and she had shown him his duty well he was going to carry it out and after all evelyns charm was strong  he had been a fool but only carrie knew and evelyn must not pay  by and by he went back to the house calmed but not much comforted  in the meantime dick reached whitelees and did not say much about his adventure  when he had got some food he went to the smokingroom and looked for paper and a pencil  he wanted to refresh his memory of the footsteps about the punt and the marks left by the anchor line  it was important that he should do so but although he sat for an hour drawing rough plans of the spot he was not satisfied  unluckily he could not go back to the sands in the morning and study the ground because he had promised to join some friends in town for a week  all the same it was some relief to put off the matter and go to bed but he did not sleep much and felt moody when he got an early breakfast and started for the station     chapter xvi  evelyns resolution fails  disturbing thoughts spoiled dicks visit to town and one morning soon after his return he went out on the sands when the tide was low  he took a notebook and a compass and before he went walked up and down a measured distance on the lawn until he thought he knew the length of his stride  since he was going to make some investigations that he tried to hope would banish his doubts it was necessary to be accurate he found the spot where jim had left his punt there was a little runlet of water down the bank that fixed it and he stepped off the distance to the level sand above  then he smoked a pipe while he tried to recapture the footsteps as he had seen them in the moonlight and when he was roughly satisfied went across to the creek that ran into the main channel  he counted his steps until he reached the spot where the shadowy figure had vanished in the fog  the creek bent just there he remembered the bend which he had cut across and the bank was steep  if lance wearing lightcolored shooting clothes had gone into the hollow nobody could have seen him a few yards off  dick made some notes and marked the distances and then went back to whitelees feeling strangely troubled  his doubts had not vanished they had changed to certainties  dick was young and often careless but now a sense of responsibility weighed upon him  he had a liking for jim and an affection for carrie that might have ripened to a stronger feeling had she allowed it and both had run some risk of being drowned  for all that dick could not see his way  the honor of the house must be guarded and although he knew himself a coward he hesitated for a miserable week  then jim came to whitelees one evening when mrs halliday and dick were dining somewhere else  he stopped for two or three hours and unluckily evelyn was bored when he arrived and jim was dull  he had had a disappointing day for a sluicegate had fallen down a workman had got hurt and a valuable horse had broken its leg  jim talked about his troubles at some length while evelyn tried to look sympathetic and afterwards stated with numerous particulars his projects for improving the estate although he carefully explained that his losing his money might prevent their being carried out  while he sketched his plans he unconsciously delineated his character and when he went away evelyn felt daunted  pulling a chair to the fire she sat for a time trying to face a crisis she had begun to fear must come  she had thought she understood jim and had known that when she married him she must give up much but now she saw him as he really was  he cared nothing for amusements and not much for music and art in fact he had no use for the refinements and amenities that smoothed the life she enjoyed  langrigg could not be made a center of pleasant social intercourse and perhaps political influence jims wife must study economy and help to manage his farms it was not that he was selfish  all his habits were utilitarian and he would not change  well she could not marry a farmer and devote herself to strenuous work  she must be amused the life jim had planned for her was frankly impossible  getting up before mrs halliday returned she left word that she had a headache and went to bed  next morning mordaunt came to whitelees and found evelyn alone  he sat down opposite with a careless smile and she noted his smooth urbanity and easy pose  jim as a rule was restless and highlystrung  seeing dick and your mother in the car encouraged me to call he said  dick and i were staunch friends but i didnt want to meet him he has recently been strange  he has been moody since he came from town although he was not in very good spirits the morning he left evelyn agreed in a thoughtful voice i imagine something that might account for it happened the night jims friends were lost on the sands  mordaunt felt disturbed but evelyns remark stiffened his resolution she had noted dicks moodiness and since the lad was suspicious he must act quickly  he might have trouble afterwards but he would meet it when it came  its possible he said dicks temperament is nervous and perhaps he had some grounds for feeling a strain  i expect you have noted that he is attracted by miss winter  i have noted it evelyn admitted with an unconscious frown  it will lead to nothing  dicks romantic but he is not a fool  he is headstrong and his own master  miss winter has beauty  for all that its ridiculous to imagine dick would marry her  i dont know said mordaunt coolly  you are going to marry jim  evelyn colored because she knew what he meant  for the most part the objections that could be urged against carrie applied to jim  i dont know if im going to marry jim or not she said  mordaunt looked hard at her and his eyes sparkled  ah he said i imagined something like this would happen in fact i have waited for it  it was plain that jim would pall  he has his virtues but he is not the man for you  he has many virtues hes big and strong and honest  it would be easier if he had some of our shabby faults  jims code is as rude as himself but its stern and he lives up to it  i dont know if i can  i know said mordaunt smiling you could not  jim is something of a savage but all the same he belongs to the old school and his rudeness is austere  we are modern and live on another plane  but how did you come to see the truth ive seen all along  jim showed me evelyn replied with some feeling  unconsciously of course  he was here last evening and talked about his plans  they are good plans  had i been different i might have helped but they left me out  i dont like to be left out  am i the girl to satisfy a man who lives to farm and dig marsh drains  you know me lance  the thing is ridiculous mordaunt declared and was silent for a moment or two  he did know evelyn and her frankness meant much  it was plain that she meant to break with jim but felt she needed help  what are you going to do about it he asked  i dont know she said drearily  i cant go on  mordaunt made a sign of sympathetic agreement  you cannot but there is a way out  i think you see the way  durst i hope youll take it with me  evelyn said nothing and turned her head and he went on im not utilitarian and my rule is yours  we understand each other  my talents will be used to amuse you and not to dig drains  he got up and stood by her chair  you have pluck evelyn  tell jim you have found you cheated yourself and let him go  i havent much pluck she said quietly  jim rather carried me away  he stood for romance struggle and adventure things i havent known  hes a man a plain hotblooded fighting man and i was tired of conventional languidness  but i began to doubt and see i wasnt strong enough to live his life  i had wrapped myself up in flimsy artificialities until they got needful and i couldnt break loose she paused and looked up  well you are my kind lance and if you want me i am willing  ill tell jim but i shrink  he may not understand and it will hurt us both  mordaunt thought for a moment  it might be better if evelyn did not tell jim and he was afraid dick would meddle  he took and kissed her hand  my dear he said  but you must not get hurt and i have a plan hasnt florence urged you to stop with her in town  well suppose you go and i join you there  we can be married by license and go to france or italy  before we come back jims disappointment will have cooled and our friends have got over their surprise  evelyn saw the plan had advantages  it would obviate the need for awkward apologies and when she and lance came back it would be too late for people to disapprove  she agreed and submitted without emotion when mordaunt put his arm round her but in spite of some regrets she was firm  romance had been a treacherous guide she had found this out and was logical again  when mordaunt went away all had been arranged and when she sat down to write to florence in london her hand was steady and composition easy  after the note was written she hesitated for a moment and then resolutely fastened the envelope  a few days after evelyn went to town dick coming back from shooting one afternoon met tom shanks on the marsh  when he saw the fellow his anger flared up for he had felt his responsibility and wondered with keen disturbance what he ought to do  although lance was on the sands the night carrie was nearly drowned and knew much about the matter dick had grounds for believing shanks moved the punt  he had meant to be cautious and wait until he saw his way but something in the fellows furtive sullen look banished his control  he stopped shanks and found it a relief to let himself go  the other was cool and hinted darkly that dick had better leave things alone  he said dick had nothing to go upon he had not seen shanks near the punt and if he went to the police about it might get somebody else into trouble  shanks knew what he knew and if he were forced would tell dick then used tact scoffing at the others hints until shanks abandoned some of his reserve and when the stormy interview was over dick went home moodily  the plan he had made of the marks by the punt was accurate but the line he ought to take not yet plain  lance was his relation  in the evening he drove mrs halliday to dryholm where jim and his friends had been asked to dine  they had not arrived and while bernard talked to mrs halliday dick went to the library to look at a book about sport  when he opened the door mordaunt was writing and there was a letter to which he seemed to be replying on the table he nodded and went on writing and dick was glad he did not want to talk  after a few minutes a car rolled up the drive and when mordaunt fastened the envelope they heard jims party in the hall  mordaunt went down stairs and dick coming after saw an envelope on the floor  imagining mordaunt had dropped it he picked it up and frowned as he recognized evelyns hand  mordaunt was talking to mrs winter and dick did not want to disturb them besides he would sooner give lance the letter when they were alone  then bernard beckoned him and before long dinner was served  dick did not enjoy the meal  he could hardly rouse himself to talk to carrie and when she turned to mordaunt the latters careless smile as he began to joke moved him to almost uncontrollable rage  dick was in a black mood for the secret he carried had worn his nerves and he did not like evelyns writing to lance  he was resolved that his sister should have nothing to do with the fellow  when dinner was over he said to mordaunt id like to see the gun you bought  very well said mordaunt and they went to the gunroom  the room was small  a glass case holding guns and fishing rods ran along one wall a bench occupied the other  there was a plain table stained by oil and a fire burned in a stove with an open front for the night was damp  a flickering glow played about the walls and shone on the greasy guns  dick stopped mordaunt who put his hand on the electriclight switch  never mind the light he said throwing a letter on the table  you dropped this  i did said mordaunt turning to dick who leaned against the table imagined id put it in my pocket  thank you for picking it up  dick thought it significant that he had not opened the case to get the new gun  lances voice was calm but his glance was quick  he seemed to be waiting  what was evelyn writing to you about dick asked  the light from the stove touched mordaunts face which hardened  then you have not read the letter  you know i have not dick rejoined for his control gave way at the others taunt  lance wanted to make him angry and find out how much he knew  well he should find out and dick thought he would get a jar anyhow you must stop writing to evelyn he resumed  id sooner you kept away from whitelees when she comes home  you bore with my visits not long since  are you afraid to state why you want them to stop  not at all said dick seeing the other meant to force him to be frank he knew lance had pluck  you are a clever philanderer but evelyns going to marry jim  mordaunt smiled imprudently since his smile infuriated dick  looks as if you wanted to quarrel  i imagine i shall not write to evelyn again for some time  this ought to satisfy you  perhaps im dull but i dont know why our friendship should break off  you well know  dick exclaimed  you meant to let jim drown not long since  youre a theatrical fool mordaunt remarked coolly although his voice was rather hoarse  anyhow i think youre sober and you have made a statement that must be justified  im willing to justify it if you force me dick declared  but id sooner you admitted the thing and left the neighborhood without an awkward explanation  if you go at once and dont come back its perhaps not needful the others should know why you went  you can live in town i dont care where you live so long as you dont see evelyn again  he stopped and his face got very red for the door opened and mrs halliday and bernard came in  i imagined we would find you here but it looks as if you were quarreling bernard remarked  we were quarreling dick admitted with strange calm for he was relieved that a chance to get rid of his load had come  it was his duty to tell jim and bernard and he had been afraid  now he could leave matters to the head of the house  you are hotblooded dick but i dont imagine you would get angry about nothing  may i inquire the grounds for the dispute  ill tell you if you will send for jim  the thing touches him  bernard pressed an electric bell and mordaunt said you will be very sorry for this dick  the bell rang and when a servant came bernard said tell mr dearham we would like to see him here     chapter xvii  dicks accusation  the party in the gunroom were silent while they waited for jim  mrs halliday glanced at the others curiously and got a sense of strain dick looking disturbed but resolute leaned against the table opposite mordaunt whose face was rather white bernard occupied the bench by the wall and his look was inscrutable  all was very quiet except for the snapping of the stove and the occasional rattle of a cinder falling through the bars  it was something of a relief when jim came in and bernard turned on the light  sit down jim he said  dick has something to tell us that he thinks you ought to hear  he hints that it is important  it is important dick replied  the thing has weighed on me for some time  in fact the load is too heavy and i feel i must get rid of it i want to hand over my responsibility and you are the head of the house sir  very well said bernard  the post has drawbacks  you had better go on  then ill begin some time since the night lance and i met jim at the telegraph shack  we talked about england and jim asked if we knew langrigg  there was an old french romance on a shelf and lance read a passage  he studied the book when jim left the shack and i found out afterwards that franklin dearhams name was written across the front page  you see what this implies sir  you mean lance knew who jim was although you did not  when did you find out  i picked up the book one day at langrigg  lance was there  he admitted that he had seen the writing at the telegraph shack  jim turned to mordaunt sharply  then you meant to let me stay in canada  i did said mordaunt who addressed bernard  i thought it would be better for jim and us if he did not know langrigg was his  i have not changed my views about it since  that has been rather obvious bernard remarked and asked dick  why did you keep the thing dark  i was afraid to meddle the matter was awkward  besides until recently i trusted lance  i thought his antagonism sprang from an honest prejudice  perhaps it was honest  are you willing to state the grounds you had for trying to keep jim out of the country lance  no grounds would justify his robbing jim of his inheritance mrs halliday interposed  mordaunt smiled  i was not scrupulous but imagine my plot is condemned mainly because it failed  i did not think jim was the man to own langrigg  his education character and the life he had led did not fit him for the position it was plain that he would rule langrigg like a canadian industrialist and break all our traditions  right or wrong i took some thought for the honor of the house  i am the head of the house and was an industrialist said bernard dryly  you talk as if you belonged to the old school but you do not go far enough back  the men who built langrigg were plain fighting farmers  he signed to dick  go on  when jims car was upset i suspected shanks was somehow accountable for the accident  he was accountable jim said grimly i didnt know you knew this but one must be just  lance lifted the wheel off my body at some risk to himself  that is so dick agreed  i think he took advantage of it afterwards i mean he knew we would remember he had saved your life it was a generous impulse but that was all  i imagine lances character is too complex for your study bernard remarked  tell us about his deeds  not long since i was coming home in the dark when i found lance talking to tom shanks in the wood  lance said he had caught the fellow poaching and i thought it strange they should talk quietly  i suspected he wanted me to tell jim but i did not  his grudge against jim had been getting worse  when did you find lance talking to shanks bernard asked and smiled rather curiously when dick replied for he remembered his visit to the lawyer  lance had known about the visit  ah he said i begin to see a light  but go on dick i expect you have now cleared the ground  dick has missed his vocation he ought to have been a barrister mordaunt remarked  im trying to be just to you and jim dick resumed  i have shirked my duty i trusted you lance and when i found you out it hurt  you trusted me until you found jim was the better man  well it looks as if others had copied your example mordaunt rejoined  bernard made an impatient sign and dick resumed ive been leading to the night jim and carrie were nearly drowned  you all know i was on the sands  well i came to jims punt when he had left her and gone to look for the geese  dick paused and taking out a plan that he put on the table addressed jim you dragged the punt up the bank and carried out the anchor  is this sketch of the spot accurate  mordaunt moved abruptly but controlled himself and stood very quiet jim picked up the paper and his face got dark  so far as i remember it is accurate  did you pull the punt down again or move the anchor  i did not  i was puzzled when i found her floating and the anchor covered  dick gave bernard the plan  the punt ought not to have floated before jim got back  you will note the rows of dots  they stand for footsteps  the first was jims then shanks came and pulled the punt back into the channeli saw the mark of the rollers leading up and down  it is plain he wanted to leave jim on the middle sand when the tide rose  how did you know the steps were shanks bernard asked  the night was very cold sir but he was barefooted  your surmise is no doubt right  anybody else would have worn boots or waders  but there are three rows of tracks  dick hesitated then answered quietly the last were lances  he passed the punt close i dont know if he touched her but it was plain that she would soon float and jim was not about  this is frankly unthinkable dick mrs halliday exclaimed  for a moment or two the others were silent and their attitudes indicated that the strain was heavy  mrs hallidays face was flushed jims was very stern and bernard knitted his brows  dick and mordaunt stood motionless but tense at opposite ends of the table  your statement is very grave dick bernard remarked  are you persuaded the steps were lances  i knew the marks of his fishing brogues and saw him a short distance off  i think he saw me because he vanished he went down into the hollow of the creek where i have drawn a ring  i went afterwards and carefully examined the ground  i think that is all sir  it is enough said bernard very dryly  you imply that lance knew jim might be cut off by the tide and refused to meddle  but you take something for granted  why do you imagine jims danger was plain to lance if it was not then plain to you  you went away  i knew carrie and jake were farther out on the sands and came back as soon as possible  i fired my gun to warn jim  lance did nothing but went off he tried to hide from me  bernard made a sign of agreement and then inquired why have you been frank about it now after saying nothing for some time  id sooner not reply sir  the thing mainly touches lance and me  his horrible treachery touches us all mrs halliday declared  if it were known we should be forced to leave the neighborhood  we could not face a scandal like this  i imagine it will not be known bernard remarked with an ironical smile and turned to mordaunt  have you anything to state  i might urge that i risked getting badly hurt when i lifted the car off jim and that i did not move his punt  you consented to its being moved dick broke in  bernard stopped him and mordaunt resumed it is plain that you have judged me  dick brings no proof of his statements but we will let this go  there is obviously no use in my denying his tale  suppose i admit that its correct  jim is the injured party  he must choose our line  there is only one line jim replied  this thing cannot be talked about  lance knows we know i cannot punish him in any lawful way but if he stops at dryholm ill use the backwoods plan  well i give him a week to go  bernard nodded and looked at his watch  a week is too long  if you pack quickly lance you can get the express to town  anyhow you will leave dryholm as soon as the car is ready  but i must be just and since you might have made your mark in a useful profession had i not allowed you to think you would inherit part of my estate i will tell my lawyers to pay you a sum quarterly  if you come back to cumberland the payments will stop  mordaunt made a sign of agreement and glanced at dick  you have won but i doubt if you have much ground for satisfaction he said and went out  dick was vaguely puzzled but when the door shut the others were conscious of keen relief  they waited until mordaunts steps died away and then bernard got up  what has happened tonight is done with i think you understand he said and turned to mrs halliday  we will join our friends and if they wonder why we have been absent so long we will leave you to satisfy their curiosity  they found the others in the drawingroom but although mrs halliday began to talk and bernard was now and then ironically humorous dick was quiet and jim rather stern  all were ready to go when mrs halliday got up but bernard kept carrie a moment when the langrigg car throbbed at the steps  this house is big and empty my dear he said  if jim is not very much occupied you will bring him now and then  carrie wondered when the car rolled off  bernard had pressed her hand and his voice was gentle  she blushed for his imagining she could persuade jim was significant but it was puzzling  he knew jim was going to marry evelyn  presently jim stopped the car and getting down beckoned jake  you can drive home carrie he said  theres something we must look after but we wont be long  carrie started the car and when it rolled away jake looked at his comrade  jim wore thin shoes and a light coat over his dinner jacket the road was wet and the low ground dotted by shining pools  it was some time after highwater and a gentle breeze blew across the marsh a halfmoon shone between slowlydrifting clouds  i suppose you mean to see shanks jake remarked  on the whole it might be wiser to send him notice to quit  you cant put the police on his track  im going to see him  if i hadnt been able to swim well carrie would have been drowned  for that matter we would all have been drowned jake said dryly  its a curious argument for leaving shanks alone  i suspected we took some chances when we blew up the dabbin  you blew up the dabbin jake rejoined  anyhow carrie had nothing to do with the thing and she ran the worst risk when we were on the sands  it was hard to hold myself when i thought about it  i was forced to let mordaunt go but my grounds for sparing him dont apply to shanks  you havent even a stick and the fellow has a gun  ive got my hands said jim  if i can get hold of tom shanks i wont need a gun  but ive no use for talking  come along  they made for a ridge of high ground that dropped to the marsh and presently stopped outside the bankend cottage  all was dark and nobody moved when jim beat on the door  shanks is sleeping pretty sound if that doesnt waken him he said bring the netbeam  well break in  jake picked up a thick wooden bar and when the door gave way they plunged into the kitchen and jim struck a match  the house was horribly dirty and old clothes empty cartridges brass snares and fishing lines lay about as if shanks had hurriedly sorted his belongings and left those he did not want  they found nobody when they went upstairs  lance has been here before us jim remarked  the curious thing is shanks had two big duckguns and has moved some truck although he couldnt get a cart  he had his shooting punt and the tide hasnt left the creek yet said jake and they ran across the marsh  when they stopped at a muddy pool the punt had gone but there were fresh footmarks on the bank and jim set off again  the creek winds and he must shove her across the mud in places he said  my punts on the sands  if we are quick we might head him off  they stumbled among reeds and rushes and fell into pools and were wet when they reached a hollow at the edge of the sands  the bank was steep but the tide had not left the channel and jim plunging in pulled up the punts anchor  then he stood on deck using the pole while jake paddled  the tide was running out and they drove the punt furiously past belts of mud and sandy shoals but the bank was high and they could not see across  shanks however was not in front jim imagined he had come down another gutter that joined the channel farther on  they must try to get there first  keep it up he shouted as he bent over the pole  in five minutes well be round the bend and can see the bay  jake braced himself for an effort and the water foamed about the punts low bow  floating weed and scum sped past the bank was dropping to the level of the flats and its wet slope sparkled in the moonlight jake saw the sandy point that marked the bend and resolved to hold out until they reached the spot  they shot round the bend and jim threw down his pole  in front lay a broad expanse of sand broken by belts of shining water  a flock of oystercatchers screaming noisily circled about the foreground but this was all  shove her in jim shouted  i reckon shanks hasnt made the meeting of the channels  well strike across the flat  the sand was soft and they labored hard  when they were haltway across a low dark object rose above the edge of the bank  it was roughly triangular and moving fast  shankss punt said jake  he has set the little black lugsail and the winds fair  you cant head him off  im going to try said jim who was now some yards in front and they pushed on  they were exhausted when they stopped beside a belt of sparkling water and jim cried out hoarsely and clenched his fist  the channel was wider than he had thought and near the other bank a punt was running down with the tide  one could hardly see her low gray hull but the tanned lugsail cut sharply against the bank and its slant and the splash of foam at the bows indicated speed  shooting punts are not built to carry canvas but they sail fast in smooth water when the wind is fair  were too late i dont know if im sorry jake remarked with labored breath  my notion is shanks has pulled out for good and nobody is going to miss him much  winds off the land waters smooth and the tide will run west for three or four hours  hell be a long way down the coast before it turns  in the meantime were some distance from langrigg and it looks as if you had lost your shoe  so i have said jim  guess it came off when i was plowing through the mud  well lets get home  shanks has gone and hell find trouble waiting if he comes back  they set off  both were wet and dirty and when they reached langrigg jims foot was sore     chapter xviii  jims release  on the morning after his pursuit of shanks jim was conscious of a flat reaction  dicks story and the excitement of the chase had helped him to forget his troubles but now he was cool they returned  he had promised to marry evelyn and found out too late that he loved another  there was no use in railing at his folly although this was great and it was futile to wonder how he had so grossly misunderstood his feelings  evelyn was all he thought her but romantic admiration and respect for her fine qualities were not love  the important thing was that she held his promise and he must make it good  there was no other way  carrie knew he loved her but she had shown him his duty  if he drew back and broke with evelyn he would earn her contempt carrie was very staunch and put honor first  anyhow he was going to draw back he had been a fool but he could pay  the trouble was evelyn was clever and might find him out  his face went grim as he thought about it the strain of pretending the effort to be kind for all that the effort must be made and perhaps by and by things would be easier  for a week he was quiet and moody and tried to occupy himself at the dyke  the evenings were the worst because it soon got dark and he must talk to jake and carrie and try to look calm  then he was puzzled about other things  evelyn had gone to london and had not written to him  a few days afterwards dick too went to town and mrs halliday did not know why he had gone  jim thought this strange but it was not important  coming home one evening from the marsh he found dick with the others in the hall  it was nearly dark but there was a bright fire and carrie was making tea  dick kneeled on the rug toasting muffins on a long fork and laughed when carrie bantered him about being afraid to scorch his hands  jim envied dick and remembered with poignant regret the days when he had helped carrie by the campfire in the woods  then dick looked up and jim thought him embarrassed  hallo dick he said  when did you get back  dick said he arrived in the morning and jim asked if he had met evelyn in town  i did dick replied  she was pretty well but its two or three days since  she said shed write to you  jim nodded  dicks voice was careless but jim thought his carelessness was forced  then he turned to carrie  did the postman call  yes said carrie  your mail is on the table  jim got the letters and lighting a lamp sat down in an easychair  the envelope with the london postmark was from evelyn but he would sooner read her note when he was alone  he opened another and presently looked up  martin has written to me from vancouver  the irrigation company has won the lawsuit and proved its claim to the waterrights  the shares are going up again and martins hopeful about the future  i can sell out for face value but he urges me to hold  ah said carrie thats good news  you can trust martin  i expect the company has straightened up because they made him a director  its very possible  he sends your mother and you greetings and hopes you havent forgotten him  one doesnt forget men like that carrie replied  martins all white clever and strong and straight  but doesnt this mean you have got over your troubles  i suppose i can go ahead with the dykes said jim  he was quiet afterwards and let the others talk until carrie got up and went away with mrs winter and jake  when the door shut dick looked up  has evelyn written to you  yes said jim  i havent read her note yet  i dont know if that is strange or not but perhaps you had better read it  i expect it will clear the ground for me and i have something to say  jim opened the envelope and braced himself for he was halfashamed of the satisfaction he got from the first few lines moreover he did not want dick to know what he felt  evelyn was apologetic but she set him free  i thought i loved you jim she said  i wanted to be brave and simple but found it would cost too much  now i hope you wont be hurt and by and by perhaps you will be glad i let you go  you will go far jim with your large stride fronting the storms you love but i could not have taken your path  mine must be sheltered and smooth  there was more for evelyn wrote with some feeling in a romantic strain but jim had read enough  his look was puzzled as he turned to dick  your sister has turned me down he said  the grounds she gives are good enough  i imagine you knew  i did know  i suspected for some time that she would do so but she did not tell me until i was in town  then i dont understand  dick hesitated before he replied lance said something at dryholm that i thought ominous  he declared id be sorry and i bothered about it for a day or two  then i saw a light and got the next train to town he meant that he was going to marry evelyn  thats unthinkable  besides evelyn was then pledged to marry me  it looks as if you didnt know lance yet im not sure you altogether know evelyn  anyhow i saw her and stopped the thing  i think she got a bad jolt when i told her about the punt  jim looked at the date on the note  when did you see her  dick told him and he pondered  then he said she wrote to me after she knew about the punt although you imply that she agreed to marry lance before  its puzzling  ive got to be frank dick replied  evelyn is not like carrie she takes the easiest line  i imagine she meant to say nothing until she had quietly married lance  then wed have been forced to accept the situation  he paused and his face got red as he resumed im thankful i was not too late but im sorry i could not find lance  jim was silent for a time  he had believed in evelyn after illumination had come on the sands  although he knew his imagination had cheated him he owned her charm and his respect for her was strong now he had got a jar  evelyn was not the girl he had thought it looked as if she were calculating unscrupulous and weak  if she had let him go before she had agreed to marry lance he could have forgiven her much  he was savage with himself  it was for evelyns sake he had lost carrie who was tender brave and staunch  by and by he roused himself and asked have you told your mother  i have not  i felt i was forced to tell you but it would be better that nobody else should know  florence with whom evelyn stayed will not talk  jim nodded  you can trust me dick  the statements in this letter are enough evelyn imagined she could not be happy with me and she was no doubt right  youre a good sort jim said dick with some embarrassment  its not strange you feel sore  it cost me something to be frank apologizing for ones sister is hard  its done with jim said quietly and as dick got up a servant came in with a pink envelope  a telegram for mr halliday she said  as mrs halliday was not at home the gardener brought it on  the servant went out and dick laughed harshly when he read the telegram  evelyn was married this morning but not to lance he said  well i expect mother will be satisfied  from one point of view the marriage is good  then you know the man said jim who sympathized with dicks bitterness  i do said dick very dryly  hes rich and getting fat but on the whole i imagine hes as good a husband as evelyn deserves  i sometimes thought he wanted her and she quietly held him off it looks as if she had lost no time now  he paused and the blood came to his skin as he resumed im breaking rules this is rotten bad form but you ought to be thankful you hadnt the misfortune to marry into our family  jim put his hand on the others arm  stop it dick  you have been honest and we are friends  but i think you have said enough  then give me a drink and let me go  i need bracing the thing has knocked me off my balance  here you are said jim who went to a cupboard and dick lifted his glass  good luck jim  you are lucky you know  but if youre not a fool youll marry carrie winter  he went out and jim sat down again looking straight in front with knitted brows  he did not know how long he mused but he got up abruptly when carrie came in  she glanced at him curiously when he indicated a chair and for a few moments he stood opposite irresolute and frowning  then he gave her evelyns note  after all there is no reason you shouldnt read this he said  carrie took the note and jim thought her hand trembled when she returned it  im sorry jim  i dont want you to be sorry i want you to understand  evelyn married somebody else this morning  dick got a telegram  ah said carrie i suppose it hurt  lets be frank  it couldnt hurt my vanity because i had none left for all that i got a knock  you see i trusted evelyn and after the night on the sands felt myself a shabby cur but i meant to keep my promise  carries face flushed delicately although her voice was calm as she said i did not trust evelyn  the trouble was i couldnt warn you  yet you wanted to warn me  oh i know  you have stood between me and trouble before but this job was too big  it was not your pluck that failed you knew my obstinacy  he stopped and carrie was silent  he moved a few paces and came back  cant you speak he asked  what am i to say jim  well he said hoarsely if you wont talk you can listen  you have borne with my moods and ive got to let myself go now or be quiet for good im something of a savage but ive had to fight for all i wanted and winning made me proud  it gave me a ridiculous confidence  well i expect i reached the top of my folly when i got evelyn  then our adventure on the sands knocked me flat i knew myself a despicable fool  id taken the best you had to give let you nurse me when i was sick and cook for me in the woods  i knew your worth and chose evelyn  then when id promised to marry her i took you in my arms and kissed you  yet you meant to marry her that was rather fine jim said carrie quietly  i dont know if it was fine or not it might have made bad worse besides you showed me you would be firm although you knew i loved you  yes i did know  you made good in canada i wanted you to make good at langrigg  jim thrilled with strong emotion  oh my dear  my staunch and generous dear  but im going to put your generosity to another test i ought to have gone away and made things easier for you i ought to have waited to save your pride but it would have been too hard well im taking a horribly wrong line but i want you and you know me for what i am  if you think im too mean ill sell langrigg and go away for good  carrie got up and looked at him with steady eyes  then her face softened and she gave him a tender smile  you are rather foolish jim but you mean well and i am satisfied  he stood still for a moment as if he doubted what he had heard and she said quietly if my pride needed saving it would be very small  my dear he said and took her in his arms  a few minutes afterwards jake and mrs winter came in and jim remarked you have owned you like the old country and ive urged you to stay  when the dykes are finished we must go mrs winter replied  you are kind but we know where we belong  she stopped and looked sharply at carrie who stood by jim and smiled her color was high and her face and palegreen dress cut against the background of somber oak  her pose was graceful but proud  jim remembered her coming down the stairs on her first evening in the house she had looked like that then  somehow one felt she was there by right  if you go you must leave me she said  i belong to langrigg and jim  mrs winter advanced and kissed her and jake gave jim his hand  for a time it looked as if we were going to lose you partner  still i felt you would come back to us  i dont know if ive come back or gone forward jim rejoined  all thats important is carrie and i go on together  for half an hour they engaged in happy talk and when after dinner carrie and jim were again alone she said you have forgotten something  oughtnt we to tell bernard  of course jim agreed  somehow i think hed like it if you wrote the note  carrie sent him for a pen and soon after he came back fastened and gave him the envelope  i suppose i ought to feel nervous but i dont she said  i was never afraid of bernard  next evening bernard came to dinner  jim and his party met him in the hall but he signed the others back when carrie gave him her hand  i am the head of the house and claim my right he said and kissed her  some day jim will take my place and i think he will fill it well  carrie blushed but jim noted with a thrill of pride that she carried herself finely  he thought she understood that bernard had formally acknowledged her  it was strange to know this was the girl who had made his bread and mended his clothes in the woods but after all the difference was only in her surroundings  carrie had not changed  i dont mind confessing i plotted for this bernard resumed with a twinkle and took a leather box from his pocket  he opened the box and a row of green jewels set in rough gold sparkled in the light  my wife last wore them they were my grandmothers and date farther back he said  now they are yours and i would like you to put them on  carrie stood quiet for a moment with the jewels in her hand while her color came and went  for all that she looked calm and rather proud she remembered that bernard had not given the necklace to evelyn  i have not worn such things and i am the first of my kind to put on these stones she said  bernard bowed  brave and good women have worn them  i have studied human nature and give them to you  this is not altogether because you are going to marry jim  carrie drew the stones round her neck and fastened the clasp  the blood came to her skin and she looked strangely vivid but in a moment or two her glance became soft  you are kind and your trust means much she said  for one thing it means i must make good  jims inheritance must be managed well  we will try to rule at langrigg as his people ruled     the end
