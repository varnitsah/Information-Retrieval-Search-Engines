40451152	ships company  by ww jacobs    manners makyth man   the nightwatchman appeared to be out of sorts  his movements were even slower than usual and when he sat the soapbox seemed to be unable to give satisfaction  his face bore an expression of deep melancholy but a smouldering gleam in his eye betokened feelings deeply moved  playacting i dont hold with he burst out with sudden ferocity never did  i dont say i aint been to a theayter once or twice in my life but i always come away with the idea that anybody could act if they liked to try  its a kids game a silly kids game dressing up and pretending to be somebody else  he cut off a piece of tobacco and stowing it in his left cheek sat chewing with his lacklustre eyes fixed on the wharves across the river the offensive antics of a lighterman in midstream who nearly fell overboard in his efforts to attract his attention he ignored  i might ha known it too he said after a long silence  if id only stopped to think instead o being in such a hurry to do good to others i should ha been all right and the pack o monkeyfaced swabs on the ilizzie and anniei wot calls themselves sailormen would ave had to ave got something else to laugh about  theyve told it in every pub for arf a mile round and last night when i went into the town of margate to get a drink three chaps climbed over the partition to ave a look at me  it all began with young ted sawyer the mate o the ilizzie and anniei he calls himself a mate but if it wasnt for aving the skipper for a brotherinlaw ed be called something else very quick  two or three times weve ad words over one thing and another and the last time i called im something that i can see now was a mistake  it was one o these ere clever things that a man dont forget let alone a lopsided monkey like im  that was when they was up time afore last and when they made fast ere last week i could see as he adnt forgotten it  for one thing he pretended not to see me and arter i ad told him wot id do to him if e ran into me agin he said e thought i was a sack o potatoes taking a airing on a pair of legs wot somebody ad throwed away  nasty tongue es got not clever but nasty  arter that i took no notice of im and o course that annoyed im more than anything  all i could do i done and e was ringing the gatebell that night from five minutes to twelve till hapast afore i heard it  many a nightwatchman gets a name for going to sleep when es only getting a bit of is own back  we stood there talking for over arfanhour arter i ad letim in leastways he did  and whenever i see as he was getting tired i just said hsh and ed start agin as fresh as ever  he tumbled to it at last and went aboard shaking is little fist at me and telling me wot hed do to me if it wasnt for the lor  i kept by the gate as soon as i came on dooty next evening just to give im a little smile as e went out  there is nothing more aggravating than a smile when it is properly done but there was no signs o my lord and arter practising it on a carman by mistake i ad to go inside for a bit and wait till he ad gorn  the coast was clear by the time i went back and i ad just stepped outside with my back up agin the gatepost to ave a pipe when i see a boy coming along with a bag  goodlooking lad of about fifteen e was nicely dressed in a serge suit and he no sooner gets up to me than e puts down the bag and looks up at me with a timid sort o little smile  good evening capn he ses  he wasnt the fust that has made that mistake older people than im have done it  good evening my lad i ses  i spose he ses in a trembling voice i suppose you aint looking out for a cabinboy sir  cabinboy i ses  no i aint  ive run away from ome to go to sea he ses and im afraid of being pursued  can i come inside  afore i could say no he ad come bag and all and afore i could say anything else he ad nipped into the office and stood there with his and on his chest panting  i know i can trust you he ses i can see it by your face  wot ave you run away from ome for i ses  have they been illtreating of you  illtreating me he ses with a laugh  not much  why i expect my father is running about all over the place offering rewards for me  he wouldnt lose me for a thousand pounds  i pricked up my ears at that i dont deny it  anybody would  besides i knew it would be doing him a kindness to hand im back to is father and then i did a bit o thinking to see ow it was to be done  sit down i ses putting three or four ledgers on the floor behind one of the desks  sit down and lets talk it over  we talked away for ever so long but do all i would i couldnt persuade im  his ead was stuffed full of coral islands and smugglers and pirates and foreign ports  he said e wanted to see the world and flyingfish  i love the blue billers he ses the heaving blue billers is wot i want  i tried to explain to im who would be doing the heaving but e wouldnt listen to me  he sat on them ledgers like a little wooden image looking up at me and shaking his ead and when i told im of storms and shipwrecks he just smacked is lips and his blue eyes shone with joy  arter a time i saw it was no good trying to persuade im and i pretended to give way  i think i can get you a ship with a friend o mine i ses but mind ive got to relieve your pore fathers mindi must let im know wots become of you  not before ive sailed he ses very quick  certingly not i ses  but you must give me is name and address and arter the blue sharkthats the name of your shipis clear of the land ill send im a letter with no name to it saying where you ave gorn  he didnt seem to like it at fust and said e would write imself but arter i ad pointed out that e might forget and that i was responsible e gave way and told me that is father was named mr watson and he kept a big drapers shop in the commercial road  we talked a bit arter that just to stop is suspicions and then i told im to stay where e was on the floor out of sight of the window while i went to see my friend the captain  i stood outside for a moment trying to make up my mind wot to do ocourse i ad no business strictly speaking to leave the wharf but on the other and there was a fathers art to relieve  i edged along bit by bit while i was thinking and then arter looking back once or twice to make sure that the boy wasnt watching me i set off for the commercial road as hard as i could go  im not so young as i was  it was a warm evening and i adnt got even a bus fare on me  i ad to walk all the way and by the time i got there i was arf melted  it was a tidysized shop with three or four nicelooking gals behind the counter and things like babies high chairs for the customers to sit onlong in the leg and ridikerlously small in the seat  i went up to one of the gals and told per i wanted to see mr watson  on private business i ses  very important  she looked at me for a moment and then she went away and fetched a tall baldheaded man with grey sidewhiskers and a large nose  wot dyou want  he ses coming up to me  i want a word with you in private i ses  this is private enough for me he ses  say wot you ave to say and be quick about it  i drawed myself up a bit and looked at him  praps you aint missed im yet i ses  missed im he ses with a growl  missed who  yourson  your blueeyed son i ses looking im straight in the eye  look here he ses spluttering  you be off  ow dare you come here with your games  wot dye mean by it  i mean i ses getting a bit out o temper that your boy has run away to go to sea and ive come to take you to im  he seemed so upset that i thought e was going to ave a fit at fust and it seemed only natural too  then i see that the bestlooking girl and another was having a fit although trying ard not to  if you dont get out o my shop he ses at last ill ave you locked up  very good i ses in a quiet way  very good but mark my words if hes drownded youll never forgive yourself as long as you live for letting your temper get the better of youyoull never know a good nights rest agin  besides wot about is mother  one o them silly gals went off agin just like a damp firework and mr watson arter nearly choking imself with temper shoved me out o the way and marched out o the shop  i didnt know wot to make of im at fust and then one o the gals told me that e was a bachelor and adnt got no son and that somebody ad been taking advantage of what she called my innercence to pull my leg  you toddle off ome she ses before mr watson comes back  its a shame to let im come out alone ses one o the other gals where do you live granpa  i see then that i ad been done and i was just walking out o the shop pretending to be deaf when mr watson come back with a silly young policeman wot asked me wot i meant by it  he told me to get off ome quick and actually put his and on my shoulder but it ud take more than a thing like that to push me and arter trying his ardest he could only rock me a bit  i went at last because i wanted to see that boy agin and the young policeman follered me quite a long way shaking his silly ead at me and telling me to be careful  i got a ride part o the way from commercial road to aldgate by getting on the wrong bus but it wasnt much good and i was quite tired by the time i got back to the wharf  i waited outside for a minute or two to get my wind back agin and then i went inboiling  you might ha knocked me down with a feather as the saying is and i just stood inside the office speechless  the boy ad disappeared and sitting on the floor where i ad left im was a very nicelooking gal of about eighteen with short air and a white blouse  good evening sir she ses jumping up and giving me a pretty little frightened look  im so sorry that my brother has been deceiving you hes a bad wicked ungrateful boy  the idea of telling you that mr watson was is father  have you been there  i do ope youre not tired  where is he i ses  hes gorn she ses shaking her ead  i begged and prayed of im to stop but e wouldnt  he said e thought you might be offended with im  give my love to old roleypoley and tell him i dont trust im he ses  she stood there looking so scared that i didnt know wot to say  by and by she took out er little pocketankercher and began to cry  oh get im back she ses  dont let it be said i follered im ere all the way for nothing  have another try  for my sake  ow can i get im back when i dont know where hes gorn i ses  hehes gorn to is godfather she ses dabbing her eyes  i promised im not to tell anybody but i dont know wot to do for the best  well praps his godfather will old on to im i ses  he wont tell im anything about going to sea she ses shaking er little head  hes just gorn to try and boboborrow some money to go away with  she bust out sobbing and it was all i could do to get the godfathers address out of er  when i think of the trouble i took to get it i come over quite faint  at last she told me between er sobs that is name was mr kiddem and that he lived at 27 bridge street  hes one o the kindestarted and most generous men that ever lived she ses thats why my brother harry as gone to im  and you neednt mind taking anything e likes to give you hes rolling in money  i took it a bit easier going to bridge street but the evening seemed otter than ever and by the time i got to the ouse i was pretty near done up  a nice tidylooking woman opened the door but she was a most stone deaf and i ad to shout the name pretty near a dozen times afore she eard it  he dont live ere she ses  as he moved i ses  or wot  she shook her cad and arter telling me to wait went in and fetched her usband  never eard of him he ses and weve been ere seventeen years  are you sure it was twentyseven  sartain i ses  well he dont live ere he ses  why not try thirtyseven and fortyseven  i triedem thirtyseven was empty and a pastyfaced chap at forty seven nearly made imself ill over the name of kiddem  it adnt struck me before but its a hard matter to deceive me and all in a flash it come over me that i ad been done agin and that the gal was as bad as er brother  i was so done up i could ardly crawl back and my ead was all in a maze  three or four times i stopped and tried to think but couldnt but at last i got back and dragged myself into the office  as i arf expected it was empty  there was no sign of either the gal or the boy and i dropped into a chair and tried to think wot it all meant  then appening to look out of the winder i see somebody running up and down the jetty  i couldnt see plain owing to the things in the way but as soon as i got outside and saw who it was i nearly dropped  it was the boy and he was running up and down wringing his ands and crying like a wild thing and instead o running away as soon as e saw me he rushed right up to me and threw is grubby little paws round my neck  save her e ses  save er  help  help  look ere i ses shoving im off  she fell overboard he ses dancing about  oh my pore sister quick  quick  i cant swim  he ran to the side and pointed at the water which was just about at arftide  then e caught old of me agin  make aste he ses giving me a shove behind  jump in  wot are you waiting for  i stood there for a moment arf dazed looking down at the water  then i pulled down a lifebelt from the wall ere and threw it in and arter another moments thought ran back to the ilizzie and anniei wot was in the inside berth and gave them a hail  ive always ad a good voice and in a flash the skipper and ted sawyer came tumbling up out of the cabin and the ands out of the focsle  gal overboard i ses shouting  the skipper just asked where and then im and the mate and a couple of ands tumbled into their boat and pulled under the jetty for all they was worth  me and the boy ran back and stood with the others watching  point out the exact spot ses the skipper  the boy pointed and the skipper stood up in the boat and felt round with a boathook  twice e said he thought e touched something but it turned out as e was mistaken  his face got longer and longer and e shook his ead and said he was afraid it was no good  dont stand cryin ere he ses to the boy kindly  jem run round for the thames police and get them and the drags  take the boy with you  itll occupy is mind  he ad another go with the boathook arter they ad gone then e gave it up and sat in the boat waiting  thisll be a bad job for you watchman he ses shaking his ead where was you when it appened  hes been missing all the evening ses the cook wot was standing beside me  if hed been doing is dooty the pore gal wouldnt ave been drownded  wot was she doing on the wharf  skylarkin i spose ses the mate  its a wonder there aint more drownded  wot can you expect when the watchman is sitting in a pub all the evening  the cook said i ought to be ung and a young ordinary seaman wot was standing beside im said he would sooner i was boiled  i believe they ad words about it but i was feeling too upset to take much notice  looking miserable wont bring er back to life agin ses the skipper looking up at me and shaking his ead  youd better go down to my cabin and get yourself a drop o whisky theres a bottle on the table  youll want all your wits about you when the police come  and wotever you do dont say nothing to criminate yourself  well do the criminating for im all right ses the cook  if i was the pore gal id haunt im ses the ordinary seaman every night of is life id stand afore im dripping with water and moaning  praps she will ses the cook lets ope so at any rate  i didnt answer em i was too deadbeat  besides which ive got a orror of ghosts and the idea of being on the wharf alone of a night arter such a thing was amost too much for me  i went on board the ilizzie and anniei and down in the cabin i found a bottle o whisky as the skipper ad said  i sat down on the locker and ad a glass and then i sat worrying and wondering wot was to be the end of it all  the whisky warmed me up a bit and i ad just taken up the bottle to elp myself agin when i eard a faint sort o sound in the skippers stateroom  i put the bottle down and listened but everything seemed deathly still  i took it up agin and ad just poured out a drop o whisky when i distinctly eard a hissing noise and then a little moan  for a moment i sat turned to stone  then i put the bottle down quiet and ad just got up to go when the door of the stateroom opened and i saw the drownded gal with er little face and hair all wet and dripping standing before me  ted sawyer as been telling everybody that i came up the companionway like a foghorn that ad lost its ma i wonder how hed ave come up if hed ad the evening i had ad  they were all on the jetty as i got there and tumbled into the skippers arms and all asking at once wot was the matter  when i got my breath back a bit and told em they laughed  all except the cook and e said it was only wot i might expect  then like a man in a dream i see the gal come out of the companion and walk slowly to the side  look i ses  look  there she is  youre dreaming ses the skipper theres nothing there  they all said the same even when the gal stepped on to the side and climbed on to the wharf  she came along towards me with er arms held close to er sides and making the most orrible faces at me and it took five ofem all their time to old me  the wharf and everything seemed to me to spin round and round  then she came straight up to me and patted me on the cheek  pore old gentleman she ses  wot a shame it is ted  its too bad  they let go o me then and stamped up and down the jetty laughing fit to kill themselves  if they ad only known wot a exhibition they was making of themselves and ow i pitied them they wouldnt ha done it and by and by ted wiped his eyes and put his arm round the gals waist and ses  this is my intended miss florrie price he ses  aint she a little wonder  wot dye think of er  ill keep my own opinion i ses  i aint got nothing to say against gals but if i only lay my hands on that young brother of ers  they went off agin then worse than ever and at last the cook came and put is skinny arm round my neck and started spluttering in my ear  i shoved im off hard because i see it all then and i should ha seen it afore only i didnt ave time to think  i dont bear no malice and all i can say is that i dont wish er any harder punishment than to be married to ted sawyer
