10283733	the queen of the pirate isle  by bret harte    i first knew her as the queen of the pirate isle to the best of my recollection she had no reasonable right to that title she was only nine years old inclined to plumpness and good humor deprecated violence and had never been to sea need it be added that she did not live in an island and that her name was polly  perhaps i ought to explain that she had already known other experiences of a purely imaginative character part of her existence had been passed as a beggar childsolely indicated by a shawl tightly folded round her shoulders and chills as a schoolmistress unnecessarily severe as a preacher singularly personal in his remarks and once after reading one of coopers novels as an indian maiden this was i believe the only instance when she had borrowed from anothers fiction most of the characters that she assumed for days and sometimes weeks at a time were purely original in conception some so much so as to be vague to the general understanding i remember that her personation of a certain mrs smith whose individuality was supposed to be sufficiently represented by a sunbonnet worn wrong side before and a weekly addition to her family was never perfectly appreciated by her own circle although she lived the character for a month another creation known as the proud ladya being whose excessive and unreasonable haughtiness was so pronounced as to give her features the expression of extreme nauseacaused her mother so much alarm that it had to be abandoned this was easily effected the proud lady was understood to have died indeed most of pollys impersonations were got rid of in this way although it by no means prevented their subsequent reappearance i thought mrs smith was dead remonstrated her mother at the posthumous appearance of that lady with a new infant she was buried alive and kem to said polly with a melancholy air fortunately the representation of a resuscitated person required such extraordinary acting and was through some uncertainty of conception so closely allied in facial expression to the proud lady that mrs smith was resuscitated only for a day  the origin of the title of the queen of the pirate isle may be briefly stated as follows  an hour after luncheon one day polly hickory hunt her cousin and wan lee a chinese page were crossing the nursery floor in a chinese junk the sea was calm and the sky cloudless any change in the weather was as unexpected as it is in books suddenly a west indian hurricane purely local in character and unfelt anywhere else struck master hickory and threw him overboard whence wildly swimming for his life and carrying polly on his back he eventually reached a desert island in the closet here the rescued party put up a tent made of a tablecloth providentially snatched from the raging billows and from two oclock until four passed six weeks on the island supported only by a piece of candle a box of matches and two peppermint lozenges it was at this time that it became necessary to account for pollys existence among them and this was only effected by an alarming sacrifice of their morality hickory and wan lee instantly became pirates and at once elected polly as their queen the royal duties which seemed to be purely maternal consisted in putting the pirates to bed after a day of rapine and bloodshed and in feeding them with licorice water through a quill in a small bottle limited as her functions were polly performed them with inimitable gravity and unquestioned sincerity even when her companions sometimes hesitated from actual hunger or fatigue and forgot their guilty part she never faltered it was her real existence her other life of being washed dressed and put to bed at certain hours by her mother was the illusion  doubt and skepticism came at lastand came from wan lee wan lee of all creatures wan lee whose silent stolid mechanical performance of a pirates dutiesa perfect imitation like all his household workhad been their one delight and fascination  it was just after the exciting capture of a merchantman with the indiscriminate slaughter of all on boarda spectacle on which the round blue eyes of the plump polly had gazed with royal and maternal toleranceand they were burying the booty two tablespoons and a thimble in the corner of the closet when wan lee stolidly rose  melican boy pleenty foolee melican boy no pilat said the little chinaman substituting ls for rs after his usual fashion  wotcher say said hickory reddening with sudden confusion  melican boys papa heap lickee himspose him leal pilat continued wan lee doggedly melican boy pilat inside housee chinee boy pilat outside housee first chop pilat  staggered by this humiliating statement hickory recovered himself in character ah ho he shrieked dancing wildly on one leg mutiny and splordinashun way with him to the yardarm  yaldalmheap foolee alee same clotheshorse for washee washee  it was here necessary for the pirate queen to assert her authority which as i have before stated was somewhat confusingly maternal  go to bed instantly without your supper she said seriously really i never saw such bad pirates say your prayers and see that youre up early to church tomorrow  it should be explained that in deference to pollys proficiency as a preacher and probably as a relief to their uneasy consciences divine service had always been held on the island but wan lee continued  me no shabbee pilat inside housee me shabbee pilat outside housee spose you lun away longside chinee boychinee boy make you pilat  hickory softly scratched his leg while a broad bashful smile almost closed his small eyes wot he asked  mebbe you too flightened to lun away melican boys papa heap lickee  this last infamous suggestion fired the corsairs blood dyar think we daresent said hickory desperately but with an uneasy glance at polly ill show yer tomorrow  the entrance of pollys mother at this moment put an end to pollys authority and dispersed the pirate band but left wan lees proposal and hickorys rash acceptance ringing in the ears of the pirate queen that evening she was unusually silent she would have taken bridget her nurse into her confidence but this would have involved a long explanation of her own feelings from which like all imaginative children she shrank she however made preparation for the proposed flight by settling in her mind which of her two dolls she would take a wooden creature with easygoing knees and movable hair seemed to be more fit for hard service and any indiscriminate scalping that might turn up hereafter at supper she timidly asked a question of bridget did ye ever hear the loikes uv that maam said the irish handmaid with affectionate pride shure the darlints head is filled noight and day with ancient history shes after asking me now if queens ever run away to pollys remorseful confusion here her good father equally proud of her precocious interest and his own knowledge at once interfered with an unintelligible account of the abdication of various queens in history until pollys head ached again well meant as it was it only settled in the childs mind that she must keep the awful secret to herself and that no one could understand her  the eventful day dawned without any unusual sign of importance it was one of the cloudless summer days of the californian foothills bright dry and as the morning advanced hot in the white sunshine the actual prosaic house in which the pirates apparently lived was a mile from a mining settlement on a beautiful ridge of pine woods sloping gently towards a valley on the one side and on the other falling abruptly into a dark deep olive gulf of pinetrees rocks and patches of red soil beautiful as the slope was looking over to the distant snow peaks which seemed to be in another world than theirs the children found a greater attraction in the fascinating depths of a mysterious gulf or canyon as it was called whose very name filled their ears with a weird music to creep to the edge of the cliff to sit upon the brown branches of some fallen pine and putting aside the dried tassels to look down upon the backs of wheeling hawks that seemed to hang in midair was a neverfailing delight here polly would try to trace the winding red ribbon of road that was continually losing itself among the dense pines of the opposite mountains here she would listen to the faroff strokes of a woodmans axe or the rattle of some heavy wagon miles away crossing the pebbles of a driedup watercourse here too the prevailing colors of the mountains red and white and green most showed themselves there were no frowning rocks to depress the childrens fancy but everywhere along the ridge pure white quartz bared itself through the red earth like smiling teeth the very pebbles they played with were streaked with shining mica like bits of lookingglass the distance was always green and summerlike but the color they most loved and which was most familiar to them was the dark red of the ground beneath their feet everywhere it showed itself in the roadside bushes its red dust pervaded the leaves of the overhanging laurel it colored their shoes and pinafores i am afraid it was often seen in indianlike patches on their faces and hands that it may have often given a sanguinary tone to their fancies i have every reason to believe  it was on this ridge that the three children gathered at ten oclock that morning an earlier flight had been impossible on account of wan lee being obliged to perform his regular duty of blacking the shoes of polly and hickory before breakfasta menial act which in the pure republic of childhood was never thought inconsistent with the loftiest piratical ambition on the ridge they met one patsey the son of a neighbor sunburned broadbrimmed hatted redhanded like themselves as there were afterwards some doubts expressed whether he joined the pirates of his own free will or was captured by them i endeavor to give the colloquy exactly as it occurred  patsey hallo fellers  the pirates hello  patsey goin to hunt bars dad seed a lot o tracks at sunup  the pirates hesitating noo  patsey i am know where i kin get a sixshooter  the pirates almost ready to abandon piracy for bearhunting but preserving their dignity cant weve runnd away for real pirates  patsey not for good  the queen interposing with sad dignity and real tears in her round blue eyes yes slowly and shaking her head cant go back again never never never thetheeye is cast  patsey bursting with excitement noo shoo wanter know  the pirates a little frightened themselves but tremulous with gratified vanity the perleese is on our track  patsey lemme go with yer  hickory wotll yer giv  patsey pistol and er bananer  hickory with judicious prudence lets see em  patsey was off like a shot his bare little red feet trembling under him in a few minutes he returned with an oldfashioned revolver known as one of allens pepperboxes and a large banana he was at once enrolled and the banana eaten  as yet they had resolved on no definite nefarious plan hickory looking down at patseys bare feet instantly took off his own shoes this bold act sent a thrill through his companions wan lee took off his cloth leggings polly removed her shoes and stockings but with royal foresight tied them up in her handkerchief the last link between them and civilization was broken  lets go to the slumgullion  slumgullion was the name given by the miners to a certain soft halfliquid mud formed of the water and finely powdered earth that was carried off by the sluiceboxes during goldwashing and eventually collected in a broad pool or lagoon before the outlet there was a pool of this kind a quarter of a mile away where there were diggings worked by patseys father and thither they proceeded along the ridge in single file when it was reached they solemnly began to wade in its viscid paintlike shallows possibly its unctuousness was pleasant to the touch possibly there was a fascination in the fact that their parents had forbidden them to go near it but probably the principal object of this performance was to produce a thick coating of mud on the feet and ankles which when dried in the sun was supposed to harden the skin and render their shoes superfluous it was also felt to be the first real step towards independence they looked down at their ensanguined extremities and recognized the impossibility of their ever again crossing unwashed the family threshold  then they again hesitated there was a manifest need of some welldefined piratical purpose the last act was reckless and irretrievable but it was vague they gazed at each other there was a stolid look of resigned and superior tolerance in wan lees eyes  pollys glance wandered down the side of the slope to the distant little tunnels or openings made by the miners who were at work in the bowels of the mountain id like to go into one of them funny holes she said to herself half aloud  wan lee suddenly began to blink his eyes with unwonted excitement catchee tunnelheap gold he said quickly when manee come outside to catchee dinnerpilats go inside catchee tunnel shabbee pilats catchee gold allee samee melican man  and take perseshiun said hickory  and hoist the pirate flag said patsey  and build a fire and cook and have a family said polly  the idea was fascinating to the point of being irresistible the eyes of the four children became rounder and rounder they seized each others hands and swung them backwards and forwards occasionally lifting their legs in a solemn rhythmic movement known only to childhood  its orful far off said patsey with a sudden look of dark importance pap says its free miles on the road take all day ter get there  the bright faces were overcast  less go down er slide said hickory boldly  they approached the edge of the cliff the slide was simply a sharp incline zigzagging down the side of the mountain used for sliding goods and provisions from the summit to the tunnelmen at the different openings below the continual traffic had gradually worn a shallow gully half filled with earth and gravel into the face of the mountain which checked the momentum of the goods in their downward passage but afforded no foothold for a pedestrian no one had ever been known to descend a slide that feat was evidently reserved for the pirate band they approached the edge of the slide hand in hand hesitated and the next moment disappeared  five minutes later the tunnelmen of the excelsior mine a mile below taking their luncheon on the rude platform of debris before their tunnel were suddenly driven to shelter in the tunnel from an apparent rain of stones and rocks and pebbles from the cliffs above looking up they were startled at seeing four round objects revolving and bounding in the dust of the slide which eventually resolved themselves into three boys and a girl for a moment the good men held their breath in helpless terror twice one of the children had struck the outer edge of the bank and displaced stones that shot a thousand feet down into the dizzy depths of the valley and now one of them the girl had actually rolled out of the slide and was hanging over the chasm supported only by a clump of chamisal to which she clung  hang on by your eyelids sis but dont stir for heavens sake shouted one of the men as two others started on a hopeless ascent of the cliff above them  but a light childish laugh from the clinging little figure seemed to mock them then two small heads appeared at the edge of the slide then a diminutive figure whose feet were apparently held by some invisible companion was shoved over the brink and stretched its tiny arms towards the girl but in vain the distance was too great another laugh of intense youthful enjoyment followed the failure and a new insecurity was added to the situation by the unsteady hands and shoulders of the relieving party who were apparently shaking with laughter then the extended figure was seen to detach what looked like a small black rope from its shoulders and throw it to the girl there was another little giggle the faces of the men below paled in terror then pollyfor it was shehanging to the long pigtail of wan lee was drawn with fits of laughter back in safety to the slide their childish treble of appreciation was answered by a ringing cheer from below  darned ef i ever want to cut off a chinamans pigtail again boys said one of the tunnelmen as he went back to dinner  meantime the children had reached the goal and stood before the opening of one of the tunnels then these four heroes who had looked with cheerful levity on the deadly peril of their descent became suddenly frightened at the mysterious darkness of the cavern and turned pale at its threshold  mebbee a wicked joss backside holee he catchee pilats said wan lee gravely  hickory began to whimper patsey drew back polly alone stood her ground albeit with a trembling lip  lets say our prayers and frighten it away she said stoutly  no no said wan lee with a sudden alarm no frighten spillits you waitee chinee boy he talkee spillit not to frighten you        the chinese pray devoutly to the evil spirits not to      injure them  tucking his hands under his blue blouse wan lee suddenly produced from some mysterious recess of his clothing a quantity of red paper slips which he scattered at the entrance of the cavern then drawing from the same inexhaustible receptacle certain squibs or fireworks he let them off and threw them into the opening there they went off with a slight fizz and splutter a momentary glittering of small points in the darkness and a strong smell of gunpowder polly gazed at the spectacle with undisguised awe and fascination hickory and patsey breathed hard with satisfaction it was beyond their wildest dreams of mystery and romance even wan lee appeared transfigured into a superior being by the potency of his own spells but an unaccountable disturbance of some kind in the dim interior of the tunnel quickly drew the blood from their blanched cheeks again it was a sound like coughing followed by something like an oath  hes made the evil spirit orful sick said hickory in a loud whisper  a slight laugh that to the children seemed demoniacal followed  see said wan lee evil spillet he likee chinee try talkee him  the pirates looked at wan lee not without a certain envy of this manifest favoritism a fearful desire to continue their awful experiments instead of pursuing their piratical avocations was taking possession of them but polly with one of the swift transitions of childhood immediately began to extemporize a house for the party at the mouth of the tunnel and with parental foresight gathered the fragments of the squibs to build a fire for supper that frugal meal consisting of half a ginger biscuit divided into five small portions each served on a chip of wood and having a deliciously mysterious flavor of gunpowder and smoke was soon over it was necessary after this that the pirates should at once seek repose after a day of adventure which they did for the space of forty seconds in singularly impossible attitudes and far too aggressive snoring indeed master hickorys almost upright pose with tightly folded arms and darkly frowning brows was felt to be dramatic but impossible for a longer period the brief interval enabled polly to collect herself and to look around her in her usual motherly fashion suddenly she started and uttered a cry in the excitement of the descent she had quite overlooked her doll and was now regarding it with roundeyed horror  lady marys hairs gone she cried convulsively grasping the pirate hickorys legs  hickory at once recognized the battered doll under the aristocratic title which polly had long ago bestowed upon it he stared at the bald and battered head  ha ha he said hoarsely skelped by injins  for an instant the delicious suggestion soothed the imaginative polly but it was quickly dispelled by wan lee  lady maleys pigtail hangee top side hillee catchee on big quartz stone allee same polly me go fetchee  no quickly shrieked the others the prospect of being left in the proximity of wan lees evil spirit without wan lees exorcising power was anything but reassuring no dont go even polly dropping a maternal tear on the bald head of lady mary protested against this breaking up of the little circle go to bed she said authoritatively and sleep till morning  thus admonished the pirates again retired this time effectively for worn by actual fatigue or soothed by the delicious coolness of the cave they gradually one by one succumbed to real slumber polly withheld from joining them by official and maternal responsibility sat and blinked at them affectionately  gradually she too felt herself yielding to the fascination and mystery of the place and the solitude that encompassed her beyond the pleasant shadows where she sat she saw the great world of mountain and valley through a dreamy haze that seemed to rise from the depths below and occasionally hang before the cavern like a veil long waves of spicy heat rolling up the mountain from the valley brought her the smell of pinetrees and bay and made the landscape swim before her eyes she could hear the faroff cry of teamsters on some unseen road she could see the faroff cloud of dust following the mountain stagecoach whose rattling wheels she could not hear she felt very lonely but was not quite afraid she felt very melancholy but was not entirely sad and she could have easily awakened her sleeping companions if she wished  no she was a lone widow with nine children six of whom were already in the lone churchyard on the hill and the others lying ill with measles and scarlet fever beside her she had just walked many weary miles that day and had often begged from door to door for a slice of bread for the starving little ones it was of no use nowthey would die they would never see their dear mother again this was a favorite imaginative situation of pollys but only indulged when her companions were asleep partly because she could not trust confederates with her more serious fancies and partly because they were at such times passive in her hands she glanced timidly around satisfied that no one could observe her she softly visited the bedside of each of her companions and administered from a purely fictitious bottle spoonfuls of invisible medicine physical correction in the form of slight taps which they always required and in which polly was strong was only withheld now from a sense of their weak condition but in vain they succumbed to the fell diseasethey always died at this junctureand polly was left alone she thought of the little church where she had once seen a funeral and remembered the nice smell of the flowers she dwelt with melancholy satisfaction of the nine little tombstones in the graveyard each with an inscription and looked forward with gentle anticipation to the long summer days when with lady mary in her lap she would sit on those graves clad in the deepest mourning the fact that the unhappy victims at times moved as it were uneasily in their graves or snored did not affect pollys imaginative contemplation nor withhold the tears that gathered in her round eyes  presently the lids of the round eyes began to droop the landscape beyond began to be more confused and sometimes to disappear entirely and reappear again with startling distinctness then a sound of rippling water from the little stream that flowed from the mouth of the tunnel soothed her and seemed to carry her away with it and then everything was dark  the next thing that she remembered was that she was apparently being carried along on some gliding object to the sound of rippling water she was not alone for her three companions were lying beside her rather tightly packed and squeezed in the same mysterious vehicle even in the profound darkness that surrounded her polly could feel and hear that they were accompanied and once or twice a faint streak of light from the side of the tunnel showed her gigantic shadows walking slowly on either side of the gliding car she felt the little hands of her associates seeking hers and knew they were awake and conscious and she returned to each a reassuring pressure from the large protecting instinct of her maternal little heart presently the car glided into an open space of bright light and stopped the transition from the darkness of the tunnel at first dazzled their eyes it was like a dream  they were in a circular cavern from which three other tunnels like the one they had passed through diverged the walls lit up by fifty or sixty candles stuck at irregular intervals in crevices of the rock were of glittering quartz and mica but more remarkable than all were the inmates of the cavern who were ranged round the wallsmen who like their attendants seemed to be of extra stature who had blackened faces wore red bandana handkerchiefs round their heads and their waists and carried enormous knives and pistols stuck in their belts on a raised platform made of a packingbox on which was rudely painted a skull and crossbones sat the chief or leader of the band covered with a buffalo robe on either side of him were two small barrels marked grog and gunpowder the children stared and clung closer to polly yet in spite of these desperate and warlike accessories the strangers bore a singular resemblance to christy minstrels in their blackened faces and attitudes that somehow made them seem less awful in particular polly was impressed with the fact that even the most ferocious had a certain kindliness of eye and showed their teeth almost idiotically  welcome said the leaderwelcome to the pirates cave the red rover of the north fork of the stanislaus river salutes the queen of the pirate isle he rose up and made an extraordinary bow it was repeated by the others with more or less exaggeration to the point of one humorist losing his balance  oh thank you very much said polly timidly but drawing her little flock closer to her with a small protecting arm but could youwould youpleasetell uswhat time it is  we are approaching the middle of next week said the leader gravely but what of that time is made for slaves the red rover seeks it not why should the queen  i think we must be going hesitated polly yet by no means displeased with the recognition of her rank  not until we have paid homage to your majesty returned the leader what ho there let brother stepandfetchit pass the queen around that we may do her honor observing that polly shrank slightly back he added fear nothing the man who hurts a hair of her majestys head dies by this hand ah ha  the others all said ha ha and danced alternately on one leg and then on the other but always with the same dark resemblance to christy minstrels brother stepandfetchit whose very long beard had a confusing suggestion of being a part of the leaders buffalo robe lifted her gently in his arms and carried her to the red rovers in turn each one bestowed a kiss upon her cheek or forehead and would have taken her in his arms or on his knees or otherwise lingered over his salute but they were sternly restrained by their leader when the solemn rite was concluded stepandfetchit paid his own courtesy with an extra squeeze of the curly head and deposited her again in the truck a little frightened a little astonished but with a considerable accession to her dignity hickory and patsey looked on with stupefied amazement wan lee alone remained stolid and unimpressed regarding the scene with calm and triangular eyes  will your majesty see the red rovers dance  no if you please said polly with gentle seriousness  will your majesty fire this barrel of gunpowder or tap this breaker of grog  no i thank you  is there no command your majesty would lay upon us  no please said polly in a failing voice  is there anything your majesty has lost think again will your majesty deign to cast your royal eyes on this  he drew from under his buffalo robe what seemed like a long tress of blond hair and held it aloft polly instantly recognized the missing scalp of her hapless doll  if you please sir its lady marys shes lost it  and lost ityour majestyonly to find something more precious would your majesty hear the story  a little alarmed a little curious a little selfanxious and a little induced by the nudges and pinches of her companions the queen blushingly signified her royal assent  enough bring refreshments will your majesty prefer wintergreen peppermint rose or acidulated drops red or white or perhaps your majesty will let me recommend these bullseyes said the leader as a collection of sweets in a hat were suddenly produced from the barrel labeled gunpowder and handed to the children  listen he continued in a silence broken only by the gentle sucking of bullseyes many years ago the old red rovers of these parts locked up all their treasures in a secret cavern in this mountain they used spells and magic to keep it from being entered or found by anybody for there was a certain mark upon it made by a peculiar rock that stuck out of it which signified what there was below long afterwards other red rovers who had heard of it came here and spent days and days trying to discover it digging holes and blasting tunnels like this but of no use sometimes they thought they discovered the magic marks in the peculiar rock that stuck out of it but when they dug there they found no treasure and why because there was a magic spell upon it and what was that magic spell why this it could only be discovered by a person who could not possibly know that he or she had discovered it who never could or would be able to enjoy it who could never see it never feel it never in fact know anything at all about it it wasnt a dead man it wasnt an animal it wasnt a baby  why said polly jumping up and clapping her hands it was a dolly  your majestys head is level your majesty has guessed it said the leader gravely it was your majestys own dolly lady mary who broke the spell when your majesty came down the slide the doll fell from your gracious hand when your foot slipped your majesty recovered lady mary but did not observe that her hair had caught in a peculiar rock called the outcrop and remained behind when later on while sitting with your attendants at the mouth of the tunnel your majesty discovered that lady marys hair was gone i overheard your majesty and dispatched the trusty stepandfetchit to seek it at the mountain side he did so and found it clinging to the rock and beneath itthe entrance to the secret cave  patsey and hickory who failing to understand a word of this explanation had given themselves up to the unconstrained enjoyment of the sweets began now to apprehend that some change was impending and prepared for the worst by hastily swallowing what they had in their mouths thus defying enchantment and getting ready for speech polly who had closely followed the story albeit with the embellishments of her own imagination made her eyes rounder than ever a bland smile broke on wan lees face as to the childrens amazement he quietly disengaged himself from the group and stepped before the leader  melican man plenty foolee melican chillern no foolee china boy china boy knowee you you no led lofer you no pilatyou allee same tunnelmanyou bob johnson me shabbee you you dressee up allee same as led loferbut you bob johnsonallee same my fader washee washee for you you no payee him you owee him folty dolla me blingee you billee you no payee billee you say chalkee up john you say bimeby john but me no catchee folty dolla  a roar of laughter followed in which even the leader apparently forgot himself enough to join but the next moment springing to his feet he shouted ho ho a traitor away with him to the deepest dungeon beneath the castle moat  hickory and patsey began to whimper but polly albeit with a tremulous lip stepped to the side of her little pagan friend dont you dare touch him she said with a shake of unexpected determination in her little curly head if you do ill tell my father and he will slay you all of youthere  your father then you are not the queen  it was a sore struggle to polly to abdicate her royal position it was harder to do it with befitting dignity to evade the direct question she was obliged to abandon her defiant attitude if you please sir she said hurriedly with an increasing color and no stops were not always pirates you know and wan lee is only our boy what brushes my shoes in the morning and runs of errands and he doesnt mean anything bad sir and wed like to take him back home with us  enough said the leader changing his entire manner with the most sudden and shameless inconsistency you shall go back together and woe betide the miscreant who would prevent it what say you brothers what shall be his fate who dares to separate our noble queen from her faithful chinese henchman  he shall die roared the others with beaming cheerfulness  and what say youshall we see them home  we will roared the others  before the children could fairly comprehend what had passed they were again lifted into the truck and began to glide back into the tunnel they had just quitted but not again in darkness and silence the entire band of red rovers accompanied them illuminating the dark passage with the candles they had snatched from the walls in a few moments they were at the entrance again the great world lay beyond them once more with rocks and valleys suffused by the rosy light of the setting sun the past seemed like a dream  but were they really awake now they could not tell they accepted everything with the confidence and credulity of all children who have no experience to compare with their first impressions and to whom the future contains nothing impossible it was without surprise therefore that they felt themselves lifted on the shoulders of the men who were making quite a procession along the steep trail towards the settlement again polly noticed that at the mouth of the other tunnels they were greeted by men as if they were carrying tidings of great joy that they stopped to rejoice together and that in some mysterious manner their conductors had got their faces washed and had become more like beings of the outer world when they neared the settlement the excitement seemed to have become greater people rushed out to shake hands with the men who were carrying them and overpowered even the children with questions they could not understand only one sentence polly could clearly remember as being the burden of all congratulations struck the old lead at last with a faint consciousness that she knew something about it she tried to assume a dignified attitude on the leaders shoulders even while she was beginning to be heavy with sleep  and then she remembered a crowd near her fathers house out of which her father came smiling pleasantly on her but not interfering with her triumphal progress until the leader finally deposited her in her mothers lap in their own sittingroom and then she remembered being cross and declining to answer any questions and shortly afterwards found herself comfortably in bed then she heard her mother say to her father  it really seems too ridiculous for anything john the idea of those grown men dressing themselves up to play with children  ridiculous or not said her father these grown men of the excelsior mine have just struck the famous old lode of red mountain which is as good as a fortune to everybody on the ridge and were as wild as boys and they say it never would have been found if polly hadnt tumbled over the slide directly on top of the outcrop and left the absurd wig of that wretched doll of hers to mark its site  and that murmured polly sleepily to her doll as she drew it closer to her breast is all that they know of it
