75670657	forsyte saga  complete   by john galsworthy        ed note the spelling conforms to the original ss instead of our      zs and cs where we would have ss and our in colour      and flavour many interesting double consonants etc   contents       part 1 the man of property       part 2 indian summer of a forsyte              in chancery       part 3 awakening              to let       the man of property         to my wife       i dedicate the forsyte saga in its entirety      believing it to be of all my works the least      unworthy of one without whose encouragement      sympathy and criticism i could never have      become even such a writer as i am     preface  the forsyte saga was the title originally destined for that part of it which is called the man of property and to adopt it for the collected chronicles of the forsyte family has indulged the forsytean tenacity that is in all of us the word saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages but it is used with a suitable irony and after all this long tale though it may deal with folk in frock coats furbelows and a giltedged period is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict discounting for the gigantic stature and bloodthirstiness of old days as they have come down to us in fairytale and legend the folk of the old sagas were forsytes assuredly in their possessive instincts and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as swithin soames or even young jolyon and if heroic figures in days that never were seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a forsyte of the victorian era we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day for all the recent efforts to talk them out  so many people have written and claimed that their families were the originals of the forsytes that one has been almost encouraged to believe in the typicality of an imagined species manners change and modes evolve and timothys on the bayswater road becomes a nest of the unbelievable in all except essentials we shall not look upon its like again nor perhaps on such a one as james or old jolyon and yet the figures of insurance societies and the utterances of judges reassure us daily that our earthly paradise is still a rich preserve where the wild raiders beauty and passion come stealing in filching security from beneath our noses as surely as a dog will bark at a brass band so will the essential soames in human nature ever rise up uneasily against the dissolution which hovers round the folds of ownership  let the dead past bury its dead would be a better saying if the past ever died the persistence of the past is one of those tragicomic blessings which each new age denies coming cocksure on to the stage to mouth its claim to a perfect novelty  but no age is so new as that human nature under its changing pretensions and clothes is and ever will be very much of a forsyte and might after all be a much worse animal  looking back on the victorian era whose ripeness decline and fallof is in some sort pictured in the forsyte saga we see now that we have but jumped out of a fryingpan into a fire it would be difficult to substantiate a claim that the case of england was better in 1913 than it was in 1886 when the forsytes assembled at old jolyons to celebrate the engagement of june to philip bosinney and in 1920 when again the clan gathered to bless the marriage of fleur with michael mont the state of england is as surely too molten and bankrupt as in the eighties it was too congealed and lowpercented if these chronicles had been a really scientific study of transition one would have dwelt probably on such factors as the invention of bicycle motorcar and flyingmachine the arrival of a cheap press the decline of country life and increase of the towns the birth of the cinema men are in fact quite unable to control their own inventions they at best develop adaptability to the new conditions those inventions create  but this long tale is no scientific study of a period it is rather an intimate incarnation of the disturbance that beauty effects in the lives of men  the figure of irene never as the reader may possibly have observed present except through the senses of other characters is a concretion of disturbing beauty impinging on a possessive world  one has noticed that readers as they wade on through the salt waters of the saga are inclined more and more to pity soames and to think that in doing so they are in revolt against the mood of his creator far from it he too pities soames the tragedy of whose life is the very simple uncontrollable tragedy of being unlovable without quite a thick enough skin to be thoroughly unconscious of the fact not even fleur loves soames as he feels he ought to be loved but in pitying soames readers incline perhaps to animus against irene after all they think he wasnt a bad fellow it wasnt his fault she ought to have forgiven him and so on  and taking sides they lose perception of the simple truth which underlies the whole story that where sex attraction is utterly and definitely lacking in one partner to a union no amount of pity or reason or duty or what not can overcome a repulsion implicit in nature whether it ought to or no is beside the point because in fact it never does and where irene seems hard and cruel as in the bois de boulogne or the goupenor gallery she is but wisely realisticknowing that the least concession is the inch which precedes the impossible the repulsive ell  a criticism one might pass on the last phase of the saga is the complaint that irene and jolyon those rebels against propertyclaim spiritual property in their son jon but it would be hypercriticism as the tale is told no father and mother could have let the boy marry fleur without knowledge of the facts and the facts determine jon not the persuasion of his parents moreover jolyons persuasion is not on his own account but on irenes and irenes persuasion becomes a reiterated dont think of me think of yourself that jon knowing the facts can realise his mothers feelings will hardly with justice be held proof that she is after all a forsyte  but though the impingement of beauty and the claims of freedom on a possessive world are the main prepossessions of the forsyte saga it cannot be absolved from the charge of embalming the uppermiddle class as the old egyptians placed around their mummies the necessaries of a future existence so i have endeavoured to lay beside the figures of aunts ann and juley and hester of timothy and swithin of old jolyon and james and of their sons that which shall guarantee them a little life hereafter a little balm in the hurried gilead of a dissolving progress  if the uppermiddle class with other classes is destined to move on into amorphism here pickled in these pages it lies under glass for strollers in the wide and illarranged museum of letters here it rests preserved in its own juice the sense of property 1922     the man of property  by john galsworthy          you will answer      the slaves are ours       merchant of venice         to edward garnett     part i     chapter iat home at old jolyons  those privileged to be present at a family festival of the forsytes have seen that charming and instructive sightan upper middleclass family in full plumage but whosoever of these favoured persons has possessed the gift of psychological analysis a talent without monetary value and properly ignored by the forsytes has witnessed a spectacle not only delightful in itself but illustrative of an obscure human problem in plainer words he has gleaned from a gathering of this familyno branch of which had a liking for the other between no three members of whom existed anything worthy of the name of sympathyevidence of that mysterious concrete tenacity which renders a family so formidable a unit of society so clear a reproduction of society in miniature he has been admitted to a vision of the dim roads of social progress has understood something of patriarchal life of the swarmings of savage hordes of the rise and fall of nations he is like one who having watched a tree grow from its plantinga paragon of tenacity insulation and success amidst the deaths of a hundred other plants less fibrous sappy and persistentone day will see it flourishing with bland full foliage in an almost repugnant prosperity at the summit of its efflorescence  on june 15 eighteen eightysix about four of the afternoon the observer who chanced to be present at the house of old jolyon forsyte in stanhope gate might have seen the highest efflorescence of the forsytes  this was the occasion of an at home to celebrate the engagement of miss june forsyte old jolyons granddaughter to mr philip bosinney in the bravery of light gloves buff waistcoats feathers and frocks the family were present even aunt ann who now but seldom left the corner of her brother timothys green drawingroom where under the aegis of a plume of dyed pampas grass in a light blue vase she sat all day reading and knitting surrounded by the effigies of three generations of forsytes even aunt ann was there her inflexible back and the dignity of her calm old face personifying the rigid possessiveness of the family idea  when a forsyte was engaged married or born the forsytes were present when a forsyte diedbut no forsyte had as yet died they did not die death being contrary to their principles they took precautions against it the instinctive precautions of highly vitalized persons who resent encroachments on their property  about the forsytes mingling that day with the crowd of other guests there was a more than ordinarily groomed look an alert inquisitive assurance a brilliant respectability as though they were attired in defiance of something the habitual sniff on the face of soames forsyte had spread through their ranks they were on their guard  the subconscious offensiveness of their attitude has constituted old jolyons home the psychological moment of the family history made it the prelude of their drama  the forsytes were resentful of something not individually but as a family this resentment expressed itself in an added perfection of raiment an exuberance of family cordiality an exaggeration of family importance andthe sniff dangerso indispensable in bringing out the fundamental quality of any society group or individualwas what the forsytes scented the premonition of danger put a burnish on their armour for the first time as a family they appeared to have an instinct of being in contact with some strange and unsafe thing  over against the piano a man of bulk and stature was wearing two waistcoats on his wide chest two waistcoats and a ruby pin instead of the single satin waistcoat and diamond pin of more usual occasions and his shaven square old face the colour of pale leather with pale eyes had its most dignified look above his satin stock this was swithin forsyte close to the window where he could get more than his fair share of fresh air the other twin jamesthe fat and the lean of it old jolyon called these brotherslike the bulky swithin over six feet in height but very lean as though destined from his birth to strike a balance and maintain an average brooded over the scene with his permanent stoop his grey eyes had an air of fixed absorption in some secret worry broken at intervals by a rapid shifting scrutiny of surrounding facts his cheeks thinned by two parallel folds and a long cleanshaven upper lip were framed within dundreary whiskers in his hands he turned and turned a piece of china not far off listening to a lady in brown his only son soames pale and wellshaved darkhaired rather bald had poked his chin up sideways carrying his nose with that aforesaid appearance of sniff as though despising an egg which he knew he could not digest behind him his cousin the tall george son of the fifth forsyte roger had a quilpish look on his fleshy face pondering one of his sardonic jests something inherent to the occasion had affected them all  seated in a row close to one another were three ladiesaunts ann hester the two forsyte maids and juley short for julia who not in first youth had so far forgotten herself as to marry septimus small a man of poor constitution she had survived him for many years with her elder and younger sister she lived now in the house of timothy her sixth and youngest brother on the bayswater road each of these ladies held fans in their hands and each with some touch of colour some emphatic feather or brooch testified to the solemnity of the opportunity  in the centre of the room under the chandelier as became a host stood the head of the family old jolyon himself eighty years of age with his fine white hair his domelike forehead his little dark grey eyes and an immense white moustache which drooped and spread below the level of his strong jaw he had a patriarchal look and in spite of lean cheeks and hollows at his temples seemed master of perennial youth he held himself extremely upright and his shrewd steady eyes had lost none of their clear shining thus he gave an impression of superiority to the doubts and dislikes of smaller men having had his own way for innumerable years he had earned a prescriptive right to it it would never have occurred to old jolyon that it was necessary to wear a look of doubt or of defiance  between him and the four other brothers who were present james swithin nicholas and roger there was much difference much similarity in turn each of these four brothers was very different from the other yet they too were alike  through the varying features and expression of those five faces could be marked a certain steadfastness of chin underlying surface distinctions marking a racial stamp too prehistoric to trace too remote and permanent to discussthe very hallmark and guarantee of the family fortunes  among the younger generation in the tall bulllike george in pallid strenuous archibald in young nicholas with his sweet and tentative obstinacy in the grave and foppishly determined eustace there was this same stampless meaningful perhaps but unmistakablea sign of something ineradicable in the family soul at one time or another during the afternoon all these faces so dissimilar and so alike had worn an expression of distrust the object of which was undoubtedly the man whose acquaintance they were thus assembled to make philip bosinney was known to be a young man without fortune but forsyte girls had become engaged to such before and had actually married them it was not altogether for this reason therefore that the minds of the forsytes misgave them they could not have explained the origin of a misgiving obscured by the mist of family gossip a story was undoubtedly told that he had paid his duty call to aunts ann juley and hester in a soft grey hata soft grey hat not even a new onea dusty thing with a shapeless crown so extraordinary my dearso odd aunt hester passing through the little dark hall she was rather shortsighted had tried to shoo it off a chair taking it for a strange disreputable cattommy had such disgraceful friends she was disturbed when it did not move  like an artist for ever seeking to discover the significant trifle which embodies the whole character of a scene or place or person so those unconscious artiststhe forsytes had fastened by intuition on this hat it was their significant trifle the detail in which was embedded the meaning of the whole matter for each had asked himself come now should i have paid that visit in that hat and each had answered no and some with more imagination than others had added it would never have come into my head  george on hearing the story grinned the hat had obviously been worn as a practical joke he himself was a connoisseur of such very haughty he said the wild buccaneer  and this mot the buccaneer was bandied from mouth to mouth till it became the favourite mode of alluding to bosinney  her aunts reproached june afterwards about the hat  we dont think you ought to let him dear they had said  june had answered in her imperious brisk way like the little embodiment of will she was oh what does it matter phil never knows what hes got on  no one had credited an answer so outrageous a man not to know what he had on no no what indeed was this young man who in becoming engaged to june old jolyons acknowledged heiress had done so well for himself he was an architect not in itself a sufficient reason for wearing such a hat none of the forsytes happened to be architects but one of them knew two architects who would never have worn such a hat upon a call of ceremony in the london season  dangerousah dangerous june of course had not seen this but though not yet nineteen she was notorious had she not said to mrs soameswho was always so beautifully dressedthat feathers were vulgar mrs soames had actually given up wearing feathers so dreadfully downright was dear june  these misgivings this disapproval and perfectly genuine distrust did not prevent the forsytes from gathering to old jolyons invitation an at home at stanhope gate was a great rarity none had been held for twelve years not indeed since old mrs jolyon had died  never had there been so full an assembly for mysteriously united in spite of all their differences they had taken arms against a common peril like cattle when a dog comes into the field they stood head to head and shoulder to shoulder prepared to run upon and trample the invader to death they had come too no doubt to get some notion of what sort of presents they would ultimately be expected to give for though the question of wedding gifts was usually graduated in this way what are you givin nicholas is givin spoonsso very much depended on the bridegroom if he were sleek wellbrushed prosperouslooking it was more necessary to give him nice things he would expect them in the end each gave exactly what was right and proper by a species of family adjustment arrived at as prices are arrived at on the stock exchangethe exact niceties being regulated at timothys commodious redbrick residence in bayswater overlooking the park where dwelt aunts ann juley and hester  the uneasiness of the forsyte family has been justified by the simple mention of the hat how impossible and wrong would it have been for any family with the regard for appearances which should ever characterize the great upper middleclass to feel otherwise than uneasy  the author of the uneasiness stood talking to june by the further door his curly hair had a rumpled appearance as though he found what was going on around him unusual he had an air too of having a joke all to himself george speaking aside to his brother eustace said  looks as if he might make a bolt of itthe dashing buccaneer  this very singularlooking man as mrs small afterwards called him was of medium height and strong build with a pale brown face a dustcoloured moustache very prominent cheekbones and hollow checks his forehead sloped back towards the crown of his head and bulged out in bumps over the eyes like foreheads seen in the lionhouse at the zoo he had sherrycoloured eyes disconcertingly inattentive at times old jolyons coachman after driving june and bosinney to the theatre had remarked to the butler  i dunno what to make of im looks to me for all the world like an alftame leopard and every now and then a forsyte would come up sidle round and take a look at him  june stood in front fending off this idle curiositya little bit of a thing as somebody once said all hair and spirit with fearless blue eyes a firm jaw and a bright colour whose face and body seemed too slender for her crown of redgold hair  a tall woman with a beautiful figure which some member of the family had once compared to a heathen goddess stood looking at these two with a shadowy smile  her hands gloved in french grey were crossed one over the other her grave charming face held to one side and the eyes of all men near were fastened on it her figure swayed so balanced that the very air seemed to set it moving there was warmth but little colour in her cheeks her large dark eyes were soft  but it was at her lipsasking a question giving an answer with that shadowy smilethat men looked they were sensitive lips sensuous and sweet and through them seemed to come warmth and perfume like the warmth and perfume of a flower  the engaged couple thus scrutinized were unconscious of this passive goddess it was bosinney who first noticed her and asked her name  june took her lover up to the woman with the beautiful figure  irene is my greatest chum she said please be good friends you two  at the little ladys command they all three smiled and while they were smiling soames forsyte silently appearing from behind the woman with the beautiful figure who was his wife said  ah introduce me too  he was seldom indeed far from irenes side at public functions and even when separated by the exigencies of social intercourse could be seen following her about with his eyes in which were strange expressions of watchfulness and longing  at the window his father james was still scrutinizing the marks on the piece of china  i wonder at jolyons allowing this engagement he said to aunt ann they tell me theres no chance of their getting married for years this young bosinney he made the word a dactyl in opposition to general usage of a short o has got nothing when winifred married dartie i made him bring every penny into settlementlucky thing tootheyd ha had nothing by this time  aunt ann looked up from her velvet chair grey curls banded her forehead curls that unchanged for decades had extinguished in the family all sense of time she made no reply for she rarely spoke husbanding her aged voice but to james uneasy of conscience her look was as good as an answer  well he said i couldnt help irenes having no money soames was in such a hurry he got quite thin dancing attendance on her  putting the bowl pettishly down on the piano he let his eyes wander to the group by the door  its my opinion he said unexpectedly that its just as well as it is  aunt ann did not ask him to explain this strange utterance she knew what he was thinking if irene had no money she would not be so foolish as to do anything wrong for they saidthey saidshe had been asking for a separate room but of course soames had not  james interrupted her reverie  but where he asked was timothy hadnt he come with them  through aunt anns compressed lips a tender smile forced its way  no he didnt think it wise with so much of this diphtheria about and he so liable to take things  james answered  well he takes good care of himself i cant afford to take the care of myself that he does  nor was it easy to say which of admiration envy or contempt was dominant in that remark  timothy indeed was seldom seen the baby of the family a publisher by profession he had some years before when business was at full tide scented out the stagnation which indeed had not yet come but which ultimately as all agreed was bound to set in and selling his share in a firm engaged mainly in the production of religious books had invested the quite conspicuous proceeds in three per cent consols by this act he had at once assumed an isolated position no other forsyte being content with less than four per cent for his money and this isolation had slowly and surely undermined a spirit perhaps better than commonly endowed with caution he had become almost a mytha kind of incarnation of security haunting the background of the forsyte universe he had never committed the imprudence of marrying or encumbering himself in any way with children  james resumed tapping the piece of china  this isnt real old worcester i spose jolyons told you something about the young man from all i can learn hes got no business no income and no connection worth speaking of but then i know nothingnobody tells me anything  aunt ann shook her head over her squarechinned aquiline old face a trembling passed the spidery fingers of her hands pressed against each other and interlaced as though she were subtly recharging her will  the eldest by some years of all the forsytes she held a peculiar position amongst them opportunists and egotists one and allthough not indeed more so than their neighboursthey quailed before her incorruptible figure and when opportunities were too strong what could they do but avoid her  twisting his long thin legs james went on  jolyon he will have his own way hes got no childrenand stopped recollecting the continued existence of old jolyons son young jolyon junes father who had made such a mess of it and done for himself by deserting his wife and child and running away with that foreign governess well he resumed hastily if he likes to do these things i spose he can afford to now whats he going to give her i spose hell give her a thousand a year hes got nobody else to leave his money to  he stretched out his hand to meet that of a dapper cleanshaven man with hardly a hair on his head a long broken nose full lips and cold grey eyes under rectangular brows  well nick he muttered how are you  nicholas forsyte with his birdlike rapidity and the look of a preternaturally sage schoolboy he had made a large fortune quite legitimately out of the companies of which he was a director placed within that cold palm the tips of his still colder fingers and hastily withdrew them  im bad he said poutingbeen bad all the week dont sleep at night the doctor cant tell why hes a clever fellow or i shouldnt have him but i get nothing out of him but bills  doctors said james coming down sharp on his words ive had all the doctors in london for one or another of us theres no satisfaction to be got out of them theyll tell you anything theres swithin now what good have they done him there he is hes bigger than ever hes enormous they cant get his weight down look at him  swithin forsyte tall square and broad with a chest like a pouter pigeons in its plumage of bright waistcoats came strutting towards them  erhow are you he said in his dandified way aspirating the h strongly this difficult letter was almost absolutely safe in his keepinghow are you  each brother wore an air of aggravation as he looked at the other two knowing by experience that they would try to eclipse his ailments  we were just saying said james that you dont get any thinner  swithin protruded his pale round eyes with the effort of hearing  thinner im in good case he said leaning a little forward not one of your threadpapers like you  but afraid of losing the expansion of his chest he leaned back again into a state of immobility for he prized nothing so highly as a distinguished appearance  aunt ann turned her old eyes from one to the other indulgent and severe was her look in turn the three brothers looked at ann she was getting shaky wonderful woman eightysix if a day might live another ten years and had never been strong swithin and james the twins were only seventyfive nicholas a mere baby of seventy or so all were strong and the inference was comforting of all forms of property their respective healths naturally concerned them most  im very well in myself proceeded james but my nerves are out of order the least thing worries me to death i shall have to go to bath  bath said nicholas ive tried harrogate thats no good what i want is sea air theres nothing like yarmouth now when i go there i sleep  my livers very bad interrupted swithin slowly dreadful pain here and he placed his hand on his right side  want of exercise muttered james his eyes on the china he quickly added i get a pain there too  swithin reddened a resemblance to a turkeycock coming upon his old face  exercise he said i take plenty i never use the lift at the club  i didnt know james hurried out i know nothing about anybody nobody tells me anything  swithin fixed him with a stare  what do you do for a pain there  james brightened  i take a compound  how are you uncle  june stood before him her resolute small face raised from her little height to his great height and her hand outheld  the brightness faded from jamess visage  how are you he said brooding over her so youre going to wales tomorrow to visit your young mans aunts youll have a lot of rain there this isnt real old worcester he tapped the bowl now that set i gave your mother when she married was the genuine thing  june shook hands one by one with her three greatuncles and turned to aunt ann a very sweet look had come into the old ladys face she kissed the girls check with trembling fervour  well my dear she said and so youre going for a whole month  the girl passed on and aunt ann looked after her slim little figure the old ladys round steel grey eyes over which a film like a birds was beginning to come followed her wistfully amongst the bustling crowd for people were beginning to say goodbye and her fingertips pressing and pressing against each other were busy again with the recharging of her will against that inevitable ultimate departure of her own  yes she thought everybodys been most kind quite a lot of people come to congratulate her she ought to be very happy amongst the throng of people by the door the welldressed throng drawn from the families of lawyers and doctors from the stock exchange and all the innumerable avocations of the uppermiddle classthere were only some twenty percent of forsytes but to aunt ann they seemed all forsytesand certainly there was not much differenceshe saw only her own flesh and blood it was her world this family and she knew no other had never perhaps known any other all their little secrets illnesses engagements and marriages how they were getting on and whether they were making moneyall this was her property her delight her life beyond this only a vague shadowy mist of facts and persons of no real significance this it was that she would have to lay down when it came to her turn to die this which gave to her that importance that secret selfimportance without which none of us can bear to live and to this she clung wistfully with a greed that grew each day if life were slipping away from her this she would retain to the end  she thought of junes father young jolyon who had run away with that foreign girl and what a sad blow to his father and to them all such a promising young fellow a sad blow though there had been no public scandal most fortunately jos wife seeking for no divorce a long time ago and when junes mother died six years ago jo had married that woman and they had two children now so she had heard still he had forfeited his right to be there had cheated her of the complete fulfilment of her family pride deprived her of the rightful pleasure of seeing and kissing him of whom she had been so proud such a promising young fellow the thought rankled with the bitterness of a longinflicted injury in her tenacious old heart a little water stood in her eyes with a handkerchief of the finest lawn she wiped them stealthily  well aunt ann said a voice behind  soames forsyte flatshouldered cleanshaven flatcheeked flatwaisted yet with something round and secret about his whole appearance looked downwards and aslant at aunt ann as though trying to see through the side of his own nose  and what do you think of the engagement he asked  aunt anns eyes rested on him proudly of all the nephews since young jolyons departure from the family nest he was now her favourite for she recognised in him a sure trustee of the family soul that must so soon slip beyond her keeping  very nice for the young man she said and hes a goodlooking young fellow but i doubt if hes quite the right lover for dear june  soames touched the edge of a goldlacquered lustre  shell tame him he said stealthily wetting his finger and rubbing it on the knobby bulbs thats genuine old lacquer you cant get it nowadays itd do well in a sale at jobsons he spoke with relish as though he felt that he was cheering up his old aunt it was seldom he was so confidential i wouldnt mind having it myself he added you can always get your price for old lacquer  youre so clever with all those things said aunt ann and how is dear irene  soamess smile died  pretty well he said complains she cant sleep she sleeps a great deal better than i do and he looked at his wife who was talking to bosinney by the door  aunt ann sighed  perhaps she said it will be just as well for her not to see so much of june shes such a decided character dear june  soames flushed his flushes passed rapidly over his flat cheeks and centered between his eyes where they remained the stamp of disturbing thoughts  i dont know what she sees in that little flibbertigibbet he burst out but noticing that they were no longer alone he turned and again began examining the lustre  they tell me jolyons bought another house said his fathers voice close by he must have a lot of moneyhe must have more money than he knows what to do with montpellier square they say close to soames they never told me irene never tells me anything  capital position not two minutes from me said the voice of swithin and from my rooms i can drive to the club in eight  the position of their houses was of vital importance to the forsytes nor was this remarkable since the whole spirit of their success was embodied therein  their father of farming stock had come from dorsetshire near the beginning of the century  superior dosset forsyte as he was called by his intimates had been a stonemason by trade and risen to the position of a masterbuilder  towards the end of his life he moved to london where building on until he died he was buried at highgate he left over thirty thousand pounds between his ten children old jolyon alluded to him if at all as a hard thick sort of man not much refinement about him the second generation of forsytes felt indeed that he was not greatly to their credit the only aristocratic trait they could find in his character was a habit of drinking madeira  aunt hester an authority on family history described him thus i dont recollect that he ever did anything at least not in my time he was eran owner of houses my dear his hair about your uncle swithins colour rather a square build tall nonot very tall he had been five feet five with a mottled face a freshcoloured man i remember he used to drink madeira but ask your aunt ann what was his father heerhad to do with the land down in dorsetshire by the sea  james once went down to see for himself what sort of place this was that they had come from he found two old farms with a cart track rutted into the pink earth leading down to a mill by the beach a little grey church with a buttressed outer wall and a smaller and greyer chapel the stream which worked the mill came bubbling down in a dozen rivulets and pigs were hunting round that estuary a haze hovered over the prospect down this hollow with their feet deep in the mud and their faces towards the sea it appeared that the primeval forsytes had been content to walk sunday after sunday for hundreds of years  whether or no james had cherished hopes of an inheritance or of something rather distinguished to be found down there he came back to town in a poor way and went about with a pathetic attempt at making the best of a bad job  theres very little to be had out of that he said regular country little place old as the hills  its age was felt to be a comfort old jolyon in whom a desperate honesty welled up at times would allude to his ancestors as yeomeni suppose very small beer yet he would repeat the word yeomen as if it afforded him consolation  they had all done so well for themselves these forsytes that they were all what is called of a certain position they had shares in all sorts of things not as yetwith the exception of timothyin consols for they had no dread in life like that of 3 per cent for their money they collected pictures too and were supporters of such charitable institutions as might be beneficial to their sick domestics from their father the builder they inherited a talent for bricks and mortar originally perhaps members of some primitive sect they were now in the natural course of things members of the church of england and caused their wives and children to attend with some regularity the more fashionable churches of the metropolis to have doubted their christianity would have caused them both pain and surprise some of them paid for pews thus expressing in the most practical form their sympathy with the teachings of christ  their residences placed at stated intervals round the park watched like sentinels lest the fair heart of this london where their desires were fixed should slip from their clutches and leave them lower in their own estimations  there was old jolyon in stanhope place the jameses in park lane swithin in the lonely glory of orange and blue chambers in hyde park mansionshe had never married not hethe soamses in their nest off knightsbridge the rogers in princes gardens roger was that remarkable forsyte who had conceived and carried out the notion of bringing up his four sons to a new profession collect house property nothing like it he would say i never did anything else  the haymans againmrs hayman was the one married forsyte sisterin a house high up on campden hill shaped like a giraffe and so tall that it gave the observer a crick in the neck the nicholases in ladbroke grove a spacious abode and a great bargain and last but not least timothys on the bayswater road where ann and juley and hester lived under his protection  but all this time james was musing and now he inquired of his host and brother what he had given for that house in montpellier square he himself had had his eye on a house there for the last two years but they wanted such a price  old jolyon recounted the details of his purchase  twentytwo years to run repeated james the very house i was afteryouve given too much for it  old jolyon frowned  its not that i want it said james hastily it wouldnt suit my purpose at that price soames knows the house wellhell tell you its too dearhis opinions worth having  i dont said old jolyon care a fig for his opinion  well murmured james you will have your own wayits a good opinion goodbye were going to drive down to hurlingham they tell me junes going to wales youll be lonely tomorrow whatll you do with yourself youd better come and dine with us  old jolyon refused he went down to the front door and saw them into their barouche and twinkled at them having already forgotten his spleenmrs james facing the horses tall and majestic with auburn hair on her left irenethe two husbands father and son sitting forward as though they expected something opposite their wives bobbing and bounding upon the spring cushions silent swaying to each motion of their chariot old jolyon watched them drive away under the sunlight  during the drive the silence was broken by mrs james  did you ever see such a collection of rumtytoo people  soames glancing at her beneath his eyelids nodded and he saw irene steal at him one of her unfathomable looks it is likely enough that each branch of the forsyte family made that remark as they drove away from old jolyons at home  amongst the last of the departing guests the fourth and fifth brothers nicholas and roger walked away together directing their steps alongside hyde park towards the praed street station of the underground like all other forsytes of a certain age they kept carriages of their own and never took cabs if by any means they could avoid it  the day was bright the trees of the park in the full beauty of midjune foliage the brothers did not seem to notice phenomena which contributed nevertheless to the jauntiness of promenade and conversation  yes said roger shes a goodlookin woman that wife of soamess im told they dont get on  this brother had a high forehead and the freshest colour of any of the forsytes his light grey eyes measured the street frontage of the houses by the way and now and then he would level his umbrella and take a lunar as he expressed it of the varying heights  shed no money replied nicholas  he himself had married a good deal of money of which it being then the golden age before the married womens property act he had mercifully been enabled to make a successful use  what was her father  heron was his name a professor so they tell me  roger shook his head  theres no money in that he said  they say her mothers father was cement  rogers face brightened  but he went bankrupt went on nicholas  ah exclaimed roger soames will have trouble with her you mark my words hell have troubleshes got a foreign look  nicholas licked his lips  shes a pretty woman and he waved aside a crossingsweeper  how did he get hold of her asked roger presently she must cost him a pretty penny in dress  ann tells me replied nicholas he was halfcracked about her she refused him five times james hes nervous about it i can see  ah said roger again im sorry for james he had trouble with dartie his pleasant colour was heightened by exercise he swung his umbrella to the level of his eye more frequently than ever nicholass face also wore a pleasant look  too pale for me he said but her figures capital  roger made no reply  i call her distinguishedlooking he said at lastit was the highest praise in the forsyte vocabulary that young bosinney will never do any good for himself they say at burkitts hes one of these artistic chapsgot an idea of improving english architecture theres no money in that i should like to hear what timothy would say to it  they entered the station  what class are you going i go second  no second for me said nicholasyou never know what you may catch  he took a firstclass ticket to notting hill gate roger a second to south kensington the train coming in a minute later the two brothers parted and entered their respective compartments each felt aggrieved that the other had not modified his habits to secure his society a little longer but as roger voiced it in his thoughts  always a stubborn beggar nick  and as nicholas expressed it to himself  cantankerous chap rogeralways was  there was little sentimentality about the forsytes in that great london which they had conquered and become merged in what time had they to be sentimental     chapter iiold jolyon goes to the opera  at five oclock the following day old jolyon sat alone a cigar between his lips and on a table by his side a cup of tea he was tired and before he had finished his cigar he fell asleep a fly settled on his hair his breathing sounded heavy in the drowsy silence his upper lip under the white moustache puffed in and out from between the fingers of his veined and wrinkled hand the cigar dropping on the empty hearth burned itself out  the gloomy little study with windows of stained glass to exclude the view was full of dark green velvet and heavilycarved mahoganya suite of which old jolyon was wont to say shouldnt wonder if it made a big price some day  it was pleasant to think that in the after life he could get more for things than he had given  in the rich brown atmosphere peculiar to back rooms in the mansion of a forsyte the rembrandtesque effect of his great head with its white hair against the cushion of his highbacked seat was spoiled by the moustache which imparted a somewhat military look to his face an old clock that had been with him since before his marriage forty years ago kept with its ticking a jealous record of the seconds slipping away forever from its old master  he had never cared for this room hardly going into it from one years end to another except to take cigars from the japanese cabinet in the corner and the room now had its revenge  his temples curving like thatches over the hollows beneath his cheekbones and chin all were sharpened in his sleep and there had come upon his face the confession that he was an old man  he woke june had gone james had said he would be lonely james had always been a poor thing he recollected with satisfaction that he had bought that house over jamess head  serve him right for sticking at the price the only thing the fellow thought of was money had he given too much though it wanted a lot of doing tohe dared say he would want all his money before he had done with this affair of junes he ought never to have allowed the engagement she had met this bosinney at the house of baynes baynes and bildeboy the architects he believed that baynes whom he knewa bit of an old womanwas the young mans uncle by marriage after that shed been always running after him and when she took a thing into her head there was no stopping her she was continually taking up with lame ducks of one sort or another this fellow had no money but she must needs become engaged to hima harumscarum unpractical chap who would get himself into no end of difficulties  she had come to him one day in her slapdash way and told him and as if it were any consolation she had added  hes so splendid hes often lived on cocoa for a week  and he wants you to live on cocoa too  oh no he is getting into the swim now  old jolyon had taken his cigar from under his white moustaches stained by coffee at the edge and looked at her that little slip of a thing who had got such a grip of his heart he knew more about swims than his granddaughter but she having clasped her hands on his knees rubbed her chin against him making a sound like a purring cat and knocking the ash off his cigar he had exploded in nervous desperation  youre all alike you wont be satisfied till youve got what you want if you must come to grief you must i wash my hands of it  so he had washed his hands of it making the condition that they should not marry until bosinney had at least four hundred a year  i shant be able to give you very much he had said a formula to which june was not unaccustomed perhaps this whatshisname will provide the cocoa  he had hardly seen anything of her since it began a bad business he had no notion of giving her a lot of money to enable a fellow he knew nothing about to live on in idleness he had seen that sort of thing before no good ever came of it worst of all he had no hope of shaking her resolution she was as obstinate as a mule always had been from a child he didnt see where it was to end they must cut their coat according to their cloth he would not give way till he saw young bosinney with an income of his own that june would have trouble with the fellow was as plain as a pikestaff he had no more idea of money than a cow as to this rushing down to wales to visit the young mans aunts he fully expected they were old cats  and motionless old jolyon stared at the wall but for his open eyes he might have been asleep the idea of supposing that young cub soames could give him advice he had always been a cub with his nose in the air he would be setting up as a man of property next with a place in the country a man of property hmph like his father he was always nosing out bargains a coldblooded young beggar  he rose and going to the cabinet began methodically stocking his cigarcase from a bundle fresh in they were not bad at the price but you couldnt get a good cigar nowadays nothing to hold a candle to those old superfinos of hanson and bridgers that was a cigar  the thought like some stealing perfume carried him back to those wonderful nights at richmond when after dinner he sat smoking on the terrace of the crown and sceptre with nicholas treffry and traquair and jack herring and anthony thornworthy how good his cigars were then poor old nickdead and jack herringdead and traquairdead of that wife of his and thornworthyawfully shaky no wonder with his appetite  of all the company of those days he himself alone seemed left except swithin of course and he so outrageously big there was no doing anything with him  difficult to believe it was so long ago he felt young still of all his thoughts as he stood there counting his cigars this was the most poignant the most bitter with his white head and his loneliness he had remained young and green at heart and those sunday afternoons on hampstead heath when young jolyon and he went for a stretch along the spaniards road to highgate to childs hill and back over the heath again to dine at jack straws castlehow delicious his cigars were then and such weather there was no weather now  when june was a toddler of five and every other sunday he took her to the zoo away from the society of those two good women her mother and her grandmother and at the top of the bear den baited his umbrella with buns for her favourite bears how sweet his cigars were then  cigars he had not even succeeded in outliving his palatethe famous palate that in the fifties men swore by and speaking of him said forsytes the best palate in london the palate that in a sense had made his fortunethe fortune of the celebrated tea men forsyte and treffry whose tea like no other mans tea had a romantic aroma the charm of a quite singular genuineness about the house of forsyte and treffry in the city had clung an air of enterprise and mystery of special dealings in special ships at special ports with special orientals  he had worked at that business men did work in those days these young pups hardly knew the meaning of the word he had gone into every detail known everything that went on sometimes sat up all night over it and he had always chosen his agents himself prided himself on it his eye for men he used to say had been the secret of his success and the exercise of this masterful power of selection had been the only part of it all that he had really liked not a career for a man of his ability even now when the business had been turned into a limited liability company and was declining he had got out of his shares long ago he felt a sharp chagrin in thinking of that time how much better he might have done he would have succeeded splendidly at the bar he had even thought of standing for parliament how often had not nicholas treffry said to him  you could do anything jo if you werent so ddamned careful of yourself dear old nick such a good fellow but a racketty chap the notorious treffry he had never taken any care of himself so he was dead old jolyon counted his cigars with a steady hand and it came into his mind to wonder if perhaps he had been too careful of himself  he put the cigarcase in the breast of his coat buttoned it in and walked up the long flights to his bedroom leaning on one foot and the other and helping himself by the bannister the house was too big after june was married if she ever did marry this fellow as he supposed she would he would let it and go into rooms what was the use of keeping half a dozen servants eating their heads off  the butler came to the ring of his bella large man with a beard a soft tread and a peculiar capacity for silence old jolyon told him to put his dress clothes out he was going to dine at the club  how long had the carriage been back from taking miss june to the station since two then let him come round at halfpast six  the club which old jolyon entered on the stroke of seven was one of those political institutions of the upper middle class which have seen better days in spite of being talked about perhaps in consequence of being talked about it betrayed a disappointing vitality people had grown tired of saying that the disunion was on its last legs old jolyon would say it too yet disregarded the fact in a manner truly irritating to wellconstituted clubmen  why do you keep your name on swithin often asked him with profound vexation why dont you join the polyglot you cant get a wine like our heidsieck under twenty shillin a bottle anywhere in london and dropping his voice he added theres only five hundred dozen left i drink it every night of my life  ill think of it old jolyon would answer but when he did think of it there was always the question of fifty guineas entrance fee and it would take him four or five years to get in he continued to think of it  he was too old to be a liberal had long ceased to believe in the political doctrines of his club had even been known to allude to them as wretched stuff and it afforded him pleasure to continue a member in the teeth of principles so opposed to his own he had always had a contempt for the place having joined it many years ago when they refused to have him at the hotch potch owing to his being in trade as if he were not as good as any of them he naturally despised the club that did take him the members were a poor lot many of them in the citystockbrokers solicitors auctioneerswhat not like most men of strong character but not too much originality old jolyon set small store by the class to which he belonged faithfully he followed their customs social and otherwise and secretly he thought them a common lot  years and philosophy of which he had his share had dimmed the recollection of his defeat at the hotch potch and now in his thoughts it was enshrined as the queen of clubs he would have been a member all these years himself but owing to the slipshod way his proposer jack herring had gone to work they had not known what they were doing in keeping him out why they had taken his son jo at once and he believed the boy was still a member he had received a letter dated from there eight years ago  he had not been near the disunion for months and the house had undergone the piebald decoration which people bestow on old houses and old ships when anxious to sell them  beastly colour the smokingroom he thought the diningroom is good  its gloomy chocolate picked out with light green took his fancy  he ordered dinner and sat down in the very corner at the very table perhaps things did not progress much at the disunion a club of almost radical principles at which he and young jolyon used to sit twentyfive years ago when he was taking the latter to drury lane during his holidays  the boy had loved the theatre and old jolyon recalled how he used to sit opposite concealing his excitement under a careful but transparent nonchalance  he ordered himself too the very dinner the boy had always chosensoup whitebait cutlets and a tart ah if he were only opposite now  the two had not met for fourteen years and not for the first time during those fourteen years old jolyon wondered whether he had been a little to blame in the matter of his son an unfortunate loveaffair with that precious flirt danae thornworthy now danae pellew anthony thornworthys daughter had thrown him on the rebound into the arms of junes mother he ought perhaps to have put a spoke in the wheel of their marriage they were too young but after that experience of jos susceptibility he had been only too anxious to see him married and in four years the crash had come to have approved his sons conduct in that crash was of course impossible reason and trainingthat combination of potent factors which stood for his principlestold him of this impossibility and his heart cried out the grim remorselessness of that business had no pity for hearts there was june the atom with flaming hair who had climbed all over him twined and twisted herself about himabout his heart that was made to be the plaything and beloved resort of tiny helpless things with characteristic insight he saw he must part with one or with the other no halfmeasures could serve in such a situation in that lay its tragedy and the tiny helpless thing prevailed he would not run with the hare and hunt with the hounds and so to his son he said goodbye  that goodbye had lasted until now  he had proposed to continue a reduced allowance to young jolyon but this had been refused and perhaps that refusal had hurt him more than anything for with it had gone the last outlet of his pennedin affection and there had come such tangible and solid proof of rupture as only a transaction in property a bestowal or refusal of such could supply  his dinner tasted flat his pint of champagne was dry and bitter stuff not like the veuve clicquots of old days  over his cup of coffee he bethought him that he would go to the opera in the times thereforehe had a distrust of other papershe read the announcement for the evening it was fidelio  mercifully not one of those newfangled german pantomimes by that fellow wagner  putting on his ancient opera hat which with its brim flattened by use and huge capacity looked like an emblem of greater days and pulling out an old pair of very thin lavender kid gloves smelling strongly of russia leather from habitual proximity to the cigarcase in the pocket of his overcoat he stepped into a hansom  the cab rattled gaily along the streets and old jolyon was struck by their unwonted animation  the hotels must be doing a tremendous business he thought a few years ago there had been none of these big hotels he made a satisfactory reflection on some property he had in the neighbourhood it must be going up in value by leaps and bounds what traffic  but from that he began indulging in one of those strange impersonal speculations so uncharacteristic of a forsyte wherein lay in part the secret of his supremacy amongst them what atoms men were and what a lot of them and what would become of them all  he stumbled as he got out of the cab gave the man his exact fare walked up to the ticket office to take his stall and stood there with his purse in his handhe always carried his money in a purse never having approved of that habit of carrying it loosely in the pockets as so many young men did nowadays the official leaned out like an old dog from a kennel  why he said in a surprised voice its mr jolyon forsyte so it is havent seen you sir for years dear me times arent what they were why you and your brother and that auctioneermr traquair and mr nicholas treffryyou used to have six or seven stalls here regular every season and how are you sir we dont get younger  the colour in old jolyons eyes deepened he paid his guinea they had not forgotten him he marched in to the sounds of the overture like an old warhorse to battle  folding his opera hat he sat down drew out his lavender gloves in the old way and took up his glasses for a long look round the house dropping them at last on his folded hat he fixed his eyes on the curtain more poignantly than ever he felt that it was all over and done with him where were all the women the pretty women the house used to be so full of where was that old feeling in the heart as he waited for one of those great singers where that sensation of the intoxication of life and of his own power to enjoy it all  the greatest operagoer of his day there was no opera now that fellow wagner had ruined everything no melody left nor any voices to sing it ah the wonderful singers gone he sat watching the old scenes acted a numb feeling at his heart  from the curl of silver over his ear to the pose of his foot in its elasticsided patent boot there was nothing clumsy or weak about old jolyon he was as uprightvery nearlyas in those old times when he came every night his sight was as goodalmost as good but what a feeling of weariness and disillusion  he had been in the habit all his life of enjoying things even imperfect thingsand there had been many imperfect thingshe had enjoyed them all with moderation so as to keep himself young but now he was deserted by his power of enjoyment by his philosophy and left with this dreadful feeling that it was all done with not even the prisoners chorus nor florians song had the power to dispel the gloom of his loneliness  if jo were only with him the boy must be forty by now he had wasted fourteen years out of the life of his only son and jo was no longer a social pariah he was married old jolyon had been unable to refrain from marking his appreciation of the action by enclosing his son a cheque for l500 the cheque had been returned in a letter from the hotch potch couched in these words  my dearest father  your generous gift was welcome as a sign that you might think worse of me i return it but should you think fit to invest it for the benefit of the little chap we call him jolly who bears our christian and by courtesy our surname i shall be very glad  i hope with all my heart that your health is as good as ever  your loving son  jo  the letter was like the boy he had always been an amiable chap old jolyon had sent this reply   my dear jo  the sum l500 stands in my books for the benefit of your boy under the name of jolyon forsyte and will be dulycredited with interest at 5 per cent i hope that you are doing well my health remains good at present  with love i am  your affectionate father  jolyon forsyte   and every year on the 1st of january he had added a hundred and the interest the sum was mounting upnext new years day it would be fifteen hundred and odd pounds and it is difficult to say how much satisfaction he had got out of that yearly transaction but the correspondence had ended  in spite of his love for his son in spite of an instinct partly constitutional partly the result as in thousands of his class of the continual handling and watching of affairs prompting him to judge conduct by results rather than by principle there was at the bottom of his heart a sort of uneasiness his son ought under the circumstances to have gone to the dogs that law was laid down in all the novels sermons and plays he had ever read heard or witnessed  after receiving the cheque back there seemed to him to be something wrong somewhere why had his son not gone to the dogs but then who could tell  he had heard of coursein fact he had made it his business to find outthat jo lived in st johns wood that he had a little house in wistaria avenue with a garden and took his wife about with him into societya queer sort of society no doubtand that they had two childrenthe little chap they called jolly considering the circumstances the name struck him as cynical and old jolyon both feared and disliked cynicism and a girl called holly born since the marriage who could tell what his sons circumstances really were he had capitalized the income he had inherited from his mothers father and joined lloyds as an underwriter he painted pictures toowatercolours old jolyon knew this for he had surreptitiously bought them from time to time after chancing to see his sons name signed at the bottom of a representation of the river thames in a dealers window he thought them bad and did not hang them because of the signature he kept them locked up in a drawer  in the great operahouse a terrible yearning came on him to see his son he remembered the days when he had been wont to slide him in a brown holland suit to and fro under the arch of his legs the times when he ran beside the boys pony teaching him to ride the day he first took him to school he had been a loving lovable little chap after he went to eton he had acquired perhaps a little too much of that desirable manner which old jolyon knew was only to be obtained at such places and at great expense but he had always been companionable always a companion even after cambridgea little far off perhaps owing to the advantages he had received old jolyons feeling towards our public schools and varsities never wavered and he retained touchingly his attitude of admiration and mistrust towards a system appropriate to the highest in the land of which he had not himself been privileged to partake now that june had gone and left or as good as left him it would have been a comfort to see his son again guilty of this treason to his family his principles his class old jolyon fixed his eyes on the singer a poor thinga wretched poor thing and the florian a perfect stick  it was over they were easily pleased nowadays  in the crowded street he snapped up a cab under the very nose of a stout and much younger gentleman who had already assumed it to be his own his route lay through pall mall and at the corner instead of going through the green park the cabman turned to drive up st jamess street old jolyon put his hand through the trap he could not bear being taken out of his way in turning however he found himself opposite the hotch potch and the yearning that had been secretly with him the whole evening prevailed he called to the driver to stop he would go in and ask if jo still belonged there  he went in the hall looked exactly as it did when he used to dine there with jack herring and they had the best cook in london and he looked round with the shrewd straight glance that had caused him all his life to be better served than most men  mr jolyon forsyte still a member here  yes sir in the club now sir what name  old jolyon was taken aback  his father he said  and having spoken he took his stand back to the fireplace  young jolyon on the point of leaving the club had put on his hat and was in the act of crossing the hall as the porter met him he was no longer young with hair going grey and facea narrower replica of his fathers with the same large drooping moustachedecidedly worn he turned pale this meeting was terrible after all those years for nothing in the world was so terrible as a scene they met and crossed hands without a word then with a quaver in his voice the father said  how are you my boy  the son answered  how are you dad  old jolyons hand trembled in its thin lavender glove  if youre going my way he said i can give you a lift  and as though in the habit of taking each other home every night they went out and stepped into the cab  to old jolyon it seemed that his son had grown more of a man altogether was his comment over the natural amiability of that sons face had come a rather sardonic mask as though he had found in the circumstances of his life the necessity for armour the features were certainly those of a forsyte but the expression was more the introspective look of a student or philosopher he had no doubt been obliged to look into himself a good deal in the course of those fifteen years  to young jolyon the first sight of his father was undoubtedly a shockhe looked so worn and old but in the cab he seemed hardly to have changed still having the calm look so well remembered still being upright and keeneyed  you look well dad  middling old jolyon answered  he was the prey of an anxiety that he found he must put into words having got his son back like this he felt he must know what was his financial position  jo he said i should like to hear what sort of water youre in i suppose youre in debt  he put it this way that his son might find it easier to confess  young jolyon answered in his ironical voice  no im not in debt  old jolyon saw that he was angry and touched his hand he had run a risk it was worth it however and jo had never been sulky with him they drove on without speaking again to stanhope gate old jolyon invited him in but young jolyon shook his head  junes not here said his father hastily went of today on a visit i suppose you know that shes engaged to be married  already murmured young jolyon  old jolyon stepped out and in paying the cab fare for the first time in his life gave the driver a sovereign in mistake for a shilling  placing the coin in his mouth the cabman whipped his horse secretly on the underneath and hurried away  old jolyon turned the key softly in the lock pushed open the door and beckoned his son saw him gravely hanging up his coat with an expression on his face like that of a boy who intends to steal cherries  the door of the diningroom was open the gas turned low a spiriturn hissed on a teatray and close to it a cynical looking cat had fallen asleep on the diningtable old jolyon shood her off at once the incident was a relief to his feelings he rattled his opera hat behind the animal  shes got fleas he said following her out of the room through the door in the hall leading to the basement he called hssst several times as though assisting the cats departure till by some strange coincidence the butler appeared below  you can go to bed parfitt said old jolyon i will lock up and put out  when he again entered the diningroom the cat unfortunately preceded him with her tail in the air proclaiming that she had seen through this manouevre for suppressing the butler from the first  a fatality had dogged old jolyons domestic stratagems all his life  young jolyon could not help smiling he was very well versed in irony and everything that evening seemed to him ironical the episode of the cat the announcement of his own daughters engagement so he had no more part or parcel in her than he had in the puss and the poetical justice of this appealed to him  what is june like now he asked  shes a little thing returned old jolyon they say shes like me but thats their folly shes more like your motherthe same eyes and hair  ah and she is pretty  old jolyon was too much of a forsyte to praise anything freely especially anything for which he had a genuine admiration  not bad lookinga regular forsyte chin itll be lonely here when shes gone jo  the look on his face again gave young jolyon the shock he had felt on first seeing his father  what will you do with yourself dad i suppose shes wrapped up in him  do with myself repeated old jolyon with an angry break in his voice itll be miserable work living here alone i dont know how its to end i wish to goodness he checked himself and added the question is what had i better do with this house  young jolyon looked round the room it was peculiarly vast and dreary decorated with the enormous pictures of still life that he remembered as a boysleeping dogs with their noses resting on bunches of carrots together with onions and grapes lying side by side in mild surprise the house was a white elephant but he could not conceive of his father living in a smaller place and all the more did it all seem ironical  in his great chair with the bookrest sat old jolyon the figurehead of his family and class and creed with his white head and domelike forehead the representative of moderation and order and love of property as lonely an old man as there was in london  there he sat in the gloomy comfort of the room a puppet in the power of great forces that cared nothing for family or class or creed but moved machinelike with dread processes to inscrutable ends this was how it struck young jolyon who had the impersonal eye  the poor old dad so this was the end the purpose to which he had lived with such magnificent moderation to be lonely and grow older and older yearning for a soul to speak to  in his turn old jolyon looked back at his son he wanted to talk about many things that he had been unable to talk about all these years it had been impossible to seriously confide in june his conviction that property in the soho quarter would go up in value his uneasiness about that tremendous silence of pippin the superintendent of the new colliery company of which he had so long been chairman his disgust at the steady fall in american golgothas or even to discuss how by some sort of settlement he could best avoid the payment of those death duties which would follow his decease under the influence however of a cup of tea which he seemed to stir indefinitely he began to speak at last a new vista of life was thus opened up a promised land of talk where he could find a harbour against the waves of anticipation and regret where he could soothe his soul with the opium of devising how to round off his property and make eternal the only part of him that was to remain alive  young jolyon was a good listener it was his great quality he kept his eyes fixed on his fathers face putting a question now and then  the clock struck one before old jolyon had finished and at the sound of its striking his principles came back he took out his watch with a look of surprise  i must go to bed jo he said  young jolyon rose and held out his hand to help his father up the old face looked worn and hollow again the eyes were steadily averted  goodbye my boy take care of yourself  a moment passed and young jolyon turning on his heel marched out at the door he could hardly see his smile quavered never in all the fifteen years since he had first found out that life was no simple business had he found it so singularly complicated     chapter iiidinner at swithins  in swithins orange and lightblue diningroom facing the park the round table was laid for twelve  a cutglass chandelier filled with lighted candles hung like a giant stalactite above its centre radiating over large giltframed mirrors slabs of marble on the tops of sidetables and heavy gold chairs with crewel worked seats everything betokened that love of beauty so deeply implanted in each family which has had its own way to make into society out of the more vulgar heart of nature swithin had indeed an impatience of simplicity a love of ormolu which had always stamped him amongst his associates as a man of great if somewhat luxurious taste and out of the knowledge that no one could possibly enter his rooms without perceiving him to be a man of wealth he had derived a solid and prolonged happiness such as perhaps no other circumstance in life had afforded him  since his retirement from land agency a profession deplorable in his estimation especially as to its auctioneering department he had abandoned himself to naturally aristocratic tastes  the perfect luxury of his latter days had embedded him like a fly in sugar and his mind where very little took place from morning till night was the junction of two curiously opposite emotions a lingering and sturdy satisfaction that he had made his own way and his own fortune and a sense that a man of his distinction should never have been allowed to soil his mind with work  he stood at the sideboard in a white waistcoat with large gold and onyx buttons watching his valet screw the necks of three champagne bottles deeper into icepails between the points of his standup collar whichthough it hurt him to movehe would on no account have had altered the pale flesh of his under chin remained immovable his eyes roved from bottle to bottle he was debating and he argued like this jolyon drinks a glass perhaps two hes so careful of himself james he cant take his wine nowadays nicholasfanny and he would swill water he shouldnt wonder soames didnt count these young nephewssoames was thirtyonecouldnt drink but bosinney  encountering in the name of this stranger something outside the range of his philosophy swithin paused a misgiving arose within him it was impossible to tell june was only a girl in love too emily mrs james liked a good glass of champagne it was too dry for juley poor old soul she had no palate as to hatty chessman the thought of this old friend caused a cloud of thought to obscure the perfect glassiness of his eyes he shouldnt wonder if she drank half a bottle  but in thinking of his remaining guest an expression like that of a cat who is just going to purr stole over his old face mrs soames she mightnt take much but she would appreciate what she drank it was a pleasure to give her good wine a pretty womanand sympathetic to him  the thought of her was like champagne itself a pleasure to give a good wine to a young woman who looked so well who knew how to dress with charming manners quite distinguisheda pleasure to entertain her between the points of his collar he gave his head the first small painful oscillation of the evening  adolf he said put in another bottle  he himself might drink a good deal for thanks to that prescription of blights he found himself extremely well and he had been careful to take no lunch he had not felt so well for weeks puffing out his lower lip he gave his last instructions  adolf the least touch of the west india when you come to the ham  passing into the anteroom he sat down on the edge of a chair with his knees apart and his tall bulky form was wrapped at once in an expectant strange primeval immobility he was ready to rise at a moments notice he had not given a dinnerparty for months this dinner in honour of junes engagement had seemed a bore at first among forsytes the custom of solemnizing engagements by feasts was religiously observed but the labours of sending invitations and ordering the repast over he felt pleasantly stimulated  and thus sitting a watch in his hand fat and smooth and golden like a flattened globe of butter he thought of nothing  a long man with side whiskers who had once been in swithins service but was now a greengrocer entered and proclaimed  mrs chessman mrs septimus small  two ladies advanced the one in front habited entirely in red had large settled patches of the same colour in her cheeks and a hard dashing eye she walked at swithin holding out a hand cased in a long primrosecoloured glove  well swithin she said i havent seen you for ages how are you why my dear boy how stout youre getting  the fixity of swithins eye alone betrayed emotion a dumb and grumbling anger swelled his bosom it was vulgar to be stout to talk of being stout he had a chest nothing more turning to his sister he grasped her hand and said in a tone of command  well juley  mrs septimus small was the tallest of the four sisters her good round old face had gone a little sour an innumerable pout clung all over it as if it had been encased in an iron wire mask up to that evening which being suddenly removed left little rolls of mutinous flesh all over her countenance even her eyes were pouting it was thus that she recorded her permanent resentment at the loss of septimus small  she had quite a reputation for saying the wrong thing and tenacious like all her breed she would hold to it when she had said it and add to it another wrong thing and so on with the decease of her husband the family tenacity the family matteroffactness had gone sterile within her a great talker when allowed she would converse without the faintest animation for hours together relating with epic monotony the innumerable occasions on which fortune had misused her nor did she ever perceive that her hearers sympathized with fortune for her heart was kind  having sat poor soul long by the bedside of small a man of poor constitution she had acquired the habit and there were countless subsequent occasions when she had sat immense periods of time to amuse sick people children and other helpless persons and she could never divest herself of the feeling that the world was the most ungrateful place anybody could live in sunday after sunday she sat at the feet of that extremely witty preacher the rev thomas scoles who exercised a great influence over her but she succeeded in convincing everybody that even this was a misfortune she had passed into a proverb in the family and when anybody was observed to be peculiarly distressing he was known as a regular juley the habit of her mind would have killed anybody but a forsyte at forty but she was seventytwo and had never looked better and one felt that there were capacities for enjoyment about her which might yet come out she owned three canaries the cat tommy and half a parrotin common with her sister hesterand these poor creatures kept carefully out of timothys wayhe was nervous about animals unlike human beings recognising that she could not help being blighted attached themselves to her passionately  she was sombrely magnificent this evening in black bombazine with a mauve front cut in a shy triangle and crowned with a black velvet ribbon round the base of her thin throat black and mauve for evening wear was esteemed very chaste by nearly every forsyte  pouting at swithin she said  ann has been asking for you you havent been near us for an age  swithin put his thumbs within the armholes of his waistcoat and replied  anns getting very shaky she ought to have a doctor  mr and mrs nicholas forsyte  nicholas forsyte cocking his rectangular eyebrows wore a smile he had succeeded during the day in bringing to fruition a scheme for the employment of a tribe from upper india in the goldmines of ceylon a pet plan carried at last in the teeth of great difficultieshe was justly pleased it would double the output of his mines and as he had often forcibly argued all experience tended to show that a man must die and whether he died of a miserable old age in his own country or prematurely of damp in the bottom of a foreign mine was surely of little consequence provided that by a change in his mode of life he benefited the british empire  his ability was undoubted raising his broken nose towards his listener he would add  for want of a few hundred of these fellows we havent paid a dividend for years and look at the price of the shares i cant get ten shillings for them  he had been at yarmouth too and had come back feeling that he had added at least ten years to his own life he grasped swithins hand exclaiming in a jocular voice  well so here we are again  mrs nicholas an effete woman smiled a smile of frightened jollity behind his back  mr and mrs james forsyte mr and mrs soames forsyte  swithin drew his heels together his deportment ever admirable  well james well emily how are you soames how do you do  his hand enclosed irenes and his eyes swelled she was a pretty womana little too pale but her figure her eyes her teeth too good for that chap soames  the gods had given irene dark brown eyes and golden hair that strange combination provocative of mens glances which is said to be the mark of a weak character and the full soft pallor of her neck and shoulders above a goldcoloured frock gave to her personality an alluring strangeness  soames stood behind his eyes fastened on his wifes neck the hands of swithins watch which he still held open in his hand had left eight behind it was half an hour beyond his dinnertimehe had had no lunchand a strange primeval impatience surged up within him  its not like jolyon to be late he said to irene with uncontrollable vexation i suppose itll be june keeping him  people in love are always late she answered  swithin stared at her a dusky orange dyed his cheeks  theyve no business to be some fashionable nonsense  and behind this outburst the inarticulate violence of primitive generations seemed to mutter and grumble  tell me what you think of my new star uncle swithin said irene softly  among the lace in the bosom of her dress was shining a fivepointed star made of eleven diamonds swithin looked at the star he had a pretty taste in stones no question could have been more sympathetically devised to distract his attention  who gave you that he asked  soames  there was no change in her face but swithins pale eyes bulged as though he might suddenly have been afflicted with insight  i dare say youre dull at home he said any day you like to come and dine with me ill give you as good a bottle of wine as youll get in london  miss june forsytemr jolyon forsyte mr boswainey  swithin moved his arm and said in a rumbling voice  dinner nowdinner  he took in irene on the ground that he had not entertained her since she was a bride june was the portion of bosinney who was placed between irene and his fiancee on the other side of june was james with mrs nicholas then old jolyon with mrs james nicholas with hatty chessman soames with mrs small completing the circle to swithin again  family dinners of the forsytes observe certain traditions there are for instance no hors doeuvre the reason for this is unknown theory among the younger members traces it to the disgraceful price of oysters it is more probably due to a desire to come to the point to a good practical sense deciding at once that hors doeuvre are but poor things the jameses alone unable to withstand a custom almost universal in park lane are now and then unfaithful  a silent almost morose inattention to each other succeeds to the subsidence into their seats lasting till well into the first entree but interspersed with remarks such as toms bad again i cant tell whats the matter with him i suppose ann doesnt come down in the morningswhats the name of your doctor fanny stubbs hes a quackwinifred shes got too many children four isnt it shes as thin as a lathwhat dyou give for this sherry swithin too dry for me  with the second glass of champagne a kind of hum makes itself heard which when divested of casual accessories and resolved into its primal element is found to be james telling a story and this goes on for a long time encroaching sometimes even upon what must universally be recognised as the crowning point of a forsyte feastthe saddle of mutton  no forsyte has given a dinner without providing a saddle of mutton there is something in its succulent solidity which makes it suitable to people of a certain position it is nourishing and tasty the sort of thing a man remembers eating it has a past and a future like a deposit paid into a bank and it is something that can be argued about  each branch of the family tenaciously held to a particular localityold jolyon swearing by dartmoor james by welsh swithin by southdown nicholas maintaining that people might sneer but there was nothing like new zealand as for roger the original of the brothers he had been obliged to invent a locality of his own and with an ingenuity worthy of a man who had devised a new profession for his sons he had discovered a shop where they sold german on being remonstrated with he had proved his point by producing a butchers bill which showed that he paid more than any of the others it was on this occasion that old jolyon turning to june had said in one of his bursts of philosophy  you may depend upon it theyre a cranky lot the forsytesand youll find it out as you grow older  timothy alone held apart for though he ate saddle of mutton heartily he was he said afraid of it  to anyone interested psychologically in forsytes this great saddleofmutton trait is of prime importance not only does it illustrate their tenacity both collectively and as individuals but it marks them as belonging in fibre and instincts to that great class which believes in nourishment and flavour and yields to no sentimental craving for beauty  younger members of the family indeed would have done without a joint altogether preferring guineafowl or lobster saladsomething which appealed to the imagination and had less nourishmentbut these were females or if not had been corrupted by their wives or by mothers who having been forced to eat saddle of mutton throughout their married lives had passed a secret hostility towards it into the fibre of their sons  the great saddleofmutton controversy at an end a tewkesbury ham commenced together with the least touch of west indianswithin was so long over this course that he caused a block in the progress of the dinner to devote himself to it with better heart he paused in his conversation  from his seat by mrs septimus small soames was watching he had a reason of his own connected with a pet building scheme for observing bosinney the architect might do for his purpose he looked clever as he sat leaning back in his chair moodily making little ramparts with breadcrumbs soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut but too small as though made many years ago  he saw him turn to irene and say something and her face sparkle as he often saw it sparkle at other peoplenever at himself he tried to catch what they were saying but aunt juley was speaking  hadnt that always seemed very extraordinary to soames only last sunday dear mr scole had been so witty in his sermon so sarcastic for what he had said shall it profit a man if he gain his own soul but lose all his property that he had said was the motto of the middleclass now what had he meant by that of course it might be what middleclass people believedshe didnt know what did soames think  he answered abstractedly how should i know scoles is a humbug though isnt he for bosinney was looking round the table as if pointing out the peculiarities of the guests and soames wondered what he was saying by her smile irene was evidently agreeing with his remarks she seemed always to agree with other people  her eyes were turned on himself soames dropped his glance at once the smile had died off her lips  a humbug but what did soames mean if mr scoles was a humbug a clergymanthen anybody might beit was frightful  well and so they are said soames  during aunt juleys momentary and horrified silence he caught some words of irenes that sounded like abandon hope all ye who enter here  but swithin had finished his ham  where do you go for your mushrooms he was saying to irene in a voice like a courtiers you ought to go to smileybobshell give em you fresh these little men they wont take the trouble  irene turned to answer him and soames saw bosinney watching her and smiling to himself a curious smile the fellow had a halfsimple arrangement like a child who smiles when he is pleased as for georges nicknamethe buccaneerhe did not think much of that and seeing bosinney turn to june soames smiled too but sardonicallyhe did not like june who was not looking too pleased  this was not surprising for she had just held the following conversation with james  i stayed on the river on my way home uncle james and saw a beautiful site for a house  james a slow and thorough eater stopped the process of mastication  eh he said now where was that  close to pangbourne  james placed a piece of ham in his mouth and june waited  i suppose you wouldnt know whether the land about there was freehold he asked at last you wouldnt know anything about the price of land about there  yes said june i made inquiries her little resolute face under its copper crown was suspiciously eager and aglow  james regarded her with the air of an inquisitor  what youre not thinking of buying land he ejaculated dropping his fork  june was greatly encouraged by his interest it had long been her pet plan that her uncles should benefit themselves and bosinney by building countryhouses  of course not she said i thought it would be such a splendid place foryou orsomeone to build a countryhouse  james looked at her sideways and placed a second piece of ham in his mouth  land ought to be very dear about there he said  what june had taken for personal interest was only the impersonal excitement of every forsyte who hears of something eligible in danger of passing into other hands but she refused to see the disappearance of her chance and continued to press her point  you ought to go into the country uncle james i wish i had a lot of money i wouldnt live another day in london  james was stirred to the depths of his long thin figure he had no idea his niece held such downright views  why dont you go into the country repeated june it would do you a lot of good  why began james in a fluster buying landwhat good dyou suppose i can do buying land building housesi couldnt get four per cent for my money  what does that matter youd get fresh air  fresh air exclaimed james what should i do with fresh air  i should have thought anybody liked to have fresh air said june scornfully  james wiped his napkin all over his mouth  you dont know the value of money he said avoiding her eye  no and i hope i never shall and biting her lip with inexpressible mortification poor june was silent  why were her own relations so rich and phil never knew where the money was coming from for tomorrows tobacco why couldnt they do something for him but they were so selfish why couldnt they build countryhouses she had all that naive dogmatism which is so pathetic and sometimes achieves such great results bosinney to whom she turned in her discomfiture was talking to irene and a chill fell on junes spirit her eyes grew steady with anger like old jolyons when his will was crossed  james too was much disturbed he felt as though someone had threatened his right to invest his money at five per cent jolyon had spoiled her none of his girls would have said such a thing james had always been exceedingly liberal to his children and the consciousness of this made him feel it all the more deeply he trifled moodily with his strawberries then deluging them with cream he ate them quickly they at all events should not escape him  no wonder he was upset engaged for fiftyfour years he had been admitted a solicitor on the earliest day sanctioned by the law in arranging mortgages preserving investments at a dead level of high and safe interest conducting negotiations on the principle of securing the utmost possible out of other people compatible with safety to his clients and himself in calculations as to the exact pecuniary possibilities of all the relations of life he had come at last to think purely in terms of money money was now his light his medium for seeing that without which he was really unable to see really not cognisant of phenomena and to have this thing i hope i shall never know the value of money said to his face saddened and exasperated him he knew it to be nonsense or it would have frightened him what was the world coming to suddenly recollecting the story of young jolyon however he felt a little comforted for what could you expect with a father like that this turned his thoughts into a channel still less pleasant what was all this talk about soames and irene  as in all selfrespecting families an emporium had been established where family secrets were bartered and family stock priced it was known on forsyte change that irene regretted her marriage her regret was disapproved of she ought to have known her own mind no dependable woman made these mistakes  james reflected sourly that they had a nice house rather small in an excellent position no children and no money troubles soames was reserved about his affairs but he must be getting a very warm man he had a capital income from the businessfor soames like his father was a member of that wellknown firm of solicitors forsyte bustard and forsyteand had always been very careful he had done quite unusually well with some mortgages he had taken up tooa little timely foreclosuremost lucky hits  there was no reason why irene should not be happy yet they said shed been asking for a separate room he knew where that ended it wasnt as if soames drank  james looked at his daughterinlaw that unseen glance of his was cold and dubious appeal and fear were in it and a sense of personal grievance why should he be worried like this it was very likely all nonsense women were funny things they exaggerated so you didnt know what to believe and then nobody told him anything he had to find out everything for himself again he looked furtively at irene and across from her to soames the latter listening to aunt juley was looking up under his brows in the direction of bosinney  hes fond of her i know thought james look at the way hes always giving her things  and the extraordinary unreasonableness of her disaffection struck him with increased force  it was a pity too she was a taking little thing and he james would be really quite fond of her if shed only let him she had taken up lately with june that was doing her no good that was certainly doing her no good she was getting to have opinions of her own he didnt know what she wanted with anything of the sort shed a good home and everything she could wish for he felt that her friends ought to be chosen for her to go on like this was dangerous  june indeed with her habit of championing the unfortunate had dragged from irene a confession and in return had preached the necessity of facing the evil by separation if need be but in the face of these exhortations irene had kept a brooding silence as though she found terrible the thought of this struggle carried through in cold blood he would never give her up she had said to june  who cares june cried let him do what he likesyouve only to stick to it and she had not scrupled to say something of this sort at timothys james when he heard of it had felt a natural indignation and horror  what if irene were to take it into her head tohe could hardly frame the thoughtto leave soames but he felt this thought so unbearable that he at once put it away the shady visions it conjured up the sound of family tongues buzzing in his ears the horror of the conspicuous happening so close to him to one of his own children luckily she had no moneya beggarly fifty pound a year and he thought of the deceased heron who had had nothing to leave her with contempt brooding over his glass his long legs twisted under the table he quite omitted to rise when the ladies left the room he would have to speak to soameswould have to put him on his guard they could not go on like this now that such a contingency had occurred to him and he noticed with sour disfavour that june had left her wineglasses full of wine  that little things at the bottom of it all he mused irened never have thought of it herself james was a man of imagination  the voice of swithin roused him from his reverie  i gave four hundred pounds for it he was saying of course its a regular work of art  four hundred hm thats a lot of money chimed in nicholas  the object alluded to was an elaborate group of statuary in italian marble which placed upon a lofty stand also of marble diffused an atmosphere of culture throughout the room the subsidiary figures of which there were six female nude and of highly ornate workmanship were all pointing towards the central figure also nude and female who was pointing at herself and all this gave the observer a very pleasant sense of her extreme value aunt juley nearly opposite had had the greatest difficulty in not looking at it all the evening  old jolyon spoke it was he who had started the discussion  four hundred fiddlesticks dont tell me you gave four hundred for that  between the points of his collar swithins chin made the second painful oscillatory movement of the evening  fourhundredpounds of english money not a farthing less i dont regret it its not common englishits genuine modern italian  soames raised the corner of his lip in a smile and looked across at bosinney the architect was grinning behind the fumes of his cigarette now indeed he looked more like a buccaneer  theres a lot of work about it remarked james hastily who was really moved by the size of the group itd sell well at jobsons  the poor foreign deyvil that made it went on swithin asked me five hundredi gave him four its worth eight looked halfstarved poor deyvil  ah chimed in nicholas suddenly poor seedylookin chaps these artists its a wonder to me how they live now theres young flageoletti that fanny and the girls are always havin in to play the fiddle if he makes a hundred a year its as much as ever he does  james shook his head ah he said i dont know how they live  old jolyon had risen and cigar in mouth went to inspect the group at close quarters  wouldnt have given two for it he pronounced at last  soames saw his father and nicholas glance at each other anxiously and on the other side of swithin bosinney still shrouded in smoke  i wonder what he thinks of it thought soames who knew well enough that this group was hopelessly vieux jeu hopelessly of the last generation there was no longer any sale at jobsons for such works of art  swithins answer came at last you never knew anything about a statue youve got your pictures and thats all  old jolyon walked back to his seat puffing his cigar it was not likely that he was going to be drawn into an argument with an obstinate beggar like swithin pigheaded as a mule who had never known a statue from astraw hat  stucco was all he said  it had long been physically impossible for swithin to start his fist came down on the table  stucco i should like to see anything youve got in your house half as good  and behind his speech seemed to sound again that rumbling violence of primitive generations  it was james who saved the situation  now what do you say mr bosinney youre an architect you ought to know all about statues and things  every eye was turned upon bosinney all waited with a strange suspicious look for his answer  and soames speaking for the first time asked  yes bosinney what do you say  bosinney replied coolly  the work is a remarkable one  his words were addressed to swithin his eyes smiled slyly at old jolyon only soames remained unsatisfied  remarkable for what  for its naivete  the answer was followed by an impressive silence swithin alone was not sure whether a compliment was intended     chapter ivprojection of the house  soames forsyte walked out of his greenpainted front door three days after the dinner at swithins and looking back from across the square confirmed his impression that the house wanted painting  he had left his wife sitting on the sofa in the drawingroom her hands crossed in her lap manifestly waiting for him to go out this was not unusual it happened in fact every day  he could not understand what she found wrong with him it was not as if he drank did he run into debt or gamble or swear was he violent were his friends rackety did he stay out at night on the contrary  the profound subdued aversion which he felt in his wife was a mystery to him and a source of the most terrible irritation that she had made a mistake and did not love him had tried to love him and could not love him was obviously no reason  he that could imagine so outlandish a cause for his wifes not getting on with him was certainly no forsyte  soames was forced therefore to set the blame entirely down to his wife he had never met a woman so capable of inspiring affection they could not go anywhere without his seeing how all the men were attracted by her their looks manners voices betrayed it her behaviour under this attention had been beyond reproach that she was one of those womennot too common in the anglosaxon raceborn to be loved and to love who when not loving are not living had certainly never even occurred to him her power of attraction he regarded as part of her value as his property but it made him indeed suspect that she could give as well as receive and she gave him nothing then why did she marry me was his continual thought he had forgotten his courtship that year and a half when he had besieged and lain in wait for her devising schemes for her entertainment giving her presents proposing to her periodically and keeping her other admirers away with his perpetual presence he had forgotten the day when adroitly taking advantage of an acute phase of her dislike to her home surroundings he crowned his labours with success if he remembered anything it was the dainty capriciousness with which the goldhaired darkeyed girl had treated him he certainly did not remember the look on her facestrange passive appealingwhen suddenly one day she had yielded and said that she would marry him  it had been one of those real devoted wooings which books and people praise when the lover is at length rewarded for hammering the iron till it is malleable and all must be happy ever after as the wedding bells  soames walked eastwards mousing doggedly along on the shady side  the house wanted doing up unless he decided to move into the country and build  for the hundredth time that month he turned over this problem there was no use in rushing into things he was very comfortably off with an increasing income getting on for three thousand a year but his invested capital was not perhaps so large as his father believedjames had a tendency to expect that his children should be better off than they were i can manage eight thousand easily enough he thought without calling in either robertsons or nicholls  he had stopped to look in at a picture shop for soames was an amateur of pictures and had a littleroom in no 62 montpellier square full of canvases stacked against the wall which he had no room to hang he brought them home with him on his way back from the city generally after dark and would enter this room on sunday afternoons to spend hours turning the pictures to the light examining the marks on their backs and occasionally making notes  they were nearly all landscapes with figures in the foreground a sign of some mysterious revolt against london its tall houses its interminable streets where his life and the lives of his breed and class were passed every now and then he would take one or two pictures away with him in a cab and stop at jobsons on his way into the city  he rarely showed them to anyone irene whose opinion he secretly respected and perhaps for that reason never solicited had only been into the room on rare occasions in discharge of some wifely duty she was not asked to look at the pictures and she never did to soames this was another grievance he hated that pride of hers and secretly dreaded it  in the plateglass window of the picture shop his image stood and looked at him  his sleek hair under the brim of the tall hat had a sheen like the hat itself his cheeks pale and flat the line of his cleanshaven lips his firm chin with its greyish shaven tinge and the buttoned strictness of his black cutaway coat conveyed an appearance of reserve and secrecy of imperturbable enforced composure but his eyes coldgrey strainedlooking with a line in the brow between them examined him wistfully as if they knew of a secret weakness  he noted the subjects of the pictures the names of the painters made a calculation of their values but without the satisfaction he usually derived from this inward appraisement and walked on  no 62 would do well enough for another year if he decided to build the times were good for building money had not been so dear for years and the site he had seen at robin hill when he had gone down there in the spring to inspect the nicholl mortgagewhat could be better within twelve miles of hyde park corner the value of the land certain to go up would always fetch more than he gave for it so that a house if built in really good style was a firstclass investment  the notion of being the one member of his family with a country house weighed but little with him for to a true forsyte sentiment even the sentiment of social position was a luxury only to be indulged in after his appetite for more material pleasure had been satisfied  to get irene out of london away from opportunities of going about and seeing people away from her friends and those who put ideas into her head that was the thing she was too thick with june june disliked him he returned the sentiment they were of the same blood  it would be everything to get irene out of town the house would please her she would enjoy messing about with the decoration she was very artistic  the house must be in good style something that would always be certain to command a price something unique like that last house of parkes which had a tower but parkes had himself said that his architect was ruinous you never knew where you were with those fellows if they had a name they ran you into no end of expense and were conceited into the bargain  and a common architect was no goodthe memory of parkes tower precluded the employment of a common architect  this was why he had thought of bosinney since the dinner at swithins he had made enquiries the result of which had been meagre but encouraging one of the new school  clever  as clever as you likea bita bit up in the air  he had not been able to discover what houses bosinney had built nor what his charges were the impression he gathered was that he would be able to make his own terms the more he reflected on the idea the more he liked it it would be keeping the thing in the family with forsytes almost an instinct and he would be able to get favourednation if not nominal termsonly fair considering the chance to bosinney of displaying his talents for this house must be no common edifice  soames reflected complacently on the work it would be sure to bring the young man for like every forsyte he could be a thorough optimist when there was anything to be had out of it  bosinneys office was in sloane street close at hand so that he would be able to keep his eye continually on the plans  again irene would not be to likely to object to leave london if her greatest friends lover were given the job junes marriage might depend on it irene could not decently stand in the way of junes marriage she would never do that he knew her too well and june would be pleased of this he saw the advantage  bosinney looked clever but he had alsoandit was one of his great attractionsan air as if he did not quite know on which side his bread were buttered he should be easy to deal with in money matters soames made this reflection in no defrauding spirit it was the natural attitude of his mindof the mind of any good business manof all those thousands of good business men through whom he was threading his way up ludgate hill  thus he fulfilled the inscrutable laws of his great classof human nature itselfwhen he reflected with a sense of comfort that bosinney would be easy to deal with in money matters  while he elbowed his way on his eyes which he usually kept fixed on the ground before his feet were attracted upwards by the dome of st pauls it had a peculiar fascination for him that old dome and not once but twice or three times a week would he halt in his daily pilgrimage to enter beneath and stop in the side aisles for five or ten minutes scrutinizing the names and epitaphs on the monuments the attraction for him of this great church was inexplicable unless it enabled him to concentrate his thoughts on the business of the day if any affair of particular moment or demanding peculiar acuteness was weighing on his mind he invariably went in to wander with mouselike attention from epitaph to epitaph then retiring in the same noiseless way he would hold steadily on up cheapside a thought more of dogged purpose in his gait as though he had seen something which he had made up his mind to buy  he went in this morning but instead of stealing from monument to monument turned his eyes upwards to the columns and spacings of the walls and remained motionless  his uplifted face with the awed and wistful look which faces take on themselves in church was whitened to a chalky hue in the vast building his gloved hands were clasped in front over the handle of his umbrella he lifted them some sacred inspiration perhaps had come to him  yes he thought i must have room to hang my pictures  that evening on his return from the city he called at bosinneys office he found the architect in his shirtsleeves smoking a pipe and ruling off lines on a plan soames refused a drink and came at once to the point  if youve nothing better to do on sunday come down with me to robin hill and give me your opinion on a building site  are you going to build  perhaps said soames but dont speak of it i just want your opinion  quite so said the architect  soames peered about the room  youre rather high up here he remarked  any information he could gather about the nature and scope of bosinneys business would be all to the good  it does well enough for me so far answered the architect youre accustomed to the swells  he knocked out his pipe but replaced it empty between his teeth it assisted him perhaps to carry on the conversation soames noted a hollow in each cheek made as it were by suction  what do you pay for an office like this said he  fifty too much replied bosinney  this answer impressed soames favourably  i suppose it is dear he said ill call for youon sunday about eleven  the following sunday therefore he called for bosinney in a hansom and drove him to the station on arriving at robin hill they found no cab and started to walk the mile and a half to the site  it was the 1st of augusta perfect day with a burning sun and cloudless skyand in the straight narrow road leading up the hill their feet kicked up a yellow dust  gravel soil remarked soames and sideways he glanced at the coat bosinney wore into the sidepockets of this coat were thrust bundles of papers and under one arm was carried a queerlooking stick soames noted these and other peculiarities  no one but a clever man or indeed a buccaneer would have taken such liberties with his appearance and though these eccentricities were revolting to soames he derived a certain satisfaction from them as evidence of qualities by which he must inevitably profit if the fellow could build houses what did his clothes matter  i told you he said that i want this house to be a surprise so dont say anything about it i never talk of my affairs until theyre carried through  bosinney nodded  let women into your plans pursued soames and you never know where itll end  ah said bosinney women are the devil  this feeling had long been at thebottom of soamess heart he had never however put it into words  oh he muttered so youre beginning to he stopped but added with an uncontrollable burst of spite junes got a temper of her ownalways had  a tempers not a bad thing in an angel  soames had never called irene an angel he could not so have violated his best instincts letting other people into the secret of her value and giving himself away he made no reply  they had struck into a halfmade road across a warren a carttrack led at rightangles to a gravel pit beyond which the chimneys of a cottage rose amongst a clump of trees at the border of a thick wood tussocks of feathery grass covered the rough surface of the ground and out of these the larks soared into the haze of sunshine on the far horizon over a countless succession of fields and hedges rose a line of downs  soames led till they had crossed to the far side and there he stopped it was the chosen site but now that he was about to divulge the spot to another he had become uneasy  the agent lives in that cottage he said hell give us some lunchwed better have lunch before we go into this matter  he again took the lead to the cottage where the agent a tall man named oliver with a heavy face and grizzled beard welcomed them during lunch which soames hardly touched he kept looking at bosinney and once or twice passed his silk handkerchief stealthily over his forehead the meal came to an end at last and bosinney rose  i dare say youve got business to talk over he said ill just go and nose about a bit without waiting for a reply he strolled out  soames was solicitor to this estate and he spent nearly an hour in the agents company looking at groundplans and discussing the nicholl and other mortgages it was as it were by an afterthought that he brought up the question of the building site  your people he said ought to come down in their price to me considering that i shall be the first to build  oliver shook his head  the site youve fixed on sir he said is the cheapest weve got sites at the top of the slope are dearer by a good bit  mind said soames ive not decided its quite possible i shant build at all the ground rents very high  well mr forsyte i shall be sorry if you go off and i think youll make a mistake sir theres not a bit of land near london with such a view as this nor one thats cheaper all things considered weve only to advertise to get a mob of people after it  they looked at each other their faces said very plainly i respect you as a man of business and you cant expect me to believe a word you say  well repeated soames i havent made up my mind the thing will very likely go off with these words taking up his umbrella he put his chilly hand into the agents withdrew it without the faintest pressure and went out into the sun  he walked slowly back towards the site in deep thought his instinct told him that what the agent had said was true a cheap site and the beauty of it was that he knew the agent did not really think it cheap so that his own intuitive knowledge was a victory over the agents  cheap or not i mean to have it he thought  the larks sprang up in front of his feet the air was full of butterflies a sweet fragrance rose from the wild grasses the sappy scent of the bracken stole forth from the wood where hidden in the depths pigeons were cooing and from afar on the warm breeze came the rhythmic chiming of church bells  soames walked with his eyes on the ground his lips opening and closing as though in anticipation of a delicious morsel but when he arrived at the site bosinney was nowhere to be seen after waiting some little time he crossed the warren in the direction of the slope he would have shouted but dreaded the sound of his voice  the warren was as lonely as a prairie its silence only broken by the rustle of rabbits bolting to their holes and the song of the larks  soames the pioneerleader of the great forsyte army advancing to the civilization of this wilderness felt his spirit daunted by the loneliness by the invisible singing and the hot sweet air he had begun to retrace his steps when he at last caught sight of bosinney  the architect was sprawling under a large oak tree whose trunk with a huge spread of bough and foliage ragged with age stood on the verge of the rise  soames had to touch him on the shoulder before he looked up  hallo forsyte he said ive found the very place for your house look here  soames stood and looked then he said coldly  you may be very clever but this site will cost me half as much again  hang the cost man look at the view  almost from their feet stretched ripe corn dipping to a small dark copse beyond a plain of fields and hedges spread to the distant greybluedowns in a silver streak to the right could be seen the line of the river  the sky was so blue and the sun so bright that an eternal summer seemed to reign over this prospect thistledown floated round them enraptured by the serenity of the ether the heat danced over the corn and pervading all was a soft insensible hum like the murmur of bright minutes holding revel between earth and heaven  soames looked in spite of himself something swelled in his breast to live here in sight of all this to be able to point it out to his friends to talk of it to possess it his cheeks flushed the warmth the radiance the glow were sinking into his senses as four years before irenes beauty had sunk into his senses and made him long for her he stole a glance at bosinney whose eyes the eyes of the coachmans halftame leopard seemed running wild over the landscape the sunlight had caught the promontories of the fellows face the bumpy cheekbones the point of his chin the vertical ridges above his brow and soames watched this rugged enthusiastic careless face with an unpleasant feeling  a long soft ripple of wind flowed over the corn and brought a puff of warm air into their faces  i could build you a teaser here said bosinney breaking the silence at last  i dare say replied soames drily you havent got to pay for it  for about eight thousand i could build you a palace  soames had become very palea struggle was going on within him he dropped his eyes and said stubbornly  i cant afford it  and slowly with his mousing walk he led the way back to the first site  they spent some time there going into particulars of the projected house and then soames returned to the agents cottage  he came out in about half an hour and joining bosinney started for the station  well he said hardly opening his lips ive taken that site of yours after all  and again he was silent confusedly debating how it was that this fellow whom by habit he despised should have overborne his own decision     chapter va forsyte menage  like the enlightened thousands of his class and generation in this great city of london who no longer believe in red velvet chairs and know that groups of modern italian marble are vieux jeu soames forsyte inhabited a house which did what it could it owned a copper door knocker of individual design windows which had been altered to open outwards hanging flower boxes filled with fuchsias and at the back a great feature a little court tiled with jadegreen tiles and surrounded by pink hydrangeas in peacockblue tubs here under a parchmentcoloured japanese sunshade covering the whole end inhabitants or visitors could be screened from the eyes of the curious while they drank tea and examined at their leisure the latest of soamess little silver boxes  the inner decoration favoured the first empire and william morris for its size the house was commodious there were countless nooks resembling birds nests and little things made of silver were deposited like eggs  in this general perfection two kinds of fastidiousness were at war there lived here a mistress who would have dwelt daintily on a desert island a master whose daintiness was as it were an investment cultivated by the owner for his advancement in accordance with the laws of competition this competitive daintiness had caused soames in his marlborough days to be the first boy into white waistcoats in summer and corduroy waistcoats in winter had prevented him from ever appearing in public with his tie climbing up his collar and induced him to dust his patent leather boots before a great multitude assembled on speech day to hear him recite moliere  skinlike immaculateness had grown over soames as over many londoners impossible to conceive of him with a hair out of place a tie deviating oneeighth of an inch from the perpendicular a collar unglossed he would not have gone without a bath for worldsit was the fashion to take baths and how bitter was his scorn of people who omitted them  but irene could be imagined like some nymph bathing in wayside streams for the joy of the freshness and of seeing her own fair body  in this conflict throughout the house the woman had gone to the wall as in the struggle between saxon and celt still going on within the nation the more impressionable and receptive temperament had had forced on it a conventional superstructure  thus the house had acquired a close resemblance to hundreds of other houses with the same high aspirations having become that very charming little house of the soames forsytes quite individual my dearreally elegant  for soames forsyteread james peabody thomas atkins or emmanuel spagnoletti the name in fact of any uppermiddle class englishman in london with any pretensions to taste and though the decoration be different the phrase is just  on the evening of august 8 a week after the expedition to robin hill in the diningroom of this housequite individual my dearreally elegantsoames and irene were seated at dinner a hot dinner on sundays was a little distinguishing elegance common to this house and many others early in married life soames had laid down the rule the servants must give us hot dinner on sundaystheyve nothing to do but play the concertina  the custom had produced no revolution forto soames a rather deplorable signservants were devoted to irene who in defiance of all safe tradition appeared to recognise their right to a share in the weaknesses of human nature  the happy pair were seated not opposite each other but rectangularly at the handsome rosewood table they dined without a clotha distinguishing eleganceand so far had not spoken a word  soames liked to talk during dinner about business or what he had been buying and so long as he talked irenes silence did not distress him this evening he had found it impossible to talk the decision to build had been weighing on his mind all the week and he had made up his mind to tell her  his nervousness about this disclosure irritated him profoundly she had no business to make him feel like thata wife and a husband being one person she had not looked at him once since they sat down and he wondered what on earth she had been thinking about all the time it was hard when a man worked as he did making money for heryes and with an ache in his heartthat she should sit there lookinglooking as if she saw the walls of the room closing in it was enough to make a man get up and leave the table  the light from the roseshaded lamp fell on her neck and armssoames liked her to dine in a low dress it gave him an inexpressible feeling of superiority to the majority of his acquaintance whose wives were contented with their best high frocks or with teagowns when they dined at home under that rosy light her ambercoloured hair and fair skin made strange contrast with her dark brown eyes  could a man own anything prettier than this diningtable with its deep tints the starry softpetalled roses the rubycoloured glass and quaint silver furnishing could a man own anything prettier than the woman who sat at it gratitude was no virtue among forsytes who competitive and full of commonsense had no occasion for it and soames only experienced a sense of exasperation amounting to pain that he did not own her as it was his right to own her that he could not as by stretching out his hand to that rose pluck her and sniff the very secrets of her heart  out of his other property out of all the things he had collected his silver his pictures his houses his investments he got a secret and intimate feeling out of her he got none  in this house of his there was writing on every wall his businesslike temperament protested against a mysterious warning that she was not made for him he had married this woman conquered her made her his own and it seemed to him contrary to the most fundamental of all laws the law of possession that he could do no more than own her bodyif indeed he could do that which he was beginning to doubt if any one had asked him if he wanted to own her soul the question would have seemed to him both ridiculous and sentimental but he did so want and the writing said he never would  she was ever silent passive gracefully averse as though terrified lest by word motion or sign she might lead him to believe that she was fond of him and he asked himself must i always go on like this  like most novel readers of his generation and soames was a great novel reader literature coloured his view of life and he had imbibed the belief that it was only a question of time  in the end the husband always gained the affection of his wife even in those casesa class of book he was not very fond ofwhich ended in tragedy the wife always died with poignant regrets on her lips or if it were the husband who diedunpleasant thoughtthrew herself on his body in an agony of remorse  he often took irene to the theatre instinctively choosing the modern society plays with the modern society conjugal problem so fortunately different from any conjugal problem in real life he found that they too always ended in the same way even when there was a lover in the case while he was watching the play soames often sympathized with the lover but before he reached home again driving with irene in a hansom he saw that this would not do and he was glad the play had ended as it had there was one class of husband that had just then come into fashion the strong rather rough but extremely sound man who was peculiarly successful at the end of the play with this person soames was really not in sympathy and had it not been for his own position would have expressed his disgust with the fellow but he was so conscious of how vital to himself was the necessity for being a successful even a strong husband that he never spoke of a distaste born perhaps by the perverse processes of nature out of a secret fund of brutality in himself  but irenes silence this evening was exceptional he had never before seen such an expression on her face and since it is always the unusual which alarms soames was alarmed he ate his savoury and hurried the maid as she swept off the crumbs with the silver sweeper when she had left the room he filled his glass with wine and said  anybody been here this afternoon  june  what did she want it was an axiom with the forsytes that people did not go anywhere unless they wanted something came to talk about her lover i suppose  irene made no reply  it looks to me continued soames as if she were sweeter on him than he is on her shes always following him about  irenes eyes made him feel uncomfortable  youve no business to say such a thing she exclaimed  why not anybody can see it  they cannot and if they could its disgraceful to say so  soamess composure gave way  youre a pretty wife he said but secretly he wondered at the heat of her reply it was unlike her youre cracked about june i can tell you one thing now that she has the buccaneer in tow she doesnt care twopence about you and youll find it out but you wont see so much of her in future were going to live in the country  he had been glad to get his news out under cover of this burst of irritation he had expected a cry of dismay the silence with which his pronouncement was received alarmed him  you dont seem interested he was obliged to add  i knew it already  he looked at her sharply  who told you  june  how did she know  irene did not answer baffled and uncomfortable he said  its a fine thing for bosinney itll be the making of him i suppose shes told you all about it  yes  there was another pause and then soames said  i suppose you dont want to go  irene made no reply  well i cant tell what you want you never seem contented here  have my wishes anything to do with it  she took the vase of roses and left the room soames remained seated was it for this that he had signed that contract was it for this that he was going to spend some ten thousand pounds bosinneys phrase came back to him women are the devil  but presently he grew calmer it might have been worse she might have flared up he had expected something more than this it was lucky after all that june had broken the ice for him she must have wormed it out of bosinney he might have known she would  he lighted his cigarette after all irene had not made a scene she would come roundthat was the best of her she was cold but not sulky and puffing the cigarette smoke at a ladybird on the shining table he plunged into a reverie about the house it was no good worrying he would go and make it up presently she would be sitting out there in the dark under the japanese sunshade knitting a beautiful warm night  in truth june had come in that afternoon with shining eyes and the words soames is a brick its splendid for philthe very thing for him  irenes face remaining dark and puzzled she went on  your new house at robin hill of course what dont you know  irene did not know  oh then i suppose i oughtnt to have told you looking impatiently at her friend she cried you look as if you didnt care dont you see its what ive been praying forthe very chance hes been wanting all this time now youll see what he can do and thereupon she poured out the whole story  since her own engagement she had not seemed much interested in her friends position the hours she spent with irene were given to confidences of her own and at times for all her affectionate pity it was impossible to keep out of her smile a trace of compassionate contempt for the woman who had made such a mistake in her lifesuch a vast ridiculous mistake  hes to have all the decorations as wella free hand its perfect june broke into laughter her little figure quivered gleefully she raised her hand and struck a blow at a muslin curtain do you know i even asked uncle james but with a sudden dislike to mentioning that incident she stopped and presently finding her friend so unresponsive went away she looked back from the pavement and irene was still standing in the doorway in response to her farewell wave irene put her hand to her brow and turning slowly shut the door  soames went to the drawingroom presently and peered at her through the window  out in the shadow of the japanese sunshade she was sitting very still the lace on her white shoulders stirring with the soft rise and fall of her bosom  but about this silent creature sitting there so motionless in the dark there seemed a warmth a hidden fervour of feeling as if the whole of her being had been stirred and some change were taking place in its very depths  he stole back to the diningroom unnoticed     chapter vijames at large  it was not long before soamess determination to build went the round of the family and created the flutter that any decision connected with property should make among forsytes  it was not his fault for he had been determined that no one should know june in the fulness of her heart had told mrs small giving her leave only to tell aunt annshe thought it would cheer her the poor old sweet for aunt ann had kept her room now for many days  mrs small told aunt ann at once who smiling as she lay back on her pillows said in her distinct trembling old voice  its very nice for dear june but i hope they will be carefulits rather dangerous  when she was left alone again a frown like a cloud presaging a rainy morrow crossed her face  while she was lying there so many days the process of recharging her will went on all the time it spread to her face too and tightening movements were always in action at the corners of her lips  the maid smither who had been in her service since girlhood and was spoken of as smithera good girlbut so slowthe maid smither performed every morning with extreme punctiliousness the crowning ceremony of that ancient toilet taking from the recesses of their pure white bandbox those flat grey curls the insignia of personal dignity she placed them securely in her mistresss hands and turned her back  and every day aunts juley and hester were required to come and report on timothy what news there was of nicholas whether dear june had succeeded in getting jolyon to shorten the engagement now that mr bosinney was building soames a house whether young rogers wife was reallyexpecting how the operation on archie had succeeded and what swithin had done about that empty house in wigmore street where the tenant had lost all his money and treated him so badly above all about soames was irene stillstill asking for a separate room and every morning smither was told i shall be coming down this afternoon smither about two oclock i shall want your arm after all these days in bed  after telling aunt ann mrs small had spoken of the house in the strictest confidence to mrs nicholas who in her turn had asked winifred dartie for confirmation supposing of course that being soamess sister she would know all about it through her it had in due course come round to the ears of james he had been a good deal agitated  nobody he said told him anything and rather than go direct to soames himself of whose taciturnity he was afraid he took his umbrella and went round to timothys  he found mrs septimus and hester who had been toldshe was so safe she found it tiring to talk ready and indeed eager to discuss the news it was very good of dear soames they thought to employ mr bosinney but rather risky what had george named him the buccaneer how droll but george was always droll however it would be all in the family they supposed they must really look upon mr bosinney as belonging to the family though it seemed strange  james here broke in  nobody knows anything about him i dont see what soames wants with a young man like that i shouldnt be surprised if irene had put her oar in i shall speak to  soames interposed aunt juley told mr bosinney that he didnt wish it mentioned he wouldnt like it to be talked about im sure and if timothy knew he would be very vexed i  james put his hand behind his ear  what he said im getting very deaf i suppose i dont hear people emilys got a bad toe we shant be able to start for wales till the end of the month theres always something and having got what he wanted he took his hat and went away  it was a fine afternoon and he walked across the park towards soamess where he intended to dine for emilys toe kept her in bed and rachel and cicely were on a visit to the country he took the slanting path from the bayswater side of the row to the knightsbridge gate across a pasture of short burnt grass dotted with blackened sheep strewn with seated couples and strange waifs lying prone on their faces like corpses on a field over which the wave of battle has rolled  he walked rapidly his head bent looking neither to right nor left the appearance of this park the centre of his own battlefield where he had all his life been fighting excited no thought or speculation in his mind these corpses flung down there from out the press and turmoil of the struggle these pairs of lovers sitting cheek by jowl for an hour of idle elysium snatched from the monotony of their treadmill awakened no fancies in his mind he had outlived that kind of imagination his nose like the nose of a sheep was fastened to the pastures on which he browsed  one of his tenants had lately shown a disposition to be behindhand in his rent and it had become a grave question whether he had not better turn him out at once and so run the risk of not reletting before christmas swithin had just been let in very badly but it had served him righthe had held on too long  he pondered this as he walked steadily holding his umbrella carefully by the wood just below the crook of the handle so as to keep the ferule off the ground and not fray the silk in the middle and with his thin high shoulders stooped his long legs moving with swift mechanical precision this passage through the park where the sun shone with a clear flame on so much idlenesson so many human evidences of the remorseless battle of property raging beyond its ringwas like the flight of some land bird across the sea  he felt a touch on the arm as he came out at albert gate  it was soames who crossing from the shady side of piccadilly where he had been walking home from the office had suddenly appeared alongside  your mothers in bed said james i was just coming to you but i suppose i shall be in the way  the outward relations between james and his son were marked by a lack of sentiment peculiarly forsytean but for all that the two were by no means unattached perhaps they regarded one another as an investment certainly they were solicitous of each others welfare glad of each others company they had never exchanged two words upon the more intimate problems of life or revealed in each others presence the existence of any deep feeling  something beyond the power of wordanalysis bound them together something hidden deep in the fibre of nations and familiesfor blood they say is thicker than waterand neither of them was a coldblooded man indeed in james love of his children was now the prime motive of his existence to have creatures who were parts of himself to whom he might transmit the money he saved was at the root of his saving and at seventyfive what was left that could give him pleasure butsaving the kernel of life was in this saving for his children  than james forsyte notwithstanding all his jonahisms there was no saner man if the leading symptom of sanity as we are told is selfpreservation though without doubt timothy went too far in all this london of which he owned so much and loved with such a dumb love as the centre of his opportunities he had the marvellous instinctive sanity of the middle class in himmore than in jolyon with his masterful will and his moments of tenderness and philosophymore than in swithin the martyr to crankinessnicholas the sufferer from abilityand roger the victim of enterprisebeat the true pulse of compromise of all the brothers he was least remarkable in mind and person and for that reason more likely to live for ever  to james more than to any of the others was the family significant and dear there had always been something primitive and cosy in his attitude towards life he loved the family hearth he loved gossip and he loved grumbling all his decisions were formed of a cream which he skimmed off the family mind and through that family off the minds of thousands of other families of similar fibre year after year week after week he went to timothys and in his brothers front drawingroomhis legs twisted his long white whiskers framing his cleanshaven mouthwould sit watching the family pot simmer the cream rising to the top and he would go away sheltered refreshed comforted with an indefinable sense of comfort  beneath the adamant of his selfpreserving instinct there was much real softness in james a visit to timothys was like an hour spent in the lap of a mother and the deep craving he himself had for the protection of the family wing reacted in turn on his feelings towards his own children it was a nightmare to him to think of them exposed to the treatment of the world in money health or reputation when his old friend john streets son volunteered for special service he shook his head querulously and wondered what john street was about to allow it and when young street was assagaied he took it so much to heart that he made a point of calling everywhere with the special object of saying he knew how it would behed no patience with them  when his soninlaw dartie had that financial crisis due to speculation in oil shares james made himself ill worrying over it the knell of all prosperity seemed to have sounded it took him three months and a visit to badenbaden to get better there was something terrible in the idea that but for his jamess money darties name might have appeared in the bankruptcy list  composed of a physiological mixture so sound that if he had an earache he thought he was dying he regarded the occasional ailments of his wife and children as in the nature of personal grievances special interventions of providence for the purpose of destroying his peace of mind but he did not believe at all in the ailments of people outside his own immediate family affirming them in every case to be due to neglected liver  his universal comment was what can they expect i have it myself if im not careful  when he went to soamess that evening he felt that life was hard on him there was emily with a bad toe and rachel gadding about in the country he got no sympathy from anybody and ann she was illhe did not believe she would last through the summer he had called there three times now without her being able to see him and this idea of soamess building a house that would have to be looked into as to the trouble with irene he didnt know what was to come of thatanything might come of it  he entered 62 montpellier square with the fullest intentions of being miserable it was already halfpast seven and irene dressed for dinner was seated in the drawingroom she was wearing her goldcoloured frockfor having been displayed at a dinnerparty a soiree and a dance it was now to be worn at homeand she had adorned the bosom with a cascade of lace on which jamess eyes riveted themselves at once  where do you get your things he said in an aggravated voice i never see rachel and cicely looking half so well that rosepoint nowthats not real  irene came close to prove to him that he was in error  and in spite of himself james felt the influence of her deference of the faint seductive perfume exhaling from her no selfrespecting forsyte surrendered at a blow so he merely said he didnt knowhe expected she was spending a pretty penny on dress  the gong sounded and putting her white arm within his irene took him into the diningroom she seated him in soamess usual place round the corner on her left the light fell softly there so that he would not be worried by the gradual dying of the day and she began to talk to him about himself  presently over james came a change like the mellowing that steals upon a fruit in the sun a sense of being caressed and praised and petted and all without the bestowal of a single caress or word of praise he felt that what he was eating was agreeing with him he could not get that feeling at home he did not know when he had enjoyed a glass of champagne so much and on inquiring the brand and price was surprised to find that it was one of which he had a large stock himself but could never drink he instantly formed the resolution to let his wine merchant know that he had been swindled  looking up from his food he remarked  youve a lot of nice things about the place now what did you give for that sugarsifter shouldnt wonder if it was worth money  he was particularly pleased with the appearance of a picture on the wall opposite which he himself had given them  id no idea it was so good he said  they rose to go into the drawingroom and james followed irene closely  thats what i call a capital little dinner he murmured breathing pleasantly down on her shoulder nothing heavyand not too frenchified but i cant get it at home i pay my cook sixty pounds a year but she cant give me a dinner like that  he had as yet made no allusion to the building of the house nor did he when soames pleading the excuse of business betook himself to the room at the top where he kept his pictures  james was left alone with his daughterinlaw the glow of the wine and of an excellent liqueur was still within him he felt quite warm towards her she was really a taking little thing she listened to you and seemed to understand what you were saying and while talking he kept examining her figure from her bronzecoloured shoes to the waved gold of her hair she was leaning back in an empire chair her shoulders poised against the topher body flexibly straight and unsupported from the hips swaying when she moved as though giving to the arms of a lover her lips were smiling her eyes halfclosed  it may have been a recognition of danger in the very charm of her attitude or a twang of digestion that caused a sudden dumbness to fall on james he did not remember ever having been quite alone with irene before and as he looked at her an odd feeling crept over him as though he had come across something strange and foreign  now what was she thinking aboutsitting back like that  thus when he spoke it was in a sharper voice as if he had been awakened from a pleasant dream  what dyou do with yourself all day he said you never come round to park lane  she seemed to be making very lame excuses and james did not look at her he did not want to believe that she was really avoiding themit would mean too much  i expect the fact is you havent time he said youre always about with june i expect youre useful to her with her young man chaperoning and one thing and another they tell me shes never at home now your uncle jolyon he doesnt like it i fancy being left so much alone as he is they tell me shes always hanging about for this young bosinney i suppose he comes here every day now what do you think of him dyou think he knows his own mind he seems to me a poor thing i should say the grey mare was the better horse  the colour deepened in irenes face and james watched her suspiciously  perhaps you dont quite understand mr bosinney she said  dont understand him james hummed out why notyou can see hes one of these artistic chaps they say hes cleverthey all think theyre clever you know more about him than i do he added and again his suspicious glance rested on her  he is designing a house for soames she said softly evidently trying to smooth things over  that brings me to what i was going to say continued james i dont know what soames wants with a young man like that why doesnt he go to a firstrate man  perhaps mr bosinney is firstrate  james rose and took a turn with bent head  thats it he said you young people you all stick together you all think you know best  halting his tall lank figure before her he raised a finger and levelled it at her bosom as though bringing an indictment against her beauty  all i can say is these artistic people or whatever they call themselves theyre as unreliable as they can be and my advice to you is dont you have too much to do with him  irene smiled and in the curve of her lips was a strange provocation she seemed to have lost her deference her breast rose and fell as though with secret anger she drew her hands inwards from their rest on the arms of her chair until the tips of her fingers met and her dark eyes looked unfathomably at james  the latter gloomily scrutinized the floor  i tell you my opinion he said its a pity you havent got a child to think about and occupy you  a brooding look came instantly on irenes face and even james became conscious of the rigidity that took possession of her whole figure beneath the softness of its silk and lace clothing  he was frightened by the effect he had produced and like most men with but little courage he sought at once to justify himself by bullying  you dont seem to care about going about why dont you drive down to hurlingham with us and go to the theatre now and then at your time of life you ought to take an interest in things youre a young woman  the brooding look darkened on her face he grew nervous  well i know nothing about it he said nobody tells me anything soames ought to be able to take care of himself if he cant take care of himself he mustnt look to methats all  biting the corner of his forefinger he stole a cold sharp look at his daughterinlaw  he encountered her eyes fixed on his own so dark and deep that he stopped and broke into a gentle perspiration  well i must be going he said after a short pause and a minute later rose with a slight appearance of surprise as though he had expected to be asked to stop giving his hand to irene he allowed himself to be conducted to the door and let out into the street he would not have a cab he would walk irene was to say goodnight to soames for him and if she wanted a little gaiety well he would drive her down to richmond any day  he walked home and going upstairs woke emily out of the first sleep she had had for four and twenty hours to tell her that it was his impression things were in a bad way at soamess on this theme he descanted for half an hour until at last saying that he would not sleep a wink he turned on his side and instantly began to snore  in montpellier square soames who had come from the picture room stood invisible at the top of the stairs watching irene sort the letters brought by the last post she turned back into the drawingroom but in a minute came out and stood as if listening then she came stealing up the stairs with a kitten in her arms he could see her face bent over the little beast which was purring against her neck why couldnt she look at him like that  suddenly she saw him and her face changed  any letters for me he said  three  he stood aside and without another word she passed on into the bedroom     chapter viiold jolyons peccadillo  old jolyon came out of lords cricket ground that same afternoon with the intention of going home he had not reached hamilton terrace before he changed his mind and hailing a cab gave the driver an address in wistaria avenue he had taken a resolution  june had hardly been at home at all that week she had given him nothing of her company for a long time past not in fact since she had become engaged to bosinney he never asked her for her company it was not his habit to ask people for things she had just that one idea nowbosinney and his affairsand she left him stranded in his great house with a parcel of servants and not a soul to speak to from morning to night his club was closed for cleaning his boards in recess there was nothing therefore to take him into the city june had wanted him to go away she would not go herself because bosinney was in london  but where was he to go by himself he could not go abroad alone the sea upset his liver he hated hotels roger went to a hydropathiche was not going to begin that at his time of life those newfangled places were all humbug  with such formulas he clothed to himself the desolation of his spirit the lines down his face deepening his eyes day by day looking forth with the melancholy which sat so strangely on a face wont to be strong and serene  and so that afternoon he took this journey through st johns wood in the goldenlight that sprinkled the rounded green bushes of the acacias before the little houses in the summer sunshine that seemed holding a revel over the little gardens and he looked about him with interest for this was a district which no forsyte entered without open disapproval and secret curiosity  his cab stopped in front of a small house of that peculiar buff colour which implies a long immunity from paint it had an outer gate and a rustic approach  he stepped out his bearing extremely composed his massive head with its drooping moustache and wings of white hair very upright under an excessively large top hat his glance firm a little angry he had been driven into this  mrs jolyon forsyte at home  oh yes sirwhat name shall i say if you please sir  old jolyon could not help twinkling at the little maid as he gave his name she seemed to him such a funny little toad  and he followed her through the dark hall into a small double drawingroom where the furniture was covered in chintz and the little maid placed him in a chair  theyre all in the garden sir if youll kindly take a seat ill tell them  old jolyon sat down in the chintzcovered chair and looked around him the whole place seemed to him as he would have expressed it pokey there was a certainhe could not tell exactly whatair of shabbiness or rather of making two ends meet about everything as far as he could see not a single piece of furniture was worth a fivepound note the walls distempered rather a long time ago were decorated with watercolour sketches across the ceiling meandered a long crack  these little houses were all old secondrate concerns he should hope the rent was under a hundred a year it hurt him more than he could have said to think of a forsytehis own son living in such a place  the little maid came back would he please to go down into the garden  old jolyon marched out through the french windows in descending the steps he noticed that they wanted painting  young jolyon his wife his two children and his dog balthasar were all out there under a peartree  this walk towards them was the most courageous act of old jolyons life but no muscle of his face moved no nervous gesture betrayed him he kept his deepset eyes steadily on the enemy  in those two minutes he demonstrated to perfection all that unconscious soundness balance and vitality of fibre that made of him and so many others of his class the core of the nation in the unostentatious conduct of their own affairs to the neglect of everything else they typified the essential individualism born in the briton from the natural isolation of his countrys life  the dog balthasar sniffed round the edges of his trousers this friendly and cynical mongreloffspring of a liaison between a russian poodle and a foxterrierhad a nose for the unusual  the strange greetings over old jolyon seated himself in a wicker chair and his two grandchildren one on each side of his knees looked at him silently never having seen so old a man  they were unlike as though recognising the difference set between them by the circumstances of their births jolly the child of sin pudgyfaced with his towcoloured hair brushed off his forehead and a dimple in his chin had an air of stubborn amiability and the eyes of a forsyte little holly the child of wedlock was a darkskinned solemn soul with her mothers grey and wistful eyes  the dog balthasar having walked round the three small flowerbeds to show his extreme contempt for things at large had also taken a seat in front of old jolyon and oscillating a tail curled by nature tightly over his back was staring up with eyes that did not blink  even in the garden that sense of things being pokey haunted old jolyon the wicker chair creaked under his weight the gardenbeds looked daverdy on the far side under the smutstained wall cats had made a path  while he and his grandchildren thus regarded each other with the peculiar scrutiny curious yet trustful that passes between the very young and the very old young jolyon watched his wife  the colour had deepened in her thin oval face with its straight brows and large grey eyes her hair brushed in fine high curves back from her forehead was going grey like his own and this greyness made the sudden vivid colour in her cheeks painfully pathetic  the look on her face such as he had never seen there before such as she had always hidden from him was full of secret resentments and longings and fears her eyes under their twitching brows stared painfully and she was silent  jolly alone sustained the conversation he had many possessions and was anxious that his unknown friend with extremely large moustaches and hands all covered with blue veins who sat with legs crossed like his own father a habit he was himself trying to acquire should know it but being a forsyte though not yet quite eight years old he made no mention of the thing at the moment dearest to his hearta camp of soldiers in a shopwindow which his father had promised to buy no doubt it seemed to him too precious a tempting of providence to mention it yet  and the sunlight played through the leaves on that little party of the three generations grouped tranquilly under the peartree which had long borne no fruit  old jolyons furrowed face was reddening patchily as old mens faces redden in the sun he took one of jollys hands in his own the boy climbed on to his knee and little holly mesmerized by this sight crept up to them the sound of the dog balthasars scratching arose rhythmically  suddenly young mrs jolyon got up and hurried indoors a minute later her husband muttered an excuse and followed old jolyon was left alone with his grandchildren  and nature with her quaint irony began working in him one of her strange revolutions following her cyclic laws into the depths of his heart and that tenderness for little children that passion for the beginnings of life which had once made him forsake his son and follow june now worked in him to forsake june and follow these littler things youth like a flame burned ever in his breast and to youth he turned to the round little limbs so reckless that wanted care to the small round faces so unreasonably solemn or bright to the treble tongues and the shrill chuckling laughter to the insistent tugging hands and the feel of small bodies against his legs to all that was young and young and once more young and his eyes grew soft his voice and thinveined hands soft and soft his heart within him and to those small creatures he became at once a place of pleasure a place where they were secure and could talk and laugh and play till like sunshine there radiated from old jolyons wicker chair the perfect gaiety of three hearts  but with young jolyon following to his wifes room it was different  he found her seated on a chair before her dressingglass with her hands before her face  her shoulders were shaking with sobs this passion of hers for suffering was mysterious to him he had been through a hundred of these moods how he had survived them he never knew for he could never believe they were moods and that the last hour of his partnership had not struck  in the night she would be sure to throw her arms round his neck and say oh jo how i make you suffer as she had done a hundred times before  he reached out his hand and unseen slipped his razorcase into his pocket i cannot stay here he thought i must go down without a word he left the room and went back to the lawn  old jolyon had little holly on his knee she had taken possession of his watch jolly very red in the face was trying to show that he could stand on his head the dog balthasar as close as he might be to the teatable had fixed his eyes on the cake  young jolyon felt a malicious desire to cut their enjoyment short  what business had his father to come and upset his wife like this it was a shock after all these years he ought to have known he ought to have given them warning but when did a forsyte ever imagine that his conduct could upset anybody and in his thoughts he did old jolyon wrong  he spoke sharply to the children and told them to go in to their tea greatly surprised for they had never heard their father speak sharply before they went off hand in hand little holly looking back over her shoulder  young jolyon poured out the tea  my wifes not the thing today he said but he knew well enough that his father had penetrated the cause of that sudden withdrawal and almost hated the old man for sitting there so calmly  youve got a nice little house here said old jolyon with a shrewd look i suppose youve taken a lease of it  young jolyon nodded  i dont like the neighbourhood said old jolyon a ramshackle lot  young jolyon replied yes were a ramshackle lot  the silence was now only broken by the sound of the dog balthasars scratching  old jolyon said simply i suppose i oughtnt to have come here jo but i get so lonely  at these words young jolyon got up and put his hand on his fathers shoulder  in the next house someone was playing over and over again la donna mobile on an untuned piano and the little garden had fallen into shade the sun now only reached the wall at the end whereon basked a crouching cat her yellow eyes turned sleepily down on the dog balthasar there was a drowsy hum of very distant traffic the creepered trellis round the garden shut out everything but sky and house and peartree with its top branches still gilded by the sun  for some time they sat there talking but little then old jolyon rose to go and not a word was said about his coming again  he walked away very sadly what a poor miserable place and he thought of the great empty house in stanhope gate fit residence for a forsyte with its huge billiardroom and drawingroom that no one entered from one weeks end to another  that woman whose face he had rather liked was too thinskinned by half she gave jo a bad time he knew and those sweet children ah what a piece of awful folly  he walked towards the edgware road between rows of little houses all suggesting to him erroneously no doubt but the prejudices of a forsyte are sacred shady histories of some sort or kind  society forsooth the chattering hags and jackanapeshad set themselves up to pass judgment on his flesh and blood a parcel of old women he stumped his umbrella on the ground as though to drive it into the heart of that unfortunate body which had dared to ostracize his son and his sons son in whom he could have lived again  he stumped his umbrella fiercely yet he himself had followed societys behaviour for fifteen yearshad only today been false to it  he thought of june and her dead mother and the whole story with all his old bitterness a wretched business  he was a long time reaching stanhope gate for with native perversity being extremely tired he walked the whole way  after washing his hands in the lavatory downstairs he went to the diningroom to wait for dinner the only room he used when june was outit was less lonely so the evening paper had not yet come he had finished the times there was therefore nothing to do  the room faced the backwater of traffic and was very silent he disliked dogs but a dog even would have been company his gaze travelling round the walls rested on a picture entitled group of dutch fishing boats at sunset the chef doeuvre of his collection it gave him no pleasure he closed his eyes he was lonely he oughtnt to complain he knew but he couldnt help it he was a poor thinghad always been a poor thingno pluck such was his thought  the butler came to lay the table for dinner and seeing his master apparently asleep exercised extreme caution in his movements this bearded man also wore a moustache which had given rise to grave doubts in the minds of many membersof the family especially those who like soames had been to public schools and were accustomed to niceness in such matters could he really be considered a butler playful spirits alluded to him as uncle jolyons nonconformist george the acknowledged wag had named him sankey  he moved to and fro between the great polished sideboard and the great polished table inimitably sleek and soft  old jolyon watched him feigning sleep the fellow was a sneakhe had always thought sowho cared about nothing but rattling through his work and getting out to his betting or his woman or goodness knew what a slug fat too and didnt care a pin about his master  but then against his will came one of those moments of philosophy which made old jolyon different from other forsytes  after all why should the man care he wasnt paid to care and why expect it in this world people couldnt look for affection unless they paid for it it might be different in the nexthe didnt knowcouldnt tell and again he shut his eyes  relentless and stealthy the butler pursued his labours taking things from the various compartments of the sideboard his back seemed always turned to old jolyon thus he robbed his operations of the unseemliness of being carried on in his masters presence now and then he furtively breathed on the silver and wiped it with a piece of chamois leather he appeared to pore over the quantities of wine in the decanters which he carried carefully and rather high letting his head droop over them protectingly when he had finished he stood for over a minute watching his master and in his greenish eyes there was a look of contempt  after all this master of his was an old buffer who hadnt much left in him  soft as a tomcat he crossed the room to press the bell his orders were dinner at seven what if his master were asleep he would soon have him out of that there was the night to sleep in he had himself to think of for he was due at his club at halfpast eight  in answer to the ring appeared a page boy with a silver soup tureen the butler took it from his hands and placed it on the table then standing by the open door as though about to usher company into the room he said in a solemn voice  dinner is on the table sir  slowly old jolyon got up out of his chair and sat down at the table to eat his dinner     chapter viiiplans of the house  forsytes as is generally admitted have shells like that extremely useful little animal which is made into turkish delight in other words they are never seen or if seen would not be recognised without habitats composed of circumstance property acquaintances and wives which seem to move along with them in their passage through a world composed of thousands of other forsytes with their habitats without a habitat a forsyte is inconceivablehe would be like a novel without a plot which is wellknown to be an anomaly  to forsyte eyes bosinney appeared to have no habitat he seemed one of those rare and unfortunate men who go through life surrounded by circumstance property acquaintances and wives that do not belong to them  his rooms in sloane street on the top floor outside which on a plate was his name philip baynes bosinney architect were not those of a forsytehe had no sittingroom apart from his office but a large recess had been screened off to conceal the necessaries of lifea couch an easy chair his pipes spirit case novels and slippers the business part of the room had the usual furniture an open cupboard with pigeonholes a round oak table a folding washstand some hard chairs a standing desk of large dimensions covered with drawings and designs june had twice been to tea there under the chaperonage of his aunt  he was believed to have a bedroom at the back  as far as the family had been able to ascertain his income it consisted of two consulting appointments at twenty pounds a year together with an odd fee once in a way andmore worthy itema private annuity under his fathers will of one hundred and fifty pounds a year  what had transpired concerning that father was not so reassuring it appeared that he had been a lincolnshire country doctor of cornish extraction striking appearance and byronic tendenciesa wellknown figure in fact in his county bosinneys uncle by marriage baynes of baynes and bildeboy a forsyte in instincts if not in name had but little that was worthy to relate of his brotherinlaw  an odd fellow he would say always spoke of his three eldest boys as good creatures but so dull theyre all doing capitally in the indian civil philip was the only one he liked ive heard him talk in the queerest way he once said to me my dear fellow never let your poor wife know what youre thinking of but i didnt follow his advice not i an eccentric man he would say to phil whether you live like a gentleman or not my boy be sure you die like one and he had himself embalmed in a frock coat suit with a satin cravat and a diamond pin oh quite an original i can assure you  of bosinney himself baynes would speak warmly with a certain compassion hes got a streak of his fathers byronism why look at the way he threw up his chances when he left my office going off like that for six months with a knapsack and all for whatto study foreign architectureforeign what could he expect and there he isa clever young fellowdoesnt make his hundred a year now this engagement is the best thing that could have happenedkeep him steady hes one of those that go to bed all day and stay up all night simply because theyve no method but no vice about himnot an ounce of vice old forsytes a rich man  mr baynes made himself extremely pleasant to june who frequently visited his house in lowndes square at this period  this house of your cousinswhat a capital man of businessis the very thing for philip he would say to her you mustnt expect to see too much of him just now my dear young lady the good causethe good cause the young man must make his way when i was his age i was at work day and night my dear wife used to say to me bobby dont work too hard think of your health but i never spared myself  june had complained that her lover found no time to come to stanhope gate  the first time he came again they had not been together a quarter of an hour before by one of those coincidences of which she was a mistress mrs septimus small arrived thereon bosinney rose and hid himself according to previous arrangement in the little study to wait for her departure  my dear said aunt juley how thin he is ive often noticed it with engaged people but you mustnt let it get worse theres barlows extract of veal it did your uncle swithin a lot of good  june her little figure erect before the hearth her small face quivering grimly for she regarded her aunts untimely visit in the light of a personal injury replied with scorn  its because hes busy people who can do anything worth doing are never fat  aunt juley pouted she herself had always been thin but the only pleasure she derived from the fact was the opportunity of longing to be stouter  i dont think she said mournfully that you ought to let them call him the buccaneer people might think it odd now that hes going to build a house for soames i do hope he will be careful its so important for him soames has such good taste  taste cried june flaring up at once wouldnt give that for his taste or any of the familys  mrs small was taken aback  your uncle swithin she said always had beautiful taste and soamess little house is lovely you dont mean to say you dont think so  hmph said june thats only because irenes there  aunt juley tried to say something pleasant  and how will dear irene like living in the country  june gazed at her intently with a look in her eyes as if her conscience had suddenly leaped up into them it passed and an even more intent look took its place as if she had stared that conscience out of countenance she replied imperiously  of course shell like it why shouldnt she  mrs small grew nervous  i didnt know she said i thought she mightnt like to leave her friends your uncle james says she doesnt take enough interest in life we thinki mean timothy thinksshe ought to go out more i expect youll miss her very much  june clasped her hands behind her neck  i do wish she cried uncle timothy wouldnt talk about what doesnt concern him  aunt juley rose to the full height of her tall figure  he never talks about what doesnt concern him she said  june was instantly compunctious she ran to her aunt and kissed her  im very sorry auntie but i wish theyd let irene alone  aunt juley unable to think of anything further on the subject that would be suitable was silent she prepared for departure hooking her black silk cape across her chest and taking up her green reticule  and how is your dear grandfather she asked in the hall i expect hes very lonely now that all your time is taken up with mr bosinney  she bent and kissed her niece hungrily and with little mincing steps passed away  the tears sprang up in junes eyes running into the little study where bosinney was sitting at the table drawing birds on the back of an envelope she sank down by his side and cried  oh phil its all so horrid her heart was as warm as the colour of her hair  on the following sunday morning while soames was shaving a message was brought him to the effect that mr bosinney was below and would be glad to see him opening the door into his wifes room he said  bosinneys downstairs just go and entertain him while i finish shaving ill be down in a minute its about the plans i expect  irene looked at him without reply put the finishing touch to her dress and went downstairs he could not make her out about this house she had said nothing against it and as far as bosinney was concerned seemed friendly enough  from the window of his dressingroom he could see them talking together in the little court below he hurried on with his shaving cutting his chin twice he heard them laugh and thought to himself well they get on all right anyway  as he expected bosinney had come round to fetch him to look at the plans  he took his hat and went over  the plans were spread on the oak table in the architects room and pale imperturbable inquiring soames bent over them for a long time without speaking  he said at last in a puzzled voice  its an odd sort of house  a rectangular house of two stories was designed in a quadrangle round a coveredin court this court encircled by a gallery on the upper floor was roofed with a glass roof supported by eight columns running up from the ground  it was indeed to forsyte eyes an odd house  theres a lot of room cut to waste pursued soames  bosinney began to walk about and soames did not like the expression on his face  the principle of this house said the architect was that you should have room to breathelike a gentleman  soames extended his finger and thumb as if measuring the extent of the distinction he should acquire and replied  oh yes i see  the peculiar look came into bosinneys face which marked all his enthusiasms  ive tried to plan you a house here with some selfrespect of its own if you dont like it youd better say so its certainly the last thing to be consideredwho wants selfrespect in a house when you can squeeze in an extra lavatory he put his finger suddenly down on the left division of the centre oblong you can swing a cat here this is for your pictures divided from this court by curtains draw them back and youll have a space of fiftyone by twentythree six this doublefaced stove in the centre here looks one way towards the court one way towards the picture room this end wall is all window youve a southeast light from that a north light from the court the rest of your pictures you can hang round the gallery upstairs or in the other rooms in architecture he went onand though looking at soames he did not seem to see him which gave soames an unpleasant feelingas in life youll get no selfrespect without regularity fellows tell you thats old fashioned it appears to be peculiar any way it never occurs to us to embody the main principle of life in our buildings we load our houses with decoration gimcracks corners anything to distract the eye on the contrary the eye should rest get your effects with a few strong lines the whole thing is regularity theres no selfrespect without it  soames the unconscious ironist fixed his gaze on bosinneys tie which was far from being in the perpendicular he was unshaven too and his dress not remarkable for order architecture appeared to have exhausted his regularity  wont it look like a barrack he inquired  he did not at once receive a reply  i can see what it is said bosinney you want one of littlemasters housesone of the pretty and commodious sort where the servants will live in garrets and the front door be sunk so that you may come up again by all means try littlemaster youll find him a capital fellow ive known him all my life  soames was alarmed he had really been struck by the plans and the concealment of his satisfaction had been merely instinctive it was difficult for him to pay a compliment he despised people who were lavish with their praises  he found himself now in the embarrassing position of one who must pay a compliment or run the risk of losing a good thing bosinney was just the fellow who might tear up the plans and refuse to act for him a kind of grownup child  this grownup childishness to which he felt so superior exercised a peculiar and almost mesmeric effect on soames for he had never felt anything like it in himself  well he stammered at last itsits certainly original  he had such a private distrust and even dislike of the word original that he felt he had not really given himself away by this remark  bosinney seemed pleased it was the sort of thing that would please a fellow like that and his success encouraged soames  itsa big place he said  space air light he heard bosinney murmur you cant live like a gentleman in one of littlemastershe builds for manufacturers  soames made a deprecating movement he had been identified with a gentleman not for a good deal of money now would he be classed with manufacturers but his innate distrust of general principles revived what the deuce was the good of talking about regularity and selfrespect it looked to him as if the house would be cold  irene cant stand the cold he said  ah said bosinney sarcastically your wife she doesnt like the cold ill see to that she shant be cold look here he pointed to four marks at regular intervals on the walls of the court ive given you hotwater pipes in aluminium casings you can get them with very good designs  soames looked suspiciously at these marks  its all very well all this he said but whats it going to cost  the architect took a sheet of paper from his pocket  the house of course should be built entirely of stone but as i thought you wouldnt stand that ive compromised for a facing it ought to have a copper roof but ive made it green slate as it is including metal work itll cost you eight thousand five hundred  eight thousand five hundred said soames why i gave you an outside limit of eight  cant be done for a penny less replied bosinney coolly  you must take it or leave it  it was the only way probably that such a proposition could have been made to soames he was nonplussed conscience told him to throw the whole thing up but the design was good and he knew itthere was completeness about it and dignity the servants apartments were excellent too he would gain credit by living in a house like thatwith such individual features yet perfectly wellarranged  he continued poring over the plans while bosinney went into his bedroom to shave and dress  the two walked back to montpellier square in silence soames watching him out of the corner of his eye  the buccaneer was rather a goodlooking fellowso he thoughtwhen he was properly got up  irene was bending over her flowers when the two men came in  she spoke of sending across the park to fetch june  no no said soames weve still got business to talk over  at lunch he was almost cordial and kept pressing bosinney to eat he was pleased to see the architect in such high spirits and left him to spend the afternoon with irene while he stole off to his pictures after his sunday habit at teatime he came down to the drawingroom and found them talking as he expressed it nineteen to the dozen  unobserved in the doorway he congratulated himself that things were taking the right turn it was lucky she and bosinney got on she seemed to be falling into line with the idea of the new house  quiet meditation among his pictures had decided him to spring the five hundred if necessary but he hoped that the afternoon might have softened bosinneys estimates it was so purely a matter which bosinney could remedy if he liked there must be a dozen ways in which he could cheapen the production of a house without spoiling the effect  he awaited therefore his opportunity till irene was handing the architect his first cup of tea a chink of sunshine through the lace of the blinds warmed her cheek shone in the gold of her hair and in her soft eyes possibly the same gleam deepened bosinneys colour gave the rather startled look to his face  soames hated sunshine and he at once got up to draw the blind then he took his own cup of tea from his wife and said more coldly than he had intended  cant you see your way to do it for eight thousand after all there must be a lot of little things you could alter  bosinney drank off his tea at a gulp put down his cup and answered  not one  soames saw that his suggestion had touched some unintelligible point of personal vanity  well he agreed with sulky resignation you must have it your own way i suppose  a few minutes later bosinney rose to go and soames rose too to see him off the premises the architect seemed in absurdly high spirits after watching him walk away at a swinging pace soames returned moodily to the drawingroom where irene was putting away the music and moved by an uncontrollable spasm of curiosity he asked  well what do you think of the buccaneer  he looked at the carpet while waiting for her answer and he had to wait some time  i dont know she said at last  do you think hes goodlooking  irene smiled and it seemed to soames that she was mocking him  yes she answered very     chapter ixdeath of aunt ann  there came a morning at the end of september when aunt ann was unable to take from smithers hands the insignia of personal dignity after one look at the old face the doctor hurriedly sent for announced that miss forsyte had passed away in her sleep  aunts juley and hester were overwhelmed by the shock they had never imagined such an ending indeed it is doubtful whether they had ever realized that an ending was bound to come secretly they felt it unreasonable of ann to have left them like this without a word without even a struggle it was unlike her  perhaps what really affected them so profoundly was the thought that a forsyte should have let go her grasp on life if one then why not all  it was a full hour before they could make up their minds to tell timothy if only it could be kept from him if only it could be broken to him by degrees  and long they stood outside his door whispering together and when it was over they whispered together again  he would feel it more they were afraid as time went on still he had taken it better than could have been expected he would keep his bed of course  they separated crying quietly  aunt juley stayed in her room prostrated by the blow her face discoloured by tears was divided into compartments by the little ridges of pouting flesh which had swollen with emotion it was impossible to conceive of life without ann who had lived with her for seventythree years broken only by the short interregnum of her married life which seemed now so unreal at fixed intervals she went to her drawer and took from beneath the lavender bags a fresh pockethandkerchief her warm heart could not bear the thought that ann was lying there so cold  aunt hester the silent the patient that backwater of the family energy sat in the drawingroom where the blinds were drawn and she too had wept at first but quietly without visible effect her guiding principle the conservation of energy did not abandon her in sorrow she sat slim motionless studying the grate her hands idle in the lap of her black silk dress they would want to rouse her into doing something no doubt as if there were any good in that doing something would not bring back ann why worry her  five oclock brought three of the brothers jolyon and james and swithin nicholas was at yarmouth and roger had a bad attack of gout mrs hayman had been by herself earlier in the day and after seeing ann had gone away leaving a message for timothywhich was kept from himthat she ought to have been told sooner in fact there was a feeling amongst them all that they ought to have been told sooner as though they had missed something and james said  i knew how itd be i told you she wouldnt last through the summer  aunt hester made no reply it was nearly october but what was the good of arguing some people were never satisfied  she sent up to tell her sister that the brothers were there mrs small came down at once she had bathed her face which was still swollen and though she looked severely at swithins trousers for they were of light bluehe had come straight from the club where the news had reached himshe wore a more cheerful expression than usual the instinct for doing the wrong thing being even now too strong for her  presently all five went up to look at the body under the pure white sheet a quilted counterpane had been placed for now more than ever aunt ann had need of warmth and the pillows removed her spine and head rested flat with the semblance of their lifelong inflexibility the coif banding the top of her brow was drawn on either side to the level of the ears and between it and the sheet her face almost as white was turned with closed eyes to the faces of her brothers and sisters in its extraordinary peace the face was stronger than ever nearly all bone now under the scarcewrinkled parchment of skinsquare jaw and chin cheekbones forehead with hollow temples chiselled nosethe fortress of an unconquerable spirit that had yielded to death and in its upward sightlessness seemed trying to regain that spirit to regain the guardianship it had just laid down  swithin took but one look at the face and left the room the sight he said afterwards made him very queer he went downstairs shaking the whole house and seizing his hat clambered into his brougham without giving any directions to the coachman he was driven home and all the evening sat in his chair without moving  he could take nothing for dinner but a partridge with an imperial pint of champagne  old jolyon stood at the bottom of the bed his hands folded in front of him he alone of those in the room remembered the death of his mother and though he looked at ann it was of that he was thinking ann was an old woman but death had come to her at lastdeath came to all his face did not move his gaze seemed travelling from very far  aunt hester stood beside him she did not cry now tears were exhaustedher nature refused to permit a further escape of force she twisted her hands looking not at ann but from side to side seeking some way of escaping the effort of realization  of all the brothers and sisters james manifested the most emotion tears rolled down the parallel furrows of his thin face where he should go now to tell his troubles he did not know juley was no good hester worse than useless he felt anns death more than he had ever thought he should this would upset him for weeks  presently aunt hester stole out and aunt juley began moving about doing what was necessary so that twice she knocked against something old jolyon roused from his reverie that reverie of the long long past looked sternly at her and went away james alone was left by the bedside glancing stealthily round to see that he was not observed he twisted his long body down placed a kiss on the dead forehead then he too hastily left the room encountering smither in the hall he began to ask her about the funeral and finding that she knew nothing complained bitterly that if they didnt take care everything would go wrong she had better send for mr soameshe knew all about that sort of thing her master was very much upset he supposedhe would want looking after as for her mistresses they were no goodthey had no gumption they would be ill too he shouldnt wonder she had better send for the doctor it was best to take things in time he didnt think his sister ann had had the best opinion if shed had blank she would have been alive now smither might send to park lane any time she wanted advice of course his carriage was at their service for the funeral he supposed she hadnt such a thing as a glass of claret and a biscuithe had had no lunch  the days before the funeral passed quietly it had long been known of course that aunt ann had left her little property to timothy there was therefore no reason for the slightest agitation soames who was sole executor took charge of all arrangements and in due course sent out the following invitation to every male member of the family  to  your presence is requested at the funeral of miss ann forsyte in highgate cemetery at noon of oct 1st carriages will meet at the bower bayswater road at 1045 no flowers by request rsvp  the morning came cold with a high grey london sky and at halfpast ten the first carriage that of james drove up it contained james and his soninlaw dartie a fine man with a square chest buttoned very tightly into a frock coat and a sallow fattish face adorned with dark wellcurled moustaches and that incorrigible commencement of whisker which eluding the strictest attempts at shaving seems the mark of something deeply ingrained in the personality of the shaver being especially noticeable in men who speculate  soames in his capacity of executor received the guests for timothy still kept his bed he would get up after the funeral and aunts juley and hester would not be coming down till all was over when it was understood there would be lunch for anyone who cared to come back the next to arrive was roger still limping from the gout and encircled by three of his sonsyoung roger eustace and thomas george the remaining son arrived almost immediately afterwards in a hansom and paused in the hall to ask soames how he found undertaking pay  they disliked each other  then came two haymansgiles and jesse perfectly silent and very well dressed with special creases down their evening trousers then old jolyon alone next nicholas with a healthy colour in his face and a carefully veiled sprightliness in every movement of his head and body one of his sons followed him meek and subdued swithin forsyte and bosinney arrived at the same momentand stoodbowing precedence to each otherbut on the door opening they tried to enter together they renewed their apologies in the hall and swithin settling his stock which had become disarranged in the struggle very slowly mounted the stairs the other hayman two married sons of nicholas together with tweetyman spender and warry the husbands of married forsyte and hayman daughters the company was then complete twentyone in all not a male member of the family being absent but timothy and young jolyon  entering the scarlet and green drawingroom whose apparel made so vivid a setting for their unaccustomed costumes each tried nervously to find a seat desirous of hiding the emphatic blackness of his trousers there seemed a sort of indecency in that blackness and in the colour of their glovesa sort of exaggeration of the feelings and many cast shocked looks of secret envy at the buccaneer who had no gloves and was wearing grey trousers a subdued hum of conversation rose no one speaking of the departed but each asking after the other as though thereby casting an indirect libation to this event which they had come to honour  and presently james said  well i think we ought to be starting  they went downstairs and two and two as they had been told off in strict precedence mounted the carriages  the hearse started at a foots pace the carriages moved slowly after in the first went old jolyon with nicholas in the second the twins swithin and james in the third roger and young roger soames young nicholas george and bosinney followed in the fourth each of the other carriages eight in all held three or four of the family behind them came the doctors brougham then at a decent interval cabs containing family clerks and servants and at the very end one containing nobody at all but bringing the total cortege up to the number of thirteen  so long as the procession kept to the highway of the bayswater road it retained the footspace but turning into less important thoroughfares it soon broke into a trot and so proceeded with intervals of walking in the more fashionable streets until it arrived in the first carriage old jolyon and nicholas were talking of their wills in the second the twins after a single attempt had lapsed into complete silence both were rather deaf and the exertion of making themselves heard was too great only once james broke this silence  i shall have to be looking about for some ground somewhere what arrangements have you made swithin  and swithin fixing him with a dreadful stare answered  dont talk to me about such things  in the third carriage a disjointed conversation was carried on in the intervals of looking out to see how far they had got george remarking well it was really time that the poor old lady went he didnt believe in people living beyond seventy young nicholas replied mildly that the rule didnt seem to apply to the forsytes george said he himself intended to commit suicide at sixty young nicholas smiling and stroking a long chin didnt think his father would like that theory he had made a lot of money since he was sixty well seventy was the outside limit it was then time george said for them to go and leave their money to their children soames hitherto silent here joined in he had not forgotten the remark about the undertaking and lifting his eyelids almost imperceptibly said it was all very well for people who never made money to talk he himself intended to live as long as he could this was a hit at george who was notoriously hard up bosinney muttered abstractedly hear hear and george yawning the conversation dropped  upon arriving the coffin was borne into the chapel and two by two the mourners filed in behind it this guard of men all attached to the dead by the bond of kinship was an impressive and singular sight in the great city of london with its overwhelming diversity of life its innumerable vocations pleasures duties its terrible hardness its terrible call to individualism  the family had gathered to triumph over all this to give a show of tenacious unity to illustrate gloriously that law of property underlying the growth of their tree by which it had thriven and spread trunk and branches the sap flowing through all the full growth reached at the appointed time the spirit of the old woman lying in her last sleep had called them to this demonstration it was her final appeal to that unity which had been their strengthit was her final triumph that she had died while the tree was yet whole  she was spared the watching of the branches jut out beyond the point of balance she could not look into the hearts of her followers the same law that had worked in her bringing her up from a tall straightbacked slip of a girl to a woman strong and grown from a woman grown to a woman old angular feeble almost witchlike with individuality all sharpened and sharpened as all rounding from the worlds contact fell off from herthat same law would work was working in the family she had watched like a mother  she had seen it young and growing she had seen it strong and grown and before her old eyes had time or strength to see any more she died she would have tried and who knows but she might have kept it young and strong with her old fingers her trembling kissesa little longer alas not even aunt ann could fight with nature  pride comes before a fall in accordance with this the greatest of natures ironies the forsyte family had gathered for a last proud pageant before they fell their faces to right and left in single lines were turned for the most part impassively toward the ground guardians of their thoughts but here and there one looking upward with a line between his brows searched to see some sight on the chapel walls too much for him to be listening to something that appalled and the responses lowmuttered in voices through which rose the same tone the same unseizable family ring sounded weird as though murmured in hurried duplication by a single person  the service in the chapel over the mourners filed up again to guard the body to the tomb the vault stood open and round it men in black were waiting  from that high and sacred field where thousands of the upper middle class lay in their last sleep the eyes of the forsytes travelled down across the flocks of graves therespreading to the distance lay london with no sun over it mourning the loss of its daughter mourning with this family so dear the loss of her who was mother and guardian a hundred thousand spires and houses blurred in the great grey web of property lay there like prostrate worshippers before the grave of this the oldest forsyte of them all  a few words a sprinkle of earth the thrusting of the coffin home and aunt ann had passed to her last rest  round the vault trustees of that passing the five brothers stood with white heads bowed they would see that ann was comfortable where she was going her little property must stay behind but otherwise all that could be should be done  then severally each stood aside and putting on his hat turned back to inspect the new inscription on the marble of the family vault       sacred to the memory of ann forsyte      the daughter of the above jolyon and ann forsyte      who departed this life the 27th day of september 1886      aged eightyseven years and four days  soon perhaps someone else would be wanting an inscription it was strange and intolerable for they had not thought somehow that forsytes could die and one and all they had a longing to get away from this painfulness this ceremony which had reminded them of things they could not bear to think aboutto get away quickly and go about their business and forget  it was cold too the wind like some slow disintegrating force blowing up the hill over the graves struck them with its chilly breath they began to split into groups and as quickly as possible to fill the waiting carriages  swithin said he should go back to lunch at timothys and he offered to take anybody with him in his brougham it was considered a doubtful privilege to drive with swithin in his brougham which was not a large one nobody accepted and he went off alone james and roger followed immediately after they also would drop in to lunch the others gradually melted away old jolyon taking three nephews to fill up his carriage he had a want of those young faces  soames who had to arrange some details in the cemetery office walked away with bosinney he had much to talk over with him and having finished his business they strolled to hampstead lunched together at the spaniards inn and spent a long time in going into practical details connected with the building of the house they then proceeded to the tramline and came as far as the marble arch where bosinney went off to stanhope gate to see june  soames felt in excellent spirits when he arrived home and confided to irene at dinner that he had had a good talk with bosinney who really seemed a sensible fellow they had had a capital walk too which had done his liver goodhe had been short of exercise for a long timeand altogether a very satisfactory day if only it hadnt been for poor aunt ann he would have taken her to the theatre as it was they must make the best of an evening at home  the buccaneer asked after you more than once he said suddenly and moved by some inexplicable desire to assert his proprietorship he rose from his chair and planted a kiss on his wifes shoulder     part ii     chapter iprogress of the house  the winter had been an open one things in the trade were slack and as soames had reflected before making up his mind it had been a good time for building the shell of the house at robin hill was thus completed by the end of april  now that there was something to be seen for his money he had been coming down once twice even three times a week and would mouse about among the debris for hours careful never to soil his clothes moving silently through the unfinished brickwork of doorways or circling round the columns in the central court  and he would stand before them for minutes together as though peering into the real quality of their substance  on april 30 he had an appointment with bosinney to go over the accounts and five minutes before the proper time he entered the tent which the architect had pitched for himself close to the old oak tree  the accounts were already prepared on a folding table and with a nod soames sat down to study them it was some time before he raised his head  i cant make them out he said at last they come to nearly seven hundred more than they ought  after a glance at bosinneys face he went on quickly  if you only make a firm stand against these builder chaps youll get them down they stick you with everything if you dont look sharp take ten per cent off all round i shant mind its coming out a hundred or so over the mark  bosinney shook his head  ive taken off every farthing i can  soames pushed back the table with a movement of anger which sent the account sheets fluttering to the ground  then all i can say is he flustered out youve made a pretty mess of it  ive told you a dozen times bosinney answered sharply that thered be extras ive pointed them out to you over and over again  i know that growled soames i shouldnt have objected to a ten pound note here and there how was i to know that by extras you meant seven hundred pounds  the qualities of both men had contributed to this notinconsiderable discrepancy on the one hand the architects devotion to his idea to the image of a house which he had created and believed inhad made him nervous of being stopped or forced to the use of makeshifts on the other soames not less true and wholehearted devotion to the very best article that could be obtained for the money had rendered him averse to believing that things worth thirteen shillings could not be bought with twelve  i wish id never undertaken your house said bosinney suddenly you come down here worrying me out of my life you want double the value for your money anybody else would and now that youve got a house that for its size is not to be beaten in the county you dont want to pay for it if youre anxious to be off your bargain i daresay i can find the balance above the estimates myself but im dd if i do another stroke of work for you  soames regained his composure knowing that bosinney had no capital he regarded this as a wild suggestion he saw too that he would be kept indefinitely out of this house on which he had set his heart and just at the crucial point when the architects personal care made all the difference in the meantime there was irene to be thought of she had been very queer lately he really believed it was only because she had taken to bosinney that she tolerated the idea of the house at all it would not do to make an open breach with her  you neednt get into a rage he said if im willing to put up with it i suppose you neednt cry out all i meant was that when you tell me a thing is going to cost so much i like towell in fact ilike to know where i am  look here said bosinney and soames was both annoyed and surprised by the shrewdness of his glance youve got my services dirt cheap for the kind of work ive put into this house and the amount of time ive given to it youd have had to pay littlemaster or some other fool four times as much what you want in fact is a firstrate man for a fourthrate fee and thats exactly what youve got  soames saw that he really meant what he said and angry though he was the consequences of a row rose before him too vividly he saw his house unfinished his wife rebellious himself a laughingstock  lets go over it he said sulkily and see how the moneys gone  very well assented bosinney but well hurry up if you dont mind i have to get back in time to take june to the theatre  soames cast a stealthy look at him and said coming to our place i suppose to meet her he was always coming to their place  there had been rain the night beforea spring rain and the earth smelt of sap and wild grasses the warm soft breeze swung the leaves and the golden buds of the old oak tree and in the sunshine the blackbirds were whistling their hearts out  it was such a spring day as breathes into a man an ineffable yearning a painful sweetness a longing that makes him stand motionless looking at the leaves or grass and fling out his arms to embrace he knows not what the earth gave forth a fainting warmth stealing up through the chilly garment in which winter had wrapped her it was her long caress of invitation to draw men down to lie within her arms to roll their bodies on her and put their lips to her breast  on just such a day as this soames had got from irene the promise he had asked her for so often seated on the fallen trunk of a tree he had promised for the twentieth time that if their marriage were not a success she should be as free as if she had never married him  do you swear it she had said a few days back she had reminded him of that oath he had answered nonsense i couldnt have sworn any such thing by some awkward fatality he remembered it now what queer things men would swear for the sake of women he would have sworn it at any time to gain her he would swear it now if thereby he could touch herbut nobody could touch her she was coldhearted  and memories crowded on him with the fresh sweet savour of the spring windmemories of his courtship  in the spring of the year 1881 he was visiting his old schoolfellow and client george liversedge of branksome who with the view of developing his pinewoods in the neighbourhood of bournemouth had placed the formation of the company necessary to the scheme in soamess hands mrs liversedge with a sense of the fitness of things had given a musical tea in his honour later in the course of this function which soames no musician had regarded as an unmitigated bore his eye had been caught by the face of a girl dressed in mourning standing by herself the lines of her tall as yet rather thin figure showed through the wispy clinging stuff of her black dress her blackgloved hands were crossed in front of her her lips slightly parted and her large dark eyes wandered from face to face her hair done low on her neck seemed to gleam above her black collar like coils of shining metal and as soames stood looking at her the sensation that most men have felt at one time or another went stealing through hima peculiar satisfaction of the senses a peculiar certainty which novelists and old ladies call love at first sight still stealthily watching her he at once made his way to his hostess and stood doggedly waiting for the music to cease  who is that girl with yellow hair and dark eyes he asked  thatoh irene heron her father professor heron died this year she lives with her stepmother shes a nice girl a pretty girl but no money  introduce me please said soames  it was very little that he found to say nor did he find her responsive to that little but he went away with the resolution to see her again he effected his object by chance meeting her on the pier with her stepmother who had the habit of walking there from twelve to one of a forenoon soames made this ladys acquaintance with alacrity nor was it long before he perceived in her the ally he was looking for his keen scent for the commercial side of family life soon told him that irene cost her stepmother more than the fifty pounds a year she brought her it also told him that mrs heron a woman yet in the prime of life desired to be married again the strange ripening beauty of her stepdaughter stood in the way of this desirable consummation and soames in his stealthy tenacity laid his plans  he left bournemouth without having given himself away but in a months time came back and this time he spoke not to the girl but to her stepmother he had made up his mind he said he would wait any time and he had long to wait watching irene bloom the lines of her young figure softening the stronger blood deepening the gleam of her eyes and warming her face to a creamy glow and at each visit he proposed to her and when that visit was at an end took her refusal away with him back to london sore at heart but steadfast and silent as the grave he tried to come at the secret springs of her resistance only once had he a gleam of light it was at one of those assembly dances which afford the only outlet to the passions of the population of seaside wateringplaces he was sitting with her in an embrasure his senses tingling with the contact of the waltz she had looked at him over her slowly waving fan and he had lost his head seizing that moving wrist he pressed his lips to the flesh of her arm and she had shudderedto this day he had not forgotten that shuddernor the look so passionately averse she had given him  a year after that she had yielded what had made her yield he could never make out and from mrs heron a woman of some diplomatic talent he learnt nothing once after they were married he asked her what made you refuse me so often she had answered by a strange silence an enigma to him from the day that he first saw her she was an enigma to him still  bosinney was waiting for him at the door and on his rugged goodlooking face was a queer yearning yet happy look as though he too saw a promise of bliss in the spring sky sniffed a coming happiness in the spring air soames looked at him waiting there what was the matter with the fellow that he looked so happy what was he waiting for with that smile on his lips and in his eyes soames could not see that for which bosinney was waiting as he stood there drinking in the flowerscented wind and once more he felt baffled in the presence of this man whom by habit he despised he hastened on to the house  the only colour for those tiles he heard bosinney sayis ruby with a grey tint in the stuff to give a transparent effect i should like irenes opinion im ordering the purple leather curtains for the doorway of this court and if you distemper the drawingroom ivory cream over paper youll get an illusive look you want to aim all through the decorations at what i call charm  soames said you mean that my wife has charm  bosinney evaded the question  you should have a clump of iris plants in the centre of that court  soames smiled superciliously  ill look into beechs some time he said and see whats appropriate  they found little else to say to each other but on the way to the station soames asked  i suppose you find irene very artistic  yes the abrupt answer was as distinct a snub as saying if you want to discuss her you can do it with someone else  and the slow sulky anger soames had felt all the afternoon burned the brighter within him  neither spoke again till they were close to the station then soames asked  when do you expect to have finished  by the end of june if you really wish me to decorate as well  soames nodded but you quite understand he said that the house is costing me a lot beyond what i contemplated i may as well tell you that i should have thrown it up only im not in the habit of giving up what ive set my mind on  bosinney made no reply and soames gave him askance a look of dogged dislikefor in spite of his fastidious air and that supercilious dandified taciturnity soames with his set lips and squared chin was not unlike a bulldog  when at seven oclock that evening june arrived at 62 montpellier square the maid bilson told her that mr bosinney was in the drawingroom the mistressshe saidwas dressing and would be down in a minute she would tell her that miss june was here  june stopped her at once  all right bilson she said ill just go in you neednt hurry mrs soames  she took off her cloak and bilson with an understanding look did not even open the drawingroom door for her but ran downstairs  june paused for a moment to look at herself in the little oldfashioned silver mirror above the oaken rug chesta slim imperious young figure with a small resolute face in a white frock cut moonshaped at the base of a neck too slender for her crown of twisted redgold hair  she opened the drawingroom door softly meaning to take him by surprise the room was filled with a sweet hot scent of flowering azaleas  she took a long breath of the perfume and heard bosinneys voice not in the room but quite close saying  ah there were such heaps of things i wanted to talk about and now we shant have time  irenes voice answered why not at dinner  how can one talk  junes first thought was to go away but instead she crossed to the long window opening on the little court it was from there that the scent of the azaleas came and standing with their backs to her their faces buried in the goldenpink blossoms stood her lover and irene  silent but unashamed with flaming cheeks and angry eyes the girl watched  come on sunday by yourselfwe can go over the house together  june saw irene look up at him through her screen of blossoms it was not the look of a coquette butfar worse to the watching girlof a woman fearful lest that look should say too much  ive promised to go for a drive with uncle  the big one make him bring you its only ten milesthe very thing for his horses  poor old uncle swithin  a wave of the azalea scent drifted into junes face she felt sick and dizzy  do ah do  but why  i must see you therei thought youd like to help me  the answer seemed to the girl to come softly with a tremble from amongst the blossoms so i do  and she stepped into the open space of the window  how stuffy it is here she said i cant bear this scent  her eyes so angry and direct swept both their faces  were you talking about the house i havent seen it yet you knowshall we all go on sunday  from irenes face the colour had flown  i am going for a drive that day with uncle swithin she answered  uncle swithin what does he matter you can throw him over  i am not in the habit of throwing people over  there was a sound of footsteps and june saw soames standing just behind her  well if you are all ready said irene looking from one to the other with a strange smile dinner is too     chapter iijunes treat  dinner began in silence the women facing one another and the men  in silence the soup was finishedexcellent if a little thick and fish was brought in silence it was handed  bosinney ventured its the first spring day  irene echoed softly yesthe first spring day  spring said june there isnt a breath of air no one replied  the fish was taken away a fine fresh sole from dover and bilson brought champagne a bottle swathed around the neck with white  soames said youll find it dry  cutlets were handed each pinkfrilled about the legs they were refused by june and silence fell  soames said youd better take a cutlet june theres nothing coming  but june again refused so they were borne away and then irene asked phil have you heard my blackbird  bosinney answered ratherhes got a huntingsong as i came round i heard him in the square  hes such a darling  salad sir spring chicken was removed  but soames was speaking the asparagus is very poor bosinney glass of sherry with your sweet june youre drinking nothing  june said you know i never do wines such horrid stuff  an apple charlotte came upon a silver dish and smilingly irene said the azaleas are so wonderful this year  to this bosinney murmured wonderful the scents extraordinary  june said how can you like the scent sugar please bilson  sugar was handed her and soames remarked this charlottes good  the charlotte was removed long silence followed irene beckoning said take out the azalea bilson miss june cant bear the scent  no let it stay said june  olives from france with russian caviare were placed on little plates and soames remarked why cant we have the spanish but no one answered  the olives were removed lifting her tumbler june demanded give me some water please water was given her a silver tray was brought with german plums there was a lengthy pause in perfect harmony all were eating them  bosinney counted up the stones this yearnext yearsome time  irene finished softly never there was such a glorious sunset the skys all ruby stillso beautiful  he answered underneath the dark  their eyes had met and june cried scornfully a london sunset  egyptian cigarettes were handed in a silver box soames taking one remarked what times your play begin  no one replied and turkish coffee followed in enamelled cups  irene smiling quietly said if only  only what said june  if only it could always be the spring  brandy was handed it was pale and old  soames said bosinney better take some brandy  bosinney took a glass they all arose  you want a cab asked soames  june answered no my cloaks please bilson her cloak was brought  irene from the window murmured such a lovely night the stars are coming out  soames added well i hope youll both enjoy yourselves  from the door june answered thanks come phil  bosinney cried im coming  soames smiled a sneering smile and said i wish you luck  and at the door irene watched them go  bosinney called good night  good night she answered softly  june made her lover take her on the top of a bus saying she wanted air and there sat silent with her face to the breeze  the driver turned once or twice with the intention of venturing a remark but thought better of it they were a lively couple the spring had got into his blood too he felt the need for letting steam escape and clucked his tongue flourishing his whip wheeling his horses and even they poor things had smelled the spring and for a brief halfhour spurned the pavement with happy hoofs  the whole town was alive the boughs curled upward with their decking of young leaves awaited some gift the breeze could bring newlighted lamps were gaining mastery and the faces of the crowd showed pale under that glare while on high the great white clouds slid swiftly softly over the purple sky  men in evening dress had thrown back overcoats stepping jauntily up the steps of clubs working folk loitered and womenthose women who at that time of night are solitarysolitary and moving eastward in a streamswung slowly along with expectation in their gait dreaming of good wine and a good supper orfor an unwonted minute of kisses given for love  those countless figures going their ways under the lamps and the movingsky had one and all received some restless blessing from the stir of spring and one and all like those clubmen with their opened coats had shed something of caste and creed and custom and by the cock of their hats the pace of their walk their laughter or their silence revealed their common kinship under the passionate heavens  bosinney and june entered the theatre in silence and mounted to their seats in the upper boxes the piece had just begun and the halfdarkened house with its rows of creatures peering all one way resembled a great garden of flowers turning their faces to the sun  june had never before been in the upper boxes from the age of fifteen she had habitually accompanied her grandfather to the stalls and not common stalls but the best seats in the house towards the centre of the third row booked by old jolyon at grogan and boynes on his way home from the city long before the day carried in his overcoat pocket together with his cigarcase and his old kid gloves and handed to june to keep till the appointed night and in those stallsan erect old figure with a serene white head a little figure strenuous and eager with a redgold headthey would sit through every kind of play and on the way home old jolyon would say of the principal actor oh hes a poor stick you should have seen little bobson  she had looked forward to this evening with keen delight it was stolen chaperoneless undreamed of at stanhope gate where she was supposed to be at soames she had expected reward for her subterfuge planned for her lovers sake she had expected it to break up the thick chilly cloud and make the relations between them which of late had been so puzzling so tormentingsunny and simple again as they had been before the winter she had come with the intention of saying something definite and she looked at the stage with a furrow between her brows seeing nothing her hands squeezed together in her lap a swarm of jealous suspicions stung and stung her  if bosinney was conscious of her trouble he made no sign  the curtain dropped the first act had come to an end  its awfully hot here said the girl i should like to go out  she was very white and she knewfor with her nerves thus sharpened she saw everythingthat he was both uneasy and compunctious  at the back of the theatre an open balcony hung over the street she took possession of this and stood leaning there without a word waiting for him to begin  at last she could bear it no longer  i want to say something to you phil she said  yes  the defensive tone of his voice brought the colour flying to her cheek the words flying to her lips you dont give me a chance to be nice to you you havent for ages now  bosinney stared down at the street he made no answer  june cried passionately you know i want to do everything for youthat i want to be everything to you  a hum rose from the street and piercing it with a sharp ping the bell sounded for the raising of the curtain june did not stir a desperate struggle was going on within her should she put everything to the proof should she challenge directly that influence that attraction which was driving him away from her it was her nature to challenge and she said phil take me to see the house on sunday  with a smile quivering and breaking on her lips and trying how hard not to show that she was watching she searched his face saw it waver and hesitate saw a troubled line come between his brows the blood rush into his face he answered not sunday dear some other day  why not sunday i shouldnt be in the way on sunday  he made an evident effort and said i have an engagement  you are going to take  his eyes grew angry he shrugged his shoulders and answered an engagement that will prevent my taking you to see the house  june bit her lip till the blood came and walked back to her seat without another word but she could not help the tears of rage rolling down her face the house had been mercifully darkened for a crisis and no one could see her trouble  yet in this world of forsytes let no man think himself immune from observation  in the third row behind euphemia nicholass youngest daughter with her marriedsister mrs tweetyman were watching  they reported at timothys how they had seen june and her fiance at the theatre  in the stalls no not in the oh in the dress circle of course that seemed to be quite fashionable nowadays with young people  wellnot exactly in the anyway that engagement wouldnt last long they had never seen anyone look so thunder and lightningy as that little june with tears of enjoyment in their eyes they related how she had kicked a mans hat as she returned to her seat in the middle of an act and how the man had looked euphemia had a noted silent laugh terminating most disappointingly in squeaks and when mrs small holding up her hands said my dear kicked a haat she let out such a number of these that she had to be recovered with smellingsalts as she went away she said to mrs tweetyman  kicked ahaat oh i shall die  for that little june this evening that was to have been her treat was the most miserable she had ever spent god knows she tried to stifle her pride her suspicion her jealousy  she parted from bosinney at old jolyons door without breaking down the feeling that her lover must be conquered was strong enough to sustain her till his retiring footsteps brought home the true extent of her wretchedness  the noiseless sankey let her in she would have slipped up to her own room but old jolyon who had heard her entrance was in the diningroom doorway  come in and have your milk he said its been kept hot for you youre very late where have you been  june stood at the fireplace with a foot on the fender and an arm on the mantelpiece as her grandfather had done when he came in that night of the opera she was too near a breakdown to care what she told him  we dined at soamess  hm the man of property his wife there and bosinney  yes  old jolyons glance was fixed on her with the penetrating gaze from which it was difficult to hide but she was not looking at him and when she turned her face he dropped his scrutiny at once he had seen enough and too much he bent down to lift the cup of milk for her from the hearth and turning away grumbled you oughtnt to stay out so late it makes you fit for nothing  he was invisible now behind his paper which he turned with a vicious crackle but when june came up to kiss him he said goodnight my darling in a tone so tremulous and unexpected that it was all the girl could do to get out of the room without breaking into the fit of sobbing which lasted her well on into the night  when the door was closed old jolyon dropped his paper and stared long and anxiously in front of him  the beggar he thought i always knew shed have trouble with him  uneasy doubts and suspicions the more poignant that he felt himself powerless to check or control the march of events came crowding upon him  was the fellow going to jilt her he longed to go and say to him look here you sir are you going to jilt my granddaughter but how could he knowing little or nothing he was yet certain with his unerring astuteness that there was something going on he suspected bosinney of being too much at montpellier square  this fellow he thought may not be a scamp his face is not a bad one but hes a queer fish i dont know what to make of him i shall never know what to make of him they tell me he works like a nigger but i see no good coming of it hes unpractical he has no method when he comes here he sits as glum as a monkey if i ask him what wine hell have he says thanks any wine if i offer him a cigar he smokes it as if it were a twopenny german thing i never see him looking at june as he ought to look at her and yet hes not after her money if she were to make a sign hed be off his bargain tomorrow but she wontnot she shell stick to him shes as obstinate as fateshell never let go  sighing deeply he turned the paper in its columns perchance he might find consolation  and upstairs in her room june sat at her open window where the spring wind came after its revel across the park to cool her hot cheeks and burn her heart     chapter iiidrive with swithin  two lines of a certain song in a certain famous old schools songbook run as follows  how the buttons on his blue frock shone tralala how he carolled and he sang like a bird  swithin did not exactly carol and sing like a bird but he felt almost like endeavouring to hum a tune as he stepped out of hyde park mansions and contemplated his horses drawn up before the door  the afternoon was as balmy as a day in june and to complete the simile of the old song he had put on a blue frockcoat dispensing with an overcoat after sending adolf down three times to make sure that there was not the least suspicion of east in the wind and the frockcoat was buttoned so tightly around his personable form that if the buttons did not shine they might pardonably have done so majestic on the pavement he fitted on a pair of dogskin gloves with his large bellshaped top hat and his great stature and bulk he looked too primeval for a forsyte his thick white hair on which adolf had bestowed a touch of pomatum exhaled the fragrance of opoponax and cigarsthe celebrated swithin brand for which he paid one hundred and forty shillings the hundred and of which old jolyon had unkindly said he wouldnt smoke them as a gift they wanted the stomach of a horse  adolf  sare  the new plaid rug  he would never teach that fellow to look smart and mrs soames he felt sure had an eye  the phaeton hood down i am goingtodrivealady  a pretty woman would want to show off her frock and wellhe was going to drive a lady it was like a new beginning to the good old days  ages since he had driven a woman the last time if he remembered it had been juley the poor old soul had been as nervous as a cat the whole time and so put him out of patience that as he dropped her in the bayswater road he had said well im dd if i ever drive you again and he never had not he  going up to his horses heads he examined their bits not that he knew anything about bitshe didnt pay his coachman sixty pounds a year to do his work for him that had never been his principle indeed his reputation as a horsey man rested mainly on the fact that once on derby day he had been welshed by some thimbleriggers but someone at the club after seeing him drive his greys up to the doorhe always drove grey horses you got more style for the money some thoughthad called him fourinhand forsyte the name having reached his ears through that fellow nicholas treffry old jolyons dead partner the great driving man notorious for more carriage accidents than any man in the kingdomswithin had ever after conceived it right to act up to it the name had taken his fancy not because he had ever driven fourinhand or was ever likely to but because of something distinguished in the sound fourinhand forsyte not bad born too soon swithin had missed his vocation coming upon london twenty years later he could not have failed to have become a stockbroker but at the time when he was obliged to select this great profession had not as yet became the chief glory of the uppermiddle class he had literally been forced into land agency  once in the driving seat with the reins handed to him and blinking over his pale old cheeks in the full sunlight he took a slow look roundadolf was already up behind the cockaded groom at the horses heads stood ready to let go everything was prepared for the signal and swithin gave it the equipage dashed forward and before you could say jack robinson with a rattle and flourish drew up at soames door  irene came out at once and stepped inhe afterward described it at timothysas light asertaglioni no fuss about it no wanting this or wanting that and above all swithin dwelt on this staring at mrs septimus in a way that disconcerted her a good deal no silly nervousness to aunt hester he portrayed irenes hat not one of your great flopping things sprawling about and catching the dust that women are so fond of nowadays but a neat little he made a circular motion of his hand white veilcapital taste  what was it made of inquired aunt hester who manifested a languid but permanent excitement at any mention of dress  made of returned swithin now how should i know  he sank into silence so profound that aunt hester began to be afraid he had fallen into a trance she did not try to rouse him herself it not being her custom  i wish somebody would come she thought i dont like the look of him  but suddenly swithin returned to life made of he wheezed out slowly what should it be made of  they had not gone four miles before swithin received the impression that irene liked driving with him her face was so soft behind that white veil and her dark eyes shone so in the spring light and whenever he spoke she raised them to him and smiled  on saturday morning soames had found her at her writingtable with a note written to swithin putting him off why did she want to put him off he asked she might put her own people off when she liked he would not have her putting off his people  she had looked at him intently had torn up the note and said very well  and then she began writing another he took a casual glance presently and saw that it was addressed to bosinney  what are you writing to him about he asked  irene looking at him again with that intent look said quietly something he wanted me to do for him  humph said soamescommissions  youll have your work cut out if you begin that sort of thing he said no more  swithin opened his eyes at the mention of robin hill it was a long way for his horses and he always dined at halfpast seven before the rush at the club began the new chef took more trouble with an early dinnera lazy rascal  he would like to have a look at the house however a house appealed to any forsyte and especially to one who had been an auctioneer after all he said the distance was nothing when he was a younger man he had had rooms at richmond for many years kept his carriage and pair there and drove them up and down to business every day of his life  fourinhand forsyte they called him his tcart his horses had been known from hyde park corner to the star and garter the duke of z wanted to get hold of them would have given him double the money but he had kept them know a good thing when you have it eh a look of solemn pride came portentously on his shaven square old face he rolled his head in his standup collar like a turkeycock preening himself  she was reallya charming woman he enlarged upon her frock afterwards to aunt juley who held up her hands at his way of putting it  fitted her like a skintight as a drum that was how he liked em all of a piece none of your daverdy scarecrow women he gazed at mrs septimus small who took after jameslong and thin  theres style about her he went on fit for a king and shes so quiet with it too  she seems to have made quite a conquest of you any way drawled aunt hester from her corner  swithin heard extremely well when anybody attacked him  whats that he said i know aprettywoman when i see one and all i can say is i dont see the young man about thats fit for her but perhapsyoudo come perhapsyoudo  oh murmured aunt hester ask juley  long before they reached robin hill however the unaccustomed airing had made him terribly sleepy he drove with his eyes closed a lifetime of deportment alone keeping his tall and bulky form from falling askew  bosinney who was watching came out to meet them and all three entered the house together swithin in front making play with a stout goldmounted malacca cane put into his hand by adolf for his knees were feeling the effects of their long stay in the same position he had assumed his fur coat to guard against the draughts of the unfinished house  the staircasehe saidwas handsome the baronial style they would want some statuary about he came to a standstill between the columns of the doorway into the inner court and held out his cane inquiringly  what was this to bethis vestibule or whatever they called it but gazing at the skylight inspiration came to him  ah the billiardroom  when told it was to be a tiled court with plants in the centre he turned to irene  waste this on plants you take my advice and have a billiard table here  irene smiled she had lifted her veil banding it like a nuns coif across her forehead and the smile of her dark eyes below this seemed to swithin more charming than ever he nodded she would take his advice he saw  he had little to say of the drawing or diningrooms which he described as spacious but fell into such raptures as he permitted to a man of his dignity in the winecellar to which he descended by stone steps bosinney going first with a light  youll have room here he said for six or seven hundred dozena very pooty little cellar  bosinney having expressed the wish to show them the house from the copse below swithin came to a stop  theres a fine view from here he remarked you havent such a thing as a chair  a chair was brought him from bosinneys tent  you go down he said blandly you two ill sit here and look at the view  he sat down by the oak tree in the sun square and upright with one hand stretched out resting on the nob of his cane the other planted on his knee his fur coat thrown open his hat roofing with its flat top the pale square of his face his stare very blank fixed on the landscape  he nodded to them as they went off down through the fields he was indeed not sorry to be left thus for a quiet moment of reflection the air was balmy not too much heat in the sun the prospect a fine one a remarka his head fell a little to one side he jerked it up and thought odd heah they were waving to him from the bottom he put up his hand and moved it more than once they were activethe prospect was remar his head fell to the left he jerked it up at once it fell to the right it remained there he was asleep  and asleep a sentinel on thetop of the rise he appeared to rule over this prospectremarkablelike some image blocked out by the special artist of primeval forsytes in pagan days to record the domination of mind over matter  and all the unnumbered generations of his yeoman ancestors wont of a sunday to stand akimbo surveying their little plots of land their grey unmoving eyes hiding their instinct with its hidden roots of violence their instinct for possession to the exclusion of all the worldall these unnumbered generations seemed to sit there with him on the top of the rise  but from him thus slumbering his jealous forsyte spirit travelled far into godknowswhat jungle of fancies with those two young people to see what they were doing down there in the copsein the copse where the spring was running riot with the scent of sap and bursting buds the song of birds innumerable a carpet of bluebells and sweet growing things and the sun caught like gold in the tops of the trees to see what they were doing walking along there so close together on the path that was too narrow walking along there so close that they were always touching to watch irenes eyes like dark thieves stealing the heart out of the spring and a great unseen chaperon his spirit was there stopping with them to look at the little furry corpse of a mole not dead an hour with his mushroomandsilver coat untouched by the rain or dew watching over irenes bent head and the soft look of her pitying eyes and over that young mans head gazing at her so hard so strangely walking on with them too across the open space where a woodcutter had been at work where the bluebells were trampled down and a trunk had swayed and staggered down from its gashed stump climbing it with them over and on to the very edge of the copse whence there stretched an undiscovered country from far away in which came the sounds cuckoocuckoo  silent standing with them there and uneasy at their silence very queer very strange  then back again as though guilty through the woodback to the cutting still silent amongst the songs of birds that never ceased and the wild scenthum what was itlike that herb they put inback to the log across the path  and then unseen uneasy flapping above them trying to make noises his forsyte spirit watched her balanced on the log her pretty figure swaying smiling down at that young man gazing up with such strange shining eyes slipping nowaah falling ooh slidingdown his breast her soft warm body clutched her head bent back from his lips his kiss her recoil his cry you must knowi love you must knowindeed a pretty love hah  swithin awoke virtue had gone out of him he had a taste in his mouth where was he  damme he had been asleep  he had dreamed something about a new soup with a taste of mint in it  those young peoplewhere had they got to his left leg had pins and needles  adolf the rascal was not there the rascal was asleep somewhere  he stood up tall square bulky in his fur looking anxiously down over the fields and presently he saw them coming  irene was in front that young fellowwhat had they nicknamed himthe buccaneer looked precious hangdog there behind her had got a flea in his ear he shouldnt wonder serve him right taking her down all that way to look at the house the proper place to look at a house from was the lawn  they saw him he extended his arm and moved it spasmodically to encourage them but they had stopped what were they standing there for talkingtalking they came on again she had been giving him a rub he had not the least doubt of it and no wonder over a house like thata great ugly thing not the sort of house he was accustomed to  he looked intently at their faces with his pale immovable stare that young man looked very queer  youll never make anything of this he said tartly pointing at the mansiontoo newfangled  bosinney gazed at him as though he had not heard and swithin afterwards described him to aunt hester as an extravagant sort of fellow very odd way of looking at youa bumpy beggar  what gave rise to this sudden piece of psychology he did not state possibly bosinneys prominent forehead and cheekbones and chin or something hungry in his face which quarrelled with swithins conception of the calm satiety that should characterize the perfect gentleman  he brightened up at the mention of tea he had a contempt for teahis brother jolyon had been in tea made a lot of money by itbut he was so thirsty and had such a taste in his mouth that he was prepared to drink anything he longed to inform irene of the taste in his mouthshe was so sympatheticbut it would not be a distinguished thing to do he rolled his tongue round and faintly smacked it against his palate  in a far corner of the tent adolf was bending his catlike moustaches over a kettle he left it at once to draw the cork of a pintbottle of champagne swithin smiled and nodding at bosinney said why youre quite a monte cristo this celebrated novelone of the halfdozen he had readhad produced an extraordinary impression on his mind  taking his glass from the table he held it away from him to scrutinize the colour thirsty as he was it was not likely that he was going to drink trash then placing it to his lips he took a sip  a very nice wine he said at last passing it before his nose not the equal of my heidsieck  it was at this moment that the idea came to him which he afterwards imparted at timothys in this nutshell i shouldnt wonder a bit if that architect chap were sweet upon mrs soames  and from this moment his pale round eyes never ceased to bulge with the interest of his discovery  the fellow he said to mrs septimus follows her about with his eyes like a dogthe bumpy beggar i dont wonder at itshes a very charming woman and i should say the pink of discretion a vague consciousness of perfume caging about irene like that from a flower with halfclosed petals and a passionate heart moved him to the creation of this image but i wasnt sure of it he said till i saw him pick up her handkerchief  mrs smalls eyes boiled with excitement  and did he give it her back she asked  give it back said swithin i saw him slobber on it when he thought i wasnt looking  mrs small gaspedtoo interested to speak  but she gave him no encouragement went on swithin he stopped and stared for a minute or two in the way that alarmed aunt hester sohe had suddenly recollected that as they were starting back in the phaeton she had given bosinney her hand a second time and let it stay there too he had touched his horses smartly with the whip anxious to get her all to himself but she had looked back and she had not answered his first question neither had he been able to see her faceshe had kept it hanging down  there is somewhere a picture which swithin has not seen of a man sitting on a rock and by him immersed in the still green water a seanymph lying on her back with her hand on her naked breast she has a halfsmile on her facea smile of hopeless surrender and of secret joy  seated by swithins side irene may have been smiling like that  when warmed by champagne he had her all to himself he unbosomed himself of his wrongs of his smothered resentment against the new chef at the club his worry over the house in wigmore street where the rascally tenant had gone bankrupt through helping his brotherinlaw as if charity did not begin at home of his deafness too and that pain he sometimes got in his right side she listened her eyes swimming under their lids he thought she was thinking deeply of his troubles and pitied himself terribly yet in his fur coat with frogs across the breast his top hat aslant driving this beautiful woman he had never felt more distinguished  a coster however taking his girl for a sunday airing seemed to have the same impression about himself this person had flogged his donkey into a gallop alongside and sat upright as a waxwork in his shallopy chariot his chin settled pompously on a red handkerchief like swithins on his full cravat while his girl with the ends of a flyblown boa floating out behind aped a woman of fashion her swain moved a stick with a ragged bit of string dangling from the end reproducing with strange fidelity the circular flourish of swithins whip and rolled his head at his lady with a leer that had a weird likeness to swithins primeval stare  though for a time unconscious of the lowly ruffians presence swithin presently took it into his head that he was being guyed he laid his whiplash across the mares flank the two chariots however by some unfortunate fatality continued abreast swithins yellow puffy face grew red he raised his whip to lash the costermonger but was saved from so far forgetting his dignity by a special intervention of providence a carriage driving out through a gate forced phaeton and donkeycart into proximity the wheels grated the lighter vehicle skidded and was overturned  swithin did not look round on no account would he have pulled up to help the ruffian serve him right if he had broken his neck  but he could not if he would the greys had taken alarm the phaeton swung from side to side and people raised frightened faces as they went dashing past swithins great arms stretched at full length tugged at the reins his cheeks were puffed his lips compressed his swollen face was of a dull angry red  irene had her hand on the rail and at every lurch she gripped it tightly swithin heard her ask  are we going to have an accident uncle swithin  he gasped out between his pants its nothing alittle fresh  ive never been in an accident  dont you move he took a look at her she was smiling perfectly calm sit still he repeated never fear ill get you home  and in the midst of all his terrible efforts he was surprised to hear her answer in a voice not like her own  i dont care if i never get home  the carriage giving a terrific lurch swithins exclamation was jerked back into his throat the horses winded by the rise of a hill now steadied to a trot and finally stopped of their own accord  whenswithin described it at timothysi pulled em up there she was as cool as myself god bless my soul she behaved as if she didnt care whether she broke her neck or not what was it she said i dont care if i never get home leaning over the handle of his cane he wheezed out to mrs smalls terror and im not altogether surprised with a finickin feller like young soames for a husband  it did not occur to him to wonder what bosinney had done after they had left him there alone whether he had gone wandering about like the dog to which swithin had compared him wandering down to that copse where the spring was still in riot the cuckoo still calling from afar gone down there with her handkerchief pressed to lips its fragrance mingling with the scent of mint and thyme gone down there with such a wild exquisite pain in his heart that he could have cried out among the trees or what indeed the fellow had done in fact till he came to timothys swithin had forgotten all about him     chapter ivjames goes to see for himself  those ignorant of forsyte change would not perhaps foresee all the stir made by irenes visit to the house  after swithin had related at timothys the full story of his memorable drive the same with the least suspicion of curiosity the merest touch of malice and a real desire to do good was passed on to june  and what a dreadful thing to say my dear ended aunt juley that about not going home what did she mean  it was a strange recital for the girl she heard it flushing painfully and suddenly with a curt handshake took her departure  almost rude mrs small said to aunt hester when june was gone  the proper construction was put on her reception of the news she was upset something was therefore very wrong odd she and irene had been such friends  it all tallied too well with whispers and hints that had been going about for some time past recollections of euphemias account of the visit to the theatremr bosinney always at soamess oh indeed yes of course he would be about the house nothing open only upon the greatest the most important provocation was it necessary to say anything open on forsyte change this machine was too nicely adjusted a hint the merest trifling expression of regret or doubt sufficed to set the family soul so sympatheticvibrating no one desired that harm should come of these vibrationsfar from it they were set in motion with the best intentions with the feeling that each member of the family had a stake in the family soul  and much kindness lay at the bottom of the gossip it would frequently result in visits of condolence being made in accordance with the customs of society thereby conferring a real benefit upon the sufferers and affording consolation to the sound who felt pleasantly that someone at all events was suffering from that from which they themselves were not suffering in fact it was simply a desire to keep things wellaired the desire which animates the public press that brought james for instance into communication with mrs septimus mrs septimus with the little nicholases the little nicholases with whoknowswhom and so on that great class to which they had risen and now belonged demanded a certain candour a still more certain reticence this combination guaranteed their membership  many of the younger forsytes felt very naturally and would openly declare that they did not want their affairs pried into but so powerful was the invisible magnetic current of family gossip that for the life of them they could not help knowing all about everything it was felt to be hopeless  one of them young roger had made an heroic attempt to free the rising generation by speaking of timothy as an old cat the effort had justly recoiled upon himself the words coming round in the most delicate way to aunt juleys ears were repeated by her in a shocked voice to mrs roger whence they returned again to young roger  and after all it was only the wrongdoers who suffered as for instance george when he lost all that money playing billiards or young roger himself when he was so dreadfully near to marrying the girl to whom it was whispered he was already married by the laws of nature or again irene who was thought rather than said to be in danger  all this was not only pleasant but salutary and it made so many hours go lightly at timothys in the bayswater road so many hours that must otherwise have been sterile and heavy to those three who lived there and timothys was but one of hundreds of such homes in this city of londonthe homes of neutral persons of the secure classes who are out of the battle themselves and must find their reason for existing in the battles of others  but for the sweetness of family gossip it must indeed have been lonely there rumours and tales reports surmiseswere they not the children of the house as dear and precious as the prattling babes the brother and sisters had missed in their own journey to talk about them was as near as they could get to the possession of all those children and grandchildren after whom their soft hearts yearned for though it is doubtful whether timothys heart yearned it is indubitable that at the arrival of each fresh forsyte child he was quite upset  useless for young roger to say old cat for euphemia to hold up her hands and cry oh those three and break into her silent laugh with the squeak at the end useless and not too kind  the situation which at this stage might seem and especially to forsyte eyes strangenot to say impossiblewas in view of certain facts not so strange after all some things had been lost sight of and first in the security bred of many harmless marriages it had been forgotten that love is no hothouse flower but a wild plant born of a wet night born of an hour of sunshine sprung from wild seed blown along the road by a wild wind a wild plant that when it blooms by chance within the hedge of our gardens we call a flower and when it blooms outside we call a weed but flower or weed whose scent and colour are always wild and furtherthe facts and figures of their own lives being against the perception of this truthit was not generally recognised by forsytes that where this wild plant springs men and women are but moths around the pale flamelike blossom  it was long since young jolyons escapadethere was danger of a tradition again arising that people in their position never cross the hedge to pluck that flower that one could reckon on having love like measles once in due season and getting over it comfortably for all timeas with measles on a soothing mixture of butter and honeyin the arms of wedlock  of all those whom this strange rumour about bosinney and mrs soames reached james was the most affected he had long forgotten how he had hovered lanky and pale in side whiskers of chestnut hue round emily in the days of his own courtship he had long forgotten the small house in the purlieus of mayfair where he had spent the early days of his married life or rather he had long forgotten the early days not the small housea forsyte never forgot a househe had afterwards sold it at a clear profit of four hundred pounds  he had long forgotten those days with their hopes and fears and doubts about the prudence of the match for emily though pretty had nothing and he himself at that time was making a bare thousand a year and that strange irresistible attraction which had drawn him on till he felt he must die if he could not marry the girl with the fair hair looped so neatly back the fair arms emerging from a skintight bodice the fair form decorously shielded by a cage of really stupendous circumference  james had passed through the fire but he had passed also through the river of years which washes out the fire he had experienced the saddest experience of allforgetfulness of what it was like to be in love  forgotten forgotten so long that he had forgotten even that he had forgotten  and now this rumour had come upon him this rumour about his sons wife very vague a shadow dodging among the palpable straightforward appearances of things unreal unintelligible as a ghost but carrying with it like a ghost inexplicable terror  he tried to bring it home to his mind but it was no more use than trying to apply to himself one of those tragedies he read of daily in his evening paper he simply could not there could be nothing in it it was all their nonsense she didnt get on with soames as well as she might but she was a good little thinga good little thing  like the not inconsiderable majority of men james relished a nice little bit of scandal and would say in a matteroffact tone licking his lips yes yesshe and young dyson they tell me theyre living at monte carlo  but the significance of an affair of this sortof its past its present or its futurehad never struck him what it meant what torture and raptures had gone to its construction what slow overmastering fate had lurked within the facts very naked sometimes sordid but generally spicy presented to his gaze he was not in the habit of blaming praising drawing deductions or generalizing at all about such things he simply listened rather greedily and repeated what he was told finding considerable benefit from the practice as from the consumption of a sherry and bitters before a meal  now however that such a thingor rather the rumour the breath of ithad come near him personally he felt as in a fog which filled his mouth full of a bad thick flavour and made it difficult to draw breath  a scandal a possible scandal  to repeat this word to himself thus was the only way in which he could focus or make it thinkable he had forgotten the sensations necessary for understanding the progress fate or meaning of any such business he simply could no longer grasp the possibilities of people running any risk for the sake of passion  amongst all those persons of his acquaintance who went into the city day after day and did their business there whatever it was and in their leisure moments bought shares and houses and ate dinners and played games as he was told it would have seemed to him ridiculous to suppose that there were any who would run risks for the sake of anything so recondite so figurative as passion  passion he seemed indeed to have heard of it and rules such as a young man and a young woman ought never to be trusted together were fixed in his mind as the parallels of latitude are fixed on a map for all forsytes when it comes to bedrock matters of fact have quite a fine taste in realism but as to anything elsewell he could only appreciate it at all through the catchword scandal  ah but there was no truth in itcould not be he was not afraid she was really a good little thing but there it was when you got a thing like that into your mind and james was of a nervous temperamentone of those men whom things will not leave alone who suffer tortures from anticipation and indecision for fear of letting something slip that he might otherwise secure he was physically unable to make up his mind until absolutely certain that by not making it up he would suffer loss  in life however there were many occasions when the business of making up his mind did not even rest with himself and this was one of them  what could he do talk it over with soames that would only make matters worse and after all there was nothing in it he felt sure  it was all that house he had mistrusted the idea from the first what did soames want to go into the country for and if he must go spending a lot of money building himself a house why not have a firstrate man instead of this young bosinney whom nobody knew anything about he had told them how it would be and he had heard that the house was costing soames a pretty penny beyond what he had reckoned on spending  this fact more than any other brought home to james the real danger of the situation it was always like this with these artistic chaps a sensible man should have nothing to say to them he had warned irene too and see what had come of it  and it suddenly sprang into jamess mind that he ought to go and see for himself in the midst of that fog of uneasiness in which his mind was enveloped the notion that he could go and look at the house afforded him inexplicable satisfaction it may have been simply the decision to do somethingmore possibly the fact that he was going to look at a housethat gave him relief he felt that in staring at an edifice of bricks and mortar of wood and stone built by the suspected man himself he would be looking into the heart of that rumour about irene  without saying a word therefore to anyone he took a hansom to the station and proceeded by train to robin hill thencethere being no flies in accordance with the custom of the neighbourhoodhe found himself obliged to walk  he started slowly up the hill his angular knees and high shoulders bent complainingly his eyes fixed on his feet yet neat for all that in his high hat and his frockcoat on which was the speckless gloss imparted by perfect superintendence emily saw to that that is she did not of course see to itpeople of good position not seeing to each others buttons and emily was of good positionbut she saw that the butler saw to it  he had to ask his way three times on each occasion he repeated the directions given him got the man to repeat them then repeated them a second time for he was naturally of a talkative disposition and one could not be too careful in a new neighbourhood  he kept assuring them that it was a new house he was looking for it was only however when he was shown the roof through the trees that he could feel really satisfied that he had not been directed entirely wrong  a heavy sky seemed to cover the world with the grey whiteness of a whitewashed ceiling there was no freshness or fragrance in the air on such a day even british workmen scarcely cared to do more then they were obliged and moved about their business without the drone of talk which whiles away the pangs of labour  through spaces of the unfinished house shirtsleeved figures worked slowly and sounds arosespasmodic knockings the scraping of metal the sawing of wood with the rumble of wheelbarrows along boards now and again the foremans dog tethered by a string to an oaken beam whimpered feebly with a sound like the singing of a kettle  the freshfitted windowpanes daubed each with a white patch in the centre stared out at james like the eyes of a blind dog  and the building chorus went on strident and mirthless under the greywhite sky but the thrushes hunting amongst the freshturned earth for worms were silent quite  james picked his way among the heaps of gravelthe drive was being laidtill he came opposite the porch here he stopped and raised his eyes there was but little to see from this point of view and that little he took in at once but he stayed in this position many minutes and who shall know of what he thought  his chinablue eyes under white eyebrows that jutted out in little horns never stirred the long upper lip of his wide mouth between the fine white whiskers twitched once or twice it was easy to see from that anxious rapt expression whence soames derived the handicapped look which sometimes came upon his face james might have been saying to himself i dont knowlifes a tough job  in this position bosinney surprised him  james brought his eyes down from whatever birdsnest they had been looking for in the sky to bosinneys face on which was a kind of humorous scorn  how do you do mr forsyte come down to see for yourself  it was exactly what james as we know had come for and he was made correspondingly uneasy he held out his hand however saying  how are you without looking at bosinney  the latter made way for him with an ironical smile  james scented something suspicious in this courtesy i should like to walk round the outside first he said and see what youve been doing  a flagged terrace of rounded stones with a list of two or three inches to port had been laid round the southeast and southwest sides of the house and ran with a bevelled edge into mould which was in preparation for being turfed along this terrace james led the way  now what did this cost he asked when he saw the terrace extending round the corner  what should you think inquired bosinney  how should i know replied james somewhat nonplussed two or three hundred i dare say  the exact sum  james gave him a sharp look but the architect appeared unconscious and he put the answer down to mishearing  on arriving at the garden entrance he stopped to look at the view  that ought to come down he said pointing to the oaktree  you think so you think that with the tree there you dont get enough view for your money  again james eyed him suspiciouslythis young man had a peculiar way of putting things well he said with a perplexed nervous emphasis i dont see what you want with a tree  it shall come down tomorrow said bosinney  james was alarmed oh he said dont go saying i said it was to come down i know nothing about it  no  james went on in a fluster why what should i know about it its nothing to do with me you do it on your own responsibility  youll allow me to mention your name  james grew more and more alarmed i dont know what you want mentioning my name for he muttered youd better leave the tree alone its not your tree  he took out a silk handkerchief and wiped his brow they entered the house like swithin james was impressed by the inner courtyard  you must have spent a deuce of a lot of money here he said after staring at the columns and gallery for some time now what did it cost to put up those columns  i cant tell you offhand thoughtfully answered bosinney but i know it was a deuce of a lot  i should think so said james i should he caught the architects eye and broke off and now whenever he came to anything of which he desired to know the cost he stifled that curiosity  bosinney appeared determined that he should see everything and had not james been of too noticing a nature he would certainly have found himself going round the house a second time he seemed so anxious to be asked questions too that james felt he must be on his guard he began to suffer from his exertions for though wiry enough for a man of his long build he was seventyfive years old  he grew discouraged he seemed no nearer to anything had not obtained from his inspection any of the knowledge he had vaguely hoped for he had merely increased his dislike and mistrust of this young man who had tired him out with his politeness and in whose manner he now certainly detected mockery  the fellow was sharper than he had thought and betterlooking than he had hoped he had aa dont care appearance that james to whom risk was the most intolerable thing in life did not appreciate a peculiar smile too coming when least expected and very queer eyes he reminded james as he said afterwards of a hungry cat this was as near as he could get in conversation with emily to a description of the peculiar exasperation velvetiness and mockery of which bosinneys manner had been composed  at last having seen all that was to be seen he came out again at the door where he had gone in and now feeling that he was wasting time and strength and money all for nothing he took the courage of a forsyte in both hands and looking sharply at bosinney said  i dare say you see a good deal of my daughterinlaw now what does she think of the house but she hasnt seen it i suppose  this he said knowing all about irenes visit not of course that there was anything in the visit except that extraordinary remark she had made about not caring to get homeand the story of how june had taken the news  he had determined by this way of putting the question to give bosinney a chance as he said to himself  the latter was long in answering but kept his eyes with uncomfortable steadiness on james  she has seen the house but i cant tell you what she thinks of it  nervous and baffled james was constitutionally prevented from letting the matter drop  oh he said she has seen it soames brought her down i suppose  bosinney smilingly replied oh no  what did she come down alone  oh no  thenwho brought her  i really dont know whether i ought to tell you who brought her  to james who knew that it was swithin this answer appeared incomprehensible  why he stammered you know that but he stopped suddenly perceiving his danger  well he said if you dont want to tell me i suppose you wont nobody tells me anything  somewhat to his surprise bosinney asked him a question  by the by he said could you tell me if there are likely to be any more of you coming down i should like to be on the spot  any more said james bewildered who should there be more i dont know of any more goodbye  looking at the ground he held out his hand crossed the palm of it with bosinneys and taking his umbrella just above the silk walked away along the terrace  before he turned the corner he glanced back and saw bosinney following him slowlyslinking along the wall as he put it to himself like a great cat he paid no attention when the young fellow raised his hat  outside the drive and out of sight he slackened his pace still more very slowly more bent than when he came lean hungry and disheartened he made his way back to the station  the buccaneer watching him go so sadly home felt sorry perhaps for his behaviour to the old man     chapter vsoames and bosinney correspond  james said nothing to his son of this visit to the house but having occasion to go to timothys one morning on a matter connected with a drainage scheme which was being forced by the sanitary authorities on his brother he mentioned it there  it was not he said a bad house he could see that a good deal could be made of it the fellow was clever in his way though what it was going to cost soames before it was done with he didnt know  euphemia forsyte who happened to be in the roomshe had come round to borrow the rev mr scoles last novel passion and paregoric which was having such a voguechimed in  i saw irene yesterday at the stores she and mr bosinney were having a nice little chat in the groceries  it was thus simply that she recorded a scene which had really made a deep and complicated impression on her she had been hurrying to the silk department of the church and commercial storesthat institution than which with its admirable system admitting only guaranteed persons on a basis of payment before delivery no emporium can be more highly recommended to forsytesto match a piece of prunella silk for her mother who was waiting in the carriage outside  passing through the groceries her eye was unpleasantly attracted by the back view of a very beautiful figure it was so charmingly proportioned so balanced and so well clothed that euphemias instinctive propriety was at once alarmed such figures she knew by intuition rather than experience were rarely connected with virtuecertainly never in her mind for her own back was somewhat difficult to fit  her suspicions were fortunately confirmed a young man coming from the drugs had snatched off his hat and was accosting the lady with the unknown back  it was then that she saw with whom she had to deal the lady was undoubtedly mrs soames the young man mr bosinney concealing herself rapidly over the purchase of a box of tunisian dates for she was impatient of awkwardly meeting people with parcels in her hands and at the busy time of the morning she was quite unintentionally an interested observer of their little interview  mrs soames usually somewhat pale had a delightful colour in her cheeks and mr bosinneys manner was strange though attractive she thought him rather a distinguishedlooking man and georges name for him the buccaneerabout which there was something romanticquite charming he seemed to be pleading indeed they talked so earnestlyor rather he talked so earnestly for mrs soames did not say muchthat they caused inconsiderately an eddy in the traffic one nice old general going towards cigars was obliged to step quite out of the way and chancing to look up and see mrs soames face he actually took off his hat the old fool so like a man  but it was mrs soames eyes that worried euphemia she never once looked at mr bosinney until he moved on and then she looked after him and oh that look  on that look euphemia had spent much anxious thought it is not too much to say that it had hurt her with its dark lingering softness for all the world as though the woman wanted to drag him back and unsay something she had been saying  ah well she had had no time to go deeply into the matter just then with that prunella silk on her hands but she was very intrigueevery she had just nodded to mrs soames to show her that she had seen and as she confided in talking it over afterwards to her chum francie rogers daughter didnt she look caught out just  james most averse at the first blush to accepting any news confirmatory of his own poignant suspicions took her up at once  oh he said theyd be after wallpapers no doubt  euphemia smiled in the groceries she said softly and taking passion and paregoric from the table added and so youll lend me this dear auntie goodbye and went away  james left almost immediately after he was late as it was  when he reached the office of forsyte bustard and forsyte he found soames sitting in his revolving chair drawing up a defence the latter greeted his father with a curt goodmorning and taking an envelope from his pocket said  it may interest you to look through this  james read as follows   309d sloane street may 15  dear forsyte  the construction of your house being now completed my duties as architect have come to an end if i am to go on with the business of decoration which at your request i undertook i should like you to clearly understand that i must have a free hand  you never come down without suggesting something that goes counter to my scheme i have here three letters from you each of which recommends an article i should never dream of putting in i had your father here yesterday afternoon who made further valuable suggestions  please make up your mind therefore whether you want me to decorate for you or to retire which on the whole i should prefer to do  but understand that if i decorate i decorate alone without interference of any sort  if i do the thing i will do it thoroughly but i must have a free hand  yours truly  philip bosinney   the exact and immediate cause of this letter cannot of course be told though it is not improbable that bosinney may have been moved by some sudden revolt against his position towards soamesthat eternal position of art towards propertywhich is so admirably summed up on the back of the most indispensable of modern appliances in a sentence comparable to the very finest in tacitus  thos t sorrow inventor bert m padland proprietor  what are you going to say to him james asked  soames did not even turn his head i havent made up my mind he said and went on with his defence  a client of his having put some buildings on a piece of ground that did not belong to him had been suddenly and most irritatingly warned to take them off again after carefully going into the facts however soames had seen his way to advise that his client had what was known as a title by possession and that though undoubtedly the ground did not belong to him he was entitled to keep it and had better do so and he was now following up this advice by taking steps toas the sailors saymake it so  he had a distinct reputation for sound advice people saying of him go to young forsytea longheaded fellow and he prized this reputation highly  his natural taciturnity was in his favour nothing could be more calculated to give people especially people with property soames had no other clients the impression that he was a safe man and he was safe tradition habit education inherited aptitude native caution all joined to form a solid professional honesty superior to temptationfrom the very fact that it was built on an innate avoidance of risk how could he fall when his soul abhorred circumstances which render a fall possiblea man cannot fall off the floor  and those countless forsytes who in the course of innumerable transactions concerned with property of all sorts from wives to water rights had occasion for the services of a safe man found it both reposeful and profitable to confide in soames that slight superciliousness of his combined with an air of mousing amongst precedents was in his favour tooa man would not be supercilious unless he knew  he was really at the head of the business for though james still came nearly every day to see for himself he did little now but sit in his chair twist his legs slightly confuse things already decided and presently go away again and the other partner bustard was a poor thing who did a great deal of work but whose opinion was never taken  so soames went steadily on with his defence yet it would be idle to say that his mind was at ease he was suffering from a sense of impending trouble that had haunted him for some time past he tried to think it physicala condition of his liverbut knew that it was not  he looked at his watch in a quarter of an hour he was due at the general meeting of the new colliery companyone of uncle jolyons concerns he should see uncle jolyon there and say something to him about bosinneyhe had not made up his mind what but somethingin any case he should not answer this letter until he had seen uncle jolyon he got up and methodically put away the draft of his defence going into a dark little cupboard he turned up the light washed his hands with a piece of brown windsor soap and dried them on a roller towel then he brushed his hair paying strict attention to the parting turned down the light took his hat and saying he would be back at halfpast two stepped into the poultry  it was not far to the offices of the new colliery company in ironmonger lane where and not at the cannon street hotel in accordance with the more ambitious practice of other companies the general meeting was always held old jolyon had from the first set his face against the press what businesshe saidhad the public with his concerns  soames arrived on the stroke of time and took his seat alongside the board who in a row each director behind his own inkpot faced their shareholders  in the centre of this row old jolyon conspicuous in his black tightlybuttoned frockcoat and his white moustaches was leaning back with finger tips crossed on a copy of the directors report and accounts  on his right hand always a little larger than life sat the secretary downbythestarn hemmings an alltoosad sadness beaming in his fine eyes his irongrey beard in mourning like the rest of him giving the feeling of an alltooblack tie behind it  the occasion indeed was a melancholy one only six weeks having elapsed since that telegram had come from scorrier the mining expert on a private mission to the mines informing them that pippin their superintendent had committed suicide in endeavouring after his extraordinary two years silence to write a letter to his board that letter was on the table now it would be read to the shareholders who would of course be put into possession of all the facts  hemmings had often said to soames standing with his coattails divided before the fireplace  what our shareholders dont know about our affairs isnt worth knowing you may take that from me mr soames  on one occasion old jolyon being present soames recollected a little unpleasantness his uncle had looked up sharply and said dont talk nonsense hemmings you mean that what they do know isnt worth knowing old jolyon detested humbug  hemmings angryeyed and wearing a smile like that of a trained poodle had replied in an outburst of artificial applause come now thats good sirthats very good your uncle will have his joke  the next time he had seen soames he had taken the opportunity of saying to him the chairmans getting very oldi cant get him to understand things and hes so wilfulbut what can you expect with a chin like his  soames had nodded  everyone knew that uncle jolyons chin was a caution he was looking worried today in spite of his general meeting look he soames should certainly speak to him about bosinney  beyond old jolyon on the left was little mr booker and he too wore his general meeting look as though searching for some particularly tender shareholder and next him was the deaf director with a frown and beyond the deaf director again was old mr bleedham very bland and having an air of conscious virtueas well he might knowing that the brownpaper parcel he always brought to the boardroom was concealed behind his hat one of that oldfashioned class of flatbrimmed tophats which go with very large bow ties cleanshaven lips fresh cheeks and neat little white whiskers  soames always attended the general meeting it was considered better that he should do so in case anything should arise he glanced round with his close supercilious air at the walls of the room where hung plans of the mine and harbour together with a large photograph of a shaft leading to a working which had proved quite remarkably unprofitable this photographa witness to the eternal irony underlying commercial enterprisestill retained its position on thewall an effigy of the directors pet but dead lamb  and now old jolyon rose to present the report and accounts  veiling under a jovelike serenity that perpetual antagonism deepseated in the bosom of a director towards his shareholders he faced them calmly soames faced them too he knew most of them by sight there was old scrubsole a tar man who always came as hemmings would say to make himself nasty a cantankerouslooking old fellow with a red face a jowl and an enormous lowcrowned hat reposing on his knee and the rev mr boms who always proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman in which he invariably expressed the hope that the board would not forget to elevate their employees using the word with a double e as being more vigorous and anglosaxon he had the strong imperialistic tendencies of his cloth it was his salutary custom to buttonhole a director afterwards and ask him whether he thought the coming year would be good or bad and according to the trend of the answer to buy or sell three shares within the ensuing fortnight  and there was that military man major obally who could not help speaking if only to second the reelection of the auditor and who sometimes caused serious consternation by taking toastsproposals ratherout of the hands of persons who had been flattered with little slips of paper entrusting the said proposals to their care  these made up the lot together with four or five strong silent shareholders with whom soames could sympathizemen of business who liked to keep an eye on their affairs for themselves without being fussygood solid men who came to the city every day and went back in the evening to good solid wives  good solid wives there was something in that thought which roused the nameless uneasiness in soames again  what should he say to his uncle what answer should he make to this letter      if any shareholder has any question to put i shall be glad to answer it a soft thump old jolyon had let the report and accounts fall and stood twisting his tortoiseshell glasses between thumb and forefinger  the ghost of a smile appeared on soames face they had better hurry up with their questions he well knew his uncles method the ideal one of at once saying i propose then that the report and accounts be adopted never let them get their windshareholders were notoriously wasteful of time  a tall whitebearded man with a gaunt dissatisfied face arose  i believe i am in order mr chairman in raising a question on this figure of l5000 in the accounts to the widow and family he looked sourly round of our late superintendent who soerilladvisedly i sayilladvisedly committed suicide at a time when his services were of the utmost value to this company you have stated that the agreement which he has so unfortunately cut short with his own hand was for a period of five years of which one only had expiredi  old jolyon made a gesture of impatience  i believe i am in order mr chairmani ask whether this amount paid or proposed to be paid by the board to the erdeceasedis for services which might have been rendered to the companyhad he not committed suicide  it is in recognition of past services which we all knowyou as well as any of usto have been of vital value  then sir all i have to say is that the services being past the amount is too much  the shareholder sat down  old jolyon waited a second and said i now propose that the report and  the shareholder rose again may i ask if the board realizes that it is not their money whichi dont hesitate to say that if it were their money  a second shareholder with a round dogged face whom soames recognised as the late superintendents brotherinlaw got up and said warmly in my opinion sir the sum is not enough  the rev mr boms now rose to his feet if i may venture to express myself he said i should say that the fact of theerdeceased having committed suicide should weigh very heavilyvery heavily with our worthy chairman i have no doubt it has weighed with him fori say this for myself and i think for everyone present hear hearhe enjoys our confidence in a high degree we all desire i should hope to be charitable but i feel sure helooked severely at the late superintendents brotherinlaw that he will in some way by some written expression or better perhaps by reducing the amount record our grave disapproval that so promising and valuable a life should have been thus impiously removed from a sphere where both its own interests andif i may say soour interests so imperatively demanded its continuance we should notnay we may notcountenance so grave a dereliction of all duty both human and divine  the reverend gentleman resumed his seat the late superintendents brotherinlaw again rose what i have said i stick to he said the amount is not enough  the first shareholder struck in i challenge the legality of the payment in my opinion this payment is not legal the companys solicitor is present i believe i am in order in asking him the question  all eyes were now turned upon soames something had arisen  he stood up closelipped and cold his nerves inwardly fluttered his attention tweaked away at last from contemplation of that cloud looming on the horizon of his mind  the point he said in a low thin voice is by no means clear as there is no possibility of future consideration being received it is doubtful whether the payment is strictly legal if it is desired the opinion of the court could be taken  the superintendents brotherinlaw frowned and said in a meaning tone we have no doubt the opinion of the court could be taken may i ask the name of the gentleman who has given us that striking piece of information mr soames forsyte indeed he looked from soames to old jolyon in a pointed manner  a flush coloured soames pale cheeks but his superciliousness did not waver old jolyon fixed his eyes on the speaker  if he said the late superintendents brotherinlaw has nothing more to say i propose that the report and accounts  at this moment however there rose one of those five silent stolid shareholders who had excited soames sympathy he said  i deprecate the proposal altogether we are expected to give charity to this mans wife and children who you tell us were dependent on him they may have been i do not care whether they were or not i object to the whole thing on principle it is high time a stand was made against this sentimental humanitarianism the country is eaten up with it i object to my money being paid to these people of whom i know nothing who have done nothing to earn it i object in toto it is not business i now move that the report and accounts be put back and amended by striking out the grant altogether  old jolyon had remained standing while the strong silent man was speaking the speech awoke an echo in all hearts voicing as it did the worship of strong men the movement against generosity which had at that time already commenced among the saner members of the community  the words it is not business had moved even the board privately everyone felt that indeed it was not but they knew also the chairmans domineering temper and tenacity he too at heart must feel that it was not business but he was committed to his own proposition would he go back upon it it was thought to be unlikely  all waited with interest old jolyon held up his hand darkrimmed glasses depending between his finger and thumb quivered slightly with a suggestion of menace  he addressed the strong silent shareholder  knowing as you do the efforts of our late superintendent upon the occasion of the explosion at the mines do you seriously wish me to put that amendment sir  i do  old jolyon put the amendment  does anyone second this he asked looking calmly round  and it was then that soames looking at his uncle felt the power of will that was in that old man no one stirred looking straight into the eyes of the strong silent shareholder old jolyon said  i now move that the report and accounts for the year 1886 be received and adopted you second that those in favour signify the same in the usual way contraryno carried the next business gentlemen  soames smiled certainly uncle jolyon had a way with him  but now his attention relapsed upon bosinney  odd how that fellow haunted his thoughts even in business hours  irenes visit to the housebut there was nothing in that except that she might have told him but then again she never did tell him anything she was more silent more touchy every day he wished to god the house were finished and they were in it away from london town did not suit her her nerves were not strong enough that nonsense of the separate room had cropped up again  the meeting was breaking up now underneath the photograph of the lost shaft hemmings was buttonholed by the rev mr boms little mr booker his bristling eyebrows wreathed in angry smiles was having a parting turnup with old scrubsole the two hated each other like poison there was some matter of a tarcontract between them little mr booker having secured it from the board for a nephew of his over old scrubsoles head soames had heard that from hemmings who liked a gossip more especially about his directors except indeed old jolyon of whom he was afraid  soames awaited his opportunity the last shareholder was vanishing through the door when he approached his uncle who was putting on his hat  can i speak to you for a minute uncle jolyon  it is uncertain what soames expected to get out of this interview  apart from that somewhat mysterious awe in which forsytes in general held old jolyon due to his philosophic twist or perhapsas hemmings would doubtless have saidto his chin there was and always had been a subtle antagonism between the younger man and the old it had lurked under their dry manner of greeting under their noncommittal allusions to each other and arose perhaps from old jolyons perception of the quiet tenacity obstinacy he rather naturally called it of the young man of a secret doubt whether he could get his own way with him  both these forsytes wide asunder as the poles in many respects possessed in their different waysto a greater degree than the rest of the familythat essential quality of tenacious and prudent insight into affairs which is the highwater mark of their great class either of them with a little luck and opportunity was equal to a lofty career either of them would have made a good financier a great contractor a statesman though old jolyon in certain of his moods when under the influence of a cigar or of naturewould have been capable of not perhaps despising but certainly of questioning his own high position while soames who never smoked cigars would not  then too in old jolyons mind there was always the secret ache that the son of jamesof james whom he had always thought such a poor thing should be pursuing the paths of success while his own son  and last not leastfor he was no more outside the radiation of family gossip than any other forsytehe had now heard the sinister indefinite but none the less disturbing rumour about bosinney and his pride was wounded to the quick  characteristically his irritation turned not against irene but against soames the idea that his nephews wife why couldnt the fellow take better care of heroh quaint injustice as though soames could possibly take more careshould be drawing to herself junes lover was intolerably humiliating and seeing the danger he did not like james hide it away in sheer nervousness but owned with the dispassion of his broader outlook that it was not unlikely there was something very attractive about irene  he had a presentiment on the subject of soames communication as they left the board room together and went out into the noise and hurry of cheapside they walked together a good minute without speaking soames with his mousing mincing step and old jolyon upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walkingstick  they turned presently into comparative quiet for old jolyons way to a second board led him in the direction of moorage street  then soames without lifting his eyes began ive had this letter from bosinney you see what he says i thought id let you know ive spent a lot more than i intended on this house and i want the position to be clear  old jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter what he says is clear enough he said  he talks about a free hand replied soames  old jolyon looked at him the longsuppressed irritation and antagonism towards this young fellow whose affairs were beginning to intrude upon his own burst from him  well if you dont trust him why do you employ him  soames stole a sideway look its much too late to go into that he said i only want it to be quite understood that if i give him a free hand he doesnt let me in i thought if you were to speak to him it would carry more weight  no said old jolyon abruptly ill have nothing to do with it  the words of both uncle and nephew gave the impression of unspoken meanings far more important behind and the look they interchanged was like a revelation of this consciousness  well said soames i thought for junes sake id tell you thats all i thought youd better know i shant stand any nonsense  what is that to me old jolyon took him up  oh i dont know said soames and flurried by that sharp look he was unable to say more dont say i didnt tell you he added sulkily recovering his composure  tell me said old jolyon i dont know what you mean you come worrying me about a thing like this i dont want to hear about your affairs you must manage them yourself  very well said soames immovably i will  goodmorning then said old jolyon and they parted  soames retraced his steps and going into a celebrated eatinghouse asked for a plate of smoked salmon and a glass of chablis he seldom ate much in the middle of the day and generally ate standing finding the position beneficial to his liver which was very sound but to which he desired to put down all his troubles  when he had finished he went slowly back to his office with bent head taking no notice of the swarming thousands on the pavements who in their turn took no notice of him  the evening post carried the following reply to bosinney   forsyte bustard and forsyte  commissioners for oaths  92001 branch lane poultry ec  may 17 1887  dear bosinney  i have received your letter the terms of which not a little surprise me i was under the impression that you had and have had all along a free hand for i do not recollect that any suggestions i have been so unfortunate as to make have met with your approval in giving you in accordance with your request this free hand i wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated inclusive of your fee as arranged between us must not exceed twelve thousand poundsl12000 this gives you an ample margin and as you know is far more than i originally contemplated  i am  yours truly  soames forsyte   on the following day he received a note from bosinney   philip baynes bosinney  architect  309d sloane street sw  may 18  dear forsyte  if you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration i can bind myself to the exact pound i am afraid you are mistaken i can see that you are tired of the arrangement and of me and i had better therefore resign  yours faithfully  philip baynes bosinney   soames pondered long and painfully over his answer and late at night in the diningroom when irene had gone to bed he composed the following   62 montpellier square sw  may 19 1887  dear bosinney  i think that in both our interests it would be extremely undesirable that matters should be so left at this stage i did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty between us this being so i should like you to reconsider your answer you have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence and i hope you will see your way to completing the decorations in the matter of which i know it is difficult to be absolutely exact  yours truly  soames forsyte   bosinneys answer which came in the course of the next day was   may 20  dear forsyte  very well  ph bosinney     chapter viold jolyon at the zoo  old jolyon disposed of his second meetingan ordinary boardsummarily he was so dictatorial that his fellow directors were left in cabal over the increasing domineeringness of old forsyte which they were far from intending to stand much longer they said  he went out by underground to portland road station whence he took a cab and drove to the zoo  he had an assignation there one of those assignations that had lately been growing more frequent to which his increasing uneasiness about june and the change in her as he expressed it was driving him  she buried herself away and was growing thin if he spoke to her he got no answer or had his head snapped off or she looked as if she would burst into tears she was as changed as she could be all through this bosinney as for telling him about anything not a bit of it  and he would sit for long spells brooding his paper unread before him a cigar extinct between his lips she had been such a companion to him ever since she was three years old and he loved her so  forces regardless of family or class or custom were beating down his guard impending events over which he had no control threw their shadows on his head the irritation of one accustomed to have his way was roused against he knew not what  chafing at the slowness of his cab he reached the zoo door but with his sunny instinct for seizing the good of each moment he forgot his vexation as he walked towards the tryst  from the stone terrace above the bearpit his son and his two grandchildren came hastening down when they saw old jolyon coming and led him away towards the lionhouse they supported him on either side holding one to each of his handswhilst jolly perverse like his father carried his grandfathers umbrella in such a way as to catch peoples legs with the crutch of the handle  young jolyon followed  it was as good as a play to see his father with the children but such a play as brings smiles with tears behind an old man and two small children walking together can be seen at any hour of the day but the sight of old jolyon with jolly and holly seemed to young jolyon a special peepshow of the things that lie at the bottom of our hearts the complete surrender of that erect old figure to those little figures on either hand was too poignantly tender and being a man of an habitual reflex action young jolyon swore softly under his breath the show affected him in a way unbecoming to a forsyte who is nothing if not undemonstrative  thus they reached the lionhouse  there had been a morning fete at the botanical gardens and a large number of forsythat is of welldressed people who kept carriages had brought them on to the zoo so as to have more if possible for their money before going back to rutland gate or bryanston square  lets go on to the zoo they had said to each other itll be great fun it was a shilling day and there would not be all those horrid common people  in front of the long line of cages they were collected in rows watching the tawny ravenous beasts behind the bars await their only pleasure of the fourandtwenty hours the hungrier the beast the greater the fascination but whether because the spectators envied his appetite or more humanely because it was so soon to be satisfied young jolyon could not tell remarks kept falling on his ears thats a nastylooking brute that tiger oh what a love look at his little mouth yes hes rather nice dont go too near mother  and frequently with little pats one or another would clap their hands to their pockets behind and look round as though expecting young jolyon or some disinterestedlooking person to relieve them of the contents  a wellfed man in a white waistcoat said slowly through his teeth its all greed they cant be hungry why they take no exercise at these words a tiger snatched a piece of bleeding liver and the fat man laughed his wife in a paris model frock and gold nosenippers reproved him how can you laugh harry such a horrid sight  young jolyon frowned  the circumstances of his life though he had ceased to take a too personal view of them had left him subject to an intermittent contempt and the class to which he had belongedthe carriage classespecially excited his sarcasm  to shut up a lion or tiger in confinement was surely a horrible barbarity but no cultivated person would admit this  the idea of its being barbarous to confine wild animals had probably never even occurred to his father for instance he belonged to the old school who considered it at once humanizing and educational to confine baboons and panthers holding the view no doubt that in course of time they might induce these creatures not so unreasonably to die of misery and heartsickness against the bars of their cages and put the society to the expense of getting others in his eyes as in the eyes of all forsytes the pleasure of seeing these beautiful creatures in a state of captivity far outweighed the inconvenience of imprisonment to beasts whom god had so improvidently placed in a state of freedom it was for the animals good removing them at once from the countless dangers of open air and exercise and enabling them to exercise their functions in the guaranteed seclusion of a private compartment indeed it was doubtful what wild animals were made for but to be shut up in cages  but as young jolyon had in his constitution the elements of impartiality he reflected that to stigmatize as barbarity that which was merely lack of imagination must be wrong for none who held these views had been placed in a similar position to the animals they caged and could not therefore be expected to enter into their sensations it was not until they were leaving the gardensjolly and holly in a state of blissful deliriumthat old jolyon found an opportunity of speaking to his son on the matter next his heart i dont know what to make of it he said if shes to go on as shes going on now i cant tell whats to come i wanted her to see the doctor but she wont shes not a bit like me shes your mother all over obstinate as a mule if she doesnt want to do a thing she wont and theres an end of it  young jolyon smiled his eyes had wandered to his fathers chin a pair of you he thought but he said nothing  and then went on old jolyon theres this bosinney i should like to punch the fellows head but i cant i suppose thoughi dont see why you shouldnt he added doubtfully  what has he done far better that it should come to an end if they dont hit it off  old jolyon looked at his son now they had actually come to discuss a subject connected with the relations between the sexes he felt distrustful jo would be sure to hold some loose view or other  well i dont know what you think he said i dare say your sympathys with himshouldnt be surprised but i think hes behaving precious badly and if he comes my way i shall tell him so he dropped the subject  it was impossible to discuss with his son the true nature and meaning of bosinneys defection had not his son done the very same thing worse if possible fifteen years ago there seemed no end to the consequences of that piece of folly  young jolyon also was silent he had quickly penetrated his fathers thought for dethroned from the high seat of an obvious and uncomplicated view of things he had become both perceptive and subtle  the attitude he had adopted towards sexual matters fifteen years before however was too different from his fathers there was no bridging the gulf  he said coolly i suppose hes fallen in love with some other woman  old jolyon gave him a dubious look i cant tell he said they say so  then its probably true remarked young jolyon unexpectedly and i suppose theyve told you who she is  yes said old jolyon soamess wife  young jolyon did not whistle the circumstances of his own life had rendered him incapable of whistling on such a subject but he looked at his father while the ghost of a smile hovered over his face  if old jolyon saw he took no notice  she and june were bosom friends he muttered  poor little june said young jolyon softly he thought of his daughter still as a babe of three  old jolyon came to a sudden halt  i dont believe a word of it he said its some old womans tale get me a cab jo im tired to death  they stood at a corner to see if an empty cab would come along while carriage after carriage drove past bearing forsytes of all descriptions from the zoo the harness the liveries the gloss on the horses coats shone and glittered in the may sunlight and each equipage landau sociable barouche victoria or brougham seemed to roll out proudly from its wheels  i and my horses and my men you know indeed the whole turnout have cost a pot but we were worth it every penny look at master and at missis now the dawgs ease with securityah thats the ticket  and such as everyone knows is fit accompaniment for a perambulating forsyte  amongst these carriages was a barouche coming at a greater pace than the others drawn by a pair of bright bay horses it swung on its high springs and the four people who filled it seemed rocked as in a cradle  this chariot attracted young jolyons attention and suddenly on the back seat he recognised his uncle james unmistakable in spite of the increased whiteness of his whiskers opposite their backs defended by sunshades rachel forsyte and her elder but married sister winifred dartie in irreproachable toilettes had posed their heads haughtily like two of the birds they had been seeing at the zoo while by james side reclined dartie in a brandnew frockcoat buttoned tight and square with a large expanse of carefully shot linen protruding below each wristband  an extra if subdued sparkle an added touch of the best gloss or varnish characterized this vehicle and seemed to distinguish it from all the others as though by some happy extravagancelike that which marks out the real work of art from the ordinary pictureit were designated as the typical car the very throne of forsytedom  old jolyon did not see them pass he was petting poor holly who was tired but those in the carriage had taken in the little group the ladies heads tilted suddenly there was a spasmodic screening movement of parasols james face protruded naively like the head of a long bird his mouth slowly opening the shieldlike rounds of the parasols grew smaller and smaller and vanished  young jolyon saw that he had been recognised even by winifred who could not have been more than fifteen when he had forfeited the right to be considered a forsyte  there was not much change in them he remembered the exact look of their turnout all that time ago horses men carriageall different now no doubtbut of the precise stamp of fifteen years before the same neat display the same nicely calculated arrogance ease with security the swing exact the pose of the sunshades exact exact the spirit of the whole thing  and in the sunlight defended by the haughty shields of parasols carriage after carriage went by  uncle james has just passed with his female folk said young jolyon  his father looked black did your uncle see us yes hmph whats he want coming down into these parts  an empty cab drove up at this moment and old jolyon stopped it  i shall see you again before long my boy he said dont you go paying any attention to what ive been saying about young bosinneyi dont believe a word of it  kissing the children who tried to detain him he stepped in and was borne away  young jolyon who had taken holly up in his arms stood motionless at the corner looking after the cab     chapter viiafternoon at timothys  if old jolyon as he got into his cab had said i wont believe a word of it he would more truthfully have expressed his sentiments  the notion that james and his womankind had seen him in the company of his son had awakened in him not only the impatience he always felt when crossed but that secret hostility natural between brothers the roots of whichlittle nursery rivalriessometimes toughen and deepen as life goes on and all hidden support a plant capable of producing in season the bitterest fruits  hitherto there had been between these six brothers no more unfriendly feeling than that caused by the secret and natural doubt that the others might be richer than themselves a feeling increased to the pitch of curiosity by the approach of deaththat end of all handicapsand the great closeness of their man of business who with some sagacity would profess to nicholas ignorance of james income to james ignorance of old jolyons to jolyon ignorance of rogers to roger ignorance of swithins while to swithin he would say most irritatingly that nicholas must be a rich man timothy alone was exempt being in giltedged securities  but now between two of them at least had arisen a very different sense of injury from the moment when james had the impertinence to pry into his affairsas he put itold jolyon no longer chose to credit this story about bosinney his granddaughter slighted through a member of that fellows family he made up his mind that bosinney was maligned there must be some other reason for his defection  june had flown out at him or something she was as touchy as she could be  he would however let timothy have a bit of his mind and see if he would go on dropping hints and he would not let the grass grow under his feet either he would go there at once and take very good care that he didnt have to go again on the same errand  he saw james carriage blocking the pavement in front of the bower so they had got there before himcackling about having seen him he dared say and further on swithins greys were turning their noses towards the noses of james bays as though in conclave over the family while their coachmen were in conclave above  old jolyon depositing his hat on the chair in the narrow hall where that hat of bosinneys had so long ago been mistaken for a cat passed his thin hand grimly over his face with its great drooping white moustaches as though to remove all traces of expression and made his way upstairs  he found the front drawingroom full it was full enough at the best of timeswithout visitorswithout any one in itfor timothy and his sisters following the tradition of their generation considered that a room was not quite nice unless it was properly furnished it held therefore eleven chairs a sofa three tables two cabinets innumerable knicknacks and part of a large grand piano and now occupied by mrs small aunt hester by swithin james rachel winifred euphemia who had come in again to return passion and paregoric which she had read at lunch and her chum frances rogers daughter the musical forsyte the one who composed songs there was only one chair left unoccupied except of course the two that nobody ever sat onand the only standing room was occupied by the cat on whom old jolyon promptly stepped  in these days it was by no means unusual for timothy to have so many visitors the family had always one and all had a real respect for aunt ann and now that she was gone they were coming far more frequently to the bower and staying longer  swithin had been the first to arrive and seated torpid in a red satin chair with a gilt back he gave every appearance of lasting the others out and symbolizing bosinneys name the big one with his great stature and bulk his thick white hair his puffy immovable shaven face he looked more primeval than ever in the highly upholstered room  his conversation as usual of late had turned at once upon irene and he had lost no time in giving aunts juley and hester his opinion with regard to this rumour he heard was going about noas he saidshe might want a bit of flirtationa pretty woman must have her fling but more than that he did not believe nothing open she had too much good sense too much proper appreciation of what was due to her position and to the family no sc he was going to say scandal but the very idea was so preposterous that he waved his hand as though to saybut let that pass  granted that swithin took a bachelors view of the situationstill what indeed was not due to that family in which so many had done so well for themselves had attained a certain position if he had heard in dark pessimistic moments the words yeomen and very small beer used in connection with his origin did he believe them  no he cherished hugging it pathetically to his bosom the secret theory that there was something distinguished somewhere in his ancestry  must be he once said to young jolyon before the latter went to the bad look at us weve got on there must be good blood in us somewhere  he had been fond of young jolyon the boy had been in a good set at college had known that old ruffian sir charles fistes sonsa pretty rascal one of them had turned out too and there was style about himit was a thousand pities he had run off with that halfforeign governess if he must go off like that why couldnt he have chosen someone who would have done them credit and what was he nowan underwriter at lloyds they said he even painted picturespictures damme he might have ended as sir jolyon forsyte bart with a seat in parliament and a place in the country  it was swithin who following the impulse which sooner or later urges thereto some member of every great family went to the heralds office where they assured him that he was undoubtedly of the same family as the wellknown forsites with an i whose arms were three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules hoping no doubt to get him to take them up  swithin however did not do this but having ascertained that the crest was a pheasant proper and the motto for forsite he had the pheasant proper placed upon his carriage and the buttons of his coachman and both crest and motto on his writingpaper the arms he hugged to himself partly because not having paid for them he thought it would look ostentatious to put them on his carriage and he hated ostentation and partly because he like any practical man all over the country had a secret dislike and contempt for things he could not understand he found it hard as anyone might to swallow three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules  he never forgot however their having told him that if he paid for them he would be entitled to use them and it strengthened his conviction that he was a gentleman imperceptibly the rest of the family absorbed the pheasant proper and some more serious than others adopted the motto old jolyon however refused to use the latter saying that it was humbug meaning nothing so far as he could see  among the older generation it was perhaps known at bottom from what great historical event they derived their crest and if pressed on the subject sooner than tell a liethey did not like telling lies having an impression that only frenchmen and russians told themthey would confess hurriedly that swithin had got hold of it somehow  among the younger generation the matter was wrapped in a discretion proper they did not want to hurt the feelings of their elders nor to feel ridiculous themselves they simply used the crest  no said swithin he had had an opportunity of seeing for himself and what he should say was that there was nothing in her manner to that young buccaneer or bosinney or whatever his name was different from her manner to himself in fact he should rather say but here the entrance of frances and euphemia put an unfortunate stop to the conversation for this was not a subject which could be discussed before young people  and though swithin was somewhat upset at being stopped like this on the point of saying something important he soon recovered his affability he was rather fond of francesfrancie as she was called in the family she was so smart and they told him she made a pretty little pot of pinmoney by her songs he called it very clever of her  he rather prided himself indeed on a liberal attitude towards women not seeing any reason why they shouldnt paint pictures or write tunes or books even for the matter of that especially if they could turn a useful penny by it not at allkept them out of mischief it was not as if they were men  little francie as she was usually called with goodnatured contempt was an important personage if only as a standing illustration of the attitude of forsytes towards the arts she was not really little but rather tall with dark hair for a forsyte which together with a grey eye gave her what was called a celtic appearance she wrote songs with titles like breathing sighs or kiss me mother ere i die with a refrain like an anthem      kiss me mother ere i die      kiss mekiss me mother ah      kiss ah kiss me eere i      kiss me mother ere i dddie  she wrote the words to them herself and other poems in lighter moments she wrote waltzes one of which the kensington coil was almost national to kensington having a sweet dip in it  it was very original then there were her songs for little people at once educational and witty especially granmas porgie and that ditty almost prophetically imbued with the coming imperial spirit entitled black him in his little eye  any publisher would take these and reviews like high living and the ladies genteel guide went into raptures over another of miss francie forsytes spirited ditties sparkling and pathetic we ourselves were moved to tears and laughter miss forsyte should go far  with the true instinct of her breed francie had made a point of knowing the right peoplepeople who would write about her and talk about her and people in society tookeeping a mental register of just where to exert her fascinations and an eye on that steady scale of rising prices which in her minds eye represented the future in this way she caused herself to be universally respected  once at a time when her emotions were whipped by an attachmentfor the tenor of rogers life with its wholehearted collection of house property had induced in his only daughter a tendency towards passionshe turned to great and sincere work choosing the sonata form for the violin this was the only one of her productions that troubled the forsytes they felt at once that it would not sell  roger who liked having a clever daughter well enough and often alluded to the amount of pocketmoney she made for herself was upset by this violin sonata  rubbish like that he called it francie had borrowed young flageoletti from euphemia to play it in the drawingroom at princes gardens  as a matter of fact roger was right it was rubbish butannoying the sort of rubbish that wouldnt sell as every forsyte knows rubbish that sells is not rubbish at allfar from it  and yet in spite of the sound common sense which fixed the worth of art at what it would fetch some of the forsytesaunt hester for instance who had always been musicalcould not help regretting that francies music was not classical the same with her poems but then as aunt hester said they didnt see any poetry nowadays all the poems were little light things  there was nobody who could write a poem like paradise lost or childe harold either of which made you feel that you really had read something still it was nice for francie to have something to occupy her while other girls were spending money shopping she was making it  and both aunt hester and aunt juley were always ready to listen to the latest story of how francie had got her price increased  they listened now together with swithin who sat pretending not to for these young people talked so fast and mumbled so he never could catch what they said  and i cant think said mrs septimus how you do it i should never have the audacity  francie smiled lightly id much rather deal with a man than a woman women are so sharp  my dear cried mrs small im sure were not  euphemia went off into her silent laugh and ending with the squeak said as though being strangled oh youll kill me some day auntie  swithin saw no necessity to laugh he detested people laughing when he himself perceived no joke indeed he detested euphemia altogether to whom he always alluded as nicks daughter whats she calledthe pale one he had just missed being her godfatherindeed would have been had he not taken a firm stand against her outlandish name he hated becoming a godfather swithin then said to francie with dignity its a fine dayerfor the time of year but euphemia who knew perfectly well that he had refused to be her godfather turned to aunt hester and began telling her how she had seen irenemrs soamesat the church and commercial stores  and soames was with her said aunt hester to whom mrs small had as yet had no opportunity of relating the incident  soames with her of course not  but was she all alone in london  oh no there was mr bosinney with her she was perfectly dressed  but swithin hearing the name irene looked severely at euphemia who it is true never did look well in a dress whatever she may have done on other occasions and said  dressed like a lady ive no doubt its a pleasure to see her  at this moment james and his daughters were announced dartie feeling badly in want of a drink had pleaded an appointment with his dentist and being put down at the marble arch had got into a hansom and was already seated in the window of his club in piccadilly  his wife he told his cronies had wanted to take him to pay some calls it was not in his linenot exactly haw  hailing the waiter he sent him out to the hall to see what had won the 430 race he was dogtired he said and that was a fact had been drivin about with his wife to shows all the afternoon had put his foot down at last a fellow must live his own life  at this moment glancing out of the bay windowfor he loved this seat whence he could see everybody passhis eye unfortunately or perhaps fortunately chanced to light on the figure of soames who was mousing across the road from the green parkside with the evident intention of coming in for he too belonged to the iseeum  dartie sprang to his feet grasping his glass he muttered something about that 430 race and swiftly withdrew to the cardroom where soames never came here in complete isolation and a dim light he lived his own life till half past seven by which hour he knew soames must certainly have left the club  it would not do as he kept repeating to himself whenever he felt the impulse to join the gossips in the baywindow getting too strong for himit absolutely would not do with finances as low as his and the old man james rusty ever since that business over the oil shares which was no fault of his to risk a row with winifred  if soames were to see him in the club it would be sure to come round to her that he wasnt at the dentists at all he never knew a family where things came round so uneasily amongst the green baize cardtables a frown on his olive coloured face his check trousers crossed and patentleather boots shining through the gloom he sat biting his forefinger and wondering where the deuce he was to get the money if erotic failed to win the lancashire cup  his thoughts turned gloomily to the forsytes what a set they were there was no getting anything out of themat least it was a matter of extreme difficulty they were so dd particular about money matters not a sportsman amongst the lot unless it were george that fellow soames for instance would have a fit if you tried to borrow a tenner from him or if he didnt have a fit he looked at you with his cursed supercilious smile as if you were a lost soul because you were in want of money  and that wife of his darties mouth watered involuntarily he had tried to be on good terms with her as one naturally would with any pretty sisterinlaw but he would be cursed if the he mentally used a coarse wordwould have anything to say to himshe looked at him indeed as if he were dirtand yet she could go far enough he wouldnt mind betting he knew women they werent made with soft eyes and figures like that for nothing as that fellow soames would jolly soon find out if there were anything in what he had heard about this buccaneer johnny  rising from his chair dartie took a turn across the room ending in front of the lookingglass over the marble chimneypiece and there he stood for a long time contemplating in the glass the reflection of his face it had that look peculiar to some men of having been steeped in linseed oil with its waxed dark moustaches and the little distinguished commencements of side whiskers and concernedly he felt the promise of a pimple on the side of his slightly curved and fattish nose  in the meantime old jolyon had found the remaining chair in timothys commodious drawingroom his advent had obviously put a stop to the conversation decided awkwardness having set in aunt juley with her wellknown kindheartedness hastened to set people at their ease again  yes jolyon she said we were just saying that you havent been here for a long time but we mustnt be surprised youre busy of course james was just saying what a busy time of year  was he said old jolyon looking hard at james it wouldnt be half so busy if everybody minded their own business  james brooding in a small chair from which his knees ran uphill shifted his feet uneasily and put one of them down on the cat which had unwisely taken refuge from old jolyon beside him  here youve got a cat here he said in an injured voice withdrawing his foot nervously as he felt it squeezing into the soft furry body  several said old jolyon looking at one face and another i trod on one just now  a silence followed  then mrs small twisting her fingers and gazing round with pathetic calm asked and how is dear june  a twinkle of humour shot through the sternness of old jolyons eyes extraordinary old woman juley no one quite like her for saying the wrong thing  bad he said london dont agree with hertoo many people about too much clatter and chatter by half he laid emphasis on the words and again looked james in the face  nobody spoke  a feeling of its being too dangerous to take a step in any direction or hazard any remark had fallen on them all something of the sense of the impending that comes over the spectator of a greek tragedy had entered that upholstered room filled with those whitehaired frockcoated old men and fashionably attired women who were all of the same blood between all of whom existed an unseizable resemblance  not that they were conscious of itthe visits of such fateful bitter spirits are only felt  then swithin rose he would not sit there feeling like thathe was not to be put down by anyone and manoeuvring round the room with added pomp he shook hands with each separately  you tell timothy from me he said that he coddles himself too much then turning to francie whom he considered smart he added you come with me for a drive one of these days but this conjured up the vision of that other eventful drive which had been so much talked about and he stood quite still for a second with glassy eyes as though waiting to catch up with the significance of what he himself had said then suddenly recollecting that he didnt care a damn he turned to old jolyon well goodbye jolyon you shouldnt go about without an overcoat youll be getting sciatica or something and kicking the cat slightly with the pointed tip of his patent leather boot he took his huge form away  when he had gone everyone looked secretly at the others to see how they had taken the mention of the word drivethe word which had become famous and acquired an overwhelming importance as the only officialso to speaknews in connection with the vague and sinister rumour clinging to the family tongue  euphemia yielding to an impulse said with a short laugh im glad uncle swithin doesnt ask me to go for drives  mrs small to reassure her and smooth over any little awkwardness the subject might have replied my dear he likes to take somebody well dressed who will do him a little credit i shall never forget the drive he took me it was an experience and her chubby round old face was spread for a moment with a strange contentment then broke into pouts and tears came into her eyes she was thinking of that long ago driving tour she had once taken with septimus small  james who had relapsed into his nervous brooding in the little chair suddenly roused himself hes a funny fellow swithin he said but in a halfhearted way  old jolyons silence his stern eyes held them all in a kind of paralysis he was disconcerted himself by the effect of his own wordsan effect which seemed to deepen the importance of the very rumour he had come to scotch but he was still angry  he had not done with them yetno nohe would give them another rub or two  he did not wish to rub his nieces he had no quarrel with thema young and presentable female always appealed to old jolyons clemencybut that fellow james and in a less degree perhaps those others deserved all they would get and he too asked for timothy  as though feeling that some danger threatened her younger brother aunt juley suddenly offered him tea there it is she said all cold and nasty waiting for you in the back drawing room but smither shall make you some fresh  old jolyon rose thank you he said looking straight at james but ive no time for tea andscandal and the rest of it its time i was at home goodbye julia goodbye hester goodbye winifred  without more ceremonious adieux he marched out  once again in his cab his anger evaporated for so it ever was with his wrathwhen he had rapped out it was gone sadness came over his spirit he had stopped their mouths maybe but at what a cost at the cost of certain knowledge that the rumour he had been resolved not to believe was true june was abandoned and for the wife of that fellows son he felt it was true and hardened himself to treat it as if it were not but the pain he hid beneath this resolution began slowly surely to vent itself in a blind resentment against james and his son  the six women and one man left behind in the little drawingroom began talking as easily as might be after such an occurrence for though each one of them knew for a fact that he or she never talked scandal each one of them also knew that the other six did all were therefore angry and at a loss james only was silent disturbed to the bottom of his soul  presently francie said do you know i think uncle jolyon is terribly changed this last year what do you think aunt hester  aunt hester made a little movement of recoil oh ask your aunt julia she said i know nothing about it  no one else was afraid of assenting and james muttered gloomily at the floor hes not half the man he was  ive noticed it a long time went on francie hes aged tremendously  aunt juley shook her head her face seemed suddenly to have become one immense pout  poor dear jolyon she said somebody ought to see to it for him  there was again silence then as though in terror of being left solitarily behind all five visitors rose simultaneously and took their departure  mrs small aunt hester and their cat were left once more alone the sound of a door closing in the distance announced the approach of timothy  that evening when aunt hester had just got off to sleep in the back bedroom that used to be aunt juleys before aunt juley took aunt anns her door was opened and mrs small in a pink nightcap a candle in her hand entered hester she said hester  aunt hester faintly rustled the sheet  hester repeated aunt juley to make quite sure that she had awakened her i am quite troubled about poor dear jolyon what aunt juley dwelt on the word do you think ought to be done  aunt hester again rustled the sheet her voice was heard faintly pleading done how should i know  aunt juley turned away satisfied and closing the door with extra gentleness so as not to disturb dear hester let it slip through her fingers and fall to with a crack  back in her own room she stood at the window gazing at the moon over the trees in the park through a chink in the muslin curtains close drawn lest anyone should see and there with her face all round and pouting in its pink cap and her eyes wet she thought of dear jolyon so old and so lonely and how she could be of some use to him and how he would come to love her as she had never been loved sincesince poor septimus went away     chapter viiidance at rogers  rogers house in princes gardens was brilliantly alight large numbers of wax candles had been collected and placed in cutglass chandeliers and the parquet floor of the long double drawingroom reflected these constellations an appearance of real spaciousness had been secured by moving out all the furniture on to the upper landings and enclosing the room with those strange appendages of civilization known as rout seats in a remote corner embowered in palms was a cottage piano with a copy of the kensington coil open on the musicstand  roger had objected to a band he didnt see in the least what they wanted with a band he wouldnt go to the expense and there was an end of it francie her mother whom roger had long since reduced to chronic dyspepsia went to bed on such occasions had been obliged to content herself with supplementing the piano by a young man who played the cornet and she so arranged with palms that anyone who did not look into the heart of things might imagine there were several musicians secreted there she made up her mind to tell them to play loudthere was a lot of music in a cornet if the man would only put his soul into it  in the more cultivated american tongue she was through at lastthrough that tortuous labyrinth of makeshifts which must be traversed before fashionable display can be combined with the sound economy of a forsyte thin but brilliant in her maizecoloured frock with much tulle about the shoulders she went from place to place fitting on her gloves and casting her eye over it all  to the hired butler for roger only kept maids she spoke about the wine did he quite understand that mr forsyte wished a dozen bottles of the champagne from whiteleys to be put out but if that were finished she did not suppose it would be most of the ladies would drink water no doubt but if it were there was the champagne cup and he must do the best he could with that  she hated having to say this sort of thing to a butler it was so infra dig but what could you do with father roger indeed after making himself consistently disagreeable about the dance would come down presently with his fresh colour and bumpy forehead as though he had been its promoter and he would smile and probably take the prettiest woman in to supper and at two oclock just as they were getting into the swing he would go up secretly to the musicians and tell them to play god save the queen and go away  francie devoutly hoped he might soon get tired and slip off to bed  the three or four devoted girl friends who were staying in the house for this dance had partaken with her in a small abandoned room upstairs of tea and cold chickenlegs hurriedly served the men had been sent out to dine at eustaces club it being felt that they must be fed up  punctually on the stroke of nine arrived mrs small alone she made elaborate apologies for the absence of timothy omitting all mention of aunt hester who at the last minute had said she could not be bothered francie received her effusively and placed her on a rout seat where she left her pouting and solitary in lavendercoloured satinthe first time she had worn colour since aunt anns death  the devoted maiden friends came now from their rooms each by magic arrangement in a differently coloured frock but all with the same liberal allowance of tulle on the shoulders and at the bosomfor they were by some fatality lean to a girl they were all taken up to mrs small none stayed with her more than a few seconds but clustering together talked and twisted their programmes looking secretly at the door for the first appearance of a man  then arrived in a group a number of nicholases always punctualthe fashion up ladbroke grove way and close behind them eustace and his men gloomy and smelling rather of smoke  three or four of francies lovers now appeared one after the other she had made each promise to come early they were all cleanshaven and sprightly with that peculiar kind of youngman sprightliness which had recently invaded kensington they did not seem to mind each others presence in the least and wore their ties bunching out at the ends white waistcoats and socks with clocks all had handkerchiefs concealed in their cuffs they moved buoyantly each armoured in professional gaiety as though he had come to do great deeds their faces when they danced far from wearing the traditional solemn look of the dancing englishman were irresponsible charming suave they bounded twirling their partners at great pace without pedantic attention to the rhythm of the music  at other dancers they looked with a kind of airy scornthey the light brigade the heroes of a hundred kensington hopsfrom whom alone could the right manner and smile and step be hoped  after this the stream came fast chaperones silting up along the wall facing the entrance the volatile element swelling the eddy in the larger room  men were scarce and wallflowers wore their peculiar pathetic expression a patient sourish smile which seemed to say oh no dont mistake me i know you are not coming up to me i can hardly expect that and francie would plead with one of her lovers or with some callow youth now to please me do let me introduce you to miss pink such a nice girl really and she would bring him up and say miss pinkmr gathercole can you spare him a dance then miss pink smiling her forced smile colouring a little answered oh i think so and screening her empty card wrote on it the name of gathercole spelling it passionately in the district that he proposed about the second extra  but when the youth had murmured that it was hot and passed she relapsed into her attitude of hopeless expectation into her patient sourish smile  mothers slowly fanning their faces watched their daughters and in their eyes could be read all the story of those daughters fortunes as for themselves to sit hour after hour dead tired silent or talking spasmodicallywhat did it matter so long as the girls were having a good time but to see them neglected and passed by ah they smiled but their eyes stabbed like the eyes of an offended swan they longed to pluck young gathercole by the slack of his dandified breeches and drag him to their daughtersthe jackanapes  and all the cruelties and hardness of life its pathos and unequal chances its conceit selfforgetfulness and patience were presented on the battlefield of this kensington ballroom  here and there too loversnot lovers like francies a peculiar breed but simply loverstrembling blushing silent sought each other by flying glances sought to meet and touch in the mazes of the dance and now and again dancing together struck some beholder by the light in their eyes  not a second before ten oclock came the jamesesemily rachel winifred dartie had been left behind having on a former occasion drunk too much of rogers champagne and cicely the youngest making her debut behind them following in a hansom from the paternal mansion where they had dined soames and irene  all these ladies had shoulderstraps and no tullethus showing at once by a bolder exposure of flesh that they came from the more fashionable side of the park  soames sidling back from the contact of the dancers took up a position against the wall guarding himself with his pale smile he stood watching waltz after waltz began and ended couple after couple brushed by with smiling lips laughter and snatches of talk or with set lips and eyes searching the throng or again with silent parted lips and eyes on each other and the scent of festivity the odour of flowers and hair of essences that women love rose suffocatingly in the heat of the summer night  silent with something of scorn in his smile soames seemed to notice nothing but now and again his eyes finding that which they sought would fix themselves on a point in the shifting throng and the smile die off his lips  he danced with no one some fellows danced with their wives his sense of form had never permitted him to dance with irene since their marriage and the god of the forsytes alone can tell whether this was a relief to him or not  she passed dancing with other men her dress iriscoloured floating away from her feet she danced well he was tired of hearing women say with an acid smile how beautifully your wife dances mr forsyteits quite a pleasure to watch her tired of answering them with his sidelong glance you think so  a young couple close by flirted a fan by turns making an unpleasant draught francie and one of her lovers stood near they were talking of love  he heard rogers voice behind giving an order about supper to a servant everything was very secondclass he wished that he had not come he had asked irene whether she wanted him she had answered with that maddening smile of hers oh no  why had he come for the last quarter of an hour he had not even seen her here was george advancing with his quilpish face it was too late to get out of his way  have you seen the buccaneer said this licensed wag hes on the warpathhair cut and everything  soames said he had not and crossing the room halfempty in an interval of the dance he went out on the balcony and looked down into the street  a carriage had driven up with late arrivals and round the door hung some of those patient watchers of the london streets who spring up to the call of light or music their faces pale and upturned above their black and rusty figures had an air of stolid watching that annoyed soames why were they allowed to hang about why didnt the bobby move them on  but the policeman took no notice of them his feet were planted apart on the strip of crimson carpet stretched across the pavement his face under the helmet wore the same stolid watching look as theirs  across the road through the railings soames could see the branches of trees shining faintly stirring in the breeze by the gleam of the street lamps beyond again the upper lights of the houses on the other side so many eyes looking down on the quiet blackness of the garden and over all the sky that wonderful london sky dusted with the innumerable reflection of countless lamps a dome woven over between its stars with the refraction of human needs and human fanciesimmense mirror of pomp and misery that night after night stretches its kindly mocking over miles of houses and gardens mansions and squalor over forsytes policemen and patient watchers in the streets  soames turned away and hidden in the recess gazed into the lighted room it was cooler out there he saw the new arrivals june and her grandfather enter what had made them so late they stood by the doorway they looked fagged fancy uncle jolyon turning out at this time of night why hadnt june come to irene as she usually did and it occurred to him suddenly that he had seen nothing of june for a long time now  watching her face with idle malice he saw it change grow so pale that he thought she would drop then flame out crimson turning to see at what she was looking he saw his wife on bosinneys arm coming from the conservatory at the end of the room her eyes were raised to his as though answering some question he had asked and he was gazing at her intently  soames looked again at june her hand rested on old jolyons arm she seemed to be making a request he saw a surprised look on his uncles face they turned and passed through the door out of his sight  the music began againa waltzand still as a statue in the recess of the window his face unmoved but no smile on his lips soames waited presently within a yard of the dark balcony his wife and bosinney passed he caught the perfume of the gardenias that she wore saw the rise and fall of her bosom the languor in her eyes her parted lips and a look on her face that he did not know to the slow swinging measure they danced by and it seemed to him that they clung to each other he saw her raise her eyes soft and dark to bosinneys and drop them again  very white he turned back to the balcony and leaning on it gazed down on the square the figures were still there looking up at the light with dull persistency the policemans face too upturned and staring but he saw nothing of them below a carriage drew up two figures got in and drove away  that evening june and old jolyon sat down to dinner at the usual hour the girl was in her customary highnecked frock old jolyon had not dressed  at breakfast she had spoken of the dance at uncle rogers she wanted to go she had been stupid enough she said not to think of asking anyone to take her it was too late now  old jolyon lifted his keen eyes june was used to go to dances with irene as a matter of course and deliberately fixing his gaze on her he asked why dont you get irene  no june did not want to ask irene she would only go ifif her grandfather wouldnt mind just for once for a little time  at her look so eager and so worn old jolyon had grumblingly consented he did not know what she wanted he said with going to a dance like this a poor affair he would wager and she no more fit for it than a cat what she wanted was sea air and after his general meeting of the globular gold concessions he was ready to take her she didnt want to go away ah she would knock herself up stealing a mournful look at her he went on with his breakfast  june went out early and wandered restlessly about in the heat her little light figure that lately had moved so languidly about its business was all on fire she bought herself some flowers she wantedshe meant to look her best he would be there she knew well enough that he had a card she would show him that she did not care but deep down in her heart she resolved that evening to win him back she came in flushed and talked brightly all lunch old jolyon was there and he was deceived  in the afternoon she was overtaken by a desperate fit of sobbing she strangled the noise against the pillows of her bed but when at last it ceased she saw in the glass a swollen face with reddened eyes and violet circles round them she stayed in the darkened room till dinner time  all through that silent meal the struggle went on within her  she looked so shadowy and exhausted that old jolyon told sankey to countermand the carriage he would not have her going out she was to go to bed she made no resistance she went up to her room and sat in the dark at ten oclock she rang for her maid  bring some hot water and go down and tell mr forsyte that i feel perfectly rested say that if hes too tired i can go to the dance by myself  the maid looked askance and june turned on her imperiously go she said bring the hot water at once  her balldress still lay on the sofa and with a sort of fierce care she arrayed herself took the flowers in her hand and went down her small face carried high under its burden of hair she could hear old jolyon in his room as she passed  bewildered and vexed he was dressing it was past ten they would not get there till eleven the girl was mad but he dared not cross herthe expression of her face at dinner haunted him  with great ebony brushes he smoothed his hair till it shone like silver under the light then he too came out on the gloomy staircase  june met him below and without a word they went to the carriage  when after that drive which seemed to last for ever she entered rogers drawingroom she disguised under a mask of resolution a very torment of nervousness and emotion the feeling of shame at what might be called running after him was smothered by the dread that he might not be there that she might not see him after all and by that dogged resolvesomehow she did not know howto win him back  the sight of the ballroom with its gleaming floor gave her a feeling of joy of triumph for she loved dancing and when dancing she floated so light was she like a strenuous eager little spirit he would surely ask her to dance and if he danced with her it would all be as it was before she looked about her eagerly  the sight of bosinney coming with irene from the conservatory with that strange look of utter absorption on his face struck her too suddenly they had not seenno one should seeher distress not even her grandfather  she put her hand on jolyons arm and said very low  i must go home gran i feel ill  he hurried her away grumbling to himself that he had known how it would be  to her he said nothing only when they were once more in the carriage which by some fortunate chance had lingered near the door he asked her what is it my darling  feeling her whole slender body shaken by sobs he was terribly alarmed she must have blank tomorrow he would insist upon it he could not have her like this there there  june mastered her sobs and squeezing his hand feverishly she lay back in her corner her face muffled in a shawl  he could only see her eyes fixed and staring in the dark but he did not cease to stroke her hand with his thin fingers     chapter ixevening at richmond  other eyes besides the eyes of june and of soames had seen those two as euphemia had already begun to call them coming from the conservatory other eyes had noticed the look on bosinneys face  there are moments when nature reveals the passion hidden beneath the careless calm of her ordinary moodsviolent spring flashing white on almondblossom through the purple clouds a snowy moonlit peak with its single star soaring up to the passionate blue or against the flames of sunset an old yewtree standing dark guardian of some fiery secret  there are moments too when in a picturegallery a work noted by the casual spectator as titianremarkably fine breaks through the defences of some forsyte better lunched perhaps than his fellows and holds him spellbound in a kind of ecstasy there are things he feelsthere are things here whichwell which are things something unreasoning unreasonable is upon him when he tries to define it with the precision of a practical man it eludes him slips away as the glow of the wine he has drunk is slipping away leaving him cross and conscious of his liver he feels that he has been extravagant prodigal of something virtue has gone out of him he did not desire this glimpse of what lay under the three stars of his catalogue god forbid that he should know anything about the forces of nature god forbid that he should admit for a moment that there are such things once admit that and where was he one paid a shilling for entrance and another for the programme  the look which june had seen which other forsytes had seen was like the sudden flashing of a candle through a hole in some imaginary canvas behind which it was being movedthe sudden flamingout of a vague erratic glow shadowy and enticing it brought home to onlookers the consciousness that dangerous forces were at work for a moment they noticed it with pleasure with interest then felt they must not notice it at all  it supplied however the reason of junes coming so late and disappearing again without dancing without even shaking hands with her lover she was ill it was said and no wonder  but here they looked at each other guiltily they had no desire to spread scandal no desire to be illnatured who would have and to outsiders no word was breathed unwritten law keeping them silent  then came the news that june had gone to the seaside with old jolyon  he had carried her off to broadstairs for which place there was just then a feeling yarmouth having lost caste in spite of nicholas and no forsyte going to the sea without intending to have an air for his money such as would render him bilious in a week that fatally aristocratic tendency of the first forsyte to drink madeira had left his descendants undoubtedly accessible  so june went to the sea the family awaited developments there was nothing else to do  but how farhow far had those two gone how far were they going to go could they really be going at all nothing could surely come of it for neither of them had any money at the most a flirtation ending as all such attachments should at the proper time  soames sister winifred dartie who had imbibed with the breezes of mayfairshe lived in green streetmore fashionable principles in regard to matrimonial behaviour than were current for instance in ladbroke grove laughed at the idea of there being anything in it the little thingirene was taller than herself and it was real testimony to the solid worth of a forsyte that she should always thus be a little thingthe little thing was bored why shouldnt she amuse herself soames was rather tiring and as to mr bosinneyonly that buffoon george would have called him the buccaneershe maintained that he was very chic  this dictumthat bosinney was chiccaused quite a sensation it failed to convince that he was goodlooking in a way they were prepared to admit but that anyone could call a man with his pronounced cheekbones curious eyes and soft felt hats chic was only another instance of winifreds extravagant way of running after something new  it was that famous summer when extravagance was fashionable when the very earth was extravagant chestnuttrees spread with blossom and flowers drenched in perfume as they had never been before when roses blew in every garden and for the swarming stars the nights had hardly space when every day and all day long the sun in full armour swung his brazen shield above the park and people did strange things lunching and dining in the open air unprecedented was the tale of cabs and carriages that streamed across the bridges of the shining river bearing the uppermiddle class in thousands to the green glories of bushey richmond kew and hampton court almost every family with any pretensions to be of the carriageclass paid one visit that year to the horsechestnuts at bushey or took one drive amongst the spanish chestnuts of richmond park bowling smoothly if dustily along in a cloud of their own creation they would stare fashionably at the antlered heads which the great slow deer raised out of a forest of bracken that promised to autumn lovers such cover as was never seen before and now and again as the amorous perfume of chestnut flowers and of fern was drifted too near one would say to the other my dear what a peculiar scent  and the limeflowers that year were of rare prime near honeycoloured at the corners of london squares they gave out as the sun went down a perfume sweeter than the honey bees had takena perfume that stirred a yearning unnamable in the hearts of forsytes and their peers taking the cool after dinner in the precincts of those gardens to which they alone had keys  and that yearning made them linger amidst the dim shapes of flowerbeds in the failing daylight made them turn and turn and turn again as though lovers were waiting for themwaiting for the last light to die away under the shadow of the branches  some vague sympathy evoked by the scent of the limes some sisterly desire to see for herself some idea of demonstrating the soundness of her dictum that there was nothing in it or merely the craving to drive down to richmond irresistible that summer moved the mother of the little darties of little publius of imogen maud and benedict to write the following note to her sisterinlaw   dear irene june 30  i hear that soames is going to henley tomorrow for the night i thought it would be great fun if we made up a little party and drove down to richmond will you ask mr bosinney and i will get young flippard  emily they called their mother emilyit was so chic will lend us the carriage i will call for you and your young man at seven oclock  your affectionate sister  winifred dartie  montague believes the dinner at the crown and sceptre to be quite eatable   montague was darties second and better known namehis first being moses for he was nothing if not a man of the world  her plan met with more opposition from providence than so benevolent a scheme deserved in the first place young flippard wrote   dear mrs dartie  awfully sorry engaged two deep  yours  augustus flippard   it was late to send into the byways and hedges to remedy this misfortune with the promptitude and conduct of a mother winifred fell back on her husband she had indeed the decided but tolerant temperament that goes with a good deal of profile fair hair and greenish eyes she was seldom or never at a loss or if at a loss was always able to convert it into a gain  dartie too was in good feather erotic had failed to win the lancashire cup indeed that celebrated animal owned as he was by a pillar of the turf who had secretly laid many thousands against him had not even started the fortyeight hours that followed his scratching were among the darkest in darties life  visions of james haunted him day and night black thoughts about soames mingled with the faintest hopes on the friday night he got drunk so greatly was he affected but on saturday morning the true stock exchange instinct triumphed within him owing some hundreds which by no possibility could he pay he went into town and put them all on concertina for the saltown borough handicap  as he said to major scrotton with whom he lunched at the iseeum that little jew boy nathans had given him the tip he didnt care a cursh he wash ina mucker if it didnt come upwell then damme the old man would have to pay  a bottle of pol roger to his own cheek had given him a new contempt for james  it came up concertina was squeezed home by her necka terrible squeak but as dartie said there was nothing like pluck  he was by no means averse to the expedition to richmond he would stand it himself he cherished an admiration for irene and wished to be on more playful terms with her  at halfpast five the park lane footman came round to say mrs forsyte was very sorry but one of the horses was coughing  undaunted by this further blow winifred at once despatched little publius now aged seven with the nursery governess to montpellier square  they would go down in hansoms and meet at the crown and sceptre at 745  dartie on being told was pleased enough it was better than going down with your back to the horses he had no objection to driving down with irene he supposed they would pick up the others at montpellier square and swop hansoms there  informed that the meet was at the crown and sceptre and that he would have to drive with his wife he turned sulky and said it was dd slow  at seven oclock they started dartie offering to bet the driver halfacrown he didnt do it in the threequarters of an hour  twice only did husband and wife exchange remarks on the way  dartie said itll put master soamess nose out of joint to hear his wifes been drivin in a hansom with master bosinney  winifred replied dont talk such nonsense monty  nonsense repeated dartie you dont know women my fine lady  on the other occasion he merely asked how am i looking a bit puffy about the gills that fizz old george is so fond of is a windy wine  he had been lunching with george forsyte at the haversnake  bosinney and irene had arrived before them they were standing in one of the long french windows overlooking the river  windows that summer were open all day long and all night too and day and night the scents of flowers and trees came in the hot scent of parching grass and the cool scent of the heavy dews  to the eye of the observant dartie his two guests did not appear to be making much running standing there close together without a word bosinney was a hungrylooking creaturenot much go about him  he left them to winifred however and busied himself to order the dinner  a forsyte will require good if not delicate feeding but a dartie will tax the resources of a crown and sceptre living as he does from hand to mouth nothing is too good for him to eat and he will eat it his drink too will need to be carefully provided there is much drink in this country not good enough for a dartie he will have the best paying for things vicariously there is no reason why he should stint himself to stint yourself is the mark of a fool not of a dartie  the best of everything no sounder principle on which a man can base his life whose fatherinlaw has a very considerable income and a partiality for his grandchildren  with his not unable eye dartie had spotted this weakness in james the very first year after little publiuss arrival an error he had profited by his perspicacity four little darties were now a sort of perpetual insurance  the feature of the feast was unquestionably the red mullet this delectable fish brought from a considerable distance in a state of almost perfect preservation was first fried then boned then served in ice with madeira punch in place of sauce according to a recipe known to a few men of the world  nothing else calls for remark except the payment of the bill by dartie  he had made himself extremely agreeable throughout the meal his bold admiring stare seldom abandoning irenes face and figure as he was obliged to confess to himself he got no change out of hershe was cool enough as cool as her shoulders looked under their veil of creamy lace he expected to have caught her out in some little game with bosinney but not a bit of it she kept up her end remarkably well as for that architect chap he was as glum as a bear with a sore headwinifred could barely get a word out of him he ate nothing but he certainly took his liquor and his face kept getting whiter and his eyes looked queer  it was all very amusing  for dartie himself was in capital form and talked freely with a certain poignancy being no fool he told two or three stories verging on the improper a concession to the company for his stories were not used to verging he proposed irenes health in a mock speech nobody drank it and winifred said dont be such a clown monty  at her suggestion they went after dinner to the public terrace overlooking the river  i should like to see the common people making love she said its such fun  there were numbers of them walking in the cool after the days heat and the air was alive with the sound of voices coarse and loud or soft as though murmuring secrets  it was not long before winifreds better senseshe was the only forsyte presentsecured them an empty bench they sat down in a row a heavy tree spread a thick canopy above their heads and the haze darkened slowly over the river  dartie sat at the end next to him irene then bosinney then winifred there was hardly room for four and the man of the world could feel irenes arm crushed against his own he knew that she could not withdraw it without seeming rude and this amused him he devised every now and again a movement that would bring her closer still he thought that buccaneer johnny shant have it all to himself its a pretty tight fit certainly  from far down below on the dark river came drifting the tinkle of a mandoline and voices singing the old round  a boat a boat unto the ferry for well go over and be merry and laugh and quaff and drink brown sherry  and suddenly the moon appeared young and tender floating up on her back from behind a tree and as though she had breathed the air was cooler but down that cooler air came always the warm odour of the limes  over his cigar dartie peered round at bosinney who was sitting with his arms crossed staring straight in front of him and on his face the look of a man being tortured  and dartie shot a glance at the face between so veiled by the overhanging shadow that it was but like a darker piece of the darkness shaped and breathed on soft mysterious enticing  a hush had fallen on the noisy terrace as if all the strollers were thinking secrets too precious to be spoken  and dartie thought women  the glow died above the river the singing ceased the young moon hid behind a tree and all was dark he pressed himself against irene  he was not alarmed at the shuddering that ran through the limbs he touched or at the troubled scornful look of her eyes he felt her trying to draw herself away and smiled  it must be confessed that the man of the world had drunk quite as much as was good for him  with thick lips parted under his wellcurled moustaches and his bold eyes aslant upon her he had the malicious look of a satyr  along the pathway of sky between the hedges of the tree tops the stars clustered forth like mortals beneath they seemed to shift and swarm and whisper then on the terrace the buzz broke out once more and dartie thought ah hes a poor hungrylooking devil that bosinney and again he pressed himself against irene  the movement deserved a better success she rose and they all followed her  the man of the world was more than ever determined to see what she was made of along the terrace he kept close at her elbow he had within him much good wine there was the long drive home the long drive and the warm dark and the pleasant closeness of the hansom cabwith its insulation from the world devised by some great and good man that hungry architect chap might drive with his wifehe wished him joy of her and conscious that his voice was not too steady he was careful not to speak but a smile had become fixed on his thick lips  they strolled along toward the cabs awaiting them at the farther end his plan had the merit of all great plans an almost brutal simplicityhe would merely keep at her elbow till she got in and get in quickly after her  but when irene reached the cab she did not get in she slipped instead to the horses head dartie was not at the moment sufficiently master of his legs to follow she stood stroking the horses nose and to his annoyance bosinney was at her side first she turned and spoke to him rapidly in a low voice the words that man reached dartie he stood stubbornly by the cab step waiting for her to come back he knew a trick worth two of that  here in the lamplight his figure no more than medium height well squared in its white evening waistcoat his light overcoat flung over his arm a pink flower in his buttonhole and on his dark face that look of confident goodhumoured insolence he was at his besta thorough man of the world  winifred was already in her cab dartie reflected that bosinney would have a poorish time in that cab if he didnt look sharp suddenly he received a push which nearly overturned him in the road bosinneys voice hissed in his ear i am taking irene back do you understand he saw a face white with passion and eyes that glared at him like a wild cats  eh he stammered what not a bit you take my wife  get away hissed bosinneyor ill throw you into the road  dartie recoiled he saw as plainly as possible that the fellow meant it in the space he made irene had slipped by her dress brushed his legs bosinney stepped in after her  go on he heard the buccaneer cry the cabman flicked his horse it sprang forward  dartie stood for a moment dumbfounded then dashing at the cab where his wife sat he scrambled in  drive on he shouted to the driver and dont you lose sight of that fellow in front  seated by his wifes side he burst into imprecations calming himself at last with a supreme effort he added a pretty mess youve made of it to let the buccaneer drive home with her why on earth couldnt you keep hold of him hes mad with love any fool can see that  he drowned winifreds rejoinder with fresh calls to the almighty nor was it until they reached barnes that he ceased a jeremiad in the course of which he had abused her her father her brother irene bosinney the name of forsyte his own children and cursed the day when he had ever married  winifred a woman of strong character let him have his say at the end of which he lapsed into sulky silence his angry eyes never deserted the back of that cab which like a lost chance haunted the darkness in front of him  fortunately he could not hear bosinneys passionate pleadingthat pleading which the man of the worlds conduct had let loose like a flood he could not see irene shivering as though some garment had been torn from her nor her eyes black and mournful like the eyes of a beaten child he could not hear bosinney entreating entreating always entreating could not hear her sudden soft weeping nor see that poor hungrylooking devil awed and trembling humbly touching her hand  in montpellier square their cabman following his instructions to the letter faithfully drew up behind the cab in front the darties saw bosinney spring out and irene follow and hasten up the steps with bent head she evidently had her key in her hand for she disappeared at once it was impossible to tell whether she had turned to speak to bosinney  the latter came walking past their cab both husband and wife had an admirable view of his face in the light of a street lamp it was working with violent emotion  goodnight mr bosinney called winifred  bosinney started clawed off his hat and hurried on he had obviously forgotten their existence  there said dartie did you see the beasts face what did i say fine games he improved the occasion  there had so clearly been a crisis in the cab that winifred was unable to defend her theory  she said i shall say nothing about it i dont see any use in making a fuss  with that view dartie at once concurred looking upon james as a private preserve he disapproved of his being disturbed by the troubles of others  quite right he said let soames look after himself hes jolly well able to  thus speaking the darties entered their habitat in green street the rent of which was paid by james and sought a wellearned rest the hour was midnight and no forsytes remained abroad in the streets to spy out bosinneys wanderings to see him return and stand against the rails of the square garden back from the glow of the street lamp to see him stand there in the shadow of trees watching the house where in the dark was hidden she whom he would have given the world to see for a single minuteshe who was now to him the breath of the limetrees the meaning of the light and the darkness the very beating of his own heart     chapter xdiagnosis of a forsyte  it is in the nature of a forsyte to be ignorant that he is a forsyte but young jolyon was well aware of being one he had not known it till after the decisive step which had made him an outcast since then the knowledge had been with him continually he felt it throughout his alliance throughout all his dealings with his second wife who was emphatically not a forsyte  he knew that if he had not possessed in great measure the eye for what he wanted the tenacity to hold on to it the sense of the folly of wasting that for which he had given so big a pricein other words the sense of property he could never have retained her perhaps never would have desired to retain her with him through all the financial troubles slights and misconstructions of those fifteen years never have induced her to marry him on the death of his first wife never have lived it all through and come up as it were thin but smiling  he was one of those men who seated crosslegged like miniature chinese idols in the cages of their own hearts are ever smiling at themselves a doubting smile not that this smile so intimate and eternal interfered with his actions which like his chin and his temperament were quite a peculiar blend of softness and determination  he was conscious too of being a forsyte in his work that painting of watercolours to which he devoted so much energy always with an eye on himself as though he could not take so unpractical a pursuit quite seriously and always with a certain queer uneasiness that he did not make more money at it  it was then this consciousness of what it meant to be a forsyte that made him receive the following letter from old jolyon with a mixture of sympathy and disgust   sheldrake house  broadstairs  july 1 my dear jo  the dads handwriting had altered very little in the thirty odd years that he remembered it  we have been here now a fortnight and have had good weather on the whole the air is bracing but my liver is out of order and i shall be glad enough to get back to town i cannot say much for june her health and spirits are very indifferent and i dont see what is to come of it she says nothing but it is clear that she is harping on this engagement which is an engagement and no engagement andgoodness knows what i have grave doubts whether she ought to be allowed to return to london in the present state of affairs but she is so selfwilled that she might take it into her head to come up at any moment the fact is someone ought to speak to bosinney and ascertain what he means im afraid of this myself for i should certainly rap him over the knuckles but i thought that you knowing him at the club might put in a word and get to ascertain what the fellow is about you will of course in no way commit june i shall be glad to hear from you in the course of a few days whether you have succeeded in gaining any information the situation is very distressing to me i worry about it at night  with my love to jolly and holly  i am  your affect father  jolyon forsyte   young jolyon pondered this letter so long and seriously that his wife noticed his preoccupation and asked him what was the matter he replied nothing  it was a fixed principle with him never to allude to june she might take alarm he did not know what she might think he hastened therefore to banish from his manner all traces of absorption but in this he was about as successful as his father would have been for he had inherited all old jolyons transparency in matters of domestic finesse and young mrs jolyon busying herself over the affairs of the house went about with tightened lips stealing at him unfathomable looks  he started for the club in the afternoon with the letter in his pocket and without having made up his mind  to sound a man as to his intentions was peculiarly unpleasant to him nor did his own anomalous position diminish this unpleasantness it was so like his family so like all the people they knew and mixed with to enforce what they called their rights over a man to bring him up to the mark so like them to carry their business principles into their private relations  and how that phrase in the letteryou will of course in no way commit junegave the whole thing away  yet the letter with the personal grievance the concern for june the rap over the knuckles was all so natural no wonder his father wanted to know what bosinney meant no wonder he was angry  it was difficult to refuse but why give the thing to him to do that was surely quite unbecoming but so long as a forsyte got what he was after he was not too particular about the means provided appearances were saved  how should he set about it or how refuse both seemed impossible so young jolyon  he arrived at the club at three oclock and the first person he saw was bosinney himself seated in a corner staring out of the window  young jolyon sat down not far off and began nervously to reconsider his position he looked covertly at bosinney sitting there unconscious he did not know him very well and studied him attentively for perhaps the first time an unusual looking man unlike in dress face and manner to most of the other members of the clubyoung jolyon himself however different he had become in mood and temper had always retained the neat reticence of forsyte appearance he alone among forsytes was ignorant of bosinneys nickname the man was unusual not eccentric but unusual he looked worn too haggard hollow in the cheeks beneath those broad high cheekbones though without any appearance of illhealth for he was strongly built with curly hair that seemed to show all the vitality of a fine constitution  something in his face and attitude touched young jolyon he knew what suffering was like and this man looked as if he were suffering  he got up and touched his arm  bosinney started but exhibited no sign of embarrassment on seeing who it was  young jolyon sat down  i havent seen you for a long time he said how are you getting on with my cousins house  itll be finished in about a week  i congratulate you  thanksi dont know that its much of a subject for congratulation  no queried young jolyon i should have thought youd be glad to get a long job like that off your hands but i suppose you feel it much as i do when i part with a picturea sort of child  he looked kindly at bosinney  yes said the latter more cordially it goes out from you and theres an end of it i didnt know you painted  only watercolours i cant say i believe in my work  dont believe in it therehow can you do it works no use unless you believe in it  good said young jolyon its exactly what ive always said bythebye have you noticed that whenever one says good one always adds its exactly what ive always said but if you ask me how i do it i answer because im a forsyte  a forsyte i never thought of you as one  a forsyte replied young jolyon is not an uncommon animal there are hundreds among the members of this club hundreds out there in the streets you meet them wherever you go  and how do you tell them may i ask said bosinney  by their sense of property a forsyte takes a practicalone might say a commonsenseview of things and a practical view of things is based fundamentally on a sense of property a forsyte you will notice never gives himself away  joking  young jolyons eye twinkled  not much as a forsyte myself i have no business to talk but im a kind of thoroughbred mongrel now theres no mistaking you youre as different from me as i am from my uncle james who is the perfect specimen of a forsyte his sense of property is extreme while you have practically none without me in between you would seem like a different species im the missing link we are of course all of us the slaves of property and i admit that its a question of degree but what i call a forsyte is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property he knows a good thing he knows a safe thing and his grip on propertyit doesnt matter whether it be wives houses money or reputationis his hallmark  ah murmured bosinney you should patent the word  i should like said young jolyon to lecture on it  properties and quality of a forsyte this little animal disturbed by the ridicule of his own sort is unaffected in his motions by the laughter of strange creatures you or i hereditarily disposed to myopia he recognises only the persons of his own species amongst which he passes an existence of competitive tranquillity  you talk of them said bosinney as if they were half england  they are repeated young jolyon half england and the better half too the safe half the three per cent half the half that counts its their wealth and security that makes everything possible makes your art possible makes literature science even religion possible without forsytes who believe in none of these things and habitats but turn them all to use where should we be my dear sir the forsytes are the middlemen the commercials the pillars of society the cornerstones of convention everything that is admirable  i dont know whether i catch your drift said bosinney but i fancy there are plenty of forsytes as you call them in my profession  certainly replied young jolyon the great majority of architects painters or writers have no principles like any other forsytes art literature religion survive by virtue of the few cranks who really believe in such things and the many forsytes who make a commercial use of them at a low estimate threefourths of our royal academicians are forsytes seveneighths of our novelists a large proportion of the press of science i cant speak they are magnificently represented in religion in the house of commons perhaps more numerous than anywhere the aristocracy speaks for itself but im not laughing it is dangerous to go against the majority and what a majority he fixed his eyes on bosinney its dangerous to let anything carry you awaya house a picture awoman  they looked at each otherand as though he had done that which no forsyte didgiven himself away young jolyon drew into his shell bosinney broke the silence  why do you take your own people as the type said he  my people replied young jolyon are not very extreme and they have their own private peculiarities like every other family but they possess in a remarkable degree those two qualities which are the real tests of a forsytethe power of never being able to give yourself up to anything soul and body and the sense of property  bosinney smiled how about the big one for instance  do you mean swithin asked young jolyon ah in swithin theres something primeval still the town and middleclass life havent digested him yet all the old centuries of farm work and brute force have settled in him and there theyve stuck for all hes so distinguished  bosinney seemed to ponder well youve hit your cousin soames off to the life he said suddenly hell never blow his brains out  young jolyon shot at him a penetrating glance  no he said he wont thats why hes to be reckoned with look out for their grip its easy to laugh but dont mistake me it doesnt do to despise a forsyte it doesnt do to disregard them  yet youve done it yourself  young jolyon acknowledged the hit by losing his smile  you forget he said with a queer pride i can hold on tooim a forsyte myself were all in the path of great forces the man who leaves the shelter of the wallwellyou know what i mean i dont he ended very low as though uttering a threat recommend every man togomyway it depends  the colour rushed into bosinneys face but soon receded leaving it sallowbrown as before he gave a short laugh that left his lips fixed in a queer fierce smile his eyes mocked young jolyon  thanks he said its deuced kind of you but youre not the only chaps that can hold on he rose  young jolyon looked after him as he walked away and resting his head on his hand sighed  in the drowsy almost empty room the only sounds were the rustle of newspapers the scraping of matches being struck he stayed a long time without moving living over again those days when he too had sat long hours watching the clock waiting for the minutes to passlong hours full of the torments of uncertainty and of a fierce sweet aching and the slow delicious agony of that season came back to him with its old poignancy the sight of bosinney with his haggard face and his restless eyes always wandering to the clock had roused in him a pity with which was mingled strange irresistible envy  he knew the signs so well whither was he goingto what sort of fate what kind of woman was it who was drawing him to her by that magnetic force which no consideration of honour no principle no interest could withstand from which the only escape was flight  flight but why should bosinney fly a man fled when he was in danger of destroying hearth and home when there were children when he felt himself trampling down ideals breaking something but here so he had heard it was all broken to his hand  he himself had not fled nor would he fly if it were all to come over again yet he had gone further than bosinney had broken up his own unhappy home not someone elses and the old saying came back to him a mans fate lies in his own heart  in his own heart the proof of the pudding was in the eatingbosinney had still to eat his pudding  his thoughts passed to the woman the woman whom he did not know but the outline of whose story he had heard  an unhappy marriage no illtreatmentonly that indefinable malaise that terrible blight which killed all sweetness under heaven and so from day to day from night to night from week to week from year to year till death should end it  but young jolyon the bitterness of whose own feelings time had assuaged saw soames side of the question too whence should a man like his cousin saturated with all the prejudices and beliefs of his class draw the insight or inspiration necessary to break up this life it was a question of imagination of projecting himself into the future beyond the unpleasant gossip sneers and tattle that followed on such separations beyond the passing pangs that the lack of the sight of her would cause beyond the grave disapproval of the worthy but few men and especially few men of soames class had imagination enough for that a deal of mortals in this world and not enough imagination to go round and sweet heaven what a difference between theory and practice many a man perhaps even soames held chivalrous views on such matters who when the shoe pinched found a distinguishing factor that made of himself an exception  then too he distrusted his judgment he had been through the experience himself had tasted too the dregs the bitterness of an unhappy marriage and how could he take the wide and dispassionate view of those who had never been within sound of the battle his evidence was too firsthandlike the evidence on military matters of a soldier who has been through much active service against that of civilians who have not suffered the disadvantage of seeing things too close most people would consider such a marriage as that of soames and irene quite fairly successful he had money she had beauty it was a case for compromise there was no reason why they should not jog along even if they hated each other it would not matter if they went their own ways a little so long as the decencies were observedthe sanctity of the marriage tie of the common home respected half the marriages of the upper classes were conducted on these lines do not offend the susceptibilities of society do not offend the susceptibilities of the church to avoid offending these is worth the sacrifice of any private feelings the advantages of the stable home are visible tangible so many pieces of property there is no risk in the statu quo to break up a home is at the best a dangerous experiment and selfish into the bargain  this was the case for the defence and young jolyon sighed  the core of it all he thought is property but there are many people who would not like it put that way to them it is the sanctity of the marriage tie but the sanctity of the marriage tie is dependent on the sanctity of the family and the sanctity of the family is dependent on the sanctity of property and yet i imagine all these people are followers of one who never owned anything it is curious  and again young jolyon sighed  am i going on my way home to ask any poor devils i meet to share my dinner which will then be too little for myself or at all events for my wife who is necessary to my health and happiness it may be that after all soames does well to exercise his rights and support by his practice the sacred principle of property which benefits us all with the exception of those who suffer by the process  and so he left his chair threaded his way through the maze of seats took his hat and languidly up the hot streets crowded with carriages reeking with dusty odours wended his way home  before reaching wistaria avenue he removed old jolyons letter from his pocket and tearing it carefully into tiny pieces scattered them in the dust of the road  he let himself in with his key and called his wifes name but she had gone out taking jolly and holly and the house was empty alone in the garden the dog balthasar lay in the shade snapping at flies  young jolyon took his seat there too under the peartree that bore no fruit     chapter xibosinney on parole  the day after the evening at richmond soames returned from henley by a morning train not constitutionally interested in amphibious sports his visit had been one of business rather than pleasure a client of some importance having asked him down  he went straight to the city but finding things slack he left at three oclock glad of this chance to get home quietly irene did not expect him not that he had any desire to spy on her actions but there was no harm in thus unexpectedly surveying the scene  after changing to park clothes he went into the drawingroom she was sitting idly in the corner of the sofa her favourite seat and there were circles under her eyes as though she had not slept  he asked how is it youre in are you expecting somebody  yes that is not particularly  who  mr bosinney said he might come  bosinney he ought to be at work  to this she made no answer  well said soames i want you to come out to the stores with me and after that well go to the park  i dont want to go out i have a headache  soames replied if ever i want you to do anything youve always got a headache itll do you good to come and sit under the trees  she did not answer  soames was silent for some minutes at last he said i dont know what your idea of a wifes duty is i never have known  he had not expected her to reply but she did  i have tried to do what you want its not my fault that i havent been able to put my heart into it  whose fault is it then he watched her askance  before we were married you promised to let me go if our marriage was not a success is it a success  soames frowned  success he stammeredit would be a success if you behaved yourself properly  i have tried said irene will you let me go  soames turned away secretly alarmed he took refuge in bluster  let you go you dont know what youre talking about let you go how can i let you go were married arent we then what are you talking about for gods sake dont lets have any of this sort of nonsense get your hat on and come and sit in the park  then you wont let me go  he felt her eyes resting on him with a strange touching look  let you go he said and what on earth would you do with yourself if i did youve got no money  i could manage somehow  he took a swift turn up and down the room then came and stood before her  understand he said once and for all i wont have you say this sort of thing go and get your hat on  she did not move  i suppose said soames you dont want to miss bosinney if he comes  irene got up slowly and left the room she came down with her hat on  they went out  in the park the motley hour of midafternoon when foreigners and other pathetic folk drive thinking themselves to be in fashion had passed the right the proper hour had come was nearly gone before soames and irene seated themselves under the achilles statue  it was some time since he had enjoyed her company in the park that was one of the past delights of the first two seasons of his married life when to feel himself the possessor of this gracious creature before all london had been his greatest though secret pride how many afternoons had he not sat beside her extremely neat with light grey gloves and faint supercilious smile nodding to acquaintances and now and again removing his hat  his light grey gloves were still on his hands and on his lips his smile sardonic but where the feeling in his heart  the seats were emptying fast but still he kept her there silent and pale as though to work out a secret punishment once or twice he made some comment and she bent her head or answered yes with a tired smile  along the rails a man was walking so fast that people stared after him when he passed  look at that ass said soames he must be mad to walk like that in this heat  he turned irene had made a rapid movement  hallo he said its our friend the buccaneer  and he sat still with his sneering smile conscious that irene was sitting still and smiling too  will she bow to him he thought  but she made no sign  bosinney reached the end of the rails and came walking back amongst the chairs quartering his ground like a pointer when he saw them he stopped dead and raised his hat  the smile never left soames face he also took off his hat  bosinney came up looking exhausted like a man after hard physical exercise the sweat stood in drops on his brow and soames smile seemed to say youve had a trying time my friend what are you doing in the park he asked we thought you despised such frivolity  bosinney did not seem to hear he made his answer to irene ive been round to your place i hoped i should find you in  somebody tapped soames on the back and spoke to him and in the exchange of those platitudes over his shoulder he missed her answer and took a resolution  were just going in he said to bosinney youd better come back to dinner with us into that invitation he put a strange bravado a stranger pathos you cant deceive me his look and voice seemed saying but seei trust youim not afraid of you  they started back to montpellier square together irene between them in the crowded streets soames went on in front he did not listen to their conversation the strange resolution of trustfulness he had taken seemed to animate even his secret conduct like a gambler he said to himself its a card i dare not throw awayi must play it for what its worth i have not too many chances  he dressed slowly heard her leave her room and go downstairs and for full five minutes after dawdled about in his dressingroom then he went down purposely shutting the door loudly to show that he was coming he found them standing by the hearth perhaps talking perhaps not he could not say  he played his part out in the farce the long evening throughhis manner to his guest more friendly than it had ever been before and when at last bosinney went he said you must come again soon irene likes to have you to talk about the house again his voice had the strange bravado and the stranger pathos but his hand was cold as ice  loyal to his resolution he turned away from their parting turned away from his wife as she stood under the hanging lamp to say goodnightaway from the sight of her golden head shining so under the light of her smiling mournful lips away from the sight of bosinneys eyes looking at her so like a dogs looking at its master  and he went to bed with the certainty that bosinney was in love with his wife  the summer night was hot so hot and still that through every opened window came in but hotter air for long hours he lay listening to her breathing  she could sleep but he must lie awake and lying awake he hardened himself to play the part of the serene and trusting husband  in the small hours he slipped out of bed and passing into his dressingroom leaned by the open window  he could hardly breathe  a night four years ago came back to himthe night but one before his marriage as hot and stifling as this  he remembered how he had lain in a long cane chair in the window of his sittingroom off victoria street down below in a side street a man had banged at a door a woman had cried out he remembered as though it were now the sound of the scuffle the slam of the door the dead silence that followed and then the early watercart cleansing the reek of the streets had approached through the strangeseeming useless lamplight he seemed to hear again its rumble nearer and nearer till it passed and slowly died away  he leaned far out of the dressingroom window over the little court below and saw the first light spread the outlines of dark walls and roofs were blurred for a moment then came out sharper than before  he remembered how that other night he had watched the lamps paling all the length of victoria street how he had hurried on his clothes and gone down into the street down past houses and squares to the street where she was staying and there had stood and looked at the front of the little house as still and grey as the face of a dead man  and suddenly it shot through his mind like a sick mans fancy whats he doingthat fellow who haunts me who was here this evening whos in love with my wifeprowling out there perhaps looking for her as i know he was looking for her this afternoon watching my house now for all i can tell  he stole across the landing to the front of the house stealthily drew aside a blind and raised a window  the grey light clung about the trees of the square as though night like a great downy moth had brushed them with her wings the lamps were still alight all pale but not a soul stirredno living thing in sight  yet suddenly very faint far off in the deathly stillness he heard a cry writhing like the voice of some wandering soul barred out of heaven and crying for its happiness there it was againagain soames shut the window shuddering  then he thought ah its only the peacocks across the water     chapter xiijune pays some calls  jolyon stood in the narrow hall at broadstairs inhaling that odour of oilcloth and herrings which permeates all respectable seaside lodginghouses on a chaira shiny leather chair displaying its horsehair through a hole in the top lefthand cornerstood a black despatch case this he was filling with papers with the times and a bottle of eaude cologne he had meetings that day of the globular gold concessions and the new colliery company limited to which he was going up for he never missed a board to miss a board would be one more piece of evidence that he was growing old and this his jealous forsyte spirit could not bear  his eyes as he filled that black despatch case looked as if at any moment they might blaze up with anger so gleams the eye of a schoolboy baited by a ring of his companions but he controls himself deterred by the fearful odds against him and old jolyon controlled himself keeping down with his masterful restraint now slowly wearing out the irritation fostered in him by the conditions of his life  he had received from his son an unpractical letter in which by rambling generalities the boy seemed trying to get out of answering a plain question ive seen bosinney he said he is not a criminal the more i see of people the more i am convinced that they are never good or badmerely comic or pathetic you probably dont agree with me  old jolyon did not he considered it cynical to so express oneself he had not yet reached that point of old age when even forsytes bereft of those illusions and principles which they have cherished carefully for practical purposes but never believed in bereft of all corporeal enjoyment stricken to the very heart by having nothing left to hope forbreak through the barriers of reserve and say things they would never have believed themselves capable of saying  perhaps he did not believe in goodness and badness any more than his son but as he would have said he didnt knowcouldnt tell there might be something in it and why by an unnecessary expression of disbelief deprive yourself of possible advantage  accustomed to spend his holidays among the mountains though like a true forsyte he had never attempted anything too adventurous or too foolhardy he had been passionately fond of them and when the wonderful view mentioned in baedekerfatiguing but repayingwas disclosed to him after the effort of the climb he had doubtless felt the existence of some great dignified principle crowning the chaotic strivings the petty precipices and ironic little dark chasms of life this was as near to religion perhaps as his practical spirit had ever gone  but it was many years since he had been to the mountains he had taken june there two seasons running after his wife died and had realized bitterly that his walking days were over  to that old mountaingiven confidence in a supreme order of things he had long been a stranger  he knew himself to be old yet he felt young and this troubled him it troubled and puzzled him too to think that he who had always been so careful should be father and grandfather to such as seemed born to disaster he had nothing to say against jowho could say anything against the boy an amiable chapbut his position was deplorable and this business of junes nearly as bad it seemed like a fatality and a fatality was one of those things no man of his character could either understand or put up with  in writing to his son he did not really hope that anything would come of it since the ball at rogers he had seen too clearly how the land layhe could put two and two together quicker than most menand with the example of his own son before his eyes knew better than any forsyte of them all that the pale flame singes mens wings whether they will or no  in the days before junes engagement when she and mrs soames were always together he had seen enough of irene to feel the spell she cast over men she was not a flirt not even a coquettewords dear to the heart of his generation which loved to define things by a good broad inadequate wordbut she was dangerous he could not say why tell him of a quality innate in some womena seductive power beyond their own control he would but answer humbug she was dangerous and there was an end of it he wanted to close his eyes to that affair if it was it was he did not want to hear any more about ithe only wanted to save junes position and her peace of mind he still hoped she might once more become a comfort to himself  and so he had written he got little enough out of the answer as to what young jolyon had made of the interview there was practically only the queer sentence i gather that hes in the stream the stream what stream what was this newfangled way of talking  he sighed and folded the last of the papers under the flap of the bag he knew well enough what was meant  june came out of the diningroom and helped him on with his summer coat from her costume and the expression of her little resolute face he saw at once what was coming  im going with you she said  nonsense my dear i go straight into the city i cant have you racketting about  i must see old mrs smeech  oh your precious lame ducks grumbled out old jolyon he did not believe her excuse but ceased his opposition there was no doing anything with that pertinacity of hers  at victoria he put her into the carriage which had been ordered for himselfa characteristic action for he had no petty selfishnesses  now dont you go tiring yourself my darling he said and took a cab on into the city  june went first to a backstreet in paddington where mrs smeech her lame duck livedan aged person connected with the charring interest but after half an hour spent in hearing her habitually lamentable recital and dragooning her into temporary comfort she went on to stanhope gate the great house was closed and dark  she had decided to learn something at all costs it was better to face the worst and have it over and this was her plan to go first to phils aunt mrs baynes and failing information there to irene herself she had no clear notion of what she would gain by these visits  at three oclock she was in lowndes square with a womans instinct when trouble is to be faced she had put on her best frock and went to the battle with a glance as courageous as old jolyons itself her tremors had passed into eagerness  mrs baynes bosinneys aunt louisa was her name was in her kitchen when june was announced organizing the cook for she was an excellent housewife and as baynes always said there was a lot in a good dinner he did his best work after dinner it was baynes who built that remarkably fine row of tall crimson houses in kensington which compete with so many others for the title of the ugliest in london  on hearing junes name she went hurriedly to her bedroom and taking two large bracelets from a red morocco case in a locked drawer put them on her white wristsfor she possessed in a remarkable degree that sense of property which as we know is the touchstone of forsyteism and the foundation of good morality  her figure of medium height and broad build with a tendency to embonpoint was reflected by the mirror of her whitewood wardrobe in a gown made under her own organization of one of those halftints reminiscent of the distempered walls of corridors in large hotels she raised her hands to her hair which she wore a la princesse de galles and touched it here and there settling it more firmly on her head and her eyes were full of an unconscious realism as though she were looking in the face one of lifes sordid facts and making the best of it in youth her cheeks had been of cream and roses but they were mottled now by middleage and again that hard ugly directness came into her eyes as she dabbed a powderpuff across her forehead putting the puff down she stood quite still before the glass arranging a smile over her high important nose her chin never large and now growing smaller with the increase of her neck her thinlipped downdrooping mouth quickly not to lose the effect she grasped her skirts strongly in both hands and went downstairs  she had been hoping for this visit for some time past whispers had reached her that things were not all right between her nephew and his fiancee neither of them had been near her for weeks she had asked phil to dinner many times his invariable answer had been too busy  her instinct was alarmed and the instinct in such matters of this excellent woman was keen she ought to have been a forsyte in young jolyons sense of the word she certainly had that privilege and merits description as such  she had married off her three daughters in a way that people said was beyond their deserts for they had the professional plainness only to be found as a rule among the female kind of the more legal callings her name was upon the committees of numberless charities connected with the churchdances theatricals or bazaarsand she never lent her name unless sure beforehand that everything had been thoroughly organized  she believed as she often said in putting things on a commercial basis the proper function of the church of charity indeed of everything was to strengthen the fabric of society individual action therefore she considered immoral organization was the only thing for by organization alone could you feel sure that you were getting a return for your money organizationand again organization and there is no doubt that she was what old jolyon called hera dab at thathe went further he called her a humbug  the enterprises to which she lent her name were organized so admirably that by the time the takings were handed over they were indeed skim milk divested of all cream of human kindness but as she often justly remarked sentiment was to be deprecated she was in fact a little academic  this great and good woman so highly thought of in ecclesiastical circles was one of the principal priestesses in the temple of forsyteism keeping alive day and night a sacred flame to the god of property whose altar is inscribed with those inspiring words nothing for nothing and really remarkably little for sixpence  when she entered a room it was felt that something substantial had come in which was probably the reason of her popularity as a patroness people liked something substantial when they had paid money for it and they would look at hersurrounded by her staff in charity ballrooms with her high nose and her broad square figure attired in an uniform covered with sequinsas though she were a general  the only thing against her was that she had not a double name she was a power in upper middleclass society with its hundred sets and circles all intersecting on the common battlefield of charity functions and on that battlefield brushing skirts so pleasantly with the skirts of society with the capital s she was a power in society with the smaller s that larger more significant and more powerful body where the commercially christian institutions maxims and principle which mrs baynes embodied were real lifeblood circulating freely real business currency not merely the sterilized imitation that flowed in the veins of smaller society with the larger s people who knew her felt her to be sounda sound woman who never gave herself away nor anything else if she could possibly help it  she had been on the worst sort of terms with bosinneys father who had not infrequently made her the object of an unpardonable ridicule she alluded to him now that he was gone as her poor dear irreverend brother  she greeted june with the careful effusion of which she was a mistress a little afraid of her as far as a woman of her eminence in the commercial and christian world could be afraidfor so slight a girl june had a great dignity the fearlessness of her eyes gave her that and mrs baynes too shrewdly recognized that behind the uncompromising frankness of junes manner there was much of the forsyte if the girl had been merely frank and courageous mrs baynes would have thought her cranky and despised her if she had been merely a forsyte like francielet us sayshe would have patronized her from sheer weight of metal but june small though she wasmrs baynes habitually admired quantitygave her an uneasy feeling and she placed her in a chair opposite the light  there was another reason for her respect which mrs baynes too good a churchwoman to be worldly would have been the last to admitshe often heard her husband describe old jolyon as extremely well off and was biassed towards his granddaughter for the soundest of all reasons today she felt the emotion with which we read a novel describing a hero and an inheritance nervously anxious lest by some frightful lapse of the novelist the young man should be left without it at the end  her manner was warm she had never seen so clearly before how distinguished and desirable a girl this was she asked after old jolyons health a wonderful man for his age so upright and young looking and how old was he eightyone she would never have thought it they were at the sea very nice for them she supposed june heard from phil every day her light grey eyes became more prominent as she asked this question but the girl met the glance without flinching  no she said he never writes  mrs bayness eyes dropped they had no intention of doing so but they did they recovered immediately  of course not thats phil all overhe was always like that  was he said june  the brevity of the answer caused mrs bayness bright smile a moments hesitation she disguised it by a quick movement and spreading her skirts afresh said why my dearhes quite the most harumscarum person one never pays the slightest attention to what he does  the conviction came suddenly to june that she was wasting her time even were she to put a question pointblank she would never get anything out of this woman  do you see him she asked her face crimsoning  the perspiration broke out on mrs baynes forehead beneath the powder  oh yes i dont remember when he was here lastindeed we havent seen much of him lately hes so busy with your cousins house im told itll be finished directly we must organize a little dinner to celebrate the event do come and stay the night with us  thank you said june again she thought im only wasting my time this woman will tell me nothing  she got up to go a change came over mrs baynes she rose too her lips twitched she fidgeted her hands something was evidently very wrong and she did not dare to ask this girl who stood there a slim straight little figure with her decided face her set jaw and resentful eyes she was not accustomed to be afraid of asking questionsall organization was based on the asking of questions  but the issue was so grave that her nerve normally strong was fairly shaken only that morning her husband had said old mr forsyte must be worth well over a hundred thousand pounds  and this girl stood there holding out her handholding out her hand  the chance might be slipping awayshe couldnt tellthe chance of keeping her in the family and yet she dared not speak  her eyes followed june to the door  it closed  then with an exclamation mrs baynes ran forward wobbling her bulky frame from side to side and opened it again  too late she heard the front door click and stood still an expression of real anger and mortification on her face  june went along the square with her birdlike quickness she detested that woman now whom in happier days she had been accustomed to think so kind was she always to be put off thus and forced to undergo this torturing suspense  she would go to phil himself and ask him what he meant she had the right to know she hurried on down sloane street till she came to bosinneys number passing the swingdoor at the bottom she ran up the stairs her heart thumping painfully  at the top of the third flight she paused for breath and holding on to the bannisters stood listening no sound came from above  with a very white face she mounted the last flight she saw the door with his name on the plate and the resolution that had brought her so far evaporated  the full meaning of her conduct came to her she felt hot all over the palms of her hands were moist beneath the thin silk covering of her gloves  she drew back to the stairs but did not descend leaning against the rail she tried to get rid of a feeling of being choked and she gazed at the door with a sort of dreadful courage no she refused to go down did it matter what people thought of her they would never know no one would help her if she did not help herself she would go through with it  forcing herself therefore to leave the support of the wall she rang the bell the door did not open and all her shame and fear suddenly abandoned her she rang again and again as though in spite of its emptiness she could drag some response out of that closed room some recompense for the shame and fear that visit had cost her it did not open she left off ringing and sitting down at the top of the stairs buried her face in her hands  presently she stole down out into the air she felt as though she had passed through a bad illness and had no desire now but to get home as quickly as she could the people she met seemed to know where she had been what she had been doing and suddenlyover on the opposite side going towards his rooms from the direction of montpellier squareshe saw bosinney himself  she made a movement to cross into the traffic their eyes met and he raised his hat an omnibus passed obscuring her view then from the edge of the pavement through a gap in the traffic she saw him walking on  and june stood motionless looking after him     chapter xiiiperfection of the house  one mockturtle clear one oxtail two glasses of port  in the upper room at frenchs where a forsyte could still get heavy english food james and his son were sitting down to lunch  of all eatingplaces james liked best to come here there was something unpretentious wellflavoured and filling about it and though he had been to a certain extent corrupted by the necessity for being fashionable and the trend of habits keeping pace with an income that would increase he still hankered in quiet city moments after the tasty fleshpots of his earlier days here you were served by hairy english waiters in aprons there was sawdust on the floor and three round gilt lookingglasses hung just above the line of sight they had only recently done away with the cubicles too in which you could have your chop prime chump with a flourypotato without seeing your neighbours like a gentleman  he tucked the top corner of his napkin behind the third button of his waistcoat a practice he had been obliged to abandon years ago in the west end he felt that he should relish his soupthe entire morning had been given to winding up the estate of an old friend  after filling his mouth with household bread stale he at once began how are you going down to robin hill you going to take irene youd better take her i should think therell be a lot thatll want seeing to  without looking up soames answered she wont go  wont go whats the meaning of that shes going to live in the house isnt she  soames made no reply  i dont know whats coming to women nowadays mumbled james i never used to have any trouble with them shes had too much liberty shes spoiled  soames lifted his eyes i wont have anything said against her he said unexpectedly  the silence was only broken now by the supping of jamess soup  the waiter brought the two glasses of port but soames stopped him  thats not the way to serve port he said take them away and bring the bottle  rousing himself from his reverie over the soup james took one of his rapid shifting surveys of surrounding facts  your mothers in bed he said you can have the carriage to take you down i should think irened like the drive this young bosinneyll be there i suppose to show you over  soames nodded  i should like to go and see for myself what sort of a job hes made finishing off pursued james ill just drive round and pick you both up  i am going down by train replied soames if you like to drive round and see irene might go with you i cant tell  he signed to the waiter to bring the bill which james paid  they parted at st pauls soames branching off to the station james taking his omnibus westwards  he had secured the corner seat next the conductor where his long legs made it difficult for anyone to get in and at all who passed him he looked resentfully as if they had no business to be using up his air  he intended to take an opportunity this afternoon of speaking to irene a word in time saved nine and now that she was going to live in the country there was a chance for her to turn over a new leaf he could see that soames wouldnt stand very much more of her goings on  it did not occur to him to define what he meant by her goings on the expression was wide vague and suited to a forsyte and james had more than his common share of courage after lunch  on reaching home he ordered out the barouche with special instructions that the groom was to go too he wished to be kind to her and to give her every chance  when the door of no62 was opened he could distinctly hear her singing and said so at once to prevent any chance of being denied entrance  yes mrs soames was in but the maid did not know if she was seeing people  james moving with the rapidity that ever astonished the observers of his long figure and absorbed expression went forthwith into the drawingroom without permitting this to be ascertained he found irene seated at the piano with her hands arrested on the keys evidently listening to the voices in the hall she greeted him without smiling  your motherinlaws in bed he began hoping at once to enlist her sympathy ive got the carriage here now be a good girl and put on your hat and come with me for a drive itll do you good  irene looked at him as though about to refuse but seeming to change her mind went upstairs and came down again with her hat on  where are you going to take me she asked  well just go down to robin hill said james spluttering out his words very quick the horses want exercise and i should like to see what theyve been doing down there  irene hung back but again changed her mind and went out to the carriage james brooding over her closely to make quite sure  it was not before he had got her more than half way that he began soames is very fond of youhe wont have anything said against you why dont you show him more affection  irene flushed and said in a low voice i cant show what i havent got  james looked at her sharply he felt that now he had her in his own carriage with his own horses and servants he was really in command of the situation she could not put him off nor would she make a scene in public  i cant think what youre about he said hes a very good husband  irenes answer was so low as to be almost inaudible among the sounds of traffic he caught the words you are not married to him  whats that got to do with it hes given you everything you want hes always ready to take you anywhere and now hes built you this house in the country its not as if you had anything of your own  no  again james looked at her he could not make out the expression on her face she looked almost as if she were going to cry and yet  im sure he muttered hastily weve all tried to be kind to you  irenes lips quivered to his dismay james saw a tear steal down her cheek he felt a choke rise in his own throat  were all fond of you he said if youd onlyhe was going to say behave yourself but changed it toif youd only be more of a wife to him  irene did not answer and james too ceased speaking there was something in her silence which disconcerted him it was not the silence of obstinacy rather that of acquiescence in all that he could find to say and yet he felt as if he had not had the last word he could not understand this  he was unable however to long keep silence  i suppose that young bosinney he said will be getting married to june now  irenes face changed i dont know she said you should ask her  does she write to you  no  hows that said james i thought you and she were such great friends  irene turned on him again she said you should ask her  well flustered james frightened by her look its very odd that i cant get a plain answer to a plain question but there it is  he sat ruminating over his rebuff and burst out at last  well ive warned you you wont look ahead soames he doesnt say much but i can see he wont stand a great deal more of this sort of thing youll have nobody but yourself to blame and whats more youll get no sympathy from anybody  irene bent her head with a little smiling bow i am very much obliged to you  james did not know what on earth to answer  the bright hot morning had changed slowly to a grey oppressive afternoon a heavy bank of clouds with the yellow tinge of coming thunder had risen in the south and was creeping up  the branches of the trees dropped motionless across the road without the smallest stir of foliage a faint odour of glue from the heated horses clung in the thick air the coachman and groom rigid and unbending exchanged stealthy murmurs on the box without ever turning their heads  to james great relief they reached the house at last the silence and impenetrability of this woman by his side whom he had always thought so soft and mild alarmed him  the carriage put them down at the door and they entered  the hall was cool and so still that it was like passing into a tomb a shudder ran down jamess spine he quickly lifted the heavy leather curtains between the columns into the inner court  he could not restrain an exclamation of approval  the decoration was really in excellent taste the dull ruby tiles that extended from the foot of the walls to the verge of a circular clump of tall iris plants surrounding in turn a sunken basin of white marble filled with water were obviously of the best quality he admired extremely the purple leather curtains drawn along one entire side framing a huge whitetiled stove the central partitions of the skylight had been slid back and the warm air from outside penetrated into the very heart of the house  he stood his hands behind him his head bent back on his high narrow shoulders spying the tracery on the columns and the pattern of the frieze which ran round the ivorycoloured walls under the gallery evidently no pains had been spared it was quite the house of a gentleman he went up to the curtains and having discovered how they were worked drew them asunder and disclosed the picturegallery ending in a great window taking up the whole end of the room it had a black oak floor and its walls again were of ivory white he went on throwing open doors and peeping in everything was in applepie order ready for immediate occupation  he turned round at last to speak to irene and saw her standing over in the garden entrance with her husband and bosinney  though not remarkable for sensibility james felt at once that something was wrong he went up to them and vaguely alarmed ignorant of the nature of the trouble made an attempt to smooth things over  how are you mr bosinney he said holding out his hand youve been spending money pretty freely down here i should say  soames turned his back and walked away  james looked from bosinneys frowning face to irene and in his agitation spoke his thoughts aloud well i cant tell whats the matter nobody tells me anything and making off after his son he heard bosinneys short laugh and his well thank god you look so most unfortunately he lost the rest  what had happened he glanced back irene was very close to the architect and her face not like the face he knew of her he hastened up to his son  soames was pacing the picturegallery  whats the matter said james whats all this  soames looked at him with his supercilious calm unbroken but james knew well enough that he was violently angry  our friend he said has exceeded his instructions again thats all so much the worse for him this time  he turned round and walked back towards the door james followed hurriedly edging himself in front he saw irene take her finger from before her lips heard her say something in her ordinary voice and began to speak before he reached them  theres a storm coming on wed better get home we cant take you i suppose mr bosinney no i suppose not then goodbye he held out his hand bosinney did not take it but turning with a laugh said  goodbye mr forsyte dont get caught in the storm and walked away  well began james i dont know  but the sight of irenes face stopped him taking hold of his daughterinlaw by the elbow he escorted her towards the carriage he felt certain quite certain they had been making some appointment or other  nothing in this world is more sure to upset a forsyte than the discovery that something on which he has stipulated to spend a certain sum has cost more and this is reasonable for upon the accuracy of his estimates the whole policy of his life is ordered if he cannot rely on definite values of property his compass is amiss he is adrift upon bitter waters without a helm  after writing to bosinney in the terms that have already been chronicled soames had dismissed the cost of the house from his mind he believed that he had made the matter of the final cost so very plain that the possibility of its being again exceeded had really never entered his head on hearing from bosinney that his limit of twelve thousand pounds would be exceeded by something like four hundred he had grown white with anger his original estimate of the cost of the house completed had been ten thousand pounds and he had often blamed himself severely for allowing himself to be led into repeated excesses over this last expenditure however bosinney had put himself completely in the wrong how on earth a fellow could make such an ass of himself soames could not conceive but he had done so and all the rancour and hidden jealousy that had been burning against him for so long was now focussed in rage at this crowning piece of extravagance the attitude of the confident and friendly husband was gone to preserve propertyhis wifehe had assumed it to preserve property of another kind he lost it now  ah he had said to bosinney when he could speak and i suppose youre perfectly contented with yourself but i may as well tell you that youve altogether mistaken your man  what he meant by those words he did not quite know at the time but after dinner he looked up the correspondence between himself and bosinney to make quite sure there could be no two opinions about itthe fellow had made himself liable for that extra four hundred or at all events for three hundred and fifty of it and he would have to make it good  he was looking at his wifes face when he came to this conclusion seated in her usual seat on the sofa she was altering the lace on a collar she had not once spoken to him all the evening  he went up to the mantelpiece and contemplating his face in the mirror said your friend the buccaneer has made a fool of himself he will have to pay for it  she looked at him scornfully and answered i dont know what you are talking about  you soon will a mere trifle quite beneath your contemptfour hundred pounds  do you mean that you are going to make him pay that towards this hateful house  i do  and you know hes got nothing  yes  then you are meaner than i thought you  soames turned from the mirror and unconsciously taking a china cup from the mantelpiece clasped his hands around it as though praying he saw her bosom rise and fall her eyes darkening with anger and taking no notice of the taunt he asked quietly  are you carrying on a flirtation with bosinney  no i am not  her eyes met his and he looked away he neither believed nor disbelieved her but he knew that he had made a mistake in asking he never had known never would know what she was thinking the sight of her inscrutable face the thought of all the hundreds of evenings he had seen her sitting there like that soft and passive but unreadable unknown enraged him beyond measure  i believe you are made of stone he said clenching his fingers so hard that he broke the fragile cup the pieces fell into the grate and irene smiled  you seem to forget she said that cup is not  soames gripped her arm a good beating he said is the only thing that would bring you to your senses but turning on his heel he left the room     chapter xivsoames sits on the stairs  soames went upstairs that night with the feeling that he had gone too far he was prepared to offer excuses for his words  he turned out the gas still burning in the passage outside their room pausing with his hand on the knob of the door he tried to shape his apology for he had no intention of letting her see that he was nervous  but the door did not open nor when he pulled it and turned the handle firmly she must have locked it for some reason and forgotten  entering his dressingroom where the gas was also lighted and burning low he went quickly to the other door that too was locked then he noticed that the camp bed which he occasionally used was prepared and his sleepingsuit laid out upon it he put his hand up to his forehead and brought it away wet it dawned on him that he was barred out  he went back to the door and rattling the handle stealthily called unlock the door do you hear unlock the door  there was a faint rustling but no answer  do you hear let me in at oncei insist on being let in  he could catch the sound of her breathing close to the door like the breathing of a creature threatened by danger  there was something terrifying in this inexorable silence in the impossibility of getting at her he went back to the other door and putting his whole weight against it tried to burst it open the door was a new onehe had had them renewed himself in readiness for their coming in after the honeymoon in a rage he lifted his foot to kick in the panel the thought of the servants restrained him and he felt suddenly that he was beaten  flinging himself down in the dressingroom he took up a book  but instead of the print he seemed to see his wifewith her yellow hair flowing over her bare shoulders and her great dark eyesstanding like an animal at bay and the whole meaning of her act of revolt came to him she meant it to be for good  he could not sit still and went to the door again he could still hear her and he called irene irene  he did not mean to make his voice pathetic  in ominous answer the faint sounds ceased he stood with clenched hands thinking  presently he stole round on tiptoe and running suddenly at the other door made a supreme effort to break it open it creaked but did not yield he sat down on the stairs and buried his face in his hands  for a long time he sat there in the dark the moon through the skylight above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards him down the stairway he tried to be philosophical  since she had locked her doors she had no further claim as a wife and he would console himself with other women  it was but a spectral journey he made among such delightshe had no appetite for these exploits he had never had much and he had lost the habit he felt that he could never recover it his hunger could only be appeased by his wife inexorable and frightened behind these shut doors no other woman could help him  this conviction came to him with terrible force out there in the dark  his philosophy left him and surly anger took its place her conduct was immoral inexcusable worthy of any punishment within his power he desired no one but her and she refused him  she must really hate him then he had never believed it yet he did not believe it now it seemed to him incredible he felt as though he had lost for ever his power of judgment if she so soft and yielding as he had always judged her could take this decided stepwhat could not happen  then he asked himself again if she were carrying on an intrigue with bosinney he did not believe that she was he could not afford to believe such a reason for her conductthe thought was not to be faced  it would be unbearable to contemplate the necessity of making his marital relations public property short of the most convincing proofs he must still refuse to believe for he did not wish to punish himself and all the time at hearthe did believe  the moonlight cast a greyish tinge over his figure hunched against the staircase wall  bosinney was in love with her he hated the fellow and would not spare him now he could and would refuse to pay a penny piece over twelve thousand and fifty poundsthe extreme limit fixed in the correspondence or rather he would pay he would pay and sue him for damages he would go to jobling and boulter and put the matter in their hands he would ruin the impecunious beggar and suddenlythough what connection between the thoughtshe reflected that irene had no money either they were both beggars this gave him a strange satisfaction  the silence was broken by a faint creaking through the wall she was going to bed at last ah joy and pleasant dreams if she threw the door open wide he would not go in now  but his lips that were twisted in a bitter smile twitched he covered his eyes with his hands  it was late the following afternoon when soames stood in the diningroom window gazing gloomily into the square  the sunlight still showered on the planetrees and in the breeze their gay broad leaves shone and swung in rhyme to a barrel organ at the corner it was playing a waltz an old waltz that was out of fashion with a fateful rhythm in the notes and it went on and on though nothing indeed but leaves danced to the tune  the woman did not look too gay for she was tired and from the tall houses no one threw her down coppers she moved the organ on and three doors off began again  it was the waltz they had played at rogers when irene had danced with bosinney and the perfume of the gardenias she had worn came back to soames drifted by the malicious music as it had been drifted to him then when she passed her hair glistening her eyes so soft drawing bosinney on and on down an endless ballroom  the organ woman plied her handle slowly she had been grinding her tune all daygrinding it in sloane street hard by grinding it perhaps to bosinney himself  soames turned took a cigarette from the carven box and walked back to the window the tune had mesmerized him and there came into his view irene her sunshade furled hastening homewards down the square in a soft rosecoloured blouse with drooping sleeves that he did not know she stopped before the organ took out her purse and gave the woman money  soames shrank back and stood where he could see into the hall  she came in with her latchkey put down her sunshade and stood looking at herself in the glass her cheeks were flushed as if the sun had burned them her lips were parted in a smile she stretched her arms out as though to embrace herself with a laugh that for all the world was like a sob  soames stepped forward  verypretty he said  but as though shot she spun round and would have passed him up the stairs he barred the way  why such a hurry he said and his eyes fastened on a curl of hair fallen loose across her ear  he hardly recognised her she seemed on fire so deep and rich the colour of her cheeks her eyes her lips and of the unusual blouse she wore  she put up her hand and smoothed back the curl she was breathing fast and deep as though she had been running and with every breath perfume seemed to come from her hair and from her body like perfume from an opening flower  i dont like that blouse he said slowly its a soft shapeless thing  he lifted his finger towards her breast but she dashed his hand aside  dont touch me she cried  he caught her wrist she wrenched it away  and where may you have been he asked  in heavenout of this house with those words she fled upstairs  outsidein thanksgivingat the very door the organgrinder was playing the waltz  and soames stood motionless what prevented him from following her  was it that with the eyes of faith he saw bosinney looking down from that high window in sloane street straining his eyes for yet another glimpse of irenes vanished figure cooling his flushed face dreaming of the moment when she flung herself on his breastthe scent of her still in the air around and the sound of her laugh that was like a sob     part iii     chapter imrs macanders evidence  many people no doubt including the editor of the ultra vivisectionist then in the bloom of its first youth would say that soames was less than a man not to have removed the locks from his wifes doors and after beating her soundly resumed wedded happiness  brutality is not so deplorably diluted by humaneness as it used to be yet a sentimental segment of the population may still be relieved to learn that he did none of these things for active brutality is not popular with forsytes they are too circumspect and on the whole too softhearted and in soames there was some common pride not sufficient to make him do a really generous action but enough to prevent his indulging in an extremely mean one except perhaps in very hot blood above all this a true forsyte refused to feel himself ridiculous short of actually beating his wife he perceived nothing to be done he therefore accepted the situation without another word  throughout the summer and autumn he continued to go to the office to sort his pictures and ask his friends to dinner  he did not leave town irene refused to go away the house at robin hill finished though it was remained empty and ownerless soames had brought a suit against the buccaneer in which he claimed from him the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds  a firm of solicitors messrs freak and able had put in a defence on bosinneys behalf admitting the facts they raised a point on the correspondence which divested of legal phraseology amounted to this to speak of a free hand in the terms of this correspondence is an irish bull  by a chance fortuitous but not improbable in the close borough of legal circles a good deal of information came to soames ear anent this line of policy the working partner in his firm bustard happening to sit next at dinner at walmisleys the taxing master to young chankery of the common law bar  the necessity for talking what is known as shop which comes on all lawyers with the removal of the ladies caused chankery a young and promising advocate to propound an impersonal conundrum to his neighbour whose name he did not know for seated as he permanently was in the background bustard had practically no name  he had said chankery a case coming on with a very nice point he then explained preserving every professional discretion the riddle in soames case everyone he said to whom he had spoken thought it a nice point the issue was small unfortunately though dd serious for his client he believedwalmisleys champagne was bad but plentiful a judge would make short work of it he was afraid he intended to make a big effortthe point was a nice one what did his neighbour say  bustard a model of secrecy said nothing he related the incident to soames however with some malice for this quiet man was capable of human feeling ending with his own opinion that the point was a very nice one  in accordance with his resolve our forsyte had put his interests into the hands of jobling and boulter from the moment of doing so he regretted that he had not acted for himself on receiving a copy of bosinneys defence he went over to their offices  boulter who had the matter in hand jobling having died some years before told him that in his opinion it was rather a nice point he would like counsels opinion on it  soames told him to go to a good man and they went to waterbuck qc marking him ten and one who kept the papers six weeks and then wrote as follows  in my opinion the true interpretation of this correspondence depends very much on the intention of the parties and will turn upon the evidence given at the trial i am of opinion that an attempt should be made to secure from the architect an admission that he understood he was not to spend at the outside more than twelve thousand and fifty pounds with regard to the expression a free hand in the terms of this correspondence to which my attention is directed the point is a nice one but i am of opinion that upon the whole the ruling in boileau v the blasted cement co ltd will apply  upon this opinion they acted administering interrogatories but to their annoyance messrs freak and able answered these in so masterly a fashion that nothing whatever was admitted and that without prejudice  it was on october 1 that soames read waterbucks opinion in the diningroom before dinner  it made him nervous not so much because of the case of boileau v the blasted cement co ltd as that the point had lately begun to seem to him too a nice one there was about it just that pleasant flavour of subtlety so attractive to the best legal appetites to have his own impression confirmed by waterbuck qc would have disturbed any man  he sat thinking it over and staring at the empty grate for though autumn had come the weather kept as gloriously fine that jubilee year as if it were still high august it was not pleasant to be disturbed he desired too passionately to set his foot on bosinneys neck  though he had not seen the architect since the last afternoon at robin hill he was never free from the sense of his presencenever free from the memory of his worn face with its high cheek bones and enthusiastic eyes it would not be too much to say that he had never got rid of the feeling of that night when he heard the peacocks cry at dawnthe feeling that bosinney haunted the house and every mans shape that he saw in the dark evenings walking past seemed that of him whom george had so appropriately named the buccaneer  irene still met him he was certain where or how he neither knew nor asked deterred by a vague and secret dread of too much knowledge it all seemed subterranean nowadays  sometimes when he questioned his wife as to where she had been which he still made a point of doing as every forsyte should she looked very strange her selfpossession was wonderful but there were moments when behind the mask of her face inscrutable as it had always been to him lurked an expression he had never been used to see there  she had taken to lunching out too when he asked bilson if her mistress had been in to lunch as often as not she would answer no sir  he strongly disapproved of her gadding about by herself and told her so but she took no notice there was something that angered amazed yet almost amused him about the calm way in which she disregarded his wishes it was really as if she were hugging to herself the thought of a triumph over him  he rose from the perusal of waterbuck qcs opinion and going upstairs entered her room for she did not lock her doors till bedtimeshe had the decency he found to save the feelings of the servants she was brushing her hair and turned to him with strange fierceness  what do you want she said please leave my room  he answered i want to know how long this state of things between us is to last i have put up with it long enough  will you please leave my room  will you treat me as your husband  no  then i shall take steps to make you  do  he stared amazed at the calmness of her answer her lips were compressed in a thin line her hair lay in fluffy masses on her bare shoulders in all its strange golden contrast to her dark eyesthose eyes alive with the emotions of fear hate contempt and odd haunting triumph  now please will you leave my room he turned round and went sulkily out  he knew very well that he had no intention of taking steps and he saw that she knew tooknew that he was afraid to  it was a habit with him to tell her the doings of his day how such and such clients had called how he had arranged a mortgage for parkes how that longstanding suit of fryer v forsyte was getting on which arising in the preternaturally careful disposition of his property by his great uncle nicholas who had tied it up so that no one could get at it at all seemed likely to remain a source of income for several solicitors till the day of judgment  and how he had called in at jobsons and seen a boucher sold which he had just missed buying of talleyrand and sons in pall mall  he had an admiration for boucher watteau and all that school it was a habit with him to tell her all these matters and he continued to do it even now talking for long spells at dinner as though by the volubility of words he could conceal from himself the ache in his heart  often if they were alone he made an attempt to kiss her when she said goodnight he may have had some vague notion that some night she would let him or perhaps only the feeling that a husband ought to kiss his wife even if she hated him he at all events ought not to put himself in the wrong by neglecting this ancient rite  and why did she hate him even now he could not altogether believe it it was strange to be hatedthe emotion was too extreme yet he hated bosinney that buccaneer that prowling vagabond that nightwanderer for in his thoughts soames always saw him lying in waitwandering ah but he must be in very low water young burkitt the architect had seen him coming out of a thirdrate restaurant looking terribly down in the mouth  during all the hours he lay awake thinking over the situation which seemed to have no endunless she should suddenly come to her sensesnever once did the thought of separating from his wife seriously enter his head  and the forsytes what part did they play in this stage of soames subterranean tragedy  truth to say little or none for they were at the sea  from hotels hydropathics or lodginghouses they were bathing daily laying in a stock of ozone to last them through the winter  each section in the vineyard of its own choosing grew and culled and pressed and bottled the grapes of a pet seaair  the end of september began to witness their several returns  in rude health and small omnibuses with considerable colour in their cheeks they arrived daily from the various termini the following morning saw them back at their vocations  on the next sunday timothys was thronged from lunch till dinner  amongst other gossip too numerous and interesting to relate mrs septimus small mentioned that soames and irene had not been away  it remained for a comparative outsider to supply the next evidence of interest  it chanced that one afternoon late in september mrs macander winifred darties greatest friend taking a constitutional with young augustus flippard on her bicycle in richmond park passed irene and bosinney walking from the bracken towards the sheen gate  perhaps the poor little woman was thirsty for she had ridden long on a hard dry road and as all london knows to ride a bicycle and talk to young flippard will try the toughest constitution or perhaps the sight of the cool bracken grove whence those two were coming down excited her envy the cool bracken grove on the top of the hill with the oak boughs for roof where the pigeons were raising an endless wedding hymn and the autumn humming whispered to the ears of lovers in the fern while the deer stole by the bracken grove of irretrievable delights of golden minutes in the long marriage of heaven and earth the bracken grove sacred to stags to strange treestump fauns leaping around the silver whiteness of a birchtree nymph at summer dusk  this lady knew all the forsytes and having been at junes at home was not at a loss to see with whom she had to deal her own marriage poor thing had not been successful but having had the good sense and ability to force her husband into pronounced error she herself had passed through the necessary divorce proceedings without incurring censure  she was therefore a judge of all that sort of thing and lived in one of those large buildings where in small sets of apartments are gathered incredible quantities of forsytes whose chief recreation out of business hours is the discussion of each others affairs  poor little woman perhaps she was thirsty certainly she was bored for flippard was a wit to see those two in so unlikely a spot was quite a merciful pickmeup  at the macander like all london time pauses  this small but remarkable woman merits attention her allseeing eye and shrewd tongue were inscrutably the means of furthering the ends of providence  with an air of being in at the death she had an almost distressing power of taking care of herself she had done more perhaps in her way than any woman about town to destroy the sense of chivalry which still clogs the wheel of civilization so smart she was and spoken of endearingly as the little macander  dressing tightly and well she belonged to a womans club but was by no means the neurotic and dismal type of member who was always thinking of her rights she took her rights unconsciously they came natural to her and she knew exactly how to make the most of them without exciting anything but admiration amongst that great class to whom she was affiliated not precisely perhaps by manner but by birth breeding and the true the secret gauge a sense of property  the daughter of a bedfordshire solicitor by the daughter of a clergyman she had never through all the painful experience of being married to a very mild painter with a cranky love of nature who had deserted her for an actress lost touch with the requirements beliefs and inner feeling of society and on attaining her liberty she placed herself without effort in the very van of forsyteism  always in good spirits and full of information she was universally welcomed she excited neither surprise nor disapprobation when encountered on the rhine or at zermatt either alone or travelling with a lady and two gentlemen it was felt that she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself and the hearts of all forsytes warmed to that wonderful instinct which enabled her to enjoy everything without giving anything away it was generally felt that to such women as mrs macander should we look for the perpetuation and increase of our best type of woman she had never had any children  if there was one thing more than another that she could not stand it was one of those soft women with what men called charm about them and for mrs soames she always had an especial dislike  obscurely no doubt she felt that if charm were once admitted as the criterion smartness and capability must go to the wall and she hatedwith a hatred the deeper that at times this socalled charm seemed to disturb all calculationsthe subtle seductiveness which she could not altogether overlook in irene  she said however that she could see nothing in the womanthere was no go about hershe would never be able to stand up for herselfanyone could take advantage of her that was plainshe could not see in fact what men found to admire  she was not really illnatured but in maintaining her position after the trying circumstances of her married life she had found it so necessary to be full of information that the idea of holding her tongue about those two in the park never occurred to her  and it so happened that she was dining that very evening at timothys where she went sometimes to cheer the old things up as she was wont to put it the same people were always asked to meet her winifred dartie and her husband francie because she belonged to the artistic circles for mrs macander was known to contribute articles on dress to the ladies kingdom come and for her to flirt with provided they could be obtained two of the hayman boys who though they never said anything were believed to be fast and thoroughly intimate with all that was latest in smart society  at twentyfive minutes past seven she turned out the electric light in her little hall and wrapped in her opera cloak with the chinchilla collar came out into the corridor pausing a moment to make sure she had her latchkey these little selfcontained flats were convenient to be sure she had no light and no air but she could shut it up whenever she liked and go away there was no bother with servants and she never felt tied as she used to when poor dear fred was always about in his mooney way she retained no rancour against poor dear fred he was such a fool but the thought of that actress drew from her even now a little bitter derisive smile  firmly snapping the door to she crossed the corridor with its gloomy yellowochre walls and its infinite vista of brown numbered doors the lift was going down and wrapped to the ears in the high cloak with every one of her auburn hairs in its place she waited motionless for it to stop at her floor the iron gates clanked open she entered there were already three occupants a man in a great white waistcoat with a large smooth face like a babys and two old ladies in black with mittened hands  mrs macander smiled at them she knew everybody and all these three who had been admirably silent before began to talk at once this was mrs macanders successful secret she provoked conversation  throughout a descent of five stories the conversation continued the lift boy standing with his back turned his cynical face protruding through the bars  at the bottom they separated the man in the white waistcoat sentimentally to the billiard room the old ladies to dine and say to each other a dear little woman such a rattle and mrs macander to her cab  when mrs macander dined at timothys the conversation although timothy himself could never be induced to be present took that wider manoftheworld tone current among forsytes at large and this no doubt was what put her at a premium there  mrs small and aunt hester found it an exhilarating change if only they said timothy would meet her it was felt that she would do him good she could tell you for instance the latest story of sir charles fistes son at monte carlo who was the real heroine of tynemouth eddys fashionable novel that everyone was holding up their hands over and what they were doing in paris about wearing bloomers she was so sensible too knowing all about that vexed question whether to send young nicholas eldest into the navy as his mother wished or make him an accountant as his father thought would be safer she strongly deprecated the navy if you were not exceptionally brilliant or exceptionally well connected they passed you over so disgracefully and what was it after all to look forward to even if you became an admirala pittance an accountant had many more chances but let him be put with a good firm where there was no risk at starting  sometimes she would give them a tip on the stock exchange not that mrs small or aunt hester ever took it they had indeed no money to invest but it seemed to bring them into such exciting touch with the realities of life it was an event they would ask timothy they said but they never did knowing in advance that it would upset him surreptitiously however for weeks after they would look in that paper which they took with respect on account of its really fashionable proclivities to see whether brights rubies or the woollen mackintosh company were up or down sometimes they could not find the name of the company at all and they would wait until james or roger or even swithin came in and ask them in voices trembling with curiosity how that bolivia lime and speltrate was doingthey could not find it in the paper  and roger would answer what do you want to know for some trash youll go burning your fingersinvesting your money in lime and things you know nothing about who told you and ascertaining what they had been told he would go away and making inquiries in the city would perhaps invest some of his own money in the concern  it was about the middle of dinner just in fact as the saddle of mutton had been brought in by smither that mrs macander looking airily round said oh and whom do you think i passed today in richmond park youll never guessmrs soames andmr bosinney they must have been down to look at the house  winifred dartie coughed and no one said a word it was the piece of evidence they had all unconsciously been waiting for  to do mrs macander justice she had been to switzerland and the italian lakes with a party of three and had not heard of soames rupture with his architect she could not tell therefore the profound impression her words would make  upright and a little flushed she moved her small shrewd eyes from face to face trying to gauge the effect of her words on either side of her a hayman boy his lean taciturn hungry face turned towards his plate ate his mutton steadily  these two giles and jesse were so alike and so inseparable that they were known as the dromios they never talked and seemed always completely occupied in doing nothing it was popularly supposed that they were cramming for an important examination they walked without hats for long hours in the gardens attached to their house books in their hands a foxterrier at their heels never saying a word and smoking all the time every morning about fifty yards apart they trotted down campden hill on two lean hacks with legs as long as their own and every morning about an hour later still fifty yards apart they cantered up again every evening wherever they had dined they might be observed about halfpast ten leaning over the balustrade of the alhambra promenade  they were never seen otherwise than together in this way passing their lives apparently perfectly content  inspired by some dumb stirring within them of the feelings of gentlemen they turned at this painful moment to mrs macander and said in precisely the same voice have you seen the  such was her surprise at being thus addressed that she put down her fork and smither who was passing promptly removed her plate mrs macander however with presence of mind said instantly i must have a little more of that nice mutton  but afterwards in the drawingroom she sat down by mrs small determined to get to the bottom of the matter and she began  what a charming woman mrs soames such a sympathetic temperament soames is a really lucky man  her anxiety for information had not made sufficient allowance for that inner forsyte skin which refuses to share its troubles with outsiders  mrs septimus small drawing herself up with a creak and rustle of her whole person said shivering in her dignity  my dear it is a subject we do not talk about     chapter iinight in the park  although with her infallible instinct mrs small had said the very thing to make her guest more intriguee than ever it is difficult to see how else she could truthfully have spoken  it was not a subject which the forsytes could talk about even among themselvesto use the word soames had invented to characterize to himself the situation it was subterranean  yet within a week of mrs macanders encounter in richmond park to all of themsave timothy from whom it was carefully keptto james on his domestic beat from the poultry to park lane to george the wild one on his daily adventure from the bow window at the haversnake to the billiard room at the red pottle was it known that those two had gone to extremes  george it was he who invented many of those striking expressions still current in fashionable circles voiced the sentiment more accurately than any one when he said to his brother eustace that the buccaneer was going it he expected soames was about fed up  it was felt that he must be and yet what could be done he ought perhaps to take steps but to take steps would be deplorable  without an open scandal which they could not see their way to recommending it was difficult to see what steps could be taken in this impasse the only thing was to say nothing to soames and nothing to each other in fact to pass it over  by displaying towards irene a dignified coldness some impression might be made upon her but she was seldom now to be seen and there seemed a slight difficulty in seeking her out on purpose to show her coldness sometimes in the privacy of his bedroom james would reveal to emily the real suffering that his sons misfortune caused him  i cant tell he would say it worries me out of my life therell be a scandal and thatll do him no good i shant say anything to him there might be nothing in it what do you think shes very artistic they tell me what oh youre a regular juley well i dont know i expect the worst this is what comes of having no children i knew how it would be from the first they never told me they didnt mean to have any childrennobody tells me anything  on his knees by the side of the bed his eyes open and fixed with worry he would breathe into the counterpane clad in his nightshirt his neck poked forward his back rounded he resembled some long white bird  our father he repeated turning over and over again the thought of this possible scandal  like old jolyon he too at the bottom of his heart set the blame of the tragedy down to family interference what business had that lothe began to think of the stanhope gate branch including young jolyon and his daughter as that lotto introduce a person like this bosinney into the family he had heard georges soubriquet the buccaneer but he could make nothing of thatthe young man was an architect  he began to feel that his brother jolyon to whom he had always looked up and on whose opinion he had relied was not quite what he had expected  not having his eldest brothers force of character he was more sad than angry his great comfort was to go to winifreds and take the little darties in his carriage over to kensington gardens and there by the round pond he could often be seen walking with his eyes fixed anxiously on little publius darties sailingboat which he had himself freighted with a penny as though convinced that it would never again come to shore while little publiuswho james delighted to say was not a bit like his father skipping along under his lee would try to get him to bet another that it never would having found that it always did and james would make the bet he always paidsometimes as many as three or four pennies in the afternoon for the game seemed never to pall on little publiusand always in paying he said now thats for your moneybox why youre getting quite a rich man the thought of his little grandsons growing wealth was a real pleasure to him but little publius knew a sweetshop and a trick worth two of that  and they would walk home across the park james figure with high shoulders and absorbed and worried face exercising its tall lean protectorship pathetically unregarded over the robust childfigures of imogen and little publius  but those gardens and that park were not sacred to james forsytes and tramps children and lovers rested and wandered day after day night after night seeking one and all some freedom from labour from the reek and turmoil of the streets  the leaves browned slowly lingering with the sun and summerlike warmth of the nights  on saturday october 5 the sky that had been blue all day deepened after sunset to the bloom of purple grapes there was no moon and a clear dark like some velvety garment was wrapped around the trees whose thinned branches resembling plumes stirred not in the still warm air all london had poured into the park draining the cup of summer to its dregs  couple after couple from every gate they streamed along the paths and over the burnt grass and one after another silently out of the lighted spaces stole into the shelter of the feathery trees where blotted against some trunk or under the shadow of shrubs they were lost to all but themselves in the heart of the soft darkness  to freshcomers along the paths these forerunners formed but part of that passionate dusk whence only a strange murmur like the confused beating of hearts came forth but when that murmur reached each couple in the lamplight their voices wavered and ceased their arms enlaced their eyes began seeking searching probing the blackness suddenly as though drawn by invisible hands they too stepped over the railing and silent as shadows were gone from the light  the stillness enclosed in the far inexorable roar of the town was alive with the myriad passions hopes and loves of multitudes of struggling human atoms for in spite of the disapproval of that great body of forsytes the municipal councilto whom love had long been considered next to the sewage question the gravest danger to the communitya process was going on that night in the park and in a hundred other parks without which the thousand factories churches shops taxes and drains of which they were custodians were as arteries without blood a man without a heart  the instincts of selfforgetfulness of passion and of love hiding under the trees away from the trustees of their remorseless enemy the sense of property were holding a stealthy revel and soames returning from bayswaterfor he had been alone to dine at timothyswalking home along the water with his mind upon that coming lawsuit had the blood driven from his heart by a low laugh and the sound of kisses he thought of writing to the times the next morning to draw the attention of the editor to the condition of our parks he did not however for he had a horror of seeing his name in print  but starved as he was the whispered sounds in the stillness the halfseen forms in the dark acted on him like some morbid stimulant he left the path along the water and stole under the trees along the deep shadow of little plantations where the boughs of chestnut trees hung their great leaves low and there was blacker refuge shaping his course in circles which had for their object a stealthy inspection of chairs side by side against treetrunks of enlaced lovers who stirred at his approach  now he stood still on the rise overlooking the serpentine where in full lamplight black against the silver water sat a couple who never moved the womans face buried on the mans necka single form like a carved emblem of passion silent and unashamed  and stung by the sight soames hurried on deeper into the shadow of the trees  in this search who knows what he thought and what he sought bread for hungerlight in darkness who knows what he expected to findimpersonal knowledge of the human heartthe end of his private subterranean tragedyfor again who knew but that each dark couple unnamed unnameable might not be he and she  but it could not be such knowledge as this that he was seekingthe wife of soames forsyte sitting in the park like a common wench such thoughts were inconceivable and from tree to tree with his noiseless step he passed  once he was sworn at once the whisper if only it could always be like this sent the blood flying again from his heart and he waited there patient and dogged for the two to move but it was only a poor thin slip of a shopgirl in her draggled blouse who passed him clinging to her lovers arm  a hundred other lovers too whispered that hope in the stillness of the trees a hundred other lovers clung to each other  but shaking himself with sudden disgust soames returned to the path and left that seeking for he knew not what     chapter iiimeeting at the botanical  young jolyon whose circumstances were not those of a forsyte found at times a difficulty in sparing the money needful for those country jaunts and researches into nature without having prosecuted which no watercolour artist ever puts brush to paper  he was frequently in fact obliged to take his colourbox into the botanical gardens and there on his stool in the shade of a monkeypuzzler or in the lee of some indiarubber plant he would spend long hours sketching  an art critic who had recently been looking at his work had delivered himself as follows  in a way your drawings are very good tone and colour in some of them certainly quite a feeling for nature but you see theyre so scattered youll never get the public to look at them now if youd taken a definite subject such as london by night or the crystal palace in the spring and made a regular series the public would have known at once what they were looking at i cant lay too much stress upon that all the men who are making great names in art like crum stone or bleeder are making them by avoiding the unexpected by specializing and putting their works all in the same pigeonhole so that the public know at once where to go and this stands to reason for if a mans a collector he doesnt want people to smell at the canvas to find out whom his pictures are by he wants them to be able to say at once a capital forsyte it is all the more important for you to be careful to choose a subject that they can lay hold of on the spot since theres no very marked originality in your style  young jolyon standing by the little piano where a bowl of dried rose leaves the only produce of the garden was deposited on a bit of faded damask listened with his dim smile  turning to his wife who was looking at the speaker with an angry expression on her thin face he said  you see dear  i do not she answered in her staccato voice that still had a little foreign accent your style has originality  the critic looked at her smiled deferentially and said no more like everyone else he knew their history  the words bore good fruit with young jolyon they were contrary to all that he believed in to all that he theoretically held good in his art but some strange deep instinct moved him against his will to turn them to profit  he discovered therefore one morning that an idea had come to him for making a series of watercolour drawings of london how the idea had arisen he could not tell and it was not till the following year when he had completed and sold them at a very fair price that in one of his impersonal moods he found himself able to recollect the art critic and to discover in his own achievement another proof that he was a forsyte  he decided to commence with the botanical gardens where he had already made so many studies and chose the little artificial pond sprinkled now with an autumn shower of red and yellow leaves for though the gardeners longed to sweep them off they could not reach them with their brooms the rest of the gardens they swept bare enough removing every morning natures rain of leaves piling them in heaps whence from slow fires rose the sweet acrid smoke that like the cuckoos note for spring the scent of lime trees for the summer is the true emblem of the fall the gardeners tidy souls could not abide the gold and green and russet pattern on the grass the gravel paths must lie unstained ordered methodical without knowledge of the realities of life nor of that slow and beautiful decay which flings crowns underfoot to star the earth with fallen glories whence as the cycle rolls will leap again wild spring  thus each leaf that fell was marked from the moment when it fluttered a goodbye and dropped slow turning from its twig  but on that little pond the leaves floated in peace and praised heaven with their hues the sunlight haunting over them  and so young jolyon found them  coming there one morning in the middle of october he was disconcerted to find a bench about twenty paces from his stand occupied for he had a proper horror of anyone seeing him at work  a lady in a velvet jacket was sitting there with her eyes fixed on the ground a flowering laurel however stood between and taking shelter behind this young jolyon prepared his easel  his preparations were leisurely he caught as every true artist should at anything that might delay for a moment the effort of his work and he found himself looking furtively at this unknown dame  like his father before him he had an eye for a face this face was charming  he saw a rounded chin nestling in a cream ruffle a delicate face with large dark eyes and soft lips a black picture hat concealed the hair her figure was lightly poised against the back of the bench her knees were crossed the tip of a patentleather shoe emerged beneath her skirt there was something indeed inexpressibly dainty about the person of this lady but young jolyons attention was chiefly riveted by the look on her face which reminded him of his wife it was as though its owner had come into contact with forces too strong for her it troubled him arousing vague feelings of attraction and chivalry who was she and what doing there alone  two young gentlemen of that peculiar breed at once forward and shy found in the regents park came by on their way to lawn tennis and he noted with disapproval their furtive stares of admiration a loitering gardener halted to do something unnecessary to a clump of pampas grass he too wanted an excuse for peeping a gentleman old and by his hat a professor of horticulture passed three times to scrutinize her long and stealthily a queer expression about his lips  with all these men young jolyon felt the same vague irritation she looked at none of them yet was he certain that every man who passed would look at her like that  her face was not the face of a sorceress who in every look holds out to men the offer of pleasure it had none of the devils beauty so highly prized among the first forsytes of the land neither was it of that type no less adorable associated with the box of chocolate it was not of the spiritually passionate or passionately spiritual order peculiar to housedecoration and modern poetry nor did it seem to promise to the playwright material for the production of the interesting and neurasthenic figure who commits suicide in the last act  in shape and colouring in its soft persuasive passivity its sensuous purity this womans face reminded him of titians heavenly love a reproduction of which hung over the sideboard in his diningroom and her attraction seemed to be in this soft passivity in the feeling she gave that to pressure she must yield  for what or whom was she waiting in the silence with the trees dropping here and there a leaf and the thrushes strutting close on grass touched with the sparkle of the autumn rime then her charming face grew eager and glancing round with almost a lovers jealousy young jolyon saw bosinney striding across the grass  curiously he watched the meeting the look in their eyes the long clasp of their hands they sat down close together linked for all their outward discretion he heard the rapid murmur of their talk but what they said he could not catch  he had rowed in the galley himself he knew the long hours of waiting and the lean minutes of a halfpublic meeting the tortures of suspense that haunt the unhallowed lover  it required however but a glance at their two faces to see that this was none of those affairs of a season that distract men and women about town none of those sudden appetites that wake up ravening and are surfeited and asleep again in six weeks this was the real thing this was what had happened to himself out of this anything might come  bosinney was pleading and she so quiet so soft yet immovable in her passivity sat looking over the grass  was he the man to carry her off that tender passive being who would never stir a step for herself who had given him all herself and would die for him but perhaps would never run away with him  it seemed to young jolyon that he could hear her saying but darling it would ruin you for he himself had experienced to the full the gnawing fear at the bottom of each womans heart that she is a drag on the man she loves  and he peeped at them no more but their soft rapid talk came to his ears with the stuttering song of some bird who seemed trying to remember the notes of spring joytragedy whichwhich  and gradually their talk ceased long silence followed  and where does soames come in young jolyon thought people think she is concerned about the sin of deceiving her husband little they know of women shes eating after starvationtaking her revenge and heaven help herfor hell take his  he heard the swish of silk and spying round the laurel saw them walking away their hands stealthily joined  at the end of july old jolyon had taken his granddaughter to the mountains and on that visit the last they ever paid june recovered to a great extent her health and spirits in the hotels filled with british forsytesfor old jolyon could not bear a set of germans as he called all foreignersshe was looked upon with respectthe only granddaughter of that finelooking and evidently wealthy old mr forsyte she did not mix freely with peopleto mix freely with people was not junes habitbut she formed some friendships and notably one in the rhone valley with a french girl who was dying of consumption  determining at once that her friend should not die she forgot in the institution of a campaign against death much of her own trouble  old jolyon watched the new intimacy with relief and disapproval for this additional proof that her life was to be passed amongst lame ducks worried him would she never make a friendship or take an interest in something that would be of real benefit to her  taking up with a parcel of foreigners he called it he often however brought home grapes or roses and presented them to mamzelle with an ingratiating twinkle  towards the end of september in spite of junes disapproval mademoiselle vigor breathed her last in the little hotel at st luc to which they had moved her and june took her defeat so deeply to heart that old jolyon carried her away to paris here in contemplation of the venus de milo and the madeleine she shook off her depression and when towards the middle of october they returned to town her grandfather believed that he had effected a cure  no sooner however had they established themselves in stanhope gate than he perceived to his dismay a return of her old absorbed and brooding manner she would sit staring in front of her her chin on her hand like a little norse spirit grim and intent while all around in the electric light then just installed shone the great drawingroom brocaded up to the frieze full of furniture from baple and pullbreds and in the huge gilt mirror were reflected those dresden china groups of young men in tight knee breeches at the feet of fullbosomed ladies nursing on their laps pet lambs which old jolyon had bought when he was a bachelor and thought so highly of in these days of degenerate taste he was a man of most open mind who more than any forsyte of them all had moved with the times but he could never forget that he had bought these groups at jobsons and given a lot of money for them he often said to june with a sort of disillusioned contempt  you dont care about them theyre not the gimcrack things you and your friends like but they cost me seventy pounds he was not a man who allowed his taste to be warped when he knew for solid reasons that it was sound  one of the first things that june did on getting home was to go round to timothys she persuaded herself that it was her duty to call there and cheer him with an account of all her travels but in reality she went because she knew of no other place where by some random speech or roundabout question she could glean news of bosinney  they received her most cordially and how was her dear grandfather he had not been to see them since may her uncle timothy was very poorly he had had a lot of trouble with the chimneysweep in his bedroom the stupid man had let the soot down the chimney it had quite upset her uncle  june sat there a long time dreading yet passionately hoping that they would speak of bosinney  but paralyzed by unaccountable discretion mrs septimus small let fall no word neither did she question june about him in desperation the girl asked at last whether soames and irene were in townshe had not yet been to see anyone  it was aunt hester who replied oh yes they were in town they had not been away at all there was some little difficulty about the house she believed june had heard no doubt she had better ask her aunt juley  june turned to mrs small who sat upright in her chair her hands clasped her face covered with innumerable pouts in answer to the girls look she maintained a strange silence and when she spoke it was to ask june whether she had worn nightsocks up in those high hotels where it must be so cold of a night  june answered that she had not she hated the stuffy things and rose to leave  mrs smalls infallibly chosen silence was far more ominous to her than anything that could have been said  before half an hour was over she had dragged the truth from mrs baynes in lowndes square that soames was bringing an action against bosinney over the decoration of the house  instead of disturbing her the news had a strangely calming effect as though she saw in the prospect of this struggle new hope for herself she learnt that the case was expected to come on in about a month and there seemed little or no prospect of bosinneys success  and whatever hell do i cant think said mrs baynes its very dreadful for him you knowhes got no moneyhes very hard up and we cant help him im sure im told the moneylenders wont lend if you have no security and he has nonenone at all  her embonpoint had increased of late she was in the full swing of autumn organization her writingtable literally strewn with the menus of charity functions she looked meaningly at june with her round eyes of parrotgrey  the sudden flush that rose on the girls intent young faceshe must have seen spring up before her a great hopethe sudden sweetness of her smile often came back to lady baynes in after years baynes was knighted when he built that public museum of art which has given so much employment to officials and so little pleasure to those working classes for whom it was designed  the memory of that change vivid and touching like the breaking open of a flower or the first sun after long winter the memory too of all that came after often intruded itself unaccountably inopportunely on lady baynes when her mind was set upon the most important things  this was the very afternoon of the day that young jolyon witnessed the meeting in the botanical gardens and on this day too old jolyon paid a visit to his solicitors forsyte bustard and forsyte in the poultry soames was not in he had gone down to somerset house bustard was buried up to the hilt in papers and that inaccessible apartment where he was judiciously placed in order that he might do as much work as possible but james was in the front office biting a finger and lugubriously turning over the pleadings in forsyte v bosinney  this sound lawyer had only a sort of luxurious dread of the nice point enough to set up a pleasurable feeling of fuss for his good practical sense told him that if he himself were on the bench he would not pay much attention to it but he was afraid that this bosinney would go bankrupt and soames would have to find the money after all and costs into the bargain and behind this tangible dread there was always that intangible trouble lurking in the background intricate dim scandalous like a bad dream and of which this action was but an outward and visible sign  he raised his head as old jolyon came in and muttered how are you jolyon havent seen you for an age youve been to switzerland they tell me this young bosinney hes got himself into a mess i knew how it would be he held out the papers regarding his elder brother with nervous gloom  old jolyon read them in silence and while he read them james looked at the floor biting his fingers the while  old jolyon pitched them down at last and they fell with a thump amongst a mass of affidavits in re buncombe deceased one of the many branches of that parent and profitable tree fryer v forsyte  i dont know what soames is about he said to make a fuss over a few hundred pounds i thought he was a man of property  james long upper lip twitched angrily he could not bear his son to be attacked in such a spot  its not the money he began but meeting his brothers glance direct shrewd judicial he stopped  there was a silence  ive come in for my will said old jolyon at last tugging at his moustache  james curiosity was roused at once perhaps nothing in this life was more stimulating to him than a will it was the supreme deal with property the final inventory of a mans belongings the last word on what he was worth he sounded the bell  bring in mr jolyons will he said to an anxious darkhaired clerk  you going to make some alterations and through his mind there flashed the thought now am i worth as much as he  old jolyon put the will in his breast pocket and james twisted his long legs regretfully  youve made some nice purchases lately they tell me he said  i dont know where you get your information from answered old jolyon sharply whens this action coming on next month i cant tell what youve got in your minds you must manage your own affairs but if you take my advice youll settle it out of court goodbye with a cold handshake he was gone  james his fixed greyblue eye corkscrewing round some secret anxious image began again to bite his finger  old jolyon took his will to the offices of the new colliery company and sat down in the empty board room to read it through he answered downbythestarn hemmings so tartly when the latter seeing his chairman seated there entered with the new superintendents first report that the secretary withdrew with regretful dignity and sending for the transfer clerk blew him up till the poor youth knew not where to look  it was notby georgeas he downbythestarn would have him know for a whippersnapper of a young fellow like him to come down to that office and think that he was god almighty he downbythestarn had been head of that office for more years than a boy like him could count and if he thought that when he had finished all his work he could sit there doing nothing he did not know him hemmings downbythestarn and so forth  on the other side of the green baize door old jolyon sat at the long mahoganyandleather board table his thick loosejointed tortoiseshell eyeglasses perched on the bridge of his nose his gold pencil moving down the clauses of his will  it was a simple affair for there were none of those vexatious little legacies and donations to charities which fritter away a mans possessions and damage the majestic effect of that little paragraph in the morning papers accorded to forsytes who die with a hundred thousand pounds  a simple affair just a bequest to his son of twenty thousand and as to the residue of my property of whatsoever kind whether realty or personalty or partaking of the nature of eitherupon trust to pay the proceeds rents annual produce dividends or interest thereof and thereon to my said granddaughter june forsyte or her assigns during her life to be for her sole use and benefit and without etc and from and after her death or decease upon trust to convey assign transfer or make over the said lastmentioned lands hereditaments premises trust moneys stocks funds investments and securities or such as shall then stand for and represent the same unto such person or persons whether one or more for such intents purposes and uses and generally in such manner way and form in all respects as the said june forsyte notwithstanding coverture shall by her last will and testament or any writing or writings in the nature of a will testament or testamentary disposition to be by her duly made signed and published direct appoint or make over give and dispose of the same and in default etc provided always and so on in seven folios of brief and simple phraseology  the will had been drawn by james in his palmy days he had foreseen almost every contingency  old jolyon sat a long time reading this will at last he took half a sheet of paper from the rack and made a prolonged pencil note then buttoning up the will he caused a cab to be called and drove to the offices of paramor and herring in lincolns inn fields jack herring was dead but his nephew was still in the firm and old jolyon was closeted with him for half an hour  he had kept the hansom and on coming out gave the driver the address3 wistaria avenue  he felt a strange slow satisfaction as though he had scored a victory over james and the man of property they should not poke their noses into his affairs any more he had just cancelled their trusteeships of his will he would take the whole of his business out of their hands and put it into the hands of young herring and he would move the business of his companies too if that young soames were such a man of property he would never miss a thousand a year or so and under his great white moustache old jolyon grimly smiled he felt that what he was doing was in the nature of retributive justice richly deserved  slowly surely with the secret inner process that works the destruction of an old tree the poison of the wounds to his happiness his will his pride had corroded the comely edifice of his philosophy life had worn him down on one side till like that family of which he was the head he had lost balance  to him borne northwards towards his sons house the thought of the new disposition of property which he had just set in motion appeared vaguely in the light of a stroke of punishment levelled at that family and that society of which james and his son seemed to him the representatives he had made a restitution to young jolyon and restitution to young jolyon satisfied his secret craving for revengerevenge against time sorrow and interference against all that incalculable sum of disapproval that had been bestowed by the world for fifteen years on his only son it presented itself as the one possible way of asserting once more the domination of his will of forcing james and soames and the family and all those hidden masses of forsytesa great stream rolling against the single dam of his obstinacyto recognise once and for all that he would be master it was sweet to think that at last he was going to make the boy a richer man by far than that son of james that man of property and it was sweet to give to jo for he loved his son  neither young jolyon nor his wife were in young jolyon indeed was not back from the botanical but the little maid told him that she expected the master at any moment  hes always at ome to tea sir to play with the children  old jolyon said he would wait and sat down patiently enough in the faded shabby drawing room where now that the summer chintzes were removed the old chairs and sofas revealed all their threadbare deficiencies he longed to send for the children to have them there beside him their supple bodies against his knees to hear jollys hallo gran and see his rush and feel hollys soft little hand stealing up against his cheek but he would not there was solemnity in what he had come to do and until it was over he would not play he amused himself by thinking how with two strokes of his pen he was going to restore the look of caste so conspicuously absent from everything in that little house how he could fill these rooms or others in some larger mansion with triumphs of art from baple and pullbreds how he could send little jolly to harrow and oxford he no longer had faith in eton and cambridge for his son had been there how he could procure little holly the best musical instruction the child had a remarkable aptitude  as these visions crowded before him causing emotion to swell his heart he rose and stood at the window looking down into the little walled strip of garden where the peartree bare of leaves before its time stood with gaunt branches in the slowgathering mist of the autumn afternoon the dog balthasar his tail curled tightly over a piebald furry back was walking at the farther end sniffing at the plants and at intervals placing his leg for support against the wall  and old jolyon mused  what pleasure was there left but to give it was pleasant to give when you could find one who would be thankful for what you gaveone of your own flesh and blood there was no such satisfaction to be had out of giving to those who did not belong to you to those who had no claim on you such giving as that was a betrayal of the individualistic convictions and actions of his life of all his enterprise his labour and his moderation of the great and proud fact that like tens of thousands of forsytes before him tens of thousands in the present tens of thousands in the future he had always made his own and held his own in the world  and while he stood there looking down on the smutcovered foliage of the laurels the blackstained grassplot the progress of the dog balthasar all the suffering of the fifteen years during which he had been baulked of legitimate enjoyment mingled its gall with the sweetness of the approaching moment  young jolyon came at last pleased with his work and fresh from long hours in the open air on hearing that his father was in the drawing room he inquired hurriedly whether mrs forsyte was at home and being informed that she was not heaved a sigh of relief then putting his painting materials carefully in the little coatcloset out of sight he went in  with characteristic decision old jolyon came at once to the point ive been altering my arrangements jo he said you can cut your coat a bit longer in the futureim settling a thousand a year on you at once june will have fifty thousand at my death and you the rest that dog of yours is spoiling the garden i shouldnt keep a dog if i were you  the dog balthasar seated in the centre of the lawn was examining his tail  young jolyon looked at the animal but saw him dimly for his eyes were misty  yours wont come short of a hundred thousand my boy said old jolyon i thought youd better know i havent much longer to live at my age i shant allude to it again hows your wife andgive her my love  young jolyon put his hand on his fathers shoulder and as neither spoke the episode closed  having seen his father into a hansom young jolyon came back to the drawingroom and stood where old jolyon had stood looking down on the little garden he tried to realize all that this meant to him and forsyte that he was vistas of property were opened out in his brain the years of half rations through which he had passed had not sapped his natural instincts in extremely practical form he thought of travel of his wifes costume the childrens education a pony for jolly a thousand things but in the midst of all he thought too of bosinney and his mistress and the broken song of the thrush joytragedy which which  the old pastthe poignant suffering passionate wonderful past that no money could buy that nothing could restore in all its burning sweetnesshad come back before him  when his wife came in he went straight up to her and took her in his arms and for a long time he stood without speaking his eyes closed pressing her to him while she looked at him with a wondering adoring doubting look in her eyes     chapter ivvoyage into the inferno  the morning after a certain night on which soames at last asserted his rights and acted like a man he breakfasted alone  he breakfasted by gaslight the fog of late november wrapping the town as in some monstrous blanket till the trees of the square even were barely visible from the diningroom window  he ate steadily but at times a sensation as though he could not swallow attacked him had he been right to yield to his overmastering hunger of the night before and break down the resistance which he had suffered now too long from this woman who was his lawful and solemnly constituted helpmate  he was strangely haunted by the recollection of her face from before which to soothe her he had tried to pull her handsof her terrible smothered sobbing the like of which he had never heard and still seemed to hear and he was still haunted by the odd intolerable feeling of remorse and shame he had felt as he stood looking at her by the flame of the single candle before silently slinking away  and somehow now that he had acted like this he was surprised at himself  two nights before at winifred darties he had taken mrs macander into dinner she had said to him looking in his face with her sharp greenish eyes and so your wife is a great friend of that mr bosinneys  not deigning to ask what she meant he had brooded over her words  they had roused in him a fierce jealousy which with the peculiar perversion of this instinct had turned to fiercer desire  without the incentive of mrs macanders words he might never have done what he had done without their incentive and the accident of finding his wifes door for once unlocked which had enabled him to steal upon her asleep  slumber had removed his doubts but the morning brought them again one thought comforted him no one would knowit was not the sort of thing that she would speak about  and indeed when the vehicle of his daily business life which needed so imperatively the grease of clear and practical thought started rolling once more with the reading of his letters those nightmarelike doubts began to assume less extravagant importance at the back of his mind the incident was really not of great moment women made a fuss about it in books but in the cool judgment of rightthinking men of men of the world of such as he recollected often received praise in the divorce court he had but done his best to sustain the sanctity of marriage to prevent her from abandoning her duty possibly if she were still seeing bosinney from  no he did not regret it  now that the first step towards reconciliation had been taken the rest would be comparativelycomparatively  he rose and walked to the window his nerve had been shaken the sound of smothered sobbing was in his ears again he could not get rid of it  he put on his fur coat and went out into the fog having to go into the city he took the underground railway from sloane square station  in his corner of the firstclass compartment filled with city men the smothered sobbing still haunted him so he opened the times with the rich crackle that drowns all lesser sounds and barricaded behind it set himself steadily to con the news  he read that a recorder had charged a grand jury on the previous day with a more than usually long list of offences he read of three murders five manslaughters seven arsons and as many as eleven rapesa surprisingly high numberin addition to many less conspicuous crimes to be tried during a coming sessions and from one piece of news he went on to another keeping the paper well before his face  and still inseparable from his reading was the memory of irenes tearstained face and the sounds from her broken heart  the day was a busy one including in addition to the ordinary affairs of his practice a visit to his brokers messrs grin and grinning to give them instructions to sell his shares in the new colliery co ltd whose business he suspected rather than knew was stagnating this enterprise afterwards slowly declined and was ultimately sold for a song to an american syndicate and a long conference at waterbuck qcs chambers attended by boulter by fiske the junior counsel and waterbuck qc himself  the case of forsyte v bosinney was expected to be reached on the morrow before mr justice bentham  mr justice bentham a man of commonsense rather than too great legal knowledge was considered to be about the best man they could have to try the action he was a strong judge  waterbuck qc in pleasing conjunction with an almost rude neglect of boulter and fiske paid to soames a good deal of attention by instinct or the sounder evidence of rumour feeling him to be a man of property  he held with remarkable consistency to the opinion he had already expressed in writing that the issue would depend to a great extent on the evidence given at the trial and in a few well directed remarks he advised soames not to be too careful in giving that evidence a little bluffness mr forsyte he said a little bluffness and after he had spoken he laughed firmly closed his lips tight and scratched his head just below where he had pushed his wig back for all the world like the gentlemanfarmer for whom he loved to be taken he was considered perhaps the leading man in breach of promise cases  soames used the underground again in going home  the fog was worse than ever at sloane square station through the still thick blur men groped in and out women very few grasped their reticules to their bosoms and handkerchiefs to their mouths crowned with the weird excrescence of the driver haloed by a vague glow of lamplight that seemed to drown in vapour before it reached the pavement cabs loomed dimshaped ever and again and discharged citizens bolting like rabbits to their burrows  and these shadowy figures wrapped each in his own little shroud of fog took no notice of each other in the great warren each rabbit for himself especially those clothed in the more expensive fur who afraid of carriages on foggy days are driven underground  one figure however not far from soames waited at the station door  some buccaneer or lover of whom each forsyte thought poor devil looks as if he were having a bad time their kind hearts beat a stroke faster for that poor waiting anxious lover in the fog but they hurried by well knowing that they had neither time nor money to spare for any suffering but their own  only a policeman patrolling slowly and at intervals took an interest in that waiting figure the brim of whose slouch hat half hid a face reddened by the cold all thin and haggard over which a hand stole now and again to smooth away anxiety or renew the resolution that kept him waiting there but the waiting lover if lover he were was used to policemens scrutiny or too absorbed in his anxiety for he never flinched a hardened case accustomed to long trysts to anxiety and fog and cold if only his mistress came at last foolish lover fogs last until the spring there is also snow and rain no comfort anywhere gnawing fear if you bring her out gnawing fear if you bid her stay at home  serve him right he should arrange his affairs better  so any respectable forsyte yet if that sounder citizen could have listened at the waiting lovers heart out there in the fog and the cold he would have said again yes poor devil hes having a bad time  soames got into his cab and with the glass down crept along sloane street and so along the brompton road and home he reached his house at five  his wife was not in she had gone out a quarter of an hour before out at such a time of night into this terrible fog what was the meaning of that  he sat by the diningroom fire with the door open disturbed to the soul trying to read the evening paper a book was no goodin daily papers alone was any narcotic to such worry as his from the customary events recorded in the journal he drew some comfort suicide of an actressgrave indisposition of a statesman that chronic suffererdivorce of an army officerfire in a collieryhe read them all they helped him a littleprescribed by the greatest of all doctors our natural taste  it was nearly seven when he heard her come in  the incident of the night before had long lost its importance under stress of anxiety at her strange sortie into the fog but now that irene was home the memory of her brokenhearted sobbing came back to him and he felt nervous at the thought of facing her  she was already on the stairs her grey fur coat hung to her knees its high collar almost hid her face she wore a thick veil  she neither turned to look at him nor spoke no ghost or stranger could have passed more silently  bilson came to lay dinner and told him that mrs forsyte was not coming down she was having the soup in her room  for once soames did not change it was perhaps the first time in his life that he had sat down to dinner with soiled cuffs and not even noticing them he brooded long over his wine he sent bilson to light a fire in his pictureroom and presently went up there himself  turning on the gas he heaved a deep sigh as though amongst these treasures the backs of which confronted him in stacks around the little room he had found at length his peace of mind he went straight up to the greatest treasure of them all an undoubted turner and carrying it to the easel turned its face to the light there had been a movement in turners but he had not been able to make up his mind to part with it he stood for a long time his pale cleanshaven face poked forward above his standup collar looking at the picture as though he were adding it up a wistful expression came into his eyes he found perhaps that it came to too little he took it down from the easel to put it back against the wall but in crossing the room stopped for he seemed to hear sobbing  it was nothingonly the sort of thing that had been bothering him in the morning and soon after putting the high guard before the blazing fire he stole downstairs  fresh for the morrow was his thought it was long before he went to sleep  it is now to george forsyte that the mind must turn for light on the events of that fogengulfed afternoon  the wittiest and most sportsmanlike of the forsytes had passed the day reading a novel in the paternal mansion at princes gardens since a recent crisis in his financial affairs he had been kept on parole by roger and compelled to reside at home  towards five oclock he went out and took train at south kensington station for everyone today went underground his intention was to dine and pass the evening playing billiards at the red pottlethat unique hostel neither club hotel nor good gilt restaurant  he got out at charing cross choosing it in preference to his more usual st jamess park that he might reach jermyn street by better lighted ways  on the platform his eyesfor in combination with a composed and fashionable appearance george had sharp eyes and was always on the lookout for fillips to his sardonic humourhis eyes were attracted by a man who leaping from a firstclass compartment staggered rather than walked towards the exit  so ho my bird said george to himself why its the buccaneer and he put his big figure on the trail nothing afforded him greater amusement than a drunken man  bosinney who wore a slouch hat stopped in front of him spun around and rushed back towards the carriage he had just left he was too late a porter caught him by the coat the train was already moving on  georges practised glance caught sight of the face of a lady clad in a grey fur coat at the carriage window it was mrs soamesand george felt that this was interesting  and now he followed bosinney more closely than everup the stairs past the ticket collector into the street in that progress however his feelings underwent a change no longer merely curious and amused he felt sorry for the poor fellow he was shadowing the buccaneer was not drunk but seemed to be acting under the stress of violent emotion he was talking to himself and all that george could catch were the words oh god nor did he appear to know what he was doing or where going but stared hesitated moved like a man out of his mind and from being merely a joker in search of amusement george felt that he must see the poor chap through  he had taken the knocktaken the knock and he wondered what on earth mrs soames had been saying what on earth she had been telling him in the railway carriage she had looked bad enough herself it made george sorry to think of her travelling on with her trouble all alone  he followed close behind bosinneys elbowtall burly figure saying nothing dodging warilyand shadowed him out into the fog  there was something here beyond a jest he kept his head admirably in spite of some excitement for in addition to compassion the instincts of the chase were roused within him  bosinney walked right out into the thoroughfarea vast muffled blackness where a man could not see six paces before him where all around voices or whistles mocked the sense of direction and sudden shapes came rolling slow upon them and now and then a light showed like a dim island in an infinite dark sea  and fast into this perilous gulf of night walked bosinney and fast after him walked george if the fellow meant to put his twopenny under a bus he would stop it if he could across the street and back the hunted creature strode not groping as other men were groping in that gloom but driven forward as though the faithful george behind wielded a knout and this chase after a haunted man began to have for george the strangest fascination  but it was now that the affair developed in a way which ever afterwards caused it to remain green in his mind brought to a standstill in the fog he heard words which threw a sudden light on these proceedings what mrs soames had said to bosinney in the train was now no longer dark george understood from those mutterings that soames had exercised his rights over an estranged and unwilling wife in the greatestthe supreme act of property  his fancy wandered in the fields of this situation it impressed him he guessed something of the anguish the sexual confusion and horror in bosinneys heart and he thought yes its a bit thick i dont wonder the poor fellow is halfcracked  he had run his quarry to earth on a bench under one of the lions in trafalgar square a monster sphynx astray like themselves in that gulf of darkness here rigid and silent sat bosinney and george in whose patience was a touch of strange brotherliness took his stand behind he was not lacking in a certain delicacya sense of formthat did not permit him to intrude upon this tragedy and he waited quiet as the lion above his fur collar hitched above his ears concealing the fleshy redness of his cheeks concealing all but his eyes with their sardonic compassionate stare and men kept passing back from business on the way to their clubsmen whose figures shrouded in cocoons of fog came into view like spectres and like spectres vanished then even in his compassion georges quilpish humour broke forth in a sudden longing to pluck these spectres by the sleeve and say  hi you johnnies you dont often see a show like this heres a poor devil whose mistress has just been telling him a pretty little story of her husband walk up walk up hes taken the knock you see  in fancy he saw them gaping round the tortured lover and grinned as he thought of some respectable newlymarried spectre enabled by the state of his own affections to catch an inkling of what was going on within bosinney he fancied he could see his mouth getting wider and wider and the fog going down and down for in george was all that contempt of the middleclass—especially of the married middleclass—peculiar to the wild and sportsmanlike spirits in its ranks  but he began to be bored waiting was not what he had bargained for  after all he thought the poor chap will get over it not the first time such a thing has happened in this little city but now his quarry again began muttering words of violent hate and anger and following a sudden impulse george touched him on the shoulder  bosinney spun round  who are you what do you want  george could have stood it well enough in the light of the gas lamps in the light of that everyday world of which he was so hardy a connoisseur but in this fog where all was gloomy and unreal where nothing had that matteroffact value associated by forsytes with earth he was a victim to strange qualms and as he tried to stare back into the eyes of this maniac he thought  if i see a bobby ill hand him over hes not fit to be at large  but waiting for no answer bosinney strode off into the fog and george followed keeping perhaps a little further off yet more than ever set on tracking him down  he cant go on long like this he thought its gods own miracle hes not been run over already he brooded no more on policemen a sportsmans sacred fire alive again within him  into a denser gloom than ever bosinney held on at a furious pace but his pursuer perceived more method in his madnesshe was clearly making his way westwards  hes really going for soames thought george the idea was attractive it would be a sporting end to such a chase he had always disliked his cousin  the shaft of a passing cab brushed against his shoulder and made him leap aside he did not intend to be killed for the buccaneer or anyone yet with hereditary tenacity he stuck to the trail through vapour that blotted out everything but the shadow of the hunted man and the dim moon of the nearest lamp  then suddenly with the instinct of a townstroller george knew himself to be in piccadilly here he could find his way blindfold and freed from the strain of geographical uncertainty his mind returned to bosinneys trouble  down the long avenue of his manabouttown experience bursting as it were through a smirch of doubtful amours there stalked to him a memory of his youth a memory poignant still that brought the scent of hay the gleam of moonlight a summer magic into the reek and blackness of this london fogthe memory of a night when in the darkest shadow of a lawn he had overheard from a womans lips that he was not her sole possessor and for a moment george walked no longer in black piccadilly but lay again with hell in his heart and his face to the sweetsmelling dewy grass in the long shadow of poplars that hid the moon  a longing seized him to throw his arm round the buccaneer and say come old boy time cures all lets go and drink it off  but a voice yelled at him and he started back a cab rolled out of blackness and into blackness disappeared and suddenly george perceived that he had lost bosinney he ran forward and back felt his heart clutched by a sickening fear the dark fear which lives in the wings of the fog perspiration started out on his brow he stood quite still listening with all his might  and then as he confided to dartie the same evening in the course of a game of billiards at the red pottle i lost him  dartie twirled complacently at his dark moustache he had just put together a neat break of twentythreefailing at a jenny and who was she he asked  george looked slowly at the man of the worlds fattish sallow face and a little grim smile lurked about the curves of his cheeks and his heavylidded eyes  no no my fine fellow he thought im not going to tell you for though he mixed with dartie a good deal he thought him a bit of a cad  oh some little lovelady or other he said and chalked his cue  a lovelady exclaimed dartiehe used a more figurative expression i made sure it was our friend soa  did you said george curtly then damme youve made an error  he missed his shot he was careful not to allude to the subject again till towards eleven oclock having in his poetic phraseology looked upon the drink when it was yellow he drew aside the blind and gazed out into the street the murky blackness of the fog was but faintly broken by the lamps of the red pottle and no shape of mortal man or thing was in sight  i cant help thinking of that poor buccaneer he said he may be wandering out there now in that fog if hes not a corpse he added with strange dejection  corpse said dartie in whom the recollection of his defeat at richmond flared up hes all right ten to one if he wasnt tight  george turned on him looking really formidable with a sort of savage gloom on his big face  dry up he said dont i tell you hes taken the knock     chapter vthe trial  in the morning of his case which was second in the list soames was again obliged to start without seeing irene and it was just as well for he had not as yet made up his mind what attitude to adopt towards her  he had been requested to be in court by halfpast ten to provide against the event of the first action a breach of promise collapsing which however it did not both sides showing a courage that afforded waterbuck qc an opportunity for improving his already great reputation in this class of case he was opposed by ram the other celebrated breach of promise man it was a battle of giants  the court delivered judgment just before the luncheon interval the jury left the box for good and soames went out to get something to eat he met james standing at the little luncheonbar like a pelican in the wilderness of the galleries bent over a sandwich with a glass of sherry before him the spacious emptiness of the great central hall over which father and son brooded as they stood together was marred now and then for a fleeting moment by barristers in wig and gown hurriedly bolting across by an occasional old lady or rustycoated man looking up in a frightened way and by two persons bolder than their generation seated in an embrasure arguing the sound of their voices arose together with a scent as of neglected wells which mingling with the odour of the galleries combined to form the savour like nothing but the emanation of a refined cheese so indissolubly connected with the administration of british justice  it was not long before james addressed his son  whens your case coming on i suppose itll be on directly i shouldnt wonder if this bosinneyd say anything i should think hed have to hell go bankrupt if it goes against him he took a large bite at his sandwich and a mouthful of sherry your mother he said wants you and irene to come and dine tonight  a chill smile played round soames lips he looked back at his father anyone who had seen the look cold and furtive thus interchanged might have been pardoned for not appreciating the real understanding between them james finished his sherry at a draught  how much he asked  on returning to the court soames took at once his rightful seat on the front bench beside his solicitor he ascertained where his father was seated with a glance so sidelong as to commit nobody  james sitting back with his hands clasped over the handle of his umbrella was brooding on the end of the bench immediately behind counsel whence he could get away at once when the case was over he considered bosinneys conduct in every way outrageous but he did not wish to run up against him feeling that the meeting would be awkward  next to the divorce court this court was perhaps the favourite emporium of justice libel breach of promise and other commercial actions being frequently decided there quite a sprinkling of persons unconnected with the law occupied the back benches and the hat of a woman or two could be seen in the gallery  the two rows of seats immediately in front of james were gradually filled by barristers in wigs who sat down to make pencil notes chat and attend to their teeth but his interest was soon diverted from these lesser lights of justice by the entrance of waterbuck qc with the wings of his silk gown rustling and his red capable face supported by two short brown whiskers the famous qc looked as james freely admitted the very picture of a man who could heckle a witness  for all his experience it so happened that he had never seen waterbuck qc before and like many forsytes in the lower branch of the profession he had an extreme admiration for a good crossexaminer the long lugubrious folds in his cheeks relaxed somewhat after seeing him especially as he now perceived that soames alone was represented by silk  waterbuck qc had barely screwed round on his elbow to chat with his junior before mr justice bentham himself appeareda thin rather henlike man with a little stoop cleanshaven under his snowy wig like all the rest of the court waterbuck rose and remained on his feet until the judge was seated james rose but slightly he was already comfortable and had no opinion of bentham having sat next but one to him at dinner twice at the bumley tomms bumley tomm was rather a poor thing though he had been so successful james himself had given him his first brief he was excited too for he had just found out that bosinney was not in court  now whats he mean by that he kept on thinking  the case having been called on waterbuck qc pushing back his papers hitched his gown on his shoulder and with a semicircular look around him like a man who is going to bat arose and addressed the court  the facts he said were not in dispute and all that his lordship would be asked was to interpret the correspondence which had taken place between his client and the defendant an architect with reference to the decoration of a house he would however submit that this correspondence could only mean one very plain thing after briefly reciting the history of the house at robin hill which he described as a mansion and the actual facts of expenditure he went on as follows  my client mr soames forsyte is a gentleman a man of property who would be the last to dispute any legitimate claim that might be made against him but he has met with such treatment from his architect in the matter of this house over which he has as your lordship has heard already spent some twelvesome twelve thousand pounds a sum considerably in advance of the amount he had originally contemplated that as a matter of principleand this i cannot too strongly emphasizeas a matter of principle and in the interests of others he has felt himself compelled to bring this action the point put forward in defence by the architect i will suggest to your lordship is not worthy of a moments serious consideration he then read the correspondence  his client a man of recognised position was prepared to go into the box and to swear that he never did authorize that it was never in his mind to authorize the expenditure of any money beyond the extreme limit of twelve thousand and fifty pounds which he had clearly fixed and not further to waste the time of the court he would at once call mr forsyte  soames then went into the box his whole appearance was striking in its composure his face just supercilious enough pale and cleanshaven with a little line between the eyes and compressed lips his dress in unostentatious order one hand neatly gloved the other bare he answered the questions put to him in a somewhat low but distinct voice his evidence under crossexamination savoured of taciturnity  had he not used the expression a free hand no  come come  the expression he had used was a free hand in the terms of this correspondence  would you tell the court that that was english  yes  what do you say it means  what it says  are you prepared to deny that it is a contradiction in terms  yes  you are not an irishman  no  are you a welleducated man  yes  and yet you persist in that statement  yes  throughout this and much more crossexamination which turned again and again around the nice point james sat with his hand behind his ear his eyes fixed upon his son  he was proud of him he could not but feel that in similar circumstances he himself would have been tempted to enlarge his replies but his instinct told him that this taciturnity was the very thing he sighed with relief however when soames slowly turning and without any change of expression descended from the box  when it came to the turn of bosinneys counsel to address the judge james redoubled his attention and he searched the court again and again to see if bosinney were not somewhere concealed  young chankery began nervously he was placed by bosinneys absence in an awkward position he therefore did his best to turn that absence to account  he could not but fearhe saidthat his client had met with an accident he had fully expected him there to give evidence they had sent round that morning both to mr bosinneys office and to his rooms though he knew they were one and the same he thought it was as well not to say so but it was not known where he was and this he considered to be ominous knowing how anxious mr bosinney had been to give his evidence he had not however been instructed to apply for an adjournment and in default of such instruction he conceived it his duty to go on the plea on which he somewhat confidently relied and which his client had he not unfortunately been prevented in some way from attending would have supported by his evidence was that such an expression as a free hand could not be limited fettered and rendered unmeaning by any verbiage which might follow it he would go further and say that the correspondence showed that whatever he might have said in his evidence mr forsyte had in fact never contemplated repudiating liability on any of the work ordered or executed by his architect the defendant had certainly never contemplated such a contingency or as was demonstrated by his letters he would never have proceeded with the worka work of extreme delicacy carried out with great care and efficiency to meet and satisfy the fastidious taste of a connoisseur a rich man a man of property he felt strongly on this point and feeling strongly he used perhaps rather strong words when he said that this action was of a most unjustifiable unexpected indeedunprecedented character if his lordship had had the opportunity that he himself had made it his duty to take to go over this very fine house and see the great delicacy and beauty of the decorations executed by his clientan artist in his most honourable professionhe felt convinced that not for one moment would his lordship tolerate this he would use no stronger word than daring attempt to evade legitimate responsibility  taking the text of soames letters he lightly touched on boileau v the blasted cement company limited it is doubtful he said what that authority has decided in any case i would submit that it is just as much in my favour as in my friends he then argued the nice point closely with all due deference he submitted that mr forsytes expression nullified itself his client not being a rich man the matter was a serious one for him he was a very talented architect whose professional reputation was undoubtedly somewhat at stake he concluded with a perhaps too personal appeal to the judge as a lover of the arts to show himself the protector of artists from what was occasionallyhe said occasionallythe too iron hand of capital what he said will be the position of the artistic professions if men of property like this mr forsyte refuse and are allowed to refuse to carry out the obligations of the commissions which they have given he would now call his client in case he should at the last moment have found himself able to be present  the name philip baynes bosinney was called three times by the ushers and the sound of the calling echoed with strange melancholy throughout the court and galleries  the crying of this name to which no answer was returned had upon james a curious effect it was like calling for your lost dog about the streets and the creepy feeling that it gave him of a man missing grated on his sense of comfort and securityon his cosiness though he could not have said why it made him feel uneasy  he looked now at the clocka quarter to three it would be all over in a quarter of an hour where could the young fellow be  it was only when mr justice bentham delivered judgment that he got over the turn he had received  behind the wooden erection by which he was fenced from more ordinary mortals the learned judge leaned forward the electric light just turned on above his head fell on his face and mellowed it to an orange hue beneath the snowy crown of his wig the amplitude of his robes grew before the eye his whole figure facing the comparative dusk of the court radiated like some majestic and sacred body he cleared his throat took a sip of water broke the nib of a quill against the desk and folding his bony hands before him began  to james he suddenly loomed much larger than he had ever thought bentham would loom it was the majesty of the law and a person endowed with a nature far less matteroffact than that of james might have been excused for failing to pierce this halo and disinter therefrom the somewhat ordinary forsyte who walked and talked in everyday life under the name of sir walter bentham  he delivered judgment in the following words  the facts in this case are not in dispute on may 15 last the defendant wrote to the plaintiff requesting to be allowed to withdraw from his professional position in regard to the decoration of the plaintiffs house unless he were given a free hand the plaintiff on may 17 wrote back as follows in giving you in accordance with your request this free hand i wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated inclusive of your fee as arranged between us must not exceed twelve thousand pounds to this letter the defendant replied on may 18 if you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration i can bind myself to the exact pound i am afraid you are mistaken on may 19 the plaintiff wrote as follows i did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty between us you have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence and i hope you will see your way to completing the decorations on may 20 the defendant replied thus shortly very well  in completing these decorations the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff this action has been brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds expended by him in excess of a sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds alleged by the plaintiff to have been fixed by this correspondence as the maximum sum that the defendant had authority to expend  the question for me to decide is whether or no the defendant is liable to refund to the plaintiff this sum in my judgment he is so liable  what in effect the plaintiff has said is this i give you a free hand to complete these decorations provided that you keep within a total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds if you exceed that sum by as much as fifty pounds i will not hold you responsible beyond that point you are no agent of mine and i shall repudiate liability it is not quite clear to me whether had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agents contracts he would under all the circumstances have been successful in so doing but he has not adopted this course he has accepted liability and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latters engagement  in my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from the defendant  it has been sought on behalf of the defendant to show that no limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this correspondence if this were so i can find no reason for the plaintiffs importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds the defendants contention would render these figures meaningless it is manifest to me that by his letter of may 20 he assented to a very clear proposition by the terms of which he must be held to be bound  for these reasons there will be judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed with costs  james sighed and stooping picked up his umbrella which had fallen with a rattle at the words importation into this correspondence  untangling his legs he rapidly left the court without waiting for his son he snapped up a hansom cab it was a clear grey afternoon and drove straight to timothys where he found swithin and to him mrs septimus small and aunt hester he recounted the whole proceedings eating two muffins not altogether in the intervals of speech  soames did very well he ended hes got his head screwed on the right way this wont please jolyon its a bad business for that young bosinney hell go bankrupt i shouldnt wonder and then after a long pause during which he had stared disquietly into the fire he added  he wasnt therenow why  there was a sound of footsteps the figure of a thickset man with the ruddy brown face of robust health was seen in the back drawingroom the forefinger of his upraised hand was outlined against the black of his frock coat he spoke in a grudging voice  well james he said i canti cant stop and turning round he walked out  it was timothy  james rose from his chair there he said there i knew there was something wro he checked himself and was silent staring before him as though he had seen a portent     chapter visoames breaks the news  in leaving the court soames did not go straight home he felt disinclined for the city and drawn by need for sympathy in his triumph he too made his way but slowly and on foot to timothys in the bayswater road  his father had just left mrs small and aunt hester in possession of the whole story greeted him warmly they were sure he was hungry after all that evidence smither should toast him some more muffins his dear father had eaten them all he must put his legs up on the sofa and he must have a glass of prune brandy too it was so strengthening  swithin was still present having lingered later than his wont for he felt in want of exercise on hearing this suggestion he pished a pretty pass young men were coming to his own liver was out of order and he could not bear the thought of anyone else drinking prune brandy  he went away almost immediately saying to soames and hows your wife you tell her from me that if shes dull and likes to come and dine with me quietly ill give her such a bottle of champagne as she doesnt get every day staring down from his height on soames he contracted his thick puffy yellow hand as though squeezing within it all this small fry and throwing out his chest he waddled slowly away  mrs small and aunt hester were left horrified swithin was so droll  they themselves were longing to ask soames how irene would take the result yet knew that they must not he would perhaps say something of his own accord to throw some light on this the present burning question in their lives the question that from necessity of silence tortured them almost beyond bearing for even timothy had now been told and the effect on his health was little short of alarming and what too would june do this also was a most exciting if dangerous speculation  they had never forgotten old jolyons visit since when he had not once been to see them they had never forgotten the feeling it gave all who were present that the family was no longer what it had beenthat the family was breaking up  but soames gave them no help sitting with his knees crossed talking of the barbizon school of painters whom he had just discovered these were the coming men he said he should not wonder if a lot of money were made over them he had his eye on two pictures by a man called corot charming things if he could get them at a reasonable price he was going to buy themthey would he thought fetch a big price some day  interested as they could not but be neither mrs septimus small nor aunt hester could entirely acquiesce in being thus put off  it was interestingmost interestingand then soames was so clever that they were sure he would do something with those pictures if anybody could but what was his plan now that he had won his case was he going to leave london at once and live in the country or what was he going to do  soames answered that he did not know he thought they should be moving soon he rose and kissed his aunts  no sooner had aunt juley received this emblem of departure than a change came over her as though she were being visited by dreadful courage every little roll of flesh on her face seemed trying to escape from an invisible confining mask  she rose to the full extent of her more than medium height and said it has been on my mind a long time dear and if nobody else will tell you i have made up my mind that  aunt hester interrupted her mind julia you do it she gaspedon your own responsibility  mrs small went on as though she had not heard i think you ought to know dear that mrs macander saw irene walking in richmond park with mr bosinney  aunt hester who had also risen sank back in her chair and turned her face away really juley was tooshe should not do such things when sheaunt hester was in the room and breathless with anticipation she waited for what soames would answer  he had flushed the peculiar flush which always centred between his eyes lifting his hand and as it were selecting a finger he bit a nail delicately then drawling it out between set lips he said mrs macander is a cat  without waiting for any reply he left the room  when he went into timothys he had made up his mind what course to pursue on getting home he would go up to irene and say  well ive won my case and theres an end of it i dont want to be hard on bosinney ill see if we cant come to some arrangement he shant be pressed and now lets turn over a new leaf well let the house and get out of these fogs well go down to robin hill at once ii never meant to be rough with you lets shake handsand perhaps she would let him kiss her and forget  when he came out of timothys his intentions were no longer so simple the smouldering jealousy and suspicion of months blazed up within him he would put an end to that sort of thing once and for all he would not have her drag his name in the dirt if she could not or would not love him as was her duty and his rightshe should not play him tricks with anyone else he would tax her with it threaten to divorce her that would make her behave she would never face that butbutwhat if she did he was staggered this had not occurred to him  what if she did what if she made him a confession how would he stand then he would have to bring a divorce  a divorce thus close the word was paralyzing so utterly at variance with all the principles that had hitherto guided his life its lack of compromise appalled him he feltlike the captain of a ship going to the side of his vessel and with his own hands throwing over the most precious of his bales this jettisoning of his property with his own hand seemed uncanny to soames it would injure him in his profession he would have to get rid of the house at robin hill on which he had spent so much money so much anticipationand at a sacrifice and she she would no longer belong to him not even in name she would pass out of his life and hehe should never see her again  he traversed in the cab the length of a street without getting beyond the thought that he should never see her again  but perhaps there was nothing to confess even now very likely there was nothing to confess was it wise to push things so far was it wise to put himself into a position where he might have to eat his words the result of this case would ruin bosinney a ruined man was desperate butwhat could he do he might go abroad ruined men always went abroad what could they doif indeed it was theywithout money it would be better to wait and see how things turned out if necessary he could have her watched the agony of his jealousy for all the world like the crisis of an aching tooth came on again and he almost cried out but he must decide fix on some course of action before he got home when the cab drew up at the door he had decided nothing  he entered pale his hands moist with perspiration dreading to meet her burning to meet her ignorant of what he was to say or do  the maid bilson was in the hall and in answer to his question where is your mistress told him that mrs forsyte had left the house about noon taking with her a trunk and bag  snatching the sleeve of his fur coat away from her grasp he confronted her  what he exclaimed whats that you said suddenly recollecting that he must not betray emotion he added what message did she leave and noticed with secret terror the startled look of the maids eyes  mrs forsyte left no message sir  no message very well thank you that will do i shall be dining out  the maid went downstairs leaving him still in his fur coat idly turning over the visiting cards in the porcelain bowl that stood on the carved oak rug chest in the hall  mr and mrs bareham culcher mrs septimus small mrs baynes mr solomon thornworthy lady bellis miss hermione bellis miss winifred bellis miss ella bellis  who the devil were all these people he seemed to have forgotten all familiar things the words no messagea trunk and a bag played a hideandseek in his brain it was incredible that she had left no message and still in his fur coat he ran upstairs two steps at a time as a young married man when he comes home will run up to his wifes room  everything was dainty fresh sweetsmelling everything in perfect order on the great bed with its lilac silk quilt was the bag she had made and embroidered with her own hands to hold her sleeping things her slippers ready at the foot the sheets even turned over at the head as though expecting her  on the table stood the silvermounted brushes and bottles from her dressing bag his own present there must then be some mistake what bag had she taken he went to the bell to summon bilson but remembered in time that he must assume knowledge of where irene had gone take it all as a matter of course and grope out the meaning for himself  he locked the doors and tried to think but felt his brain going round and suddenly tears forced themselves into his eyes  hurriedly pulling off his coat he looked at himself in the mirror  he was too pale a greyish tinge all over his face he poured out water and began feverishly washing  her silvermounted brushes smelt faintly of the perfumed lotion she used for her hair and at this scent the burning sickness of his jealousy seized him again  struggling into his fur he ran downstairs and out into the street  he had not lost all command of himself however and as he went down sloane street he framed a story for use in case he should not find her at bosinneys but if he should his power of decision again failed he reached the house without knowing what he should do if he did find her there  it was after office hours and the street door was closed the woman who opened it could not say whether mr bosinney were in or no she had not seen him that day not for two or three days she did not attend to him now nobody attended to him he  soames interrupted her he would go up and see for himself he went up with a dogged white face  the top floor was unlighted the door closed no one answered his ringing he could hear no sound he was obliged to descend shivering under his fur a chill at his heart hailing a cab he told the man to drive to park lane  on the way he tried to recollect when he had last given her a cheque she could not have more than three or four pounds but there were her jewels and with exquisite torture he remembered how much money she could raise on these enough to take them abroad enough for them to live on for months he tried to calculate the cab stopped and he got out with the calculation unmade  the butler asked whether mrs soames was in the cab the master had told him they were both expected to dinner  soames answered no mrs forsyte has a cold  the butler was sorry  soames thought he was looking at him inquisitively and remembering that he was not in dress clothes asked anybody here to dinner warmson  nobody but mr and mrs dartie sir  again it seemed to soames that the butler was looking curiously at him his composure gave way  what are you looking at he said whats the matter with me eh  the butler blushed hung up the fur coat murmured something that sounded like nothing sir im sure sir and stealthily withdrew  soames walked upstairs passing the drawingroom without a look he went straight up to his mothers and fathers bedroom  james standing sideways the concave lines of his tall lean figure displayed to advantage in shirtsleeves and evening waistcoat his head bent the end of his white tie peeping askew from underneath one white dundreary whisker his eyes peering with intense concentration his lips pouting was hooking the top hooks of his wifes bodice soames stopped he felt halfchoked whether because he had come upstairs too fast or for some other reason hehe himself had nevernever been asked to  he heard his fathers voice as though there were a pin in his mouth saying whos that whos there what dyou want his mothers here felice come and hook this your masterll never get done  he put his hand up to his throat and said hoarsely  its isoames  he noticed gratefully the affectionate surprise in emilys well my dear boy and james as he dropped the hook what soames whats brought you up arent you well  he answered mechanically im all right and looked at them and it seemed impossible to bring out his news  james quick to take alarm began you dont look well i expect youve taken a chillits liver i shouldnt wonder your motherll give you  but emily broke in quietly have you brought irene  soames shook his head  no he stammered sheshes left me  emily deserted the mirror before which she was standing her tall full figure lost its majesty and became very human as she came running over to soames  my dear boy my dear boy  she put her lips to his forehead and stroked his hand  james too had turned full towards his son his face looked older  left you he said what dyou meanleft you you never told me she was going to leave you  soames answered surlily how could i tell whats to be done  james began walking up and down he looked strange and storklike without a coat whats to be done he muttered how should i know whats to be done whats the good of asking me nobody tells me anything and then they come and ask me whats to be done and i should like to know how im to tell them heres your mother there she stands she doesnt say anything what i should say youve got to do is to follow her  soames smiled his peculiar supercilious smile had never before looked pitiable  i dont know where shes gone he said  dont know where shes gone said james how dyou mean dont know where shes gone where dyou suppose shes gone shes gone after that young bosinney thats where shes gone i knew how it would be  soames in the long silence that followed felt his mother pressing his hand and all that passed seemed to pass as though his own power of thinking or doing had gone to sleep  his fathers face dusky red twitching as if he were going to cry and words breaking out that seemed rent from him by some spasm in his soul  therell be a scandal i always said so then no one saying anything and there you stand you and your mother  and emilys voice calm rather contemptuous come now james soames will do all that he can  and james staring at the floor a little brokenly well i cant help you im getting old dont you be in too great a hurry my boy  and his mothers voice again soames will do all he can to get her back we wont talk of it itll all come right i dare say  and james well i cant see how it can come right and if she hasnt gone off with that young bosinney my advice to you is not to listen to her but to follow her and get her back  once more soames felt his mother stroking his hand in token of her approval and as though repeating some form of sacred oath he muttered between his teeth i will  all three went down to the drawingroom together there were gathered the three girls and dartie had irene been present the family circle would have been complete  james sank into his armchair and except for a word of cold greeting to dartie whom he both despised and dreaded as a man likely to be always in want of money he said nothing till dinner was announced soames too was silent emily alone a woman of cool courage maintained a conversation with winifred on trivial subjects she was never more composed in her manner and conversation than that evening  a decision having been come to not to speak of irenes flight no view was expressed by any other member of the family as to the right course to be pursued there can be little doubt from the general tone adopted in relation to events as they afterwards turned out that jamess advice dont you listen to her follow her and get her back would with here and there an exception have been regarded as sound not only in park lane but amongst the nicholases the rogers and at timothys just as it would surely have been endorsed by that wider body of forsytes all over london who were merely excluded from judgment by ignorance of the story  in spite then of emilys efforts the dinner was served by warmson and the footman almost in silence dartie was sulky and drank all he could get the girls seldom talked to each other at any time james asked once where june was and what she was doing with herself in these days no one could tell him he sank back into gloom only when winifred recounted how little publius had given his bad penny to a beggar did he brighten up  ah he said thats a clever little chap i dont know whatll become of him if he goes on like this an intelligent little chap i call him but it was only a flash  the courses succeeded one another solemnly under the electric light which glared down onto the table but barely reached the principal ornament of the walls a socalled sea piece by turner almost entirely composed of cordage and drowning men  champagne was handed and then a bottle of james prehistoric port but as by the chill hand of some skeleton  at ten oclock soames left twice in reply to questions he had said that irene was not well he felt he could no longer trust himself his mother kissed him with her large soft kiss and he pressed her hand a flush of warmth in his cheeks he walked away in the cold wind which whistled desolately round the corners of the streets under a sky of clear steelblue alive with stars he noticed neither their frosty greeting nor the crackle of the curledup planeleaves nor the nightwomen hurrying in their shabby furs nor the pinched faces of vagabonds at street corners winter was come but soames hastened home oblivious his hands trembled as he took the late letters from the gilt wire cage into which they had been thrust through the slit in the door  none from irene  he went into the diningroom the fire was bright there his chair drawn up to it slippers ready spirit case and carven cigarette box on the table but after staring at it all for a minute or two he turned out the light and went upstairs there was a fire too in his dressingroom but her room was dark and cold it was into this room that soames went  he made a great illumination with candles and for a long time continued pacing up and down between the bed and the door he could not get used to the thought that she had really left him and as though still searching for some message some reason some reading of all the mystery of his married life he began opening every recess and drawer  there were her dresses he had always liked indeed insisted that she should be welldressedshe had taken very few two or three at most and drawer after drawer full of linen and silk things was untouched  perhaps after all it was only a freak and she had gone to the seaside for a few days change if only that were so and she were really coming back he would never again do as he had done that fatal night before last never again run that riskthough it was her duty her duty as a wife though she did belong to himhe would never again run that risk she was evidently not quite right in her head  he stooped over the drawer where she kept her jewels it was not locked and came open as he pulled the jewel box had the key in it this surprised him until he remembered that it was sure to be empty he opened it  it was far from empty divided in little green velvet compartments were all the things he had given her even her watch and stuck into the recess that contained the watch was a threecornered note addressed soames forsyte in irenes handwriting  i think i have taken nothing that you or your people have given me and that was all  he looked at the clasps and bracelets of diamonds and pearls at the little flat gold watch with a great diamond set in sapphires at the chains and rings each in its nest and the tears rushed up in his eyes and dropped upon them  nothing that she could have done nothing that she had done brought home to him like this the inner significance of her act for the moment perhaps he understood nearly all there was to understandunderstood that she loathed him that she had loathed him for years that for all intents and purposes they were like people living in different worlds that there was no hope for him never had been even that she had sufferedthat she was to be pitied  in that moment of emotion he betrayed the forsyte in himforgot himself his interests his propertywas capable of almost anything was lifted into the pure ether of the selfless and unpractical  such moments pass quickly  and as though with the tears he had purged himself of weakness he got up locked the box and slowly almost trembling carried it with him into the other room     chapter viijunes victory  june had waited for her chance scanning the duller columns of the journals morning and evening with an assiduity which at first puzzled old jolyon and when her chance came she took it with all the promptitude and resolute tenacity of her character  she will always remember best in her life that morning when at last she saw amongst the reliable cause list of the times newspaper under the heading of court xiii mr justice bentham the case of forsyte v bosinney  like a gambler who stakes his last piece of money she had prepared to hazard her all upon this throw it was not her nature to contemplate defeat how unless with the instinct of a woman in love she knew that bosinneys discomfiture in this action was assured cannot be toldon this assumption however she laid her plans as upon a certainty  half past eleven found her at watch in the gallery of court xiii and there she remained till the case of forsyte v bosinney was over bosinneys absence did not disquiet her she had felt instinctively that he would not defend himself at the end of the judgment she hastened down and took a cab to his rooms  she passed the open streetdoor and the offices on the three lower floors without attracting notice not till she reached the top did her difficulties begin  her ring was not answered she had now to make up her mind whether she would go down and ask the caretaker in the basement to let her in to await mr bosinneys return or remain patiently outside the door trusting that no one would come up she decided on the latter course  a quarter of an hour had passed in freezing vigil on the landing before it occurred to her that bosinney had been used to leave the key of his rooms under the doormat she looked and found it there for some minutes she could not decide to make use of it at last she let herself in and left the door open that anyone who came might see she was there on business  this was not the same june who had paid the trembling visit five months ago those months of suffering and restraint had made her less sensitive she had dwelt on this visit so long with such minuteness that its terrors were discounted beforehand she was not there to fail this time for if she failed no one could help her  like some mother beast on the watch over her young her little quick figure never stood still in that room but wandered from wall to wall from window to door fingering now one thing now another there was dust everywhere the room could not have been cleaned for weeks and june quick to catch at anything that should buoy up her hope saw in it a sign that he had been obliged for economys sake to give up his servant  she looked into the bedroom the bed was roughly made as though by the hand of man listening intently she darted in and peered into his cupboards a few shirts and collars a pair of muddy bootsthe room was bare even of garments  she stole back to the sittingroom and now she noticed the absence of all the little things he had set store by the clock that had been his mothers the fieldglasses that had hung over the sofa two really valuable old prints of harrow where his father had been at school and last not least the piece of japanese pottery she herself had given him all were gone and in spite of the rage roused within her championing soul at the thought that the world should treat him thus their disappearance augured happily for the success of her plan  it was while looking at the spot where the piece of japanese pottery had stood that she felt a strange certainty of being watched and turning saw irene in the open doorway  the two stood gazing at each other for a minute in silence then june walked forward and held out her hand irene did not take it  when her hand was refused june put it behind her her eyes grew steady with anger she waited for irene to speak and thus waiting took in with whoknowswhat rage of jealousy suspicion and curiosity every detail of her friends face and dress and figure  irene was clothed in her long grey fur the travelling cap on her head left a wave of gold hair visible above her forehead the soft fullness of the coat made her face as small as a childs  unlike junes cheeks her cheeks had no colour in them but were ivory white and pinched as if with cold dark circles lay round her eyes in one hand she held a bunch of violets  she looked back at june no smile on her lips and with those great dark eyes fastened on her the girl for all her startled anger felt something of the old spell  she spoke first after all  what have you come for but the feeling that she herself was being asked the same question made her add this horrible case i came to tell himhe has lost it  irene did not speak her eyes never moved from junes face and the girl cried  dont stand there as if you were made of stone  irene laughed i wish to god i were  but june turned away stop she cried dont tell me i dont want to hear i dont want to hear what youve come for i dont want to hear and like some uneasy spirit she began swiftly walking to and fro suddenly she broke out  i was here first we cant both stay here together  on irenes face a smile wandered up and died out like a flicker of firelight she did not move and then it was that june perceived under the softness and immobility of this figure something desperate and resolved something not to be turned away something dangerous she tore off her hat and putting both hands to her brow pressed back the bronze mass of her hair  you have no right here she cried defiantly  irene answered i have no right anywhere  what do you mean  i have left soames you always wanted me to  june put her hands over her ears  dont i dont want to hear anythingi dont want to know anything its impossible to fight with you what makes you stand like that why dont you go  irenes lips moved she seemed to be saying where should i go  june turned to the window she could see the face of a clock down in the street it was nearly four at any moment he might come she looked back across her shoulder and her face was distorted with anger  but irene had not moved in her gloved hands she ceaselessly turned and twisted the little bunch of violets  the tears of rage and disappointment rolled down junes cheeks  how could you come she said you have been a false friend to me  again irene laughed june saw that she had played a wrong card and broke down  why have you come she sobbed youve ruined my life and now you want to ruin his  irenes mouth quivered her eyes met junes with a look so mournful that the girl cried out in the midst of her sobbing no no  but irenes head bent till it touched her breast she turned and went quickly out hiding her lips with the little bunch of violets  june ran to the door she heard the footsteps going down and down she called out come back irene come back  the footsteps died away  bewildered and torn the girl stood at the top of the stairs why had irene gone leaving her mistress of the field what did it mean had she really given him up to her or had she and she was the prey of a gnawing uncertainty bosinney did not come  about six oclock that afternoon old jolyon returned from wistaria avenue where now almost every day he spent some hours and asked if his granddaughter were upstairs on being told that she had just come in he sent up to her room to request her to come down and speak to him  he had made up his mind to tell her that he was reconciled with her father in future bygones must be bygones he would no longer live alone or practically alone in this great house he was going to give it up and take one in the country for his son where they could all go and live together if june did not like this she could have an allowance and live by herself it wouldnt make much difference to her for it was a long time since she had shown him any affection  but when june came down her face was pinched and piteous there was a strained pathetic look in her eyes she snuggled up in her old attitude on the arm of his chair and what he said compared but poorly with the clear authoritative injured statement he had thought out with much care his heart felt sore as the great heart of a motherbird feels sore when its youngling flies and bruises its wing his words halted as though he were apologizing for having at last deviated from the path of virtue and succumbed in defiance of sounder principles to his more natural instincts  he seemed nervous lest in thus announcing his intentions he should be setting his granddaughter a bad example and now that he came to the point his way of putting the suggestion that if she didnt like it she could live by herself and lump it was delicate in the extreme  and if by any chance my darling he said you found you didnt get onwith them why i could make that all right you could have what you liked we could find a little flat in london where you could set up and i could be running to continually but the children he added are dear little things  then in the midst of this grave rather transparent explanation of changed policy his eyes twinkled thisll astonish timothys weak nerves that precious young thing will have something to say about this or im a dutchman  june had not yet spoken perched thus on the arm of his chair with her head above him her face was invisible but presently he felt her warm cheek against his own and knew that at all events there was nothing very alarming in her attitude towards his news he began to take courage  youll like your father he saidan amiable chap never was much push about him but easy to get on with youll find him artistic and all that  and old jolyon bethought him of the dozen or so watercolour drawings all carefully locked up in his bedroom for now that his son was going to become a man of property he did not think them quite such poor things as heretofore  as to youryour stepmother he said using the word with some little difficulty i call her a refined womana bit of a mrs gummidge i shouldnt wonderbut very fond of jo and the children he repeatedindeed this sentence ran like music through all his solemn selfjustificationare sweet little things  if june had known those words but reincarnated that tender love for little children for the young and weak which in the past had made him desert his son for her tiny self and now as the cycle rolled was taking him from her  but he began to get alarmed at her silence and asked impatiently well what do you say  june slid down to his knee and she in her turn began her tale she thought it would all go splendidly she did not see any difficulty and she did not care a bit what people thought  old jolyon wriggled hm then people would think he had thought that after all these years perhaps they wouldnt well he couldnt help it nevertheless he could not approve of his granddaughters way of putting itshe ought to mind what people thought  yet he said nothing his feelings were too mixed too inconsistent for expression  nowent on junehe did not care what business was it of theirs there was only one thingand with her cheek pressing against his knee old jolyon knew at once that this something was no trifle as he was going to buy a house in the country would he notto please herbuy that splendid house of soames at robin hill it was finished it was perfectly beautiful and no one would live in it now they would all be so happy there  old jolyon was on the alert at once wasnt the man of property going to live in his new house then he never alluded to soames now but under this title  nojune saidhe was not she knew that he was not  how did she know  she could not tell him but she knew she knew nearly for certain it was most unlikely circumstances had changed irenes words still rang in her head i have left soames where should i go  but she kept silence about that  if her grandfather would only buy it and settle that wretched claim that ought never to have been made on phil it would be the very best thing for everybody and everythingeverything might come straight  and june put her lips to his forehead and pressed them close  but old jolyon freed himself from her caress his face wore the judicial look which came upon it when he dealt with affairs he asked what did she mean there was something behind all thishad she been seeing bosinney  june answered no but i have been to his rooms  been to his rooms who took you there  june faced him steadily i went alone he has lost that case i dont care whether it was right or wrong i want to help him and i will  old jolyon asked again have you seen him his glance seemed to pierce right through the girls eyes into her soul  again june answered no he was not there i waited but he did not come  old jolyon made a movement of relief she had risen and looked down at him so slight and light and young but so fixed and so determined and disturbed vexed as he was he could not frown away that fixed look the feeling of being beaten of the reins having slipped of being old and tired mastered him  ah he said at last youll get yourself into a mess one of these days i can see you want your own way in everything  visited by one of his strange bursts of philosophy he added like that you were born and like that youll stay until you die  and he who in his dealings with men of business with boards with forsytes of all descriptions with such as were not forsytes had always had his own way looked at his indomitable grandchild sadlyfor he felt in her that quality which above all others he unconsciously admired  do you know what they say is going on he said slowly  june crimsoned  yesno i knowand i dont knowi dont care and she stamped her foot  i believe said old jolyon dropping his eyes that youd have him if he were dead  there was a long silence before he spoke again  but as to buying this houseyou dont know what youre talking about  june said that she did she knew that he could get it if he wanted he would only have to give what it cost  what it cost you know nothing about it i wont go to soamesill have nothing more to do with that young man  but you neednt you can go to uncle james if you cant buy the house will you pay his lawsuit claim i know he is terribly hard upive seen it you can stop it out of my money  a twinkle came into old jolyons eyes  stop it out of your money a pretty way and what will you do pray without your money  but secretly the idea of wresting the house from james and his son had begun to take hold of him he had heard on forsyte change much comment much rather doubtful praise of this house it was too artistic but a fine place to take from the man of property that on which he had set his heart would be a crowning triumph over james practical proof that he was going to make a man of property of jo to put him back in his proper position and there to keep him secure justice once for all on those who had chosen to regard his son as a poor penniless outcast  he would see he would see it might be out of the question he was not going to pay a fancy price but if it could be done why perhaps he would do it  and still more secretly he knew that he could not refuse her  but he did not commit himself he would think it overhe said to june     chapter viiibosinneys departure  old jolyon was not given to hasty decisions it is probable that he would have continued to think over the purchase of the house at robin hill had not junes face told him that he would have no peace until he acted  at breakfast next morning she asked him what time she should order the carriage  carriage he said with some appearance of innocence what for im not going out  she answered if you dont go early you wont catch uncle james before he goes into the city  james what about your uncle james  the house she replied in such a voice that he no longer pretended ignorance  ive not made up my mind he said  you must you must oh granthink of me  old jolyon grumbled out think of youim always thinking of you but you dont think of yourself you dont think what youre letting yourself in for well order the carriage at ten  at a quarter past he was placing his umbrella in the stand at park lanehe did not choose to relinquish his hat and coat telling warmson that he wanted to see his master he went without being announced into the study and sat down  james was still in the diningroom talking to soames who had come round again before breakfast on hearing who his visitor was he muttered nervously now whats he want i wonder  he then got up  well he said to soames dont you go doing anything in a hurry the first thing is to find out where she isi should go to stainers about it theyre the best men if they cant find her nobody can and suddenly moved to strange softness he muttered to himself poor little thing i cant tell what she was thinking about and went out blowing his nose  old jolyon did not rise on seeing his brother but held out his hand and exchanged with him the clasp of a forsyte  james took another chair by the table and leaned his head on his hand  well he said how are you we dont see much of you nowadays  old jolyon paid no attention to the remark  hows emily he asked and waiting for no reply went on ive come to see you about this affair of young bosinneys im told that new house of his is a white elephant  i dont know anything about a white elephant said james i know hes lost his case and i should say hell go bankrupt  old jolyon was not slow to seize the opportunity this gave him  i shouldnt wonder a bit he agreed and if he goes bankrupt the man of propertythat is soamesll be out of pocket now what i was thinking was this if hes not going to live there  seeing both surprise and suspicion in james eye he quickly went on i dont want to know anything i suppose irenes put her foot downits not material to me but im thinking of a house in the country myself not too far from london and if it suited me i dont say that i mightnt look at it at a price  james listened to this statement with a strange mixture of doubt suspicion and relief merging into a dread of something behind and tinged with the remains of his old undoubted reliance upon his elder brothers good faith and judgment there was anxiety too as to what old jolyon could have heard and how he had heard it and a sort of hopefulness arising from the thought that if junes connection with bosinney were completely at an end her grandfather would hardly seem anxious to help the young fellow altogether he was puzzled as he did not like either to show this or to commit himself in any way he said  they tell me youre altering your will in favour of your son  he had not been told this he had merely added the fact of having seen old jolyon with his son and grandchildren to the fact that he had taken his will away from forsyte bustard and forsyte the shot went home  who told you that asked old jolyon  im sure i dont know said james i cant remember namesi know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house hes not likely to part with it except at a good price  well said old jolyon if he thinks im going to pay a fancy price hes mistaken ive not got the money to throw away that he seems to have let him try and sell it at a forced sale and see what hell get its not every mans house i hear  james who was secretly also of this opinion answered its a gentlemans house soames is here now if youd like to see him  no said old jolyon i havent got as far as that and im not likely to i can see that very well if im met in this manner  james was a little cowed when it came to the actual figures of a commercial transaction he was sure of himself for then he was dealing with facts not with men but preliminary negotiations such as these made him nervoushe never knew quite how far he could go  well he said i know nothing about it soames he tells me nothing i should think hed entertain itits a question of price  oh said old jolyon dont let him make a favour of it he placed his hat on his head in dudgeon  the door was opened and soames came in  theres a policeman out here he said with his half smile for uncle jolyon  old jolyon looked at him angrily and james said a policeman i dont know anything about a policeman but i suppose you know something about him he added to old jolyon with a look of suspicion i suppose youd better see him  in the hall an inspector of police stood stolidly regarding with heavylidded paleblue eyes the fine old english furniture picked up by james at the famous mavrojano sale in portman square youll find my brother in there said james  the inspector raised his fingers respectfully to his peaked cap and entered the study  james saw him go in with a strange sensation  well he said to soames i suppose we must wait and see what he wants your uncles been here about the house  he returned with soames into the diningroom but could not rest  now what does he want he murmured again  who replied soames the inspector they sent him round from stanhope gate thats all i know that nonconformist of uncle jolyons has been pilfering i shouldnt wonder  but in spite of his calmness he too was ill at ease  at the end of ten minutes old jolyon came in he walked up to the table and stood there perfectly silent pulling at his long white moustaches james gazed up at him with opening mouth he had never seen his brother look like this  old jolyon raised his hand and said slowly  young bosinney has been run over in the fog and killed  then standing above his brother and his nephew and looking down at him with his deep eyes  theressometalkofsuicide he said  james jaw dropped suicide what should he do that for  old jolyon answered sternly god knows if you and your son dont  but james did not reply  for all men of great age even for all forsytes life has had bitter experiences the passerby who sees them wrapped in cloaks of custom wealth and comfort would never suspect that such black shadows had fallen on their roads to every man of great ageto sir walter bentham himselfthe idea of suicide has once at least been present in the anteroom of his soul on the threshold waiting to enter held out from the inmost chamber by some chance reality some vague fear some painful hope to forsytes that final renunciation of property is hard oh it is hard seldomperhaps nevercan they achieve it and yet how near have they not sometimes been  so even with james then in the medley of his thoughts he broke out why i saw it in the paper yesterday run over in the fog they didnt know his name he turned from one face to the other in his confusion of soul but instinctively all the time he was rejecting that rumour of suicide he dared not entertain this thought so against his interest against the interest of his son of every forsyte he strove against it and as his nature ever unconsciously rejected that which it could not with safety accept so gradually he overcame this fear it was an accident it must have been  old jolyon broke in on his reverie  death was instantaneous he lay all day yesterday at the hospital there was nothing to tell them who he was i am going there now you and your son had better come too  no one opposing this command he led the way from the room  the day was still and clear and bright and driving over to park lane from stanhope gate old jolyon had had the carriage open sitting back on the padded cushions finishing his cigar he had noticed with pleasure the keen crispness of the air the bustle of the cabs and people the strange almost parisian alacrity that the first fine day will bring into london streets after a spell of fog or rain and he had felt so happy he had not felt like it for months his confession to june was off his mind he had the prospect of his sons above all of his grandchildrens company in the futurehe had appointed to meet young jolyon at the hotch potch that very manning todiscuss it again and there was the pleasurable excitement of a coming encounter a coming victory over james and the man of property in the matter of the house  he had the carriage closed now he had no heart to look on gaiety nor was it right that forsytes should be seen driving with an inspector of police  in that carriage the inspector spoke again of the death  it was not so very thickjust there the driver says the gentleman must have had time to see what he was about he seemed to walk right into it it appears that he was very hard up we found several pawn tickets at his rooms his account at the bank is overdrawn and theres this case in todays papers his cold blue eyes travelled from one to another of the three forsytes in the carriage  old jolyon watching from his corner saw his brothers face change and the brooding worried look deepen on it at the inspectors words indeed all james doubts and fears revived harduppawnticketsan overdrawn account these words that had all his life been a faroff nightmare to him seemed to make uncannily real that suspicion of suicide which must on no account be entertained he sought his sons eye but lynxeyed taciturn immovable soames gave no answering look and to old jolyon watching divining the league of mutual defence between them there came an overmastering desire to have his own son at his side as though this visit to the dead mans body was a battle in which otherwise he must singlehanded meet those two and the thought of how to keep junes name out of the business kept whirring in his brain james had his son to support him why should he not send for jo  taking out his cardcase he pencilled the following message  come round at once ive sent the carriage for you  on getting out he gave this card to his coachman telling him to driveas fast as possible to the hotch potch club and if mr jolyon forsyte were there to give him the card and bring him at once if not there yet he was to wait till he came  he followed the others slowly up the steps leaning on his umbrella and stood a moment to get his breath the inspector said this is the mortuary sir but take your time  in the bare whitewalled room empty of all but a streak of sunshine smeared along the dustless floor lay a form covered by a sheet with a huge steady hand the inspector took the hem and turned it back a sightless face gazed up at them and on either side of that sightless defiant face the three forsytes gazed down in each one of them the secret emotions fears and pity of his own nature rose and fell like the rising falling waves of life whose wash those white walls barred out now for ever from bosinney and in each one of them the trend of his nature the odd essential spring which moved him in fashions minutely unalterably different from those of every other human being forced him to a different attitude of thought far from the others yet inscrutably close each stood thus alone with death silent his eyes lowered  the inspector asked softly  you identify the gentleman sir  old jolyon raised his head and nodded he looked at his brother opposite at that long lean figure brooding over the dead man with face dusky red and strained grey eyes and at the figure of soames white and still by his fathers side and all that he had felt against those two was gone like smoke in the long white presence of death whence comes it how comes itdeath sudden reverse of all that goes before blind setting forth on a path that leads to where dark quenching of the fire the heavy brutal crushingout that all men must go through keeping their eyes clear and brave unto the end small and of no import insects though they are and across old jolyons face there flitted a gleam for soames murmuring to the inspector crept noiselessly away  then suddenly james raised his eyes there was a queer appeal in that suspicious troubled look i know im no match for you it seemed to say and hunting for handkerchief he wiped his brow then bending sorrowful and lank over the dead man he too turned and hurried out  old jolyon stood still as death his eyes fixed on the body who shall tell of what he was thinking of himself when his hair was brown like the hair of that young fellow dead before him of himself with his battle just beginning the long long battle he had loved the battle that was over for this young man almost before it had begun of his granddaughter with her broken hopes of that other woman of the strangeness and the pity of it and the irony inscrutable and bitter of that end justice there was no justice for men for they were ever in the dark  or perhaps in his philosophy he thought better to be out of it all better to have done with it like this poor youth  some one touched him on the arm  a tear started up and wetted his eyelash well he said im no good here id better be going youll come to me as soon as you can jo and with his head bowed he went away  it was young jolyons turn to take his stand beside the dead man round whose fallen body he seemed to see all the forsytes breathless and prostrated the stroke had fallen too swiftly  the forces underlying every tragedyforces that take no denial working through cross currents to their ironical end had met and fused with a thunderclap flung out the victim and flattened to the ground all those that stood around  or so at all events young jolyon seemed to see them lying around bosinneys body  he asked the inspector to tell him what had happened and the latter like a man who does not every day get such a chance again detailed such facts as were known  theres more here sir however he said than meets the eye i dont believe in suicide nor in pure accident myself its more likely i think that he was suffering under great stress of mind and took no notice of things about him perhaps you can throw some light on these  he took from his pocket a little packet and laid it on the table carefully undoing it he revealed a ladys handkerchief pinned through the folds with a pin of discoloured venetian gold the stone of which had fallen from the socket a scent of dried violets rose to young jolyons nostrils  found in his breast pocket said the inspector the name has been cut away  young jolyon with difficulty answered im afraid i cannot help you but vividly there rose before him the face he had seen light up so tremulous and glad at bosinneys coming of her he thought more than of his own daughter more than of them allof her with the dark soft glance the delicate passive face waiting for the dead man waiting even at that moment perhaps still and patient in the sunlight  he walked sorrowfully away from the hospital towards his fathers house reflecting that this death would break up the forsyte family the stroke had indeed slipped past their defences into the very wood of their tree they might flourish to all appearance as before preserving a brave show before the eyes of london but the trunk was dead withered by the same flash that had stricken down bosinney and now the saplings would take its place each one a new custodian of the sense of property  good forest of forsytes thought young jolyonsoundest timber of our land  concerning the cause of this deathhis family would doubtless reject with vigour the suspicion of suicide which was so compromising they would take it as an accident a stroke of fate in their hearts they would even feel it an intervention of providence a retributionhad not bosinney endangered their two most priceless possessions the pocket and the hearth and they would talk of that unfortunate accident of young bosinneys but perhaps they would not talksilence might be better  as for himself he regarded the busdrivers account of the accident as of very little value for no one so madly in love committed suicide for want of money nor was bosinney the sort of fellow to set much store by a financial crisis and so he too rejected this theory of suicide the dead mans face rose too clearly before him gone in the heyday of his summerand to believe thus that an accident had cut bosinney off in the full sweep of his passion was more than ever pitiful to young jolyon  then came a vision of soames home as it now was and must be hereafter the streak of lightning had flashed its clear uncanny gleam on bare bones with grinning spaces between the disguising flesh was gone  in the diningroom at stanhope gate old jolyon was sitting alone when his son came in he looked very wan in his great armchair and his eyes travelling round the walls with their pictures of still life and the masterpiece dutch fishingboats at sunset seemed as though passing their gaze over his life with its hopes its gains its achievements  ah jo he said is that you ive told poor little june but thats not all of it are you going to soames shes brought it on herself i suppose but somehow i cant bear to think of her shut up thereand all alone and holding up his thin veined hand he clenched it     chapter ixirenes return  after leaving james and old jolyon in the mortuary of the hospital soames hurried aimlessly along the streets  the tragic event of bosinneys death altered the complexion of everything there was no longer the same feeling that to lose a minute would be fatal nor would he now risk communicating the fact of his wifes flight to anyone till the inquest was over  that morning he had risen early before the postman came had taken the firstpost letters from the box himself and though there had been none from irene he had made an opportunity of telling bilson that her mistress was at the sea he would probably he said be going down himself from saturday to monday this had given him time to breathe time to leave no stone unturned to find her  but now cut off from taking steps by bosinneys deaththat strange death to think of which was like putting a hot iron to his heart like lifting a great weight from ithe did not know how to pass his day and he wandered here and there through the streets looking at every face he met devoured by a hundred anxieties  and as he wandered he thought of him who had finished his wandering his prowling and would never haunt his house again  already in the afternoon he passed posters announcing the identity of the dead man and bought the papers to see what they said he would stop their mouths if he could and he went into the city and was closeted with boulter for a long time  on his way home passing the steps of jobsons about half past four he met george forsyte who held out an evening paper to soames saying  here have you seen this about the poor buccaneer  soames answered stonily yes  george stared at him he had never liked soames he now held him responsible for bosinneys death soames had done for himdone for him by that act of property that had sent the buccaneer to run amok that fatal afternoon  the poor fellow he was thinking was so cracked with jealousy so cracked for his vengeance that he heard nothing of the omnibus in that infernal fog  soames had done for him and this judgment was in georges eyes  they talk of suicide here he said at last that cat wont jump  soames shook his head an accident he muttered  clenching his fist on the paper george crammed it into his pocket he could not resist a parting shot  hmm all flourishing at home any little soameses yet  with a face as white as the steps of jobsons and a lip raised as if snarling soames brushed past him and was gone  on reaching home and entering the little lighted hall with his latchkey the first thing that caught his eye was his wifes goldmounted umbrella lying on the rug chest flinging off his fur coat he hurried to the drawingroom  the curtains were drawn for the night a bright fire of cedarlogs burned in the grate and by its light he saw irene sitting in her usual corner on the sofa he shut the door softly and went towards her she did not move and did not seem to see him  so youve come back he said why are you sitting here in the dark  then he caught sight of her face so white and motionless that it seemed as though the blood must have stopped flowing in her veins and her eyes that looked enormous like the great wide startled brown eyes of an owl  huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl bunched in its soft feathers against the wires of a cage the supple erectness of her figure was gone as though she had been broken by cruel exercise as though there were no longer any reason for being beautiful and supple and erect  so youve come back he repeated  she never looked up and never spoke the firelight playing over her motionless figure  suddenly she tried to rise but he prevented her it was then that he understood  she had come back like an animal wounded to death not knowing where to turn not knowing what she was doing the sight of her figure huddled in the fur was enough  he knew then for certain that bosinney had been her lover knew that she had seen the report of his deathperhaps like himself had bought a paper at the draughty corner of a street and read it  she had come back then of her own accord to the cage she had pined to be free ofand taking in all the tremendous significance of this he longed to cry take your hated body that i love out of my house take away that pitiful white face so cruel and softbefore i crush it get out of my sight never let me see you again  and at those unspoken words he seemed to see her rise and move away like a woman in a terrible dream from which she was fighting to awakerise and go out into the dark and cold without a thought of him without so much as the knowledge of his presence  then he cried contradicting what he had not yet spoken no stay there and turning away from her he sat down in his accustomed chair on the other side of the hearth  they sat in silence  and soames thought why is all this why should i suffer so what have i done it is not my fault  again he looked at her huddled like a bird that is shot and dying whose poor breast you see panting as the air is taken from it whose poor eyes look at you who have shot it with a slow soft unseeing look taking farewell of all that is goodof the sun and the air and its mate  so they sat by the firelight in the silence one on each side of the hearth  and the fume of the burning cedar logs that he loved so well seemed to grip soames by the throat till he could bear it no longer and going out into the hall he flung the door wide to gulp down the cold air that came in then without hat or overcoat went out into the square  along the garden rails a halfstarved cat came rubbing her way towards him and soames thought suffering when will it cease my suffering  at a front door across the way was a man of his acquaintance named rutter scraping his boots with an air of i am master here and soames walked on  from far in the clear air the bells of the church where he and irene had been married were pealing in practice for the advent of christ the chimes ringing out above the sound of traffic he felt a craving for strong drink to lull him to indifference or rouse him to fury if only he could burst out of himself out of this web that for the first time in his life he felt around him if only he could surrender to the thought divorce herturn her out she has forgotten you forget her  if only he could surrender to the thought let her goshe has suffered enough  if only he could surrender to the desire make a slave of hershe is in your power  if only even he could surrender to the sudden vision what does it all matter forget himself for a minute forget that it mattered what he did forget that whatever he did he must sacrifice something  if only he could act on an impulse  he could forget nothing surrender to no thought vision or desire it was all too serious too close around him an unbreakable cage  on the far side of the square newspaper boys were calling their evening wares and the ghoulish cries mingled and jangled with the sound of those church bells  soames covered his ears the thought flashed across him that but for a chance he himself and not bosinney might be lying dead and she instead of crouching there like a shot bird with those dying eyes  something soft touched his legs the cat was rubbing herself against them and a sob that shook him from head to foot burst from soames chest then all was still again in the dark where the houses seemed to stare at him each with a master and mistress of its own and a secret story of happiness or sorrow  and suddenly he saw that his own door was open and black against the light from the hall a man standing with his back turned something slid too in his breast and he stole up close behind  he could see his own fur coat flung across the carved oak chair the persian rugs the silver bowls the rows of porcelain plates arranged along the walls and this unknown man who was standing there  and sharply he asked what is it you want sir  the visitor turned it was young jolyon  the door was open he said might i see your wife for a minute i have a message for her  soames gave him a strange sidelong stare  my wife can see no one he muttered doggedly  young jolyon answered gently i shouldnt keep her a minute  soames brushed by him and barred the way  she can see no one he said again  young jolyons glance shot past him into the hall and soames turned there in the drawingroom doorway stood irene her eyes were wild and eager her lips were parted her hands outstretched in the sight of both men that light vanished from her face her hands dropped to her sides she stood like stone  soames spun round and met his visitors eyes and at the look he saw in them a sound like a snarl escaped him he drew his lips back in the ghost of a smile  this is my house he said i manage my own affairs ive told you oncei tell you again we are not at home  and in young jolyons face he slammed the door      the forsyte sagavolume ii  by john galsworthy    contents     indian summer of a forsyte               in chancery   to andre chevrillon     indian summer of a forsyte         and summers lease hath all                 too short a date        shakespeare     i  in the last day of may in the early nineties about six oclock of the evening old jolyon forsyte sat under the oak tree below the terrace of his house at robin hill he was waiting for the midges to bite him before abandoning the glory of the afternoon his thin brown hand where blue veins stood out held the end of a cigar in its tapering longnailed fingersa pointed polished nail had survived with him from those earlier victorian days when to touch nothing even with the tips of the fingers had been so distinguished his domed forehead great white moustache lean cheeks and long lean jaw were covered from the westering sunshine by an old brown panama hat his legs were crossed in all his attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance as of an old man who every morning put eau de cologne upon his silk handkerchief at his feet lay a woolly brownandwhite dog trying to be a pomeranianthe dog balthasar between whom and old jolyon primal aversion had changed into attachment with the years close to his chair was a swing and on the swing was seated one of hollys dollscalled duffer alicewith her body fallen over her legs and her doleful nose buried in a black petticoat she was never out of disgrace so it did not matter to her how she sat below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank stretched to the fernery and beyond that refinement became fields dropping to the pond the coppice and the prospectfine remarkableat which swithin forsyte from under this very tree had stared five years ago when he drove down with irene to look at the house old jolyon had heard of his brothers exploitthat drive which had become quite celebrated on forsyte change swithin and the fellow had gone and died last november at the age of only seventynine renewing the doubt whether forsytes could live for ever which had first arisen when aunt ann passed away died and left only jolyon and james roger and nicholas and timothy julia hester susan and old jolyon thought eightyfive i dont feel itexcept when i get that pain  his memory went searching he had not felt his age since he had bought his nephew soames illstarred house and settled into it here at robin hill over three years ago it was as if he had been getting younger every spring living in the country with his son and his grandchildrenjune and the little ones of the second marriage jolly and holly living down here out of the racket of london and the cackle of forsyte change free of his boards in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play with plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its twenty acres and in ministering to the whims of holly and jolly all the knots and crankiness which had gathered in his heart during that long and tragic business of june soames irene his wife and poor young bosinney had been smoothed out even june had thrown off her melancholy at lastwitness this travel in spain she was taking now with her father and her stepmother curiously perfect peace was left by their departure blissful yet blank because his son was not there jo was never anything but a comfort and a pleasure to him nowadaysan amiable chap but women somehoweven the bestgot a little on ones nerves unless of course one admired them  faroff a cuckoo called a woodpigeon was cooing from the first elmtree in the field and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the last mowing the wind had got into the sou west tooa delicious air sappy he pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his chin and cheek somehow today he wanted companywanted a pretty face to look at people treated the old as if they wanted nothing and with the unforsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul he thought ones never had enough with a foot in the grave onell want something i shouldnt be surprised down hereaway from the exigencies of affairshis grandchildren and the flowers trees birds of his little domain to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above them said open sesame to him day and night and sesame had openedhow much perhaps he did not know he had always been responsive to what they had begun to call nature genuinely almost religiously responsive though he had never lost his habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view however deeply they might move him but nowadays nature actually made him ache he appreciated it so every one of these calm bright lengthening days with hollys hand in his and the dog balthasar in front looking studiously for what he never found he would stroll watching the roses open fruit budding on the walls sunlight brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the coppice watching the waterlily leaves unfold and glisten and the silvery young corn of the one wheat field listening to the starlings and skylarks and the alderney cows chewing the cud flicking slow their tufted tails and every one of these fine days he ached a little from sheer love of it all feeling perhaps deep down that he had not very much longer to enjoy it the thought that some dayperhaps not ten years hence perhaps not fiveall this world would be taken away from him before he had exhausted his powers of loving it seemed to him in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon if anything came after this life it wouldnt be what he wanted not robin hill and flowers and birds and pretty facestoo few even now of those about him with the years his dislike of humbug had increased the orthodoxy he had worn in the sixties as he had worn sidewhiskers out of sheer exuberance had long dropped off leaving him reverent before three things alonebeauty upright conduct and the sense of property and the greatest of these now was beauty he had always had wide interests and indeed could still read the times but he was liable at any moment to put it down if he heard a blackbird sing upright conduct propertysomehow they were tiring the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him only gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them staring into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and white flowers on the lawn a thought came to him this weather was like the music of orfeo which he had recently heard at covent garden a beautiful opera not like meyerbeer nor even quite mozart but in its way perhaps even more lovely something classical and of the golden age about it chaste and mellow and the ravogli almost worthy of the old dayshighest praise he could bestow the yearning of orpheus for the beauty he was losing for his love going down to hades as in life love and beauty did gothe yearning which sang and throbbed through the golden music stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that evening and with the tip of his corksoled elasticsided boot he involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog balthasar causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas for though he was supposed to have none nothing could persuade him of the fact when he had finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his masters calf and settled down again with his chin over the instep of the disturbing boot and into old jolyons mind came a sudden recollectiona face he had seen at that opera three weeks agoirene the wife of his precious nephew soames that man of property though he had not met her since the day of the at home in his old house at stanhope gate which celebrated his granddaughter junes illstarred engagement to young bosinney he had remembered her at once for he had always admired hera very pretty creature after the death of young bosinney whose mistress she had so reprehensibly become he had heard that she had left soames at once goodness only knew what she had been doing since that sight of her facea side viewin the row in front had been literally the only reminder these three years that she was still alive no one ever spoke of her and yet jo had told him something oncesomething which had upset him completely the boy had got it from george forsyte he believed who had seen bosinney in the fog the day he was run oversomething which explained the young fellows distressan act of soames towards his wifea shocking act jo had seen her too that afternoon after the news was out seen her for a moment and his description had always lingered in old jolyons mindwild and lost he had called her and next day june had gone therebottled up her feelings and gone there and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in the night and vanished a tragic business altogether one thing was certainsoames had never been able to lay hands on her again and he was living at brighton and journeying up and downa fitting fate the man of property for when he once took a dislike to anyoneas he had to his nephewold jolyon never got over it he remembered still the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of irenes disappearance it had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that house to which she must have wandered back when jo saw her wandered back for a momentlike a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that news tragic death of an architect in the street her face had struck him very much the other nightmore beautiful than he had remembered but like a mask with something going on beneath it a young woman stilltwentyeight perhaps ah well very likely she had another lover by now but at this subversive thoughtfor married women should never love once even had been too muchhis instep rose and with it the dog balthasars head the sagacious animal stood up and looked into old jolyons face walk he seemed to say and old jolyon answered come on old chap  slowly as was their wont they crossed among the constellations of buttercups and daisies and entered the fernery this feature where very little grew as yet had been judiciously dropped below the level of the lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and give the impression of irregularity so important in horticulture its rocks and earth were beloved of the dog balthasar who sometimes found a mole there old jolyon made a point of passing through it because though it was not beautiful he intended that it should be some day and he would think i must get varr to come down and look at it hes better than beech for plants like houses and human complaints required the best expert consideration it was inhabited by snails and if accompanied by his grandchildren he would point to one and tell them the story of the little boy who said have plummers got leggers mother no sonny then darned if i havent been and swallowed a snileybob and when they skipped and clutched his hand thinking of the snileybob going down the little boys red lane his eyes would twinkle emerging from the fernery he opened the wicket gate which just there led into the first field a large and parklike area out of which within brick walls the vegetable garden had been carved old jolyon avoided this which did not suit his mood and made down the hill towards the pond balthasar who knew a waterrat or two gambolled in front at the gait which marks an oldish dog who takes the same walk every day arrived at the edge old jolyon stood noting another waterlily opened since yesterday he would show it to holly tomorrow when his little sweet had got over the upset which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunchher little arrangements were very delicate now that jolly had gone to schoolhis first termholly was with him nearly all day long and he missed her badly he felt that pain too which often bothered him now a little dragging at his left side he looked back up the hill really poor young bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house he would have done very well for himself if he had lived and where was he now perhaps still haunting this the site of his last work of his tragic love affair or was philip bosinneys spirit diffused in the general who could say that dog was getting his legs muddy and he moved towards the coppice there had been the most delightful lot of bluebells and he knew where some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the trees away out of the sun he passed the cowhouses and the henhouses there installed and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings making for one of the bluebell plots balthasar preceding him once more uttered a low growl old jolyon stirred him with his foot but the dog remained motionless just where there was no room to pass and the hair rose slowly along the centre of his woolly back whether from the growl and the look of the dogs stivered hair or from the sensation which a man feels in a wood old jolyon also felt something move along his spine and then the path turned and there was an old mossy log and on it a woman sitting her face was turned away and he had just time to think shes trespassingi must have a board put up before she turned powers above the face he had seen at the operathe very woman he had just been thinking of in that confused moment he saw things blurred as if a spiritqueer effectthe slant of sunlight perhaps on her violetgrey frock and then she rose and stood smiling her head a little to one side old jolyon thought how pretty she is she did not speak neither did he and he realized why with a certain admiration she was here no doubt because of some memory and did not mean to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation  dont let that dog touch your frock he said hes got wet feet come here you  but the dog balthasar went on towards the visitor who put her hand down and stroked his head old jolyon said quickly  i saw you at the opera the other night you didnt notice me  oh yes i did  he felt a subtle flattery in that as though she had added do you think one could miss seeing you  theyre all in spain he remarked abruptly im alone i drove up for the opera the ravoglis good have you seen the cowhouses  in a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property and she moved beside him her figure swayed faintly like the best kind of french figures her dress too was a sort of french grey he noticed two or three silver threads in her ambercoloured hair strange hair with those dark eyes of hers and that creamypale face a sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed him it seemed to come from deep and far from another world almost or at all events from some one not living very much in this and he said mechanically  where are you living now  i have a little flat in chelsea  he did not want to hear what she was doing did not want to hear anything but the perverse word came out  alone  she nodded it was a relief to know that and it came into his mind that but for a twist of fate she would have been mistress of this coppice showing these cowhouses to him a visitor  all alderneys he muttered they give the best milk this ones a pretty creature woa myrtle  the fawncoloured cow with eyes as soft and brown as irenes own was standing absolutely still not having long been milked she looked round at them out of the corner of those lustrous mild cynical eyes and from her grey lips a little dribble of saliva threaded its way towards the straw the scent of hay and vanilla and ammonia rose in the dim light of the cool cowhouse and old jolyon said  you must come up and have some dinner with me ill send you home in the carriage  he perceived a struggle going on within her natural no doubt with her memories but he wanted her company a pretty face a charming figure beauty he had been alone all the afternoon perhaps his eyes were wistful for she answered thank you uncle jolyon i should like to  he rubbed his hands and said  capital lets go up then and preceded by the dog balthasar they ascended through the field the sun was almost level in their faces now and he could see not only those silver threads but little lines just deep enough to stamp her beauty with a coinlike finenessthe special look of life unshared with others ill take her in by the terrace he thought i wont make a common visitor of her  what do you do all day he said  teach music i have another interest too  work said old jolyon picking up the doll from off the swing and smoothing its black petticoat nothing like it is there i dont do any now im getting on what interest is that  trying to help women whove come to grief old jolyon did not quite understand to grief he repeated then realised with a shock that she meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he had used that expression assisting the magdalenes of london what a weird and terrifying interest and curiosity overcoming his natural shrinking he asked  why what do you do for them  not much ive no money to spare i can only give sympathy and food sometimes  involuntarily old jolyons hand sought his purse he said hastily how dyou get hold of them  i go to a hospital  a hospital phew  what hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of beauty  old jolyon straightened the doll beauty he ejaculated ha yes a sad business and he moved towards the house through a french window under sunblinds not yet drawn up he preceded her into the room where he was wont to study the times and the sheets of an agricultural magazine with huge illustrations of mangold wurzels and the like which provided holly with material for her paint brush  dinners in half an hour youd like to wash your hands ill take you to junes room  he saw her looking round eagerly what changes since she had last visited this house with her husband or her lover or both perhapshe did not know could not say all that was dark and he wished to leave it so but what changes and in the hall he said  my boy jos a painter you know hes got a lot of taste it isnt mine of course but ive let him have his way  she was standing very still her eyes roaming through the hall and music room as it now wasall thrown into one under the great skylight old jolyon had an odd impression of her was she trying to conjure somebody from the shades of that space where the colouring was all pearlgrey and silver he would have had gold himself more lively and solid but jo had french tastes and it had come out shadowy like that with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour it was not his dream mentally he had hung this space with those goldframed masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when quantity was precious and now where were they sold for a song that something which made him alone among forsytes move with the times had warned him against the struggle to retain them but in his study he still had dutch fishing boats at sunset  he began to mount the stairs with her slowly for he felt his side  these are the bathrooms he said and other arrangements ive had them tiled the nurseries are along there and this is jos and his wifes they all communicate but you remember i expect  irene nodded they passed on up the gallery and entered a large room with a small bed and several windows  this is mine he said the walls were covered with the photographs of children and watercolour sketches and he added doubtfully  these are jos the views firstrate you can see the grand stand at epsom in clear weather  the sun was down now behind the house and over the prospect a luminous haze had settled emanation of the long and prosperous day few houses showed but fields and trees faintly glistened away to a loom of downs  the countrys changing he said abruptly but there itll be when were all gone look at those thrushesthe birds are sweet here in the mornings im glad to have washed my hands of london  her face was close to the window pane and he was struck by its mournful look wish i could make her look happy he thought a pretty face but sad and taking up his can of hot water he went out into the gallery  this is junes room he said opening the next door and putting the can down i think youll find everything and closing the door behind her he went back to his own room brushing his hair with his great ebony brushes and dabbing his forehead with eau de cologne he mused she had come so strangelya sort of visitation mysterious even romantic as if his desire for company for beauty had been fulfilled by whatever it was which fulfilled that sort of thing and before the mirror he straightened his still upright figure passed the brushes over his great white moustache touched up his eyebrows with eau de cologne and rang the bell  i forgot to let them know that i have a lady to dinner with me let cook do something extra and tell beacon to have the landau and pair at halfpast ten to drive her back to town tonight is miss holly asleep  the maid thought not and old jolyon passing down the gallery stole on tiptoe towards the nursery and opened the door whose hinges he kept specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the evenings without being heard  but holly was asleep and lay like a miniature madonna of that type which the old painters could not tell from venus when they had completed her her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks on her face was perfect peaceher little arrangements were evidently all right again and old jolyon in the twilight of the room stood adoring her it was so charming solemn and lovingthat little face he had more than his share of the blessed capacity of living again in the young they were to him his future lifeall of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted there she was with everything before her and his bloodsome of itin her tiny veins there she was his little companion to be made as happy as ever he could make her so that she knew nothing but love his heart swelled and he went out stilling the sound of his patentleather boots in the corridor an eccentric notion attacked him to think that children should come to that which irene had told him she was helping women who were all once little things like this one sleeping there i must give her a cheque he mused cant bear to think of them they had never borne reflecting on those poor outcasts wounding too deeply the core of true refinement hidden under layers of conformity to the sense of propertywounding too grievously the deepest thing in hima love of beauty which could give him even now a flutter of the heart thinking of his evening in the society of a pretty woman and he went downstairs through the swinging doors to the back regions there in the winecellar was a hock worth at least two pounds a bottle a steinberg cabinet better than any johannisberg that ever went down throat a wine of perfect bouquet sweet as a nectarinenectar indeed he got a bottle out handling it like a baby and holding it level to the light to look enshrined in its coat of dust that mellow coloured slendernecked bottle gave him deep pleasure three years to settle down again since the move from townought to be in prime condition thirtyfive years ago he had bought itthank god he had kept his palate and earned the right to drink it she would appreciate this not a spice of acidity in a dozen he wiped the bottle drew the cork with his own hands put his nose down inhaled its perfume and went back to the music room  irene was standing by the piano she had taken off her hat and a lace scarf she had been wearing so that her goldcoloured hair was visible and the pallor of her neck in her grey frock she made a pretty picture for old jolyon against the rosewood of the piano  he gave her his arm and solemnly they went the room which had been designed to enable twentyfour people to dine in comfort held now but a little round table in his present solitude the big diningtable oppressed old jolyon he had caused it to be removed till his son came back here in the company of two really good copies of raphael madonnas he was wont to dine alone it was the only disconsolate hour of his day this summer weather he had never been a large eater like that great chap swithin or sylvanus heythorp or anthony thornworthy those cronies of past times and to dine alone overlooked by the madonnas was to him but a sorrowful occupation which he got through quickly that he might come to the more spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar but this evening was a different matter his eyes twinkled at her across the little table and he spoke of italy and switzerland telling her stories of his travels there and other experiences which he could no longer recount to his son and granddaughter because they knew them this fresh audience was precious to him he had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round the fields of reminiscence himself quickly fatigued by the insensitive he instinctively avoided fatiguing others and his natural flirtatiousness towards beauty guarded him specially in his relations with a woman he would have liked to draw her out but though she murmured and smiled and seemed to be enjoying what he told her he remained conscious of that mysterious remoteness which constituted half her fascination he could not bear women who threw their shoulders and eyes at you and chattered away or hardmouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you did there was only one quality in a woman that appealed to himcharm and the quieter it was the more he liked it and this one had charm shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those italian hills and valleys he had loved the feeling too that she was as it were apart cloistered made her seem nearer to himself a strangely desirable companion when a man is very old and quite out of the running he loves to feel secure from the rivalries of youth for he would still be first in the heart of beauty and he drank his hock and watched her lips and felt nearly young but the dog balthasar lay watching her lips too and despising in his heart the interruptions of their talk and the tilting of those greenish glasses full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to him  the light was just failing when they went back into the musicroom and cigar in mouth old jolyon said  play me some chopin  by the cigars they smoke and the composers they love ye shall know the texture of mens souls old jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or wagners music he loved beethoven and mozart handel and gluck and schumann and for some occult reason the operas of meyerbeer but of late years he had been seduced by chopin just as in painting he had succumbed to botticelli in yielding to these tastes he had been conscious of divergence from the standard of the golden age their poetry was not that of milton and byron and tennyson of raphael and titian mozart and beethoven it was as it were behind a veil their poetry hit no one in the face but slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted and melted up the heart and never certain that this was healthy he did not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one or hear the music of the other  irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned with pearlgrey and old jolyon in an armchair whence he could see her crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar she sat a few moments with her hands on the keys evidently searching her mind for what to give him then she began and within old jolyon there arose a sorrowful pleasure not quite like anything else in the world he fell slowly into a trance interrupted only by the movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at long intervals and replacing it she was there and the hock within him and the scent of tobacco but there too was a world of sunshine lingering into moonlight and pools with storks upon them and bluish trees above glowing with blurs of winered roses and fields of lavender where milkwhite cows were grazing and a woman all shadowy with dark eyes and a white neck smiled holding out her arms and through air which was like music a star dropped and was caught on a cows horn he opened his eyes beautiful piece she played wellthe touch of an angel and he closed them again he felt miraculously sad and happy as one does standing under a limetree in full honey flower not live ones own life again but just stand there and bask in the smile of a womans eyes and enjoy the bouquet and he jerked his hand the dog balthasar had reached up and licked it  beautiful he said go onmore chopin  she began to play again this time the resemblance between her and chopin struck him the swaying he had noticed in her walk was in her playing too and the nocturne she had chosen and the soft darkness of her eyes the light on her hair as of moonlight from a golden moon seductive yes but nothing of delilah in her or in that music a long blue spiral from his cigar ascended and dispersed so we go out he thought no more beauty nothing  again irene stopped  would you like some gluck he used to write his music in a sunlit garden with a bottle of rhine wine beside him  ah yes lets have orfeo round about him now were fields of gold and silver flowers white forms swaying in the sunlight bright birds flying to and fro all was summer lingering waves of sweetness and regret flooded his soul some cigar ash dropped and taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off he inhaled a mingled scent as of snuff and eau de cologne ah he thought indian summerthats all and he said you havent played me che faro  she did not answer did not move he was conscious of somethingsome strange upset suddenly he saw her rise and turn away and a pang of remorse shot through him what a clumsy chap like orpheus she of courseshe too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory and disturbed to the heart he got up from his chair she had gone to the great window at the far end gingerly he followed her hands were folded over her breast he could just see her cheek very white and quite emotionalized he said  there there my love the words had escaped him mechanically for they were those he used to holly when she had a pain but their effect was instantaneously distressing she raised her arms covered her face with them and wept  old jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age the passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment so unlike the control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before broken down in the presence of another being  there therethere there he murmured and putting his hand out reverently touched her she turned and leaned the arms which covered her face against him old jolyon stood very still keeping one thin hand on her shoulder let her cry her heart outit would do her good  and the dog balthasar puzzled sat down on his stern to examine them  the window was still open the curtains had not been drawn the last of daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the lamp within there was a scent of newmown grass with the wisdom of a long life old jolyon did not speak even grief sobbed itself out in time only time was good for sorrowtime who saw the passing of each mood each emotion in turn time the layertorest there came into his mind the words as panteth the hart after cooling streamsbut they were of no use to him then conscious of a scent of violets he knew she was drying her eyes he put his chin forward pressed his moustache against her forehead and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body as of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops she put his hand to her lips as if saying all over now forgive me  the kiss filled him with a strange comfort he led her back to where she had been so upset and the dog balthasar following laid the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet  anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion he could think of nothing better than china and moving with her slowly from cabinet to cabinet he kept taking up bits of dresden and lowestoft and chelsea turning them round and round with his thin veined hands whose skin faintly freckled had such an aged look  i bought this at jobsons he would say cost me thirty pounds its very old that dog leaves his bones all over the place this old shipbowl i picked up at the sale when that precious rip the marquis came to grief but you dont remember heres a nice piece of chelsea now what would you say this was and he was comforted feeling that with her taste she was taking a real interest in these things for after all nothing better composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china  when the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last he said  you must come again you must come to lunch then i can show you these by daylight and my little sweetshes a dear little thing this dog seems to have taken a fancy to you  for balthasar feeling that she was about to leave was rubbing his side against her leg going out under the porch with her he said  hell get you up in an hour and a quarter take this for your protegees and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand he saw her brightened eyes and heard her murmur oh uncle jolyon and a real throb of pleasure went through him that meant one or two poor creatures helped a little and it meant that she would come again he put his hand in at the window and grasped hers once more the carriage rolled away he stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees and thought a sweet night she     ii  two days of rain and summer set in bland and sunny old jolyon walked and talked with holly at first he felt taller and full of a new vigour then he felt restless almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice and walk as far as the log well shes not there he would think of course not and he would feel a little shorter and drag his feet walking up the hill home with his hand clapped to his left side now and then the thought would move in him did she comeor did i dream it and he would stare at space while the dog balthasar stared at him of course she would not come again he opened the letters from spain with less excitement they were not returning till july he felt oddly that he could bear it every day at dinner he screwed up his eyes and looked at where she had sat she was not there so he unscrewed his eyes again  on the seventh afternoon he thought i must go up and get some boots he ordered beacon and set out passing from putney towards hyde park he reflected i might as well go to chelsea and see her and he called out just drive me to where you took that lady the other night the coachman turned his broad red face and his juicy lips answered the lady in grey sir  yes the lady in grey what other ladies were there stodgy chap  the carriage stopped before a small threestoried block of flats standing a little back from the river with a practised eye old jolyon saw that they were cheap i should think about sixty pound a year he mused and entering he looked at the nameboard the name forsyte was not on it but against first floor flat c were the words mrs irene heron ah she had taken her maiden name again and somehow this pleased him he went upstairs slowly feeling his side a little he stood a moment before ringing to lose the feeling of drag and fluttering there she would not be in and thenboots the thought was black what did he want with boots at his age he could not wear out all those he had  your mistress at home  yes sir  say mr jolyon forsyte  yes sir will you come this way  old jolyon followed a very little maidnot more than sixteen one would sayinto a very small drawingroom where the sunblinds were drawn it held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and good taste he stood in the middle with his top hat in his hand and thought i expect shes very badly off there was a mirror above the fireplace and he saw himself reflected an oldlooking chap he heard a rustle and turned round she was so close that his moustache almost brushed her forehead just under her hair  i was driving up he said thought id look in on you and ask you how you got up the other night  and seeing her smile he felt suddenly relieved she was really glad to see him perhaps  would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the park  but while she was gone to put her hat on he frowned the park james and emily mrs nicholas or some other member of his precious family would be there very likely prancing up and down and they would go and wag their tongues about having seen him with her afterwards better not he did not wish to revive the echoes of the past on forsyte change he removed a white hair from the lapel of his closelybuttonedup frock coat and passed his hand over his cheeks moustache and square chin it felt very hollow there under the cheekbones he had not been eating much latelyhe had better get that little whippersnapper who attended holly to give him a tonic but she had come back and when they were in the carriage he said  suppose we go and sit in kensington gardens instead and added with a twinkle no prancing up and down there as if she had been in the secret of his thoughts  leaving the carriage they entered those select precincts and strolled towards the water  youve gone back to your maiden name i see he said im not sorry  she slipped her hand under his arm has june forgiven me uncle jolyon  he answered gently yesyes of course why not  and have you  i i forgave you as soon as i saw how the land really lay and perhaps he had his instinct had always been to forgive the beautiful  she drew a deep breath i never regrettedi couldnt did you ever love very deeply uncle jolyon  at that strange question old jolyon stared before him had he he did not seem to remember that he ever had but he did not like to say this to the young woman whose hand was touching his arm whose life was suspended as it were by memory of a tragic love and he thought if i had met you when i was young ii might have made a fool of myself perhaps and a longing to escape in generalities beset him  loves a queer thing he said fatal thing often it was the greekswasnt itmade love into a goddess they were right i dare say but then they lived in the golden age  phil adored them  phil the word jarred him for suddenlywith his power to see all round a thing he perceived why she was putting up with him like this she wanted to talk about her lover well if it was any pleasure to her and he said ah there was a bit of the sculptor in him i fancy  yes he loved balance and symmetry he loved the wholehearted way the greeks gave themselves to art  balance the chap had no balance at all if he remembered as for symmetrycleanbuilt enough he was no doubt but those queer eyes of his and high cheekbonessymmetry  youre of the golden age too uncle jolyon  old jolyon looked round at her was she chaffing him no her eyes were soft as velvet was she flattering him but if so why there was nothing to be had out of an old chap like him  phil thought so he used to say but i can never tell him that i admire him  ah there it was again her dead lover her desire to talk of him and he pressed her arm half resentful of those memories half grateful as if he recognised what a link they were between herself and him  he was a very talented young fellow he murmured its hot i feel the heat nowadays lets sit down  they took two chairs beneath a chestnut tree whose broad leaves covered them from the peaceful glory of the afternoon a pleasure to sit there and watch her and feel that she liked to be with him and the wish to increase that liking if he could made him go on  i expect he showed you a side of him i never saw hed be at his best with you his ideas of art were a little newto me he had stiffed the word fangled  yes but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty old jolyon thought the devil he did but answered with a twinkle well i have or i shouldnt be sitting here with you she was fascinating when she smiled with her eyes like that  he thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old phil had real insight  he was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past out of a longing to talk of her dead lovernot a bit and yet it was precious to hear because she pleased his eyes and heart whichquite truehad never grown old was that becauseunlike her and her dead lover he had never loved to desperation had always kept his balance his sense of symmetry well it had left him power at eightyfour to admire beauty and he thought if i were a painter or a sculptor but im an old chap make hay while the sun shines  a couple with arms entwined crossed on the grass before them at the edge of the shadow from their tree the sunlight fell cruelly on their pale squashed unkempt young faces were an ugly lot said old jolyon suddenly it amazes me to see howlove triumphs over that  love triumphs over everything  the young think so he muttered  love has no age no limit and no death  with that glow in her pale face her breast heaving her eyes so large and dark and soft she looked like venus come to life but this extravagance brought instant reaction and twinkling he said well if it had limits we shouldnt be born for by george its got a lot to put up with  then removing his top hat he brushed it round with a cuff the great clumsy thing heated his forehead in these days he often got a rush of blood to the headhis circulation was not what it had been  she still sat gazing straight before her and suddenly she murmured  its strange enough that im alive  those words of jos wild and lost came back to him  ah he said my son saw you for a momentthat day  was it your son i heard a voice in the hall i thought for a second it wasphil  old jolyon saw her lips tremble she put her hand over them took it away again and went on calmly that night i went to the embankment a woman caught me by the dress she told me about herself when one knows that others suffer ones ashamed  one of those  she nodded and horror stirred within old jolyon the horror of one who has never known a struggle with desperation almost against his will he muttered tell me wont you  i didnt care whether i lived or died when youre like that fate ceases to want to kill you she took care of me three daysshe never left me i had no money thats why i do what i can for them now  but old jolyon was thinking no money what fate could compare with that every other was involved in it  i wish you had come to me he said why didnt you but irene did not answer  because my name was forsyte i suppose or was it june who kept you away how are you getting on now his eyes involuntarily swept her body perhaps even now she was and yet she wasnt thinnot really  oh with my fifty pounds a year i make just enough the answer did not reassure him he had lost confidence and that fellow soames but his sense of justice stifled condemnation no she would certainly have died rather than take another penny from him soft as she looked there must be strength in her somewherestrength and fidelity but what business had young bosinney to have got run over and left her stranded like this  well you must come to me now he said for anything you want or i shall be quite cut up and putting on his hat he rose lets go and get some tea i told that lazy chap to put the horses up for an hour and come for me at your place well take a cab presently i cant walk as i used to  he enjoyed that stroll to the kensington end of the gardensthe sound of her voice the glancing of her eyes the subtle beauty of a charming form moving beside him he enjoyed their tea at ruffels in the high street and came out thence with a great box of chocolates swung on his little finger he enjoyed the drive back to chelsea in a hansom smoking his cigar she had promised to come down next sunday and play to him again and already in thought he was plucking carnations and early roses for her to carry back to town it was a pleasure to give her a little pleasure if it were pleasure from an old chap like him the carriage was already there when they arrived just like that fellow who was always late when he was wanted old jolyon went in for a minute to say goodbye the little dark hall of the flat was impregnated with a disagreeable odour of patchouli and on a bench against the wallits only furniturehe saw a figure sitting he heard irene say softly just one minute in the little drawingroom when the door was shut he asked gravely one of your protegees  yes now thanks to you i can do something for her  he stood staring and stroking that chin whose strength had frightened so many in its time the idea of her thus actually in contact with this outcast grieved and frightened him what could she do for them nothing only soil and make trouble for herself perhaps and he said take care my dear the world puts the worst construction on everything  i know that  he was abashed by her quiet smile well thensunday he murmured goodbye  she put her cheek forward for him to kiss  goodbye he said again take care of yourself and he went out not looking towards the figure on the bench he drove home by way of hammersmith that he might stop at a place he knew of and tell them to send her in two dozen of their best burgundy she must want pickingup sometimes only in richmond park did he remember that he had gone up to order himself some boots and was surprised that he could have had so paltry an idea     iii  the little spirits of the past which throng an old mans days had never pushed their faces up to his so seldom as in the seventy hours elapsing before sunday came the spirit of the future with the charm of the unknown put up her lips instead old jolyon was not restless now and paid no visits to the log because she was coming to lunch there is wonderful finality about a meal it removes a world of doubts for no one misses meals except for reasons beyond control he played many games with holly on the lawn pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be ready to bowl to jolly in the holidays for she was not a forsyte but jolly wasand forsytes always bat until they have resigned and reached the age of eightyfive the dog balthasar in attendance lay on the ball as often as he could and the pageboy fielded till his face was like the harvest moon and because the time was getting shorter each day was longer and more golden than the last on friday night he took a liver pill his side hurt him rather and though it was not the liver side there is no remedy like that anyone telling him that he had found a new excitement in life and that excitement was not good for him would have been met by one of those steady and rather defiant looks of his deepset irongrey eyes which seemed to say i know my own business best he always had and always would  on sunday morning when holly had gone with her governess to church he visited the strawberry beds there accompanied by the dog balthasar he examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen berries which were really ripe stooping was not good for him and he became very dizzy and red in the forehead having placed the strawberries in a dish on the diningtable he washed his hands and bathed his forehead with eau de cologne there before the mirror it occurred to him that he was thinner what a threadpaper he had been when he was young it was nice to be slimhe could not bear a fat chap and yet perhaps his cheeks were too thin she was to arrive by train at halfpast twelve and walk up entering from the road past drages farm at the far end of the coppice and having looked into junes room to see that there was hot water ready he set forth to meet her leisurely for his heart was beating the air smelled sweet larks sang and the grand stand at epsom was visible a perfect day on just such a one no doubt six years ago soames had brought young bosinney down with him to look at the site before they began to build it was bosinney who had pitched on the exact spot for the houseas june had often told him in these days he was thinking much about that young fellow as if his spirit were really haunting the field of his last work on the chance of seeingher bosinneythe one man who had possessed her heart to whom she had given her whole self with rapture at his age one could not of course imagine such things but there stirred in him a queer vague achingas it were the ghost of an impersonal jealousy and a feeling too more generous of pity for that love so early lost all over in a few poor months well well he looked at his watch before entering the coppiceonly a quarter past twentyfive minutes to wait and then turning the corner of the path he saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time on the log and realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit there alone for a couple of hours at least two hours of her society missed what memory could make that log so dear to her his face showed what he was thinking for she said at once  forgive me uncle jolyon it was here that i first knew  yes yes there it is for you whenever you like youre looking a little londony youre giving too many lessons  that she should have to give lessons worried him lessons to a parcel of young girls thumping out scales with their thick fingers  where do you go to give them he asked  theyre mostly jewish families luckily  old jolyon stared to all forsytes jews seem strange and doubtful  they love music and theyre very kind  they had better be by george he took her armhis side always hurt him a little going uphilland said  did you ever see anything like those buttercups they came like that in a night  her eyes seemed really to fly over the field like bees after the flowers and the honey i wanted you to see themwouldnt let them turn the cows in yet then remembering that she had come to talk about bosinney he pointed to the clocktower over the stables  i expect he wouldnt have let me put that therehad no notion of time if i remember  but pressing his arm to her she talked of flowers instead and he knew it was done that he might not feel she came because of her dead lover  the best flower i can show you he said with a sort of triumph is my little sweet shell be back from church directly theres something about her which reminds me a little of you and it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus instead of saying theres something about you which reminds me a little of her ah and here she was  holly followed closely by her elderly french governess whose digestion had been ruined twentytwo years ago in the siege of strasbourg came rushing towards them from under the oak tree she stopped about a dozen yards away to pat balthasar and pretend that this was all she had in her mind old jolyon who knew better said  well my darling heres the lady in grey i promised you  holly raised herself and looked up he watched the two of them with a twinkle irene smiling holly beginning with grave inquiry passing into a shy smile too and then to something deeper she had a sense of beauty that childknew what was what he enjoyed the sight of the kiss between them  mrs heron mamzelle beauce well mamzellegood sermon  for now that he had not much more time before him the only part of the service connected with this world absorbed what interest in church remained to him mamzelle beauce stretched out a spidery hand clad in a black kid gloveshe had been in the best familiesand the rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish face seemed to ask are you wellbrrred whenever holly or jolly did anything unpleasing to hera not uncommon occurrenceshe would say to them the little tayleurs never did thatthey were such wellbrrred little children jolly hated the little tayleurs holly wondered dreadfully how it was she fell so short of them a thin rum little soul old jolyon thought hermamzelle beauce  luncheon was a successful meal the mushrooms which he himself had picked in the mushroom house his chosen strawberries and another bottle of the steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain aromatic spirituality and a conviction that he would have a touch of eczema tomorrow  after lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking turkish coffee it was no matter of grief to him when mademoiselle beauce withdrew to write her sunday letter to her sister whose future had been endangered in the past by swallowing a pinan event held up daily in warning to the children to eat slowly and digest what they had eaten at the foot of the bank on a carriage rug holly and the dog balthasar teased and loved each other and in the shade old jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar luxuriously savoured gazed at irene sitting in the swing a light vaguely swaying grey figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon it lips just opened eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped she looked content surely it did her good to come and see him the selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him for he could still feel pleasure in the pleasure of others realising that what he wanted though much was not quite all that mattered  its quiet here he said you mustnt come down if you find it dull but its a pleasure to see you my little sweet is the only face which gives me any pleasure except yours  from her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be appreciated and this reassured him thats not humbug he said i never told a woman i admired her when i didnt in fact i dont know when ive told a woman i admired her except my wife in the old days and wives are funny he was silent but resumed abruptly  she used to expect me to say it more often than i felt it and there we were her face looked mysteriously troubled and afraid that he had said something painful he hurried on when my little sweet marries i hope shell find someone who knows what women feel i shant be here to see it but theres too much topsyturvydom in marriage i dont want her to pitch up against that and aware that he had made bad worse he added that dog will scratch  a silence followed of what was she thinking this pretty creature whose life was spoiled who had done with love and yet was made for love some day when he was gone perhaps she would find another matenot so disorderly as that young fellow who had got himself run over ah but her husband  does soames never trouble you he asked  she shook her head her face had closed up suddenly for all her softness there was something irreconcilable about her and a glimpse of light on the inexorable nature of sex antipathies strayed into a brain which belonging to early victorian civilisationso much older than this of his old agehad never thought about such primitive things  thats a comfort he said you can see the grand stand today shall we take a turn round  through the flower and fruit garden against whose high outer walls peach trees and nectarines were trained to the sun through the stables the vinery the mushroom house the asparagus beds the rosery the summerhouse he conducted hereven into the kitchen garden to see the tiny green peas which holly loved to scoop out of their pods with her finger and lick up from the palm of her little brown hand many delightful things he showed her while holly and the dog balthasar danced ahead or came to them at intervals for attention it was one of the happiest afternoons he had ever spent but it tired him and he was glad to sit down in the music room and let her give him tea a special little friend of hollys had come ina fair child with short hair like a boys and the two sported in the distance under the stairs on the stairs and up in the gallery old jolyon begged for chopin she played studies mazurkas waltzes till the two children creeping near stood at the foot of the piano their dark and golden heads bent forward listening old jolyon watched  lets see you dance you two  shyly with a false start they began bobbing and circling earnest not very adroit they went past and past his chair to the strains of that waltz he watched them and the face of her who was playing turned smiling towards those little dancers thinking  sweetest picture ive seen for ages  a voice said  hollee mais enfinquestce que tu fais ladanser le dimanche viens donc  but the children came close to old jolyon knowing that he would save them and gazed into a face which was decidedly caught out  better the day better the deed mamzelle its all my doing trot along chicks and have your tea  and when they were gone followed by the dog balthasar who took every meal he looked at irene with a twinkle and said  well there we are arent they sweet have you any little ones among your pupils  yes threetwo of them darlings  pretty  lovely  old jolyon sighed he had an insatiable appetite for the very young my little sweet he said is devoted to music shell be a musician some day you wouldnt give me your opinion of her playing i suppose  of course i will  you wouldnt like but he stifled the words to give her lessons the idea that she gave lessons was unpleasant to him yet it would mean that he would see her regularly she left the piano and came over to his chair  i would like very much but there isjune when are they coming back  old jolyon frowned not till the middle of next month what does that matter  you said june had forgiven me but she could never forget uncle jolyon  forget she must forget if he wanted her to  but as if answering irene shook her head you know she couldnt one doesnt forget  always that wretched past and he said with a sort of vexed finality  well we shall see  he talked to her an hour or more of the children and a hundred little things till the carriage came round to take her home and when she had gone he went back to his chair and sat there smoothing his face and chin dreaming over the day  that evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet of paper he stayed for some minutes without writing then rose and stood under the masterpiece dutch fishing boats at sunset he was not thinking of that picture but of his life he was going to leave her something in his will nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of thought and memory he was going to leave her a portion of his wealth of his aspirations deeds qualities workall that had made that wealth going to leave her too a part of all he had missed in life by his sane and steady pursuit of wealth all what had he missed dutch fishing boats responded blankly he crossed to the french window and drawing the curtain aside opened it a wind had got up and one of last years oak leaves which had somehow survived the gardeners brooms was dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone terrace in the twilight except for that it was very quiet out there and he could smell the heliotrope watered not long since a bat went by a bird uttered its last cheep and right above the oak tree the first star shone faust in the opera had bartered his soul for some fresh years of youth morbid notion no such bargain was possible that was real tragedy no making oneself new again for love or life or anything nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while you could and leave it something in your will but how much and as if he could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of the country night he turned back and went up to the chimneypiece there were his pet bronzesa cleopatra with the asp at her breast a socrates a greyhound playing with her puppy a strong man reining in some horses they last he thought and a pang went through his heart they had a thousand years of life before them  how much well enough at all events to save her getting old before her time to keep the lines out of her face as long as possible and grey from soiling that bright hair he might live another five years she would be well over thirty by then how much she had none of his blood in her in loyalty to the tenor of his life for forty years and more ever since he married and founded that mysterious thing a family came this warning thoughtnone of his blood no right to anything it was a luxury then this notion an extravagance a petting of an old mans whim one of those things done in dotage his real future was vested in those who had his blood in whom he would live on when he was gone he turned away from the bronzes and stood looking at the old leather chair in which he had sat and smoked so many hundreds of cigars and suddenly he seemed to see her sitting there in her grey dress fragrant soft darkeyed graceful looking up at him why she cared nothing for him really all she cared for was that lost lover of hers but she was there whether she would or no giving him pleasure with her beauty and grace one had no right to inflict an old mans company no right to ask her down to play to him and let him look at herfor no reward pleasure must be paid for in this world how much after all there was plenty his son and his three grandchildren would never miss that little lump he had made it himself nearly every penny he could leave it where he liked allow himself this little pleasure he went back to the bureau well im going to he thought let them think what they like im going to and he sat down  how much ten thousand twenty thousandhow much if only with his money he could buy one year one month of youth and startled by that thought he wrote quickly  dear herringdraw me a codicil to this effect i leave to my niece irene forsyte born irene heron by which name she now goes fifteen thousand pounds free of legacy duty yours faithfully jolyon forsyte  when he had sealed and stamped the envelope he went back to the window and drew in a long breath it was dark but many stars shone now     iv  he woke at halfpast two an hour which long experience had taught him brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts experience had also taught him that a further waking at the proper hour of eight showed the folly of such panic on this particular morning the thought which gathered rapid momentum was that if he became ill at his age not improbable he would not see her from this it was but a step to realisation that he would be cut off too when his son and june returned from spain how could he justify desire for the company of one who had stolenearly morning does not mince wordsjunes lover that lover was dead but june was a stubborn little thing warmhearted but stubborn as wood andquite truenot one who forgot by the middle of next month they would be back he had barely five weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had come into what remained of his life darkness showed up to him absurdly clear the nature of his feeling admiration for beautya craving to see that which delighted his eyes  preposterous at his age and yetwhat other reason was there for asking june to undergo such painful reminder and how prevent his son and his sons wife from thinking him very queer he would be reduced to sneaking up to london which tired him and the least indisposition would cut him off even from that he lay with eyes open setting his jaw against the prospect and calling himself an old fool while his heart beat loudly and then seemed to stop beating altogether he had seen the dawn lighting the window chinks heard the birds chirp and twitter and the cocks crow before he fell asleep again and awoke tired but sane five weeks before he need bother at his age an eternity but that early morning panic had left its mark had slightly fevered the will of one who had always had his own way he would see her as often as he wished why not go up to town and make that codicil at his solicitors instead of writing about it she might like to go to the opera but by train for he would not have that fat chap beacon grinning behind his back servants were such fools and as likely as not they had known all the past history of irene and young bosinneyservants knew everything and suspected the rest he wrote to her that morning  my dear irenei have to be up in town tomorrow if you would like to have a look in at the opera come and dine with me quietly   but where it was decades since he had dined anywhere in london save at his club or at a private house ah that newfangled place close to covent garden   let me have a line tomorrow morning to the piedmont hotel whether to expect you there at 7 oclock  yours affectionately  jolyon forsyte   she would understand that he just wanted to give her a little pleasure for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to see her was instinctively unpleasant to him it was not seemly that one so old should go out of his way to see beauty especially in a woman  the journey next day short though it was and the visit to his lawyers tired him it was hot too and after dressing for dinner he lay down on the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little he must have had a sort of fainting fit for he came to himself feeling very queer and with some difficulty rose and rang the bell why it was past seven and there he was and she would be waiting but suddenly the dizziness came on again and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa he heard the maids voice say  did you ring sir  yes come here he could not see her clearly for the cloud in front of his eyes im not well i want some sal volatile  yes sir her voice sounded frightened  old jolyon made an effort  dont go take this message to my niecea lady waiting in the halla lady in grey say mr forsyte is not wellthe heat he is very sorry if he is not down directly she is not to wait dinner  when she was gone he thought feebly why did i say a lady in greyshe may be in anything sal volatile he did not go off again yet was not conscious of how irene came to be standing beside him holding smelling salts to his nose and pushing a pillow up behind his head he heard her say anxiously dear uncle jolyon what is it was dimly conscious of the soft pressure of her lips on his hand then drew a long breath of smelling salts suddenly discovered strength in them and sneezed  ha he said its nothing how did you get here go down and dinethe tickets are on the dressingtable i shall be all right in a minute  he felt her cool hand on his forehead smelled violets and sat divided between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right  why you are in grey he said help me up once on his feet he gave himself a shake  what business had i to go off like that and he moved very slowly to the glass what a cadaverous chap her voice behind him murmured  you mustnt come down uncle you must rest  fiddlesticks a glass of champagnell soon set me to rights i cant have you missing the opera  but the journey down the corridor was troublesome what carpets they had in these newfangled places so thick that you tripped up in them at every step in the lift he noticed how concerned she looked and said with the ghost of a twinkle  im a pretty host  when the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to prevent its slipping under him but after soup and a glass of champagne he felt much better and began to enjoy an infirmity which had brought such solicitude into her manner towards him  i should have liked you for a daughter he said suddenly and watching the smile in her eyes went on  you mustnt get wrapped up in the past at your time of life plenty of that when you get to my age thats a nice dressi like the style  i made it myself  ah a woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her interest in life  make hay while the sun shines he said and drink that up i want to see some colour in your cheeks we mustnt waste life it doesnt do theres a new marguerite tonight lets hope she wont be fat and mephistoanything more dreadful than a fat chap playing the devil i cant imagine  but they did not go to the opera after all for in getting up from dinner the dizziness came over him again and she insisted on his staying quiet and going to bed early when he parted from her at the door of the hotel having paid the cabman to drive her to chelsea he sat down again for a moment to enjoy the memory of her words you are such a darling to me uncle jolyon why who wouldnt be he would have liked to stay up another day and take her to the zoo but two days running of him would bore her to death no he must wait till next sunday she had promised to come then they would settle those lessons for holly if only for a month it would be something that little mamzelle beauce wouldnt like it but she would have to lump it and crushing his old opera hat against his chest he sought the lift  he drove to waterloo next morning struggling with a desire to say drive me to chelsea but his sense of proportion was too strong besides he still felt shaky and did not want to risk another aberration like that of last night away from home holly too was expecting him and what he had in his bag for her not that there was any cupboard love in his little sweetshe was a bundle of affection then with the rather bitter cynicism of the old he wondered for a second whether it was not cupboard love which made irene put up with him no she was not that sort either she had if anything too little notion of how to butter her bread no sense of property poor thing besides he had not breathed a word about that codicil nor should hesufficient unto the day was the good thereof  in the victoria which met him at the station holly was restraining the dog balthasar and their caresses made jubey his drive home all the rest of that fine hot day and most of the next he was content and peaceful reposing in the shade while the long lingering sunshine showered gold on the lawns and the flowers but on thursday evening at his lonely dinner he began to count the hours sixtyfive till he would go down to meet her again in the little coppice and walk up through the fields at her side he had intended to consult the doctor about his fainting fit but the fellow would be sure to insist on quiet no excitement and all that and he did not mean to be tied by the leg did not want to be told of an infirmityif there were one could not afford to hear of it at his time of life now that this new interest had come and he carefully avoided making any mention of it in a letter to his son it would only bring them back with a run how far this silence was due to consideration for their pleasure how far to regard for his own he did not pause to consider  that night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was dozing off when he heard the rustle of a gown and was conscious of a scent of violets opening his eyes he saw her dressed in grey standing by the fireplace holding out her arms the odd thing was that though those arms seemed to hold nothing they were curved as if round someones neck and her own neck was bent back her lips open her eyes closed she vanished at once and there were the mantelpiece and his bronzes but those bronzes and the mantelpiece had not been there when she was only the fireplace and the wall shaken and troubled he got up i must take medicine he thought i cant be well his heart beat too fast he had an asthmatic feeling in the chest and going to the window he opened it to get some air a dog was barking far away one of the dogs at gages farm no doubt beyond the coppice a beautiful still night but dark i dropped off he mused thats it and yet ill swear my eyes were open a sound like a sigh seemed to answer  whats that he said sharply whos there  putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart he stepped out on the terrace something soft scurried by in the dark shoo it was that great grey cat young bosinney was like a great cat he thought it was him in there that shethat she washes got her still he walked to the edge of the terrace and looked down into the darkness he could just see the powdering of the daisies on the unmown lawn here today and gone tomorrow and there came the moon who saw all young and old alive and dead and didnt care a dump his own turn soon for a single day of youth he would give what was left and he turned again towards the house he could see the windows of the night nursery up there his little sweet would be asleep hope that dog wont wake her he thought what is it makes us love and makes us die i must go to bed  and across the terrace stones growing grey in the moonlight he passed back within  how should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his wellspent past in that at all events there is no agitating warmth only pale winter sunshine the shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos of memory the present he should distrust the future shun from beneath thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes if there be sun of summer let him not go out into it mistaking it for the indiansummer sun thus peradventure he shall decline softly slowly imperceptibly until impatient nature clutches his windpipe and he gasps away to death some early morning before the world is aired and they put on his tombstone in the fulness of years yea if he preserve his principles in perfect order a forsyte may live on long after he is dead  old jolyon was conscious of all this and yet there was in him that which transcended forsyteism for it is written that a forsyte shall not love beauty more than reason nor his own way more than his own health and something beat within him in these days that with each throb fretted at the thinning shell his sagacity knew this but it knew too that he could not stop that beating nor would if he could and yet if you had told him he was living on his capital he would have stared you down no no a man did not live on his capital it was not done the shibboleths of the past are ever more real than the actualities of the present and he to whom living on ones capital had always been anathema could not have borne to have applied so gross a phrase to his own case pleasure is healthful beauty good to see to live again in the youth of the youngand what else on earth was he doing  methodically as had been the way of his whole life he now arranged his time on tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train irene came and dined with him and they went to the opera on thursdays he drove to town and putting that fat chap and his horses up met her in kensington gardens picking up the carriage after he had left her and driving home again in time for dinner he threw out the casual formula that he had business in london on those two days on wednesdays and saturdays she came down to give holly music lessons the greater the pleasure he took in her society the more scrupulously fastidious he became just a matteroffact and friendly uncle not even in feeling really was he morefor after all there was his age and yet if she were late he fidgeted himself to death if she missed coming which happened twice his eyes grew sad as an old dogs and he failed to sleep  and so a month went bya month of summer in the fields and in his heart with summers heat and the fatigue thereof who could have believed a few weeks back that he would have looked forward to his sons and his granddaughters return with something like dread there was such a delicious freedom such recovery of that independence a man enjoys before he founds a family about these weeks of lovely weather and this new companionship with one who demanded nothing and remained always a little unknown retaining the fascination of mystery it was like a draught of wine to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has almost forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood the narcotic to his brain the flowers were coloured brighter scents and music and the sunlight had a living valuewere no longer mere reminders of past enjoyment there was something now to live for which stirred him continually to anticipation he lived in that not in retrospection the difference is considerable to any so old as he the pleasures of the table never of much consequence to one naturally abstemious had lost all value he ate little without knowing what he ate and every day grew thinner and more worn to look at he was again a threadpaper and to this thinned form his massive forehead with hollows at the temples gave more dignity than ever he was very well aware that he ought to see the doctor but liberty was too sweet he could not afford to pet his frequent shortness of breath and the pain in his side at the expense of liberty return to the vegetable existence he had led among the agricultural journals with the lifesize mangold wurzels before this new attraction came into his lifeno he exceeded his allowance of cigars two a day had always been his rule now he smoked three and sometimes foura man will when he is filled with the creative spirit but very often he thought i must give up smoking and coffee i must give up rattling up to town but he did not there was no one in any sort of authority to notice him and this was a priceless boon  the servants perhaps wondered but they were naturally dumb mamzelle beauce was too concerned with her own digestion and too wellbrrred to make personal allusions holly had not as yet an eye for the relative appearance of him who was her plaything and her god it was left for irene herself to beg him to eat more to rest in the hot part of the day to take a tonic and so forth but she did not tell him that she was the cause of his thinnessfor one cannot see the havoc oneself is working a man of eightyfive has no passions but the beauty which produces passion works on in the old way till death closes the eyes which crave the sight of her  on the first day of the second week in july he received a letter from his son in paris to say that they would all be back on friday this had always been more sure than fate but with the pathetic improvidence given to the old that they may endure to the end he had never quite admitted it now he did and something would have to be done he had ceased to be able to imagine life without this new interest but that which is not imagined sometimes exists as forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost he sat in his old leather chair doubling up the letter and mumbling with his lips the end of an unlighted cigar after tomorrow his tuesday expeditions to town would have to be abandoned he could still drive up perhaps once a week on the pretext of seeing his man of business but even that would be dependent on his health for now they would begin to fuss about him the lessons the lessons must go on she must swallow down her scruples and june must put her feelings in her pocket she had done so once on the day after the news of bosinneys death what she had done then she could surely do again now four years since that injury was inflicted on hernot christian to keep the memory of old sores alive junes will was strong but his was stronger for his sands were running out irene was soft surely she would do this for him subdue her natural shrinking sooner than give him pain the lessons must continue for if they did he was secure and lighting his cigar at last he began trying to shape out how to put it to them all and explain this strange intimacy how to veil and wrap it away from the naked truththat he could not bear to be deprived of the sight of beauty ah holly holly was fond of her holly liked her lessons she would save himhis little sweet and with that happy thought he became serene and wondered what he had been worrying about so fearfully he must not worry it left him always curiously weak and as if but half present in his own body  that evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness though he did not faint he would not ring the bell because he knew it would mean a fuss and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous when one grew old the whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom and for what reasonjust to keep the breath in him a little longer he did not want it at such cost only the dog balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy instead of giving him a biscuit when at last old jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed and though still shaky next morning the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him it was always such a pleasure to give her a good dinnerhe suspected her of undereating when she was alone and at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten the unconscious smiling of her lips she hadnt much pleasure and this was the last time he would be able to give her that treat but when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him and the exertion too of telling her about junes return  the opera that evening was carmen and he chose the last entracte to break the news instinctively putting it off till the latest moment  she took it quietly queerly in fact he did not know how she had taken it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence became necessary the mask was down over her face that mask behind which so much went on that he could not see she wanted time to think it over no doubt he would not press her for she would be coming to give her lesson tomorrow afternoon and he should see her then when she had got used to the idea in the cab he talked only of the carmen he had seen better in the old days but this one was not bad at all when he took her hand to say goodnight she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead  goodbye dear uncle jolyon you have been so sweet to me  tomorrow then he said goodnight sleep well she echoed softly sleep well and from the cab window already moving away he saw her face screwed round towards him and her hand put out in a gesture which seemed to linger  he sought his room slowly they never gave him the same and he could not get used to these spickandspandy bedrooms with new furniture and greygreen carpets sprinkled all over with pink roses he was wakeful and that wretched habanera kept throbbing in his head  his french had never been equal to its words but its sense he knew if it had any sense a gipsy thingwild and unaccountable well there was in life something which upset all your care and planssomething which made men and women dance to its pipes and he lay staring from deepsunk eyes into the darkness where the unaccountable held sway you thought you had hold of life but it slipped away behind you took you by the scruff of the neck forced you here and forced you there and then likely as not squeezed life out of you it took the very stars like that he shouldnt wonder rubbed their noses together and flung them apart it had never done playing its pranks five million people in this great blunderbuss of a town and all of them at the mercy of that lifeforce like a lot of little dried peas hopping about on a board when you struck your fist on it ah well himself would not hop much longera good long sleep would do him good  how hot it was up herehow noisy his forehead burned she had kissed it just where he always worried just thereas if she had known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for him but instead her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness she had never spoken in quite that voice had never before made that lingering gesture or looked back at him as she drove away  he got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside his room faced down over the river there was little air but the sight of that breadth of water flowing by calm eternal soothed him the great thing he thought is not to make myself a nuisance ill think of my little sweet and go to sleep but it was long before the heat and throbbing of the london night died out into the short slumber of the summer morning and old jolyon had but forty winks  when he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden and with the help of holly who was very delicate with flowers gathered a great bunch of carnations they were he told her for the lady in greya name still bandied between them and he put them in a bowl in his study where he meant to tackle irene the moment she came on the subject of june and future lessons their fragrance and colour would help after lunch he lay down for he felt very tired and the carriage would not bring her from the station till four oclock but as the hour approached he grew restless and sought the schoolroom which overlooked the drive the sunblinds were down and holly was there with mademoiselle beauce sheltered from the heat of a stifling july day attending to their silkworms old jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical creatures whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants who nibbled such quantities of holes in nice green leaves and smelled as he thought horrid he sat down on a chintzcovered windowseat whence he could see the drive and get what air there was and the dog balthasar who appreciated chintz on hot days jumped up beside him over the cottage piano a violet dustsheet faded almost to grey was spread and on it the first lavender whose scent filled the room in spite of the coolness here perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his ebbeddown senses each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying brilliance that dog smelled very strong the lavender perfume was overpowering those silkworms heaving up their greygreen backs seemed horribly alive and hollys dark head bent over them had a wonderfully silky sheen a marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when you were old and weak it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms and its beating vitality he had never till those last few weeks had this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life and with the other half left on the bank watching that helpless progress only when irene was with him did he lose this double consciousness  holly turned her head pointed with her little brown fist to the pianofor to point with a finger was not wellbrrredand said slyly  look at the lady in grey gran isnt she pretty today  old jolyons heart gave a flutter and for a second the room was clouded then it cleared and he said with a twinkle  whos been dressing her up  mamzelle  hollee dont be foolish  that prim little frenchwoman she hadnt yet got over the music lessons being taken away from her that wouldnt help his little sweet was the only friend they had well they were her lessons and he shouldnt budge shouldnt budge for anything he stroked the warm wool on balthasars head and heard holly say when mothers home there wont be any changes will there she doesnt like strangers you know  the childs words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of opposition about old jolyon and disclose all the menace to his newfound freedom ah he would have to resign himself to being an old man at the mercy of care and love or fight to keep this new and prized companionship and to fight tired him to death but his thin worn face hardened into resolution till it appeared all jaw this was his house and his affair he should not budge he looked at his watch old and thin like himself he had owned it fifty years past four already and kissing the top of hollys head in passing he went down to the hall he wanted to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson at the first sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch and saw at once that the victoria was empty  the trains in sir but the lady asnt come  old jolyon gave him a sharp upward look his eyes seemed to push away that fat chaps curiosity and defy him to see the bitter disappointment he was feeling  very well he said and turned back into the house he went to his study and sat down quivering like a leaf what did this mean she might have lost her train but he knew well enough she hadnt goodbye dear uncle jolyon why goodbye and not goodnight and that hand of hers lingering in the air and her kiss what did it mean vehement alarm and irritation took possession of him he got up and began to pace the turkey carpet between window and wall she was going to give him up he felt it for certainand he defenceless an old man wanting to look on beauty it was ridiculous age closed his mouth paralysed his power to fight he had no right to what was warm and living no right to anything but memories and sorrow he could not plead with her even an old man has his dignity defenceless for an hour lost to bodily fatigue he paced up and down past the bowl of carnations he had plucked which mocked him with its scent of all things hard to bear the prostration of willpower is hardest for one who has always had his way nature had got him in its net and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes here and there found no hole no breaking point they brought him tea at five oclock and a letter for a moment hope beat up in him he cut the envelope with the butter knife and read   dearest uncle jolyoni cant bear to write anything that may disappoint you but i was too cowardly to tell you last night i feel i cant come down and give holly any more lessons now that june is coming back some things go too deep to be forgotten it has been such a joy to see you and holly perhaps i shall still see you sometimes when you come up though im sure its not good for you i can see you are tiring yourself too much i believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot weather and now you have your son and june coming back you will be so happy thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me  lovingly your irene   so there it was not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly cared about to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things the approach of death with its stealthy rustling footsteps not good for him not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him  his tea grew cold his cigar remained unlit and up and down he paced torn between his dignity and his hold on life intolerable to be squeezed out slowly without a say of your own to live on when your will was in the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love intolerable he would see what telling her the truth would dothe truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on he sat down at his old bureau and took a pen but he could not write there was something revolting in having to plead like this plead that she should warm his eyes with her beauty it was tantamount to confessing dotage he simply could not and instead he wrote   i had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be allowed to stand in the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to me and my little granddaughter but old men learn to forego their whims they are obliged to even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later and perhaps the sooner the better  my love to you  jolyon forsyte   bitter he thought but i cant help it im tired he sealed and dropped it into the box for the evening post and hearing it fall to the bottom thought there goes all ive looked forward to  that evening after dinner which he scarcely touched after his cigar which he left halfsmoked for it made him feel faint he went very slowly upstairs and stole into the nightnursery he sat down on the windowseat a nightlight was burning and he could just see hollys face with one hand underneath the cheek an early cockchafer buzzed in the japanese paper with which they had filled the grate and one of the horses in the stable stamped restlessly to sleep like that child he pressed apart two rungs of the venetian blind and looked out the moon was rising bloodred he had never seen so red a moon the woods and fields out there were dropping to sleep too in the last glimmer of the summer light and beauty like a spirit walked ive had a long life he thought the best of nearly everything im an ungrateful chap ive seen a lot of beauty in my time poor young bosinney said i had a sense of beauty theres a man in the moon tonight a moth went by another another ladies in grey he closed his eyes a feeling that he would never open them again beset him he let it grow let himself sink then with a shiver dragged the lids up there was something wrong with him no doubt deeply wrong he would have to have the doctor after all it didnt much matter now into that coppice the moonlight would have crept there would be shadows and those shadows would be the only things awake no birds beasts flowers insects just the shadows moving ladies in grey over that log they would climb would whisper together she and bosinney funny thought and the frogs and little things would whisper too how the clock ticked in here it was all eerieout there in the light of that red moon in here with the little steady nightlight and the ticking clock and the nurses dressinggown hanging from the edge of the screen tall like a womans figure lady in grey and a very odd thought beset him did she exist had she ever come at all or was she but the emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon the violetgrey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber hair who walks the dawn and the moonlight and at bluebell time what was she who was she did she exist he rose and stood a moment clutching the windowsill to give him a sense of reality again then began tiptoeing towards the door he stopped at the foot of the bed and holly as if conscious of his eyes fixed on her stirred sighed and curled up closer in defence he tiptoed on and passed out into the dark passage reached his room undressed at once and stood before a mirror in his nightshirt what a scarecrowwith temples fallen in and thin legs his eyes resisted his own image and a look of pride came on his face all was in league to pull him down even his reflection in the glass but he was not downyet he got into bed and lay a long time without sleeping trying to reach resignation only too well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for him  he woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for the doctor after sounding him the fellow pulled a face as long as your arm and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking that was no hardship there was nothing to get up for and when he felt ill tobacco always lost its savour he spent the morning languidly with the sunblinds down turning and returning the times not reading much the dog balthasar lying beside his bed with his lunch they brought him a telegram running thus  your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at fourthirty irene  coming down after all then she did existand he was not deserted coming down a glow ran through his limbs his cheeks and forehead felt hot he drank his soup and pushed the traytable away lying very quiet until they had removed lunch and left him alone but every now and then his eyes twinkled coming down his heart beat fast and then did not seem to beat at all at three oclock he got up and dressed deliberately noiselessly holly and mamzelle would be in the schoolroom and the servants asleep after their dinner he shouldnt wonder he opened his door cautiously and went downstairs in the hall the dog balthasar lay solitary and followed by him old jolyon passed into his study and out into the burning afternoon he meant to go down and meet her in the coppice but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat he sat down instead under the oak tree by the swing and the dog balthasar who also felt the heat lay down beside him he sat there smiling what a revel of bright minutes what a hum of insects and cooing of pigeons it was the quintessence of a summer day lovely and he was happyhappy as a sandboy whatever that might be she was coming she had not given him up he had everything in life he wantedexcept a little more breath and less weightjust here he would see her when she emerged from the fernery come swaying just a little a violetgrey figure passing over the daisies and dandelions and soldiers on the lawnthe soldiers with their flowery crowns he would not move but she would come up to him and say dear uncle jolyon i am sorry and sit in the swing and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very well but was all right now and that dog would lick her hand that dog knew his master was fond of her that dog was a good dog  it was quite shady under the tree the sun could not get at him only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the grand stand at epsom away out there very far and the cows cropping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with their tails he smelled the scent of limes and lavender ah that was why there was such a racket of bees they were excitedbusy as his heart was busy and excited drowsy too drowsy and drugged on honey and happiness as his heart was drugged and drowsy summersummerthey seemed saying great bees and little bees and the flies too  the stable clock struck four in half an hour she would be here he would have just one tiny nap because he had had so little sleep of late and then he would be fresh for her fresh for youth and beauty coming towards him across the sunlit lawnlady in grey and settling back in his chair he closed his eyes some thistledown came on what little air there was and pitched on his moustache more white than itself he did not know but his breathing stirred it caught there a ray of sunlight struck through and lodged on his boot a bumblebee alighted and strolled on the crown of his panama hat and the delicious surge of slumber reached the brain beneath that hat and the head swayed forward and rested on his breast summersummer so went the hum  the stable clock struck the quarter past the dog balthasar stretched and looked up at his master the thistledown no longer moved the dog placed his chin over the sunlit foot it did not stir the dog withdrew his chin quickly rose and leaped on old jolyons lap looked in his face whined then leaping down sat on his haunches gazing up and suddenly he uttered a long long howl  but the thistledown was still as death and the face of his old master  summersummersummer the soundless footsteps on the grass 1917      in chancery       two households both alike in dignity      from ancient grudge break into new mutiny      romeo and juliet   to jessie and joseph conrad     part 1     chapter iat timothys  the possessive instinct never stands still through florescence and feud frosts and fires it followed the laws of progression even in the forsyte family which had believed it fixed for ever nor can it be dissociated from environment any more than the quality of potato from the soil  the historian of the english eighties and nineties will in his good time depict the somewhat rapid progression from selfcontented and contained provincialism to still more selfcontented if less contained imperialismin other words the possessive instinct of the nation on the move and so as if in conformity was it with the forsyte family they were spreading not merely on the surface but within  when in 1895 susan hayman the married forsyte sister followed her husband at the ludicrously low age of seventyfour and was cremated it made strangely little stir among the six old forsytes left for this apathy there were three causes first the almost surreptitious burial of old jolyon in 1892 down at robin hillfirst of the forsytes to desert the family grave at highgate that burial coming a year after swithins entirely proper funeral had occasioned a great deal of talk on forsyte change the abode of timothy forsyte on the bayswater road london which still collected and radiated family gossip opinions ranged from the lamentation of aunt juley to the outspoken assertion of francie that it was a jolly good thing to stop all that stuffy highgate business uncle jolyon in his later yearsindeed ever since the strange and lamentable affair between his granddaughter junes lover young bosinney and irene his nephew soames forsytes wifehad noticeably rapped the familys knuckles and that way of his own which he had always taken had begun to seem to them a little wayward the philosophic vein in him of course had always been too liable to crop out of the strata of pure forsyteism so they were in a way prepared for his interment in a strange spot but the whole thing was an odd business and when the contents of his will became current coin on forsyte change a shiver had gone round the clan out of his estate l145304 gross with liabilities l35 7s 4d he had actually left l15000 to whomever do you think my dear to irene that runaway wife of his nephew soames irene a woman who had almost disgraced the family andstill more amazing was to him no blood relation not out and out of course only a life interestonly the income from it still there it was and old jolyons claim to be the perfect forsyte was ended once for all that then was the first reason why the burial of susan haymanat wokingmade little stir  the second reason was altogether more expansive and imperial besides the house on campden hill susan had a place left her by hayman when he died just over the border in hants where the hayman boys had learned to be such good shots and riders as it was believed which was of course nice for them and creditable to everybody and the fact of owning something really countrified seemed somehow to excuse the dispersion of her remainsthough what could have put cremation into her head they could not think the usual invitations however had been issued and soames had gone down and young nicholas and the will had been quite satisfactory so far as it went for she had only had a life interest and everything had gone quite smoothly to the children in equal shares  the third reason why susans burial made little stir was the most expansive of all it was summed up daringly by euphemia the pale the thin well i think people have a right to their own bodies even when theyre dead coming from a daughter of nicholas a liberal of the old school and most tyrannical it was a startling remarkshowing in a flash what a lot of water had run under bridges since the death of aunt ann in 86 just when the proprietorship of soames over his wifes body was acquiring the uncertainty which had led to such disaster euphemia of course spoke like a child and had no experience for though well over thirty by now her name was still forsyte but making all allowances her remark did undoubtedly show expansion of the principle of liberty decentralisation and shift in the central point of possession from others to oneself when nicholas heard his daughters remark from aunt hester he had rapped out wives and daughters theres no end to their liberty in these days i knew that jackson case would lead to thingslugging in habeas corpus like that he had of course never really forgiven the married womans property act which would so have interfered with him if he had not mercifully married before it was passed but in truth there was no denying the revolt among the younger forsytes against being owned by others that as it were colonial disposition to own oneself which is the paradoxical forerunner of imperialism was making progress all the time they were all now married except george confirmed to the turf and the iseeum club francie pursuing her musical career in a studio off the kings road chelsea and still taking lovers to dances euphemia living at home and complaining of nicholas and those two dromios giles and jesse hayman of the third generation there were not very manyyoung jolyon had three winifred dartie four young nicholas six already young roger had one marian tweetyman one st john hayman two but the rest of the sixteen marriedsoames rachel and cicely of james family eustace and thomas of rogers ernest archibald and florence of nicholas augustus and annabel spender of the haymanswere going down the years unreproduced  thus of the ten old forsytes twentyone young forsytes had been born but of the twentyone young forsytes there were as yet only seventeen descendants and it already seemed unlikely that there would be more than a further unconsidered trifle or so a student of statistics must have noticed that the birth rate had varied in accordance with the rate of interest for your money grandfather superior dosset forsyte in the early nineteenth century had been getting ten per cent for his hence ten children those ten leaving out the four who had not married and juley whose husband septimus small had of course died almost at once had averaged from four to five per cent for theirs and produced accordingly the twentyone whom they produced were now getting barely three per cent in the consols to which their father had mostly tied the settlements they made to avoid death duties and the six of them who had been reproduced had seventeen children or just the proper two and fivesixths per stem  there were other reasons too for this mild reproduction a distrust of their earning powers natural where a sufficiency is guaranteed together with the knowledge that their fathers did not die kept them cautious if one had children and not much income the standard of taste and comfort must of necessity go down what was enough for two was not enough for four and so onit would be better to wait and see what father did besides it was nice to be able to take holidays unhampered sooner in fact than own children they preferred to concentrate on the ownership of themselves conforming to the growing tendency fin de siecle as it was called in this way little risk was run and one would be able to have a motorcar indeed eustace already had one but it had shaken him horribly and broken one of his eye teeth so that it would be better to wait till they were a little safer in the meantime no more children even young nicholas was drawing in his horns and had made no addition to his six for quite three years  the corporate decay however of the forsytes their dispersion rather of which all this was symptomatic had not advanced so far as to prevent a rally when roger forsyte died in 1899 it had been a glorious summer and after holidays abroad and at the sea they were practically all back in london when roger with a touch of his old originality had suddenly breathed his last at his own house in princes gardens at timothys it was whispered sadly that poor roger had always been eccentric about his digestionhad he not for instance preferred german mutton to all the other brands  be that as it may his funeral at highgate had been perfect and coming away from it soames forsyte made almost mechanically for his uncle timothys in the bayswater road the old thingsaunt juley and aunt hesterwould like to hear about it his fatherjamesat eightyeight had not felt up to the fatigue of the funeral and timothy himself of course had not gone so that nicholas had been the only brother present still there had been a fair gathering and it would cheer aunts juley and hester up to know the kindly thought was not unmixed with the inevitable longing to get something out of everything you do which is the chief characteristic of forsytes and indeed of the saner elements in every nation in this practice of taking family matters to timothys in the bayswater road soames was but following in the footsteps of his father who had been in the habit of going at least once a week to see his sisters at timothys and had only given it up when he lost his nerve at eightysix and could not go out without emily to go with emily was of no use for who could really talk to anyone in the presence of his own wife like james in the old days soames found time to go there nearly every sunday and sit in the little drawingroom into which with his undoubted taste he had introduced a good deal of change and china not quite up to his own fastidious mark and at least two rather doubtful barbizon pictures at christmastides he himself who had done extremely well with the barbizons had for some years past moved towards the marises israels and mauve and was hoping to do better in the riverside house which he now inhabited near mapledurham he had a gallery beautifully hung and lighted to which few london dealers were strangers it served too as a sunday afternoon attraction in those weekend parties which his sisters winifred or rachel occasionally organised for him for though he was but a taciturn showman his quiet collected determinism seldom failed to influence his guests who knew that his reputation was grounded not on mere aesthetic fancy but on his power of gauging the future of market values when he went to timothys he almost always had some little tale of triumph over a dealer to unfold and dearly he loved that coo of pride with which his aunts would greet it this afternoon however he was differently animated coming from rogers funeral in his neat dark clothesnot quite black for after all an uncle was but an uncle and his soul abhorred excessive display of feeling leaning back in a marqueterie chair and gazing down his uplifted nose at the skyblue walls plastered with gold frames he was noticeably silent whether because he had been to a funeral or not the peculiar forsyte build of his face was seen to the best advantage this afternoona face concave and long with a jaw which divested of flesh would have seemed extravagant altogether a chinny face though not at all illlooking he was feeling more strongly than ever that timothys was hopelessly rumtitoo and the souls of his aunts dismally midvictorian the subject on which alone he wanted to talkhis own undivorced positionwas unspeakable and yet it occupied his mind to the exclusion of all else it was only since the spring that this had been so and a new feeling grown up which was egging him on towards what he knew might well be folly in a forsyte of fortyfive more and more of late he had been conscious that he was getting on the fortune already considerable when he conceived the house at robin hill which had finally wrecked his marriage with irene had mounted with surprising vigour in the twelve lonely years during which he had devoted himself to little else he was worth today well over a hundred thousand pounds and had no one to leave it tono real object for going on with what was his religion even if he were to relax his efforts money made money and he felt that he would have a hundred and fifty thousand before he knew where he was there had always been a strongly domestic philoprogenitive side to soames baulked and frustrated it had hidden itself away but now had crept out again in this his prime of life concreted and focussed of late by the attraction of a girls undoubted beauty it had become a veritable prepossession  and this girl was french not likely to lose her head or accept any unlegalised position moreover soames himself disliked the thought of that he had tasted of the sordid side of sex during those long years of forced celibacy secretively and always with disgust for he was fastidious and his sense of law and order innate he wanted no hole and corner liaison a marriage at the embassy in paris a few months travel and he could bring annette back quite separated from a past which in truth was not too distinguished for she only kept the accounts in her mothers soho restaurant he could bring her back as something very new and chic with her french taste and selfpossession to reign at the shelter near mapledurham on forsyte change and among his riverside friends it would be current that he had met a charming french girl on his travels and married her there would be the flavour of romance and a certain cachet about a french wife no he was not at all afraid of that it was only this cursed undivorced condition of his andand the question whether annette would take him which he dared not put to the touch until he had a clear and even dazzling future to offer her  in his aunts drawingroom he heard with but muffled ears those usual questions how was his dear father not going out of course now that the weather was turning chilly would soames be sure to tell him that hester had found boiled holly leaves most comforting for that pain in her side a poultice every three hours with red flannel afterwards and could he relish just a little pot of their very best prune preserveit was so delicious this year and had such a wonderful effect oh and about the dartieshad soames heard that dear winifred was having a most distressing time with montague timothy thought she really ought to have protection it was saidbut soames mustnt take this for certainthat he had given some of winifreds jewellery to a dreadful dancer it was such a bad example for dear val just as he was going to college soames had not heard oh but he must go and see his sister and look into it at once and did he think these boers were really going to resist timothy was in quite a stew about it the price of consols was so high and he had such a lot of money in them did soames think they must go down if there was a war soames nodded but it would be over very quickly it would be so bad for timothy if it wasnt and of course soames dear father would feel it very much at his age luckily poor dear roger had been spared this dreadful anxiety and aunt juley with a little handkerchief wiped away the large tear trying to climb the permanent pout on her now quite withered left cheek she was remembering dear roger and all his originality and how he used to stick pins into her when they were little together aunt hester with her instinct for avoiding the unpleasant here chimed in did soames think they would make mr chamberlain prime minister at once he would settle it all so quickly she would like to see that old kruger sent to st helena she could remember so well the news of napoleons death and what a relief it had been to his grandfather of course she and juleywe were in pantalettes then my dearhad not felt it much at the time  soames took a cup of tea from her drank it quickly and ate three of those macaroons for which timothys was famous his faint pale supercilious smile had deepened just a little really his family remained hopelessly provincial however much of london they might possess between them in these goahead days their provincialism stared out even more than it used to why old nicholas was still a free trader and a member of that antediluvian home of liberalism the remove clubthough to be sure the members were pretty well all conservatives now or he himself could not have joined and timothy they said still wore a nightcap aunt juley spoke again dear soames was looking so well hardly a day older than he did when dear ann died and they were all there together dear jolyon and dear swithin and dear roger she paused and caught the tear which had climbed the pout on her right cheek did hedid he ever hear anything of irene nowadays aunt hester visibly interposed her shoulder really juley was always saying something the smile left soames face and he put his cup down here was his subject broached for him and for all his desire to expand he could not take advantage  aunt juley went on rather hastily  they say dear jolyon first left her that fifteen thousand out and out then of course he saw it would not be right and made it for her life only  had soames heard that  soames nodded  your cousin jolyon is a widower now he is her trustee you knew that of course  soames shook his head he did know but wished to show no interest young jolyon and he had not met since the day of bosinneys death  he must be quite middleaged by now went on aunt juley dreamily let me see he was born when your dear uncle lived in mount street long before they went to stanhope gate in december just before that dreadful commune over fifty fancy that such a pretty baby and we were all so proud of him the very first of you all aunt juley sighed and a lock of not quite her own hair came loose and straggled so that aunt hester gave a little shiver soames rose he was experiencing a curious piece of selfdiscovery that old wound to his pride and selfesteem was not yet closed he had come thinking he could talk of it even wanting to talk of his fettered condition andbehold he was shrinking away from this reminder by aunt juley renowned for her malapropisms  oh soames was not going already  soames smiled a little vindictively and said  yes goodbye remember me to uncle timothy and leaving a cold kiss on each forehead whose wrinkles seemed to try and cling to his lips as if longing to be kissed away he left them looking brightly after himdear soames it had been so good of him to come today when they were not feeling very  with compunction tweaking at his chest soames descended the stairs where was always that rather pleasant smell of camphor and port wine and house where draughts are not permitted the poor old thingshe had not meant to be unkind and in the street he instantly forgot them repossessed by the image of annette and the thought of the cursed coil around him why had he not pushed the thing through and obtained divorce when that wretched bosinney was run over and there was evidence galore for the asking and he turned towards his sister winifred darties residence in green street mayfair     chapter iiexit a man of the world  that a man of the world so subject to the vicissitudes of fortunes as montague dartie should still be living in a house he had inhabited twenty years at least would have been more noticeable if the rent rates taxes and repairs of that house had not been defrayed by his fatherinlaw by that simple if wholesale device james forsyte had secured a certain stability in the lives of his daughter and his grandchildren after all there is something invaluable about a safe roof over the head of a sportsman so dashing as dartie until the events of the last few days he had been almostsupernaturally steady all this year the fact was he had acquired a half share in a filly of george forsytes who had gone irreparably on the turf to the horror of roger now stilled by the grave sleevelinks by martyr out of shirtonfire by suspender was a bay filly three years old who for a variety of reasons had never shown her true form with half ownership of this hopeful animal all the idealism latent somewhere in dartie as in every other man had put up its head and kept him quietly ardent for months past when a man has some thing good to live for it is astonishing how sober he becomes and what dartie had was really gooda three to one chance for an autumn handicap publicly assessed at twentyfive to one the oldfashioned heaven was a poor thing beside it and his shirt was on the daughter of shirtonfire but how much more than his shirt depended on this granddaughter of suspender at that roving age of fortyfive trying to forsytesand though perhaps less distinguishable from any other age trying even to dartiesmontague had fixed his current fancy on a dancer it was no mean passion but without money and a good deal of it likely to remain a love as airy as her skirts and dartie never had any money subsisting miserably on what he could beg or borrow from winifreda woman of character who kept him because he was the father of her children and from a lingering admiration for those nowdying wardour street good looks which in their youth had fascinated her she together with anyone else who would lend him anything and his losses at cards and on the turf extraordinary how some men make a good thing out of losses were his whole means of subsistence for james was now too old and nervous to approach and soames too formidably adamant it is not too much to say that dartie had been living on hope for months he had never been fond of money for itself had always despised the forsytes with their investing habits though careful to make such use of them as he could what he liked about money was what it boughtpersonal sensation  no real sportsman cares for money he would say borrowing a pony if it was no use trying for a monkey there was something delicious about montague dartie he was as george forsyte said a daisy  the morning of the handicap dawned clear and bright the last day of september and dartie who had travelled to newmarket the night before arrayed himself in spotless checks and walked to an eminence to see his half of the filly take her final canter if she won he would be a cool three thou in pocketa poor enough recompense for the sobriety and patience of these weeks of hope while they had been nursing her for this race but he had not been able to afford more should he lay it off at the eight to one to which she had advanced this was his single thought while the larks sang above him and the grassy downs smelled sweet and the pretty filly passed tossing her head and glowing like satin  after all if he lost it would not be he who paid and to lay it off would reduce his winnings to some fifteen hundredhardly enough to purchase a dancer out and out even more potent was the itch in the blood of all the darties for a real flutter and turning to george he said shes a clipper shell win hands down i shall go the whole hog george who had laid off every penny and a few besides and stood to win however it came out grinned down on him from his bulky height with the words so ho my wild one for after a chequered apprenticeship weathered with the money of a deeply complaining roger his forsyte blood was beginning to stand him in good stead in the profession of owner  there are moments of disillusionment in the lives of men from which the sensitive recorder shrinks suffice it to say that the good thing fell down sleevelinks finished in the ruck darties shirt was lost  between the passing of these things and the day when soames turned his face towards green street what had not happened  when a man with the constitution of montague dartie has exercised selfcontrol for months from religious motives and remains unrewarded he does not curse god and die he curses god and lives to the distress of his family  winifreda plucky woman if a little too fashionablewho had borne the brunt of him for exactly twentyone years had never really believed that he would do what he now did like so many wives she thought she knew the worst but she had not yet known him in his fortyfifth year when he like other men felt that it was now or never paying on the 2nd of october a visit of inspection to her jewel case she was horrified to observe that her womans crown and glory was gonethe pearls which montague had given her in 86 when benedict was born and which james had been compelled to pay for in the spring of 87 to save scandal she consulted her husband at once he poohpoohed the matter they would turn up nor till she said sharply very well then monty i shall go down to scotland yard myself did he consent to take the matter in hand alas that the steady and resolved continuity of design necessary to the accomplishment of sweeping operations should be liable to interruption by drink that night dartie returned home without a care in the world or a particle of reticence under normal conditions winifred would merely have locked her door and let him sleep it off but torturing suspense about her pearls had caused her to wait up for him taking a small revolver from his pocket and holding on to the dining table he told her at once that he did not care a cursh whether she lived slong as she was quiet but he himself wash tired o life winifred holding onto the other side of the dining table answered  dont be a clown monty have you been to scotland yard  placing the revolver against his chest dartie had pulled the trigger several times it was not loaded dropping it with an imprecation he had muttered for shake o the children and sank into a chair winifred having picked up the revolver gave him some soda water the liquor had a magical effect life had illused him winifred had never unshtoodm if he hadnt the right to take the pearls he had given her himself who had that spanish filly had gotm if winifred had any jection he wd cutherthroat what was the matter with that probably the first use of that celebrated phraseso obscure are the origins of even the most classical language  winifred who had learned selfcontainment in a hard school looked up at him and said spanish filly do you mean that girl we saw dancing in the pandemonium ballet well you are a thief and a blackguard it had been the last straw on a sorely loaded consciousness reaching up from his chair dartie seized his wifes arm and recalling the achievements of his boyhood twisted it winifred endured the agony with tears in her eyes but no murmur watching for a moment of weakness she wrenched it free then placing the dining table between them said between her teeth you are the limit monty undoubtedly the inception of that phraseso is english formed under the stress of circumstances leaving dartie with foam on his dark moustache she went upstairs and after locking her door and bathing her arm in hot water lay awake all night thinking of her pearls adorning the neck of another and of the consideration her husband had presumably received therefor  the man of the world awoke with a sense of being lost to that world and a dim recollection of having been called a limit he sat for half an hour in the dawn and the armchair where he had sleptperhaps the unhappiest halfhour he had ever spent for even to a dartie there is something tragic about an end and he knew that he had reached it never again would he sleep in his diningroom and wake with the light filtering through those curtains bought by winifred at nickens and jarveys with the money of james never again eat a devilled kidney at that rosewood table after a roll in the sheets and a hot bath he took his note case from his dress coat pocket four hundred pounds in fives and tensthe remainder of the proceeds of his half of sleevelinks sold last night cash down to george forsyte who having won over the race had not conceived the sudden dislike to the animal which he himself now felt the ballet was going to buenos aires the day after tomorrow and he was going too full value for the pearls had not yet been received he was only at the soup  he stole upstairs not daring to have a bath or shave besides the water would be cold he changed his clothes and packed stealthily all he could it was hard to leave so many shining boots but one must sacrifice something then carrying a valise in either hand he stepped out onto the landing the house was very quietthat house where he had begotten his four children it was a curious moment this outside the room of his wife once admired if not perhaps loved who had called him the limit he steeled himself with that phrase and tiptoed on but the next door was harder to pass it was the room his daughters slept in maud was at school but imogen would be lying there and moisture came into darties early morning eyes she was the most like him of the four with her dark hair and her luscious brown glance just coming out a pretty thing he set down the two valises this almost formal abdication of fatherhood hurt him the morning light fell on a face which worked with real emotion nothing so false as penitence moved him but genuine paternal feeling and that melancholy of never again he moistened his lips and complete irresolution for a moment paralysed his legs in their check trousers it was hardhard to be thus compelled to leave his home dnit he muttered i never thought it would come to this noises above warned him that the maids were beginning to get up and grasping the two valises he tiptoed on downstairs his cheeks were wet and the knowledge of that was comforting as though it guaranteed the genuineness of his sacrifice he lingered a little in the rooms below to pack all the cigars he had some papers a crush hat a silver cigarette box a ruffs guide then mixing himself a stiff whisky and soda and lighting a cigarette he stood hesitating before a photograph of his two girls in a silver frame it belonged to winifred never mind he thought she can get another taken and i cant he slipped it into the valise then putting on his hat and overcoat he took two others his best malacca cane an umbrella and opened the front door closing it softly behind him he walked out burdened as he had never been in all his life and made his way round the corner to wait there for an early cab to come by  thus had passed montague dartie in the fortyfifth year of his age from the house which he had called his own  when winifred came down and realised that he was not in the house her first feeling was one of dull anger that he should thus elude the reproaches she had carefully prepared in those long wakeful hours he had gone off to newmarket or brighton with that woman as likely as not disgusting forced to a complete reticence before imogen and the servants and aware that her fathers nerves would never stand the disclosure she had been unable to refrain from going to timothys that afternoon and pouring out the story of the pearls to aunts juley and hester in utter confidence it was only on the following morning that she noticed the disappearance of that photograph what did it mean careful examination of her husbands relics prompted the thought that he had gone for good as that conclusion hardened she stood quite still in the middle of his dressingroom with all the drawers pulled out to try and realise what she was feeling by no means easy though he was the limit he was yet her property and for the life of her she could not but feel the poorer to be widowed yet not widowed at fortytwo with four children made conspicuous an object of commiseration gone to the arms of a spanish jade memories feelings which she had thought quite dead revived within her painful sullen tenacious mechanically she closed drawer after drawer went to her bed lay on it and buried her face in the pillows she did not cry what was the use of that when she got off her bed to go down to lunch she felt as if only one thing could do her good and that was to have val home heher eldest boywho was to go to oxford next month at james expense was at littlehampton taking his final gallops with his trainer for smalls as he would have phrased it following his fathers diction she caused a telegram to be sent to him  i must see about his clothes she said to imogen i cant have him going up to oxford all anyhow those boys are so particular  vals got heaps of things imogen answered  i know but they want overhauling i hope hell come  hell come like a shot mother but hell probably skew his exam  i cant help that said winifred i want him  with an innocent shrewd look at her mothers face imogen kept silence it was father of course val did come like a shot at six oclock  imagine a cross between a pickle and a forsyte and you have young publius valerius dartie a youth so named could hardly turn out otherwise when he was born winifred in the heyday of spirits and the craving for distinction had determined that her children should have names such as no others had ever had it was a mercyshe felt nowthat she had just not named imogen thisbe but it was to george forsyte always a wag that vals christening was due it so happened that dartie dining with him a week after the birth of his son and heir had mentioned this aspiration of winifreds  call him cato said george itll be damned piquant he had just won a tenner on a horse of that name  cato dartie had repliedthey were a little on as the phrase was even in those daysits not a christian name  halo you george called to a waiter in knee breeches bring me the encycpedia brit from the library letter c  the waiter brought it  here you are said george pointing with his cigar cato publius valerius by virgil out of lydia thats what you want publius valerius is christian enough  dartie on arriving home had informed winifred she had been charmed it was so chic and publius valerius became the babys name though it afterwards transpired that they had got hold of the inferior cato in 1890 however when little publius was nearly ten the word chic went out of fashion and sobriety came in winifred began to have doubts they were confirmed by little publius himself who returned from his first term at school complaining that life was a burden to himthey called him pubby winifreda woman of real decisionpromptly changed his school and his name to val the publius being dropped even as an initial  at nineteen he was a limber freckled youth with a wide mouth light eyes long dark lashes a rather charming smile considerable knowledge of what he should not know and no experience of what he ought to do few boys had more narrowly escaped being expelledthe engaging rascal after kissing his mother and pinching imogen he ran upstairs three at a time and came down four dressed for dinner he was awfully sorry but his trainer who had come up too had asked him to dine at the oxford and cambridge it wouldnt do to missthe old chap would be hurt winifred let him go with an unhappy pride she had wanted him at home but it was very nice to know that his tutor was so fond of him he went out with a wink at imogen saying i say mother could i have two plovers eggs when i come incooks got some they top up so jolly well oh and look herehave you any moneyi had to borrow a fiver from old snobby  winifred looking at him with fond shrewdness answered  my dear you are naughty about money but you shouldnt pay him tonight anyway youre his guest how nice and slim he looked in his white waistcoat and his dark thick lashes  oh but we may go to the theatre you see mother and i think i ought to stand the tickets hes always hard up you know  winifred produced a fivepound note saying  well perhaps youd better pay him but you mustnt stand the tickets too  val pocketed the fiver  if i do i cant he said goodnight mum  he went out with his head up and his hat cocked joyously sniffing the air of piccadilly like a young hound loosed into covert jolly good biz after that mouldy old slow hole down there  he found his tutor not indeed at the oxford and cambridge but at the goats club this tutor was a year older than himself a goodlooking youth with fine brown eyes and smooth dark hair a small mouth an oval face languid immaculate cool to a degree one of those young men who without effort establish moral ascendancy over their companions he had missed being expelled from school a year before val had spent that year at oxford and val could almost see a halo round his head his name was crum and no one could get through money quicker it seemed to be his only aim in lifedazzling to young val in whom however the forsyte would stand apart now and then wondering where the value for that money was  they dined quietly in style and taste left the club smoking cigars with just two bottles inside them and dropped into stalls at the liberty for val the sound of comic songs the sight of lovely legs were fogged and interrupted by haunting fears that he would never equal crums quiet dandyism his idealism was roused and when that is so one is never quite at ease surely he had too wide a mouth not the best cut of waistcoat no braid on his trousers and his lavender gloves had no thin black stitchings down the back besides he laughed too muchcrum never laughed he only smiled with his regular dark brows raised a little so that they formed a gable over his just drooped lids no he would never be crums equal all the same it was a jolly good show and cynthia dark simply ripping between the acts crum regaled him with particulars of cynthias private life and the awful knowledge became vals that if he liked crum could go behind he simply longed to say i say take me but dared not because of his deficiencies and this made the last act or two almost miserable on coming out crum said its half an hour before they close lets go on to the pandemonium they took a hansom to travel the hundred yards and seats costing sevenandsix apiece because they were going to stand and walked into the promenade it was in these little things this utter negligence of money that crum had such engaging polish the ballet was on its last legs and night and the traffic of the promenade was suffering for the moment men and women were crowded in three rows against the barrier the whirl and dazzle on the stage the half dark the mingled tobacco fumes and womens scent all that curious lure to promiscuity which belongs to promenades began to free young val from his idealism he looked admiringly in a young womans face saw she was not young and quickly looked away shades of cynthia dark the young womans arm touched his unconsciously there was a scent of musk and mignonette val looked round the corner of his lashes perhaps she was young after all her foot trod on his she begged his pardon he said  not at all jolly good ballet isnt it  oh im tired of it arent you  young val smiledhis wide rather charming smile beyond that he did not gonot yet convinced the forsyte in him stood out for greater certainty and on the stage the ballet whirled its kaleidoscope of snowwhite salmonpink and emeraldgreen and violet and seemed suddenly to freeze into a stilly spangled pyramid applause broke out and it was over maroon curtains had cut it off the semicircle of men and women round the barrier broke up the young womans arm pressed his a little way off disturbance seemed centring round a man with a pink carnation val stole another glance at the young woman who was looking towards it three men unsteady emerged walking arm in arm the one in the centre wore the pink carnation a white waistcoat a dark moustache he reeled a little as he walked crums voice said slow and level look at that bounder hes screwed val turned to look the bounder had disengaged his arm and was pointing straight at them crums voice level as ever said  he seems to know you the bounder spoke  hllo he said you fllows look theres my young rascal of a son  val saw it was his father he could have sunk into the crimson carpet it was not the meeting in this place not even that his father was screwed it was crums word bounder which as by heavenly revelation he perceived at that moment to be true yes his father looked a bounder with his dark good looks and his pink carnation and his square selfassertive walk and without a word he ducked behind the young woman and slipped out of the promenade he heard the word val behind him and ran down deepcarpeted steps past the chuckersout into the square  to be ashamed of his own father is perhaps the bitterest experience a young man can go through it seemed to val hurrying away that his career had ended before it had begun how could he go up to oxford now amongst all those chaps those splendid friends of crums who would know that his father was a bounder and suddenly he hated crum who the devil was crum to say that if crum had been beside him at that moment he would certainly have been jostled off the pavement his own fatherhis own a choke came up in his throat and he dashed his hands down deep into his overcoat pockets damn crum he conceived the wild idea of running back and fending his father taking him by the arm and walking about with him in front of crum but gave it up at once and pursued his way down piccadilly a young woman planted herself before him not so angry darling he shied dodged her and suddenly became quite cool if crum ever said a word he would jolly well punch his head and there would be an end of it he walked a hundred yards or more contented with that thought then lost its comfort utterly it wasnt simple like that he remembered how at school when some parent came down who did not pass the standard it just clung to the fellow afterwards it was one of those things nothing could remove why had his mother married his father if he was a bounder it was bitterly unfairjolly lowdown on a fellow to give him a bounder for father the worst of it was that now crum had spoken the word he realised that he had long known subconsciously that his father was not the clean potato it was the beastliest thing that had ever happened to himbeastliest thing that had ever happened to any fellow and downhearted as he had never yet been he came to green street and let himself in with a smuggled latchkey in the diningroom his plovers eggs were set invitingly with some cut bread and butter and a little whisky at the bottom of a decanterjust enough as winifred had thought for him to feel himself a man it made him sick to look at them and he went upstairs  winifred heard him pass and thought the dear boys in thank goodness if he takes after his father i dont know what i shall do but he wont hes like me dear val     chapter iiisoames prepares to take steps  when soames entered his sisters little louis quinze drawingroom with its small balcony always flowered with hanging geraniums in the summer and now with pots of lilium auratum he was struck by the immutability of human affairs it looked just the same as on his first visit to the newly married darties twentyone years ago he had chosen the furniture himself and so completely that no subsequent purchase had ever been able to change the rooms atmosphere yes he had founded his sister well and she had wanted it indeed it said a great deal for winifred that after all this time with dartie she remained wellfounded from the first soames had nosed out darties nature from underneath the plausibility savoir faire and good looks which had dazzled winifred her mother and even james to the extent of permitting the fellow to marry his daughter without bringing anything but shares of no value into settlement  winifred whom he noticed next to the furniture was sitting at her buhl bureau with a letter in her hand she rose and came towards him tall as himself strong in the cheekbones well tailored something in her face disturbed soames she crumpled the letter in her hand but seemed to change her mind and held it out to him he was her lawyer as well as her brother  soames read on iseeum club paper these words  you will not get chance to insult in my own again i am leaving country tomorrow its played out im tired of being insulted by you youve brought on yourself no selfrespecting man can stand it i shall not ask you for anything again goodbye i took the photograph of the two girls give them my love i dont care what your family say its all their doing im going to live new life md  this afterdinner note had a splotch on it not yet quite dry he looked at winifredthe splotch had clearly come from her and he checked the words good riddance then it occurred to him that with this letter she was entering that very state which he himself so earnestly desired to quitthe state of a forsyte who was not divorced  winifred had turned away and was taking a long sniff from a little goldtopped bottle a dull commiseration together with a vague sense of injury crept about soames heart he had come to her to talk of his own position and get sympathy and here was she in the same position wanting of course to talk of it and get sympathy from him it was always like that nobody ever seemed to think that he had troubles and interests of his own he folded up the letter with the splotch inside and said  whats it all about now  winifred recited the story of the pearls calmly  do you think hes really gone soames you see the state he was in when he wrote that  soames who when he desired a thing placated providence by pretending that he did not think it likely to happen answered  i shouldnt think so i might find out at his club  if george is there said winifred he would know  george said soames i saw him at his fathers funeral  then hes sure to be there  soames whose good sense applauded his sisters acumen said grudgingly well ill go round have you said anything in park lane  ive told emily returned winifred who retained that chic way of describing her mother father would have a fit  indeed anything untoward was now sedulously kept from james with another look round at the furniture as if to gauge his sisters exact position soames went out towards piccadilly the evening was drawing ina touch of chill in the october haze he walked quickly with his close and concentrated air he must get through for he wished to dine in soho on hearing from the hall porter at the iseeum that mr dartie had not been in today he looked at the trusty fellow and decided only to ask if mr george forsyte was in the club he was soames who always looked askance at his cousin george as one inclined to jest at his expense followed the pageboy slightly reassured by the thought that george had just lost his father he must have come in for about thirty thousand besides what he had under that settlement of rogers which had avoided death duty he found george in a bowwindow staring out across a halfeaten plate of muffins his tall bulky blackclothed figure loomed almost threatening though preserving still the supernatural neatness of the racing man with a faint grin on his fleshy face he said  hallo soames have a muffin  no thanks murmured soames and nursing his hat with the desire to say something suitable and sympathetic added  hows your mother  thanks said george soso havent seen you for ages you never go racing hows the city  soames scenting the approach of a jest closed up and answered  i wanted to ask you about dartie i hear hes  flitted made a bolt to buenos aires with the fair lola good for winifred and the little darties hes a treat  soames nodded naturally inimical as these cousins were dartie made them kin  uncle jamesll sleep in his bed now resumed george i suppose hes had a lot off you too  soames smiled  ah you saw him further said george amicably hes a real rouser young val will want a bit of looking after i was always sorry for winifred shes a plucky woman  again soames nodded i must be getting back to her he said she just wanted to know for certain we may have to take steps i suppose theres no mistake  its quite ok said georgeit was he who invented so many of those quaint sayings which have been assigned to other sources he was drunk as a lord last night but he went off all right this morning his ships the tuscarora and fishing out a card he read mockingly  mr montague dartie poste restante buenos aires i should hurry up with the steps if i were you he fairly fed me up last night  yes said soames but its not always easy then conscious from georges eyes that he had roused reminiscence of his own affair he got up and held out his hand george rose too  remember me to winifred youll enter her for the divorce stakes straight off if you ask me  soames took a sidelong look back at him from the doorway george had seated himself again and was staring before him he looked big and lonely in those black clothes soames had never known him so subdued i suppose he feels it in a way he thought they must have about fifty thousand each all told they ought to keep the estate together if theres a war house property will go down uncle roger was a good judge though and the face of annette rose before him in the darkening street her brown hair and her blue eyes with their dark lashes her fresh lips and cheeks dewy and blooming in spite of london her perfect french figure take steps he thought reentering winifreds house he encountered val and they went in together an idea had occurred to soames his cousin jolyon was irenes trustee the first step would be to go down and see him at robin hill robin hill the oddthe very odd feeling those words brought back robin hillthe house bosinney had built for him and irenethe house they had never lived inthe fatal house and jolyon lived there now hm and suddenly he thought they say hes got a boy at oxford why not take young val down and introduce them its an excuse less baldvery much less bald so as they went upstairs he said to val  youve got a cousin at oxford youve never met him i should like to take you down with me tomorrow to where he lives and introduce you youll find it useful  val receiving the idea with but moderate transports soames clinched it  ill call for you after lunch its in the countrynot far youll enjoy it  on the threshold of the drawingroom he recalled with an effort that the steps he contemplated concerned winifred at the moment not himself  winifred was still sitting at her buhl bureau  its quite true he said hes gone to buenos aires started this morningwed better have him shadowed when he lands ill cable at once otherwise we may have a lot of expense the sooner these things are done the better im always regretting that i didnt he stopped and looked sidelong at the silent winifred by the way he went on can you prove cruelty  winifred said in a dull voice  i dont know what is cruelty  well has he struck you or anything  winifred shook herself and her jaw grew square  he twisted my arm or would pointing a pistol count or being too drunk to undress himself ornoi cant bring in the children  no said soames no i wonder of course theres legal separationwe can get that but separation um  what does it mean asked winifred desolately  that he cant touch you or you him youre both of you married and unmarried and again he grunted what was it in fact but his own accursed position legalised no he would not put her into that  it must be divorce he said decisively failing cruelty theres desertion theres a way of shortening the two years now we get the court to give us restitution of conjugal rights then if he doesnt obey we can bring a suit for divorce in six months time of course you dont want him back but they wont know that still theres the risk that he might come id rather try cruelty  winifred shook her head its so beastly  well soames murmured perhaps there isnt much risk so long as hes infatuated and got money dont say anything to anybody and dont pay any of his debts  winifred sighed in spite of all she had been through the sense of loss was heavy on her and this idea of not paying his debts any more brought it home to her as nothing else yet had some richness seemed to have gone out of life without her husband without her pearls without that intimate sense that she made a brave show above the domestic whirlpool she would now have to face the world she felt bereaved indeed  and into the chilly kiss he placed on her forehead soames put more than his usual warmth  i have to go down to robin hill tomorrow he said to see young jolyon on business hes got a boy at oxford id like to take val with me and introduce him come down to the shelter for the weekend and bring the children oh by the way no that wont do ive got some other people coming so saying he left her and turned towards soho     chapter ivsoho  of all quarters in the queer adventurous amalgam called london soho is perhaps least suited to the forsyte spirit soho my wild one george would have said if he had seen his cousin going there untidy full of greeks ishmaelites cats italians tomatoes restaurants organs coloured stuffs queer names people looking out of upper windows it dwells remote from the british body politic yet has it haphazard proprietary instincts of its own and a certain possessive prosperity which keeps its rents up when those of other quarters go down for long years soames acquaintanceship with soho had been confined to its western bastion wardour street many bargains had he picked up there even during those seven years at brighton after bosinneys death and irenes flight he had bought treasures there sometimes though he had no place to put them for when the conviction that his wife had gone for good at last became firm within him he had caused a board to be put up in montpellier square                       for sale         the lease of this desirable residence          enquire of messrs lesson and tukes              court street belgravia  it had sold within a weekthat desirable residence in the shadow of whose perfection a man and a woman had eaten their hearts out  of a misty january evening just before the board was taken down soames had gone there once more and stood against the square railings looking at its unlighted windows chewing the cud of possessive memories which had turned so bitter in the mouth why had she never loved him why she had been given all she had wanted and in return had given him for three long years all he had wantedexcept indeed her heart he had uttered a little involuntary groan and a passing policeman had glanced suspiciously at him who no longer possessed the right to enter that green door with the carved brass knocker beneath the board for sale a choking sensation had attacked his throat and he had hurried away into the mist that evening he had gone to brighton to live  approaching malta street soho and the restaurant bretagne where annette would be drooping her pretty shoulders over her accounts soames thought with wonder of those seven years at brighton how had he managed to go on so long in that town devoid of the scent of sweetpeas where he had not even space to put his treasures true those had been years with no time at all for looking at themyears of almost passionate moneymaking during which forsyte bustard and forsyte had become solicitors to more limited companies than they could properly attend to up to the city of a morning in a pullman car down from the city of an evening in a pullman car law papers again after dinner then the sleep of the tired and up again next morning saturday to monday was spent at his club in towncurious reversal of customary procedure based on the deep and careful instinct that while working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice a day and while resting must indulge his domestic affections the sunday visit to his family in park lane to timothys and to green street the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as necessary to health as sea air on weekdays even since his migration to mapledurham he had maintained those habits untilhe had known annette  whether annette had produced the revolution in his outlook or that outlook had produced annette he knew no more than we know where a circle begins it was intricate and deeply involved with the growing consciousness that property without anyone to leave it to is the negation of true forsyteism to have an heir some continuance of self who would begin where he left offensure in fact that he would not leave offhad quite obsessed him for the last year and more after buying a bit of wedgwood one evening in april he had dropped into malta street to look at a house of his fathers which had been turned into a restauranta risky proceeding and one not quite in accordance with the terms of the lease he had stared for a little at the outside painted a good cream colour with two peacockblue tubs containing little baytrees in a recessed doorwayand at the words restaurant bretagne above them in gold letters rather favourably impressed entering he had noticed that several people were already seated at little round green tables with little pots of fresh flowers on them and brittanyware plates and had asked of a trim waitress to see the proprietor they had shown him into a back room where a girl was sitting at a simple bureau covered with papers and a small round table was laid for two the impression of cleanliness order and good taste was confirmed when the girl got up saying you wish to see maman monsieur in a broken accent  yes soames had answered i represent your landlord in fact im his son  wont you sit down sir please tell maman to come to this gentleman  he was pleased that the girl seemed impressed because it showed business instinct and suddenly he noticed that she was remarkably prettyso remarkably pretty that his eyes found a difficulty in leaving her face when she moved to put a chair for him she swayed in a curious subtle way as if she had been put together by someone with a special secret skill and her face and neck which was a little bared looked as fresh as if they had been sprayed with dew probably at this moment soames decided that the lease had not been violated though to himself and his father he based the decision on the efficiency of those illicit adaptations in the building on the signs of prosperity and the obvious business capacity of madame lamotte he did not however neglect to leave certain matters to future consideration which had necessitated further visits so that the little back room had become quite accustomed to his spare not unsolid but unobtrusive figure and his pale chinny face with clipped moustache and dark hair not yet grizzling at the sides  un monsieur tres distingue madame lamotte found him and presently tres amical tres gentil watching his eyes upon her daughter  she was one of those generously built finefaced darkhaired frenchwomen whose every action and tone of voice inspire perfect confidence in the thoroughness of their domestic tastes their knowledge of cooking and the careful increase of their bank balances  after those visits to the restaurant bretagne began other visits ceasedwithout indeed any definite decision for soames like all forsytes and the great majority of their countrymen was a born empiricist but it was this change in his mode of life which had gradually made him so definitely conscious that he desired to alter his condition from that of the unmarried married man to that of the married man remarried  turning into malta street on this evening of early october 1899 he bought a paper to see if there were any afterdevelopment of the dreyfus casea question which he had always found useful in making closer acquaintanceship with madame lamotte and her daughter who were catholic and antidreyfusard  scanning those columns soames found nothing french but noticed a general fall on the stock exchange and an ominous leader about the transvaal he entered thinking wars a certainty i shall sell my consols not that he had many personally the rate of interest was too wretched but he should advise his companiesconsols would assuredly go down a look as he passed the doorways of the restaurant assured him that business was good as ever and this which in april would have pleased him now gave him a certain uneasiness if the steps which he had to take ended in his marrying annette he would rather see her mother safely back in france a move to which the prosperity of the restaurant bretagne might become an obstacle he would have to buy them out of course for french people only came to england to make money and it would mean a higher price and then that peculiar sweet sensation at the back of his throat and a slight thumping about the heart which he always experienced at the door of the little room prevented his thinking how much it would cost  going in he was conscious of an abundant black skirt vanishing through the door into the restaurant and of annette with her hands up to her hair it was the attitude in which of all others he admired herso beautifully straight and rounded and supple and he said  i just came in to talk to your mother about pulling down that partition no dont call her  monsieur will have supper with us it will be ready in ten minutes soames who still held her hand was overcome by an impulse which surprised him  you look so pretty tonight he said so very pretty do you know how pretty you look annette  annette withdrew her hand and blushed monsieur is very good  not a bit good said soames and sat down gloomily  annette made a little expressive gesture with her hands a smile was crinkling her red lips untouched by salve  and looking at those lips soames said  are you happy over here or do you want to go back to france  oh i like london paris of course but london is better than orleans and the english country is so beautiful i have been to richmond last sunday  soames went through a moment of calculating struggle mapledurham dared he after all dared he go so far as that and show her what there was to look forward to still down there one could say things in this room it was impossible  i want you and your mother he said suddenly to come for the afternoon next sunday my house is on the river its not too late in this weather and i can show you some good pictures what do you say  annette clasped her hands  it will be lovelee the river is so beautiful  thats understood then ill ask madame  he need say no more to her this evening and risk giving himself away but had he not already said too much did one ask restaurant proprietors with pretty daughters down to ones country house without design madame lamotte would see if annette didnt well there was not much that madame did not see besides this was the second time he had stayed to supper with them he owed them hospitality  walking home towards park lanefor he was staying at his fatherswith the impression of annettes soft clever hand within his own his thoughts were pleasant slightly sensual rather puzzled take steps what steps how dirty linen washed in public pah with his reputation for sagacity for farsightedness and the clever extrication of others he who stood for proprietary interests to become the plaything of that law of which he was a pillar there was something revolting in the thought winifreds affair was bad enough to have a double dose of publicity in the family would not a liaison be better than thata liaison and a son he could adopt but dark solid watchful madame lamotte blocked the avenue of that vision no that would not work it was not as if annette could have a real passion for him one could not expect that at his age if her mother wished if the worldly advantage were manifestly greatperhaps if not refusal would be certain besides he thought im not a villain i dont want to hurt her and i dont want anything underhand but i do want her and i want a son theres nothing for it but divorcesomehowanyhowdivorce under the shadow of the planetrees in the lamplight he passed slowly along the railings of the green park mist clung there among the bluish tree shapes beyond range of the lamps how many hundred times he had walked past those trees from his fathers house in park lane when he was quite a young man or from his own house in montpellier square in those four years of married life and tonight making up his mind to free himself if he could of that long useless marriage tie he took a fancy to walk on in at hyde park corner out at knightsbridge gate just as he used to when going home to irene in the old days what could she be like nowhow had she passed the years since he last saw her twelve years in all seven already since uncle jolyon left her that money was she still beautiful would he know her if he saw her ive not changed much he thought i expect she has she made me suffer he remembered suddenly one night the first on which he went out to dinner alonean old malburian dinnerthe first year of their marriage with what eagerness he had hurried back and entering softly as a cat had heard her playing opening the drawingroom door noiselessly he had stood watching the expression on her face different from any he knew so much more open so confiding as though to her music she was giving a heart he had never seen and he remembered how she stopped and looked round how her face changed back to that which he did know and what an icy shiver had gone through him for all that the next moment he was fondling her shoulders yes she had made him suffer divorce it seemed ridiculous after all these years of utter separation but it would have to be no other way the question he thought with sudden realism iswhich of us she or me she deserted me she ought to pay for it therell be someone i suppose involuntarily he uttered a little snarling sound and turning made his way back to park lane     chapter vjames sees visions  the butler himself opened the door and closing it softly detained soames on the inner mat  the masters poorly sir he murmured he wouldnt go to bed till you came in hes still in the diningroom  soames responded in the hushed tone to which the house was now accustomed  whats the matter with him warmson  nervous sir i think might be the funeral might be mrs darties comin round this afternoon i think he overheard something ive took him in a negus the mistress has just gone up  soames hung his hat on a mahogany stagshorn  all right warmson you can go to bed ill take him up myself and he passed into the diningroom  james was sitting before the fire in a big armchair with a camelhair shawl very light and warm over his frockcoated shoulders on to which his long white whiskers drooped his white hair still fairly thick glistened in the lamplight a little moisture from his fixed lightgrey eyes stained the cheeks still quite well coloured and the long deep furrows running to the corners of the cleanshaven lips which moved as if mumbling thoughts his long legs thin as a crows in shepherds plaid trousers were bent at less than a right angle and on one knee a spindly hand moved continually with fingers wide apart and glistening tapered nails beside him on a low stool stood a halffinished glass of negus bedewed with beads of heat there he had been sitting with intervals for meals all day at eightyeight he was still organically sound but suffering terribly from the thought that no one ever told him anything it is indeed doubtful how he had become aware that roger was being buried that day for emily had kept it from him she was always keeping things from him emily was only seventy james had a grudge against his wifes youth he felt sometimes that he would never have married her if he had known that she would have so many years before her when he had so few it was not natural she would live fifteen or twenty years after he was gone and might spend a lot of money she had always had extravagant tastes for all he knew she might want to buy one of these motorcars cicely and rachel and imogen and all the young peoplethey all rode those bicycles now and went off goodness knew where and now roger was gone he didnt knowcouldnt tell the family was breaking up soames would know how much his uncle had left curiously he thought of roger as soames uncle not as his own brother soames it was more and more the one solid spot in a vanishing world soames was careful he was a warm man but he had no one to leave his money to there it was he didnt know and there was that fellow chamberlain for james political principles had been fixed between 70 and 85 when that rascally radical had been the chief thorn in the side of property and he distrusted him to this day in spite of his conversion he would get the country into a mess and make money go down before he had done with it a stormy petrel of a chap where was soames he had gone to the funeral of course which they had tried to keep from him he knew that perfectly well he had seen his sons trousers roger roger in his coffin he remembered how when they came up from school together from the west on the box seat of the old slowflyer in 1824 roger had got into the boot and gone to sleep james uttered a thin cackle a funny fellowrogeran original he didnt know younger than himself and in his coffin the family was breaking up there was val going to the university he never came to see him now he would cost a pretty penny up there it was an extravagant age and all the pretty pennies that his four grandchildren would cost him danced before james eyes he did not grudge them the money but he grudged terribly the risk which the spending of that money might bring on them he grudged the diminution of security and now that cicely had married she might be having children too he didnt knowcouldnt tell nobody thought of anything but spending money in these days and racing about and having what they called a good time a motorcar went past the window ugly great lumbering thing making all that racket but there it was the country rattling to the dogs people in such a hurry that they couldnt even care for stylea neat turnout like his barouche and bays was worth all those newfangled things and consols at 116 there must be a lot of money in the country and now there was this old kruger they had tried to keep old kruger from him but he knew better there would be a pretty kettle of fish out there he had known how it would be when that fellow gladstonedead now thank god made such a mess of it after that dreadful business at majuba he shouldnt wonder if the empire split up and went to pot and this vision of the empire going to pot filled a full quarter of an hour with qualms of the most serious character he had eaten a poor lunch because of them but it was after lunch that the real disaster to his nerves occurred he had been dozing when he became aware of voiceslow voices ah they never told him anything winifreds and her mothers monty that fellow dartiealways that fellow dartie the voices had receded and james had been left alone with his ears standing up like a hares and fear creeping about his inwards why did they leave him alone why didnt they come and tell him and an awful thought which through long years had haunted him concreted again swiftly in his brain dartie had gone bankruptfraudulently bankrupt and to save winifred and the children hejameswould have to pay could hecould soames turn him into a limited company no he couldnt there it was with every minute before emily came back the spectre fiercened why it might be forgery with eyes fixed on the doubted turner in the centre of the wall james suffered tortures he saw dartie in the dock his grandchildren in the gutter and himself in bed he saw the doubted turner being sold at jobsons and all the majestic edifice of property in rags he saw in fancy winifred unfashionably dressed and heard in fancy emilys voice saying now dont fuss james she was always saying dont fuss she had no nerves he ought never to have married a woman eighteen years younger than himself then emilys real voice said  have you had a nice nap james  nap he was in torment and she asked him that  whats this about dartie he said and his eyes glared at her  emilys selfpossession never deserted her  what have you been hearing she asked blandly  whats this about dartie repeated james hes gone bankrupt  fiddle  james made a great effort and rose to the full height of his storklike figure  you never tell me anything he said hes gone bankrupt  the destruction of that fixed idea seemed to emily all that mattered at the moment  he has not she answered firmly hes gone to buenos aires  if she had said hes gone to mars she could not have dealt james a more stunning blow his imagination invested entirely in british securities could as little grasp one place as the other  whats he gone there for he said hes got no money what did he take  agitated within by winifreds news and goaded by the constant reiteration of this jeremiad emily said calmly  he took winifreds pearls and a dancer  what said james and sat down  his sudden collapse alarmed her and smoothing his forehead she said  now dont fuss james  a dusky red had spread over james cheeks and forehead  i paid for them he said tremblingly hes a thief ii knew how it would be hell be the death of me he  words failed him and he sat quite still emily who thought she knew him so well was alarmed and went towards the sideboard where she kept some sal volatile she could not see the tenacious forsyte spirit working in that thin tremulous shape against the extravagance of the emotion called up by this outrage on forsyte principlesthe forsyte spirit deep in there saying you mustnt get into a fantod itll never do you wont digest your lunch youll have a fit all unseen by her it was doing better work in james than sal volatile  drink this she said  james waved it aside  what was winifred about he said to let him take her pearls emily perceived the crisis past  she can have mine she said comfortably i never wear them shed better get a divorce  there you go said james divorce weve never had a divorce in the family wheres soames  hell be in directly  no he wont said james almost fiercely hes at the funeral you think i know nothing  well said emily with calm you shouldnt get into such fusses when we tell you things and plumping up his cushions and putting the sal volatile beside him she left the room  but james sat there seeing visionsof winifred in the divorce court and the family name in the papers of the earth falling on rogers coffin of val taking after his father of the pearls he had paid for and would never see again of money back at four per cent and the country going to the dogs and as the afternoon wore into evening and teatime passed and dinnertime those visions became more and more mixed and menacingof being told nothing till he had nothing left of all his wealth and they told him nothing of it where was soames why didnt he come in his hand grasped the glass of negus he raised it to drink and saw his son standing there looking at him a little sigh of relief escaped his lips and putting the glass down he said  there you are darties gone to buenos aires  soames nodded thats all right he said good riddance  a wave of assuagement passed over james brain soames knew soames was the only one of them all who had sense why couldnt he come and live at home he had no son of his own and he said plaintively  at my age i get nervous i wish you were more at home my boy  again soames nodded the mask of his countenance betrayed no understanding but he went closer and as if by accident touched his fathers shoulder  they sent their love to you at timothys he said it went off all right ive been to see winifred im going to take steps and he thought yes and you mustnt hear of them  james looked up his long white whiskers quivered his thin throat between the points of his collar looked very gristly and naked  ive been very poorly all day he said they never tell me anything  soames heart twitched  well its all right theres nothing to worry about will you come up now and he put his hand under his fathers arm  james obediently and tremulously raised himself and together they went slowly across the room which had a rich look in the firelight and out to the stairs very slowly they ascended  goodnight my boy said james at his bedroom door  goodnight father answered soames his hand stroked down the sleeve beneath the shawl it seemed to have almost nothing in it so thin was the arm and turning away from the light in the opening doorway he went up the extra flight to his own bedroom  i want a son he thought sitting on the edge of his bed i want a son     chapter vinolongeryoung jolyon at home  trees take little account of time and the old oak on the upper lawn at robin hill looked no day older than when bosinney sprawled under it and said to soames forsyte ive found the very place for your house since then swithin had dreamed and old jolyon died beneath its branches and now close to the swing nolongeryoung jolyon often painted there of all spots in the world it was perhaps the most sacred to him for he had loved his father  contemplating its great girthcrinkled and a little mossed but not yet hollowhe would speculate on the passage of time that tree had seen perhaps all real english history it dated he shouldnt wonder from the days of elizabeth at least his own fifty years were as nothing to its wood when the house behind it which he now owned was three hundred years of age instead of twelve that tree might still be standing there vast and hollowfor who would commit such sacrilege as to cut it down a forsyte might perhaps still be living in that house to guard it jealously and jolyon would wonder what the house would look like coated with such age wistaria was already about its wallsthe new look had gone would it hold its own and keep the dignity bosinney had bestowed on it or would the giant london have lapped it round and made it into an asylum in the midst of a jerrybuilt wilderness often within and without of it he was persuaded that bosinney had been moved by the spirit when he built he had put his heart into that house indeed it might even become one of the homes of englanda rare achievement for a house in these degenerate days of building and the aesthetic spirit moving hand in hand with his forsyte sense of possessive continuity dwelt with pride and pleasure on his ownership thereof there was the smack of reverence and ancestorworship if only for one ancestor in his desire to hand this house down to his son and his sons son his father had loved the house had loved the view the grounds that tree his last years had been happy there and no one had lived there before him these last eleven years at robin hill had formed in jolyons life as a painter the important period of success he was now in the very van of watercolour art hanging on the line everywhere his drawings fetched high prices specialising in that one medium with the tenacity of his breed he had arrivedrather late but not too late for a member of the family which made a point of living for ever his art had really deepened and improved in conformity with his position he had grown a short fair beard which was just beginning to grizzle and hid his forsyte chin his brown face had lost the warped expression of his ostracised periodhe looked if anything younger the loss of his wife in 1894 had been one of those domestic tragedies which turn out in the end for the good of all he had indeed loved her to the last for his was an affectionate spirit but she had become increasingly difficult jealous of her stepdaughter june jealous even of her own little daughter holly and making ceaseless plaint that he could not love her ill as she was and useless to everyone and better dead he had mourned her sincerely but his face had looked younger since she died if she could only have believed that she made him happy how much happier would the twenty years of their companionship have been  june had never really got on well with her who had reprehensibly taken her own mothers place and ever since old jolyon died she had been established in a sort of studio in london but she had come back to robin hill on her stepmothers death and gathered the reins there into her small decided hands jolly was then at harrow holly still learning from mademoiselle beauce there had been nothing to keep jolyon at home and he had removed his grief and his paintbox abroad there he had wandered for the most part in brittany and at last had fetched up in paris he had stayed there several months and come back with the younger face and the short fair beard essentially a man who merely lodged in any house it had suited him perfectly that june should reign at robin hill so that he was free to go off with his easel where and when he liked she was inclined it is true to regard the house rather as an asylum for her proteges but his own outcast days had filled jolyon for ever with sympathy towards an outcast and junes lame ducks about the place did not annoy him by all means let her have them downand feed them up and though his slightly cynical humour perceived that they ministered to his daughters love of domination as well as moved her warm heart he never ceased to admire her for having so many ducks he fell indeed year by year into a more and more detached and brotherly attitude towards his own son and daughters treating them with a sort of whimsical equality when he went down to harrow to see jolly he never quite knew which of them was the elder and would sit eating cherries with him out of one paper bag with an affectionate and ironical smile twisting up an eyebrow and curling his lips a little and he was always careful to have money in his pocket and to be modish in his dress so that his son need not blush for him they were perfect friends but never seemed to have occasion for verbal confidences both having the competitive selfconsciousness of forsytes they knew they would stand by each other in scrapes but there was no need to talk about it jolyon had a striking horrorpartly original sin but partly the result of his early immoralityof the moral attitude the most he could ever have said to his son would have been  look here old man dont forget youre a gentleman and then have wondered whimsically whether that was not a snobbish sentiment the great cricket match was perhaps the most searching and awkward time they annually went through together for jolyon had been at eton they would be particularly careful during that match continually saying hooray oh hard luck old man or hooray oh bad luck dad to each other when some disaster at which their hearts bounded happened to the opposing school and jolyon would wear a grey top hat instead of his usual soft one to save his sons feelings for a black top hat he could not stomach when jolly went up to oxford jolyon went up with him amused humble and a little anxious not to discredit his boy amongst all these youths who seemed so much more assured and old than himself he often thought glad im a painter for he had long dropped underwriting at lloydsits so innocuous you cant look down on a painteryou cant take him seriously enough for jolly who had a sort of natural lordliness had passed at once into a very small set who secretly amused his father the boy had fair hair which curled a little and his grandfathers deepset irongrey eyes he was wellbuilt and very upright and always pleased jolyons aesthetic sense so that he was a tiny bit afraid of him as artists ever are of those of their own sex whom they admire physically on that occasion however he actually did screw up his courage to give his son advice and this was it  look here old man youre bound to get into debt mind you come to me at once of course ill always pay them but you might remember that one respects oneself more afterwards if one pays ones own way and dont ever borrow except from me will you  and jolly had said  all right dad i wont and he never had  and theres just one other thing i dont know much about morality and that but there is this its always worth while before you do anything to consider whether its going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary  jolly had looked thoughtful and nodded and presently had squeezed his fathers hand and jolyon had thought i wonder if i had the right to say that he always had a sort of dread of losing the dumb confidence they had in each other remembering how for long years he had lost his own fathers so that there had been nothing between them but love at a great distance he underestimated no doubt the change in the spirit of the age since he himself went up to cambridge in 65 and perhaps he underestimated too his boys power of understanding that he was tolerant to the very bone it was that tolerance of his and possibly his scepticism which ever made his relations towards june so queerly defensive she was such a decided mortal knew her own mind so terribly well wanted things so inexorably until she got themand then indeed often dropped them like a hot potato her mother had been like that whence had come all those tears not that his incompatibility with his daughter was anything like what it had been with the first mrs young jolyon one could be amused where a daughter was concerned in a wifes case one could not be amused to see june set her heart and jaw on a thing until she got it was all right because it was never anything which interfered fundamentally with jolyons libertythe one thing on which his jaw was also absolutely rigid a considerable jaw under that short grizzling beard nor was there ever any necessity for real hearttoheart encounters one could break away into ironyas indeed he often had to but the real trouble with june was that she had never appealed to his aesthetic sense though she might well have with her redgold hair and her vikingcoloured eyes and that touch of the berserker in her spirit it was very different with holly soft and quiet shy and affectionate with a playful imp in her somewhere he watched this younger daughter of his through the duckling stage with extraordinary interest would she come out a swan with her sallow oval face and her grey wistful eyes and those long dark lashes she might or she might not only this last year had he been able to guess yes she would be a swanrather a dark one always a shy one but an authentic swan she was eighteen now and mademoiselle beauce was gonethe excellent lady had removed after eleven years haunted by her continuous reminiscences of the wellbrrred little tayleurs to another family whose bosom would now be agitated by her reminiscences of the wellbrrred little forsytes she had taught holly to speak french like herself  portraiture was not jolyons forte but he had already drawn his younger daughter three times and was drawing her a fourth on the afternoon of october 4th 1899 when a card was brought to him which caused his eyebrows to go up          mr soames forsyte  the shelter connoisseurs club mapledurham st jamess  but here the forsyte saga must digress again  to return from a long travel in spain to a darkened house to a little daughter bewildered with tears to the sight of a loved father lying peaceful in his last sleep had never been was never likely to be forgotten by so impressionable and warmhearted a man as jolyon a sense as of mystery too clung to that sad day and about the end of one whose life had been so wellordered balanced and aboveboard it seemed incredible that his father could thus have vanished without as it were announcing his intention without last words to his son and due farewells and those incoherent allusions of little holly to the lady in grey of mademoiselle beauce to a madame errant as it sounded involved all things in a mist lifted a little when he read his fathers will and the codicil thereto it had been his duty as executor of that will and codicil to inform irene wife of his cousin soames of her life interest in fifteen thousand pounds he had called on her to explain that the existing investment in india stock earmarked to meet the charge would produce for her the interesting net sum of l430 odd a year clear of income tax this was but the third time he had seen his cousin soames wifeif indeed she was still his wife of which he was not quite sure he remembered having seen her sitting in the botanical gardens waiting for bosinneya passive fascinating figure reminding him of titians heavenly love and again when charged by his father he had gone to montpellier square on the afternoon when bosinneys death was known he still recalled vividly her sudden appearance in the drawingroom doorway on that occasionher beautiful face passing from wild eagerness of hope to stony despair remembered the compassion he had felt soames snarling smile his words we are not at home and the slam of the front door  this third time he saw a face and form more beautifulfreed from that warp of wild hope and despair looking at her he thought yes you are just what the dad would have admired and the strange story of his fathers indian summer became slowly clear to him she spoke of old jolyon with reverence and tears in her eyes he was so wonderfully kind to me i dont know why he looked so beautiful and peaceful sitting in that chair under the tree it was i who first came on him sitting there you know such a lovely day i dont think an end could have been happier we should all like to go out like that  quite right he had thought we should all a like to go out in full summer with beauty stepping towards us across a lawn and looking round the little almost empty drawingroom he had asked her what she was going to do now i am going to live again a little cousin jolyon its wonderful to have money of ones own ive never had any i shall keep this flat i think im used to it but i shall be able to go to italy  exactly jolyon had murmured looking at her faintly smiling lips and he had gone away thinking a fascinating woman what a waste im glad the dad left her that money he had not seen her again but every quarter he had signed her cheque forwarding it to her bank with a note to the chelsea flat to say that he had done so and always he had received a note in acknowledgment generally from the flat but sometimes from italy so that her personality had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper an upright fine handwriting and the words dear cousin jolyon man of property that he now was the slender cheque he signed often gave rise to the thought well i suppose she just manages sliding into a vague wonder how she was faring otherwise in a world of men not wont to let beauty go unpossessed at first holly had spoken of her sometimes but ladies in grey soon fade from childrens memories and the tightening of junes lips in those first weeks after her grandfathers death whenever her former friends name was mentioned had discouraged allusion only once indeed had june spoken definitely ive forgiven her im frightfully glad shes independent now  on receiving soames card jolyon said to the maidfor he could not abide butlersshow him into the study please and say ill be there in a minute and then he looked at holly and asked  do you remember the lady in grey who used to give you musiclessons  oh yes why has she come  jolyon shook his head and changing his holland blouse for a coat was silent perceiving suddenly that such history was not for those young ears his face in fact became whimsical perplexity incarnate while he journeyed towards the study  standing by the frenchwindow looking out across the terrace at the oak tree were two figures middleaged and young and he thought whos that boy surely they never had a child  the elder figure turned the meeting of those two forsytes of the second generation so much more sophisticated than the first in the house built for the one and owned and occupied by the other was marked by subtle defensiveness beneath distinct attempt at cordiality has he come about his wife jolyon was thinking and soames how shall i begin while val brought to break the ice stood negligently scrutinising this bearded pard from under his dark thick eyelashes  this is val dartie said soames my sisters son hes just going up to oxford i thought id like him to know your boy  ah im sorry jollys away what college  bnc replied val  jollys at the house but hell be delighted to look you up  thanks awfully  hollys inif you could put up with a female relation shed show you round youll find her in the hall if you go through the curtains i was just painting her  with another thanks awfully val vanished leaving the two cousins with the ice unbroken  i see youve some drawings at the water colours said soames  jolyon winced he had been out of touch with the forsyte family at large for twentysix years but they were connected in his mind with friths derby day and landseer prints he had heard from june that soames was a connoisseur which made it worse he had become aware too of a curious sensation of repugnance  i havent seen you for a long time he said  no answered soames between close lips not sinceas a matter of fact its about that ive come youre her trustee im told  jolyon nodded  twelve years is a long time said soames rapidly iim tired of it  jolyon found no more appropriate answer than  wont you smoke  no thanks  jolyon himself lit a cigarette  i wish to be free said soames abruptly  i dont see her murmured jolyon through the fume of his cigarette  but you know where she lives i suppose  jolyon nodded he did not mean to give her address without permission soames seemed to divine his thought  i dont want her address he said i know it  what exactly do you want  she deserted me i want a divorce  rather late in the day isnt it  yes said soames and there was a silence  i dont know much about these thingsat least ive forgotten said jolyon with a wry smile he himself had had to wait for death to grant him a divorce from the first mrs jolyon do you wish me to see her about it  soames raised his eyes to his cousins face i suppose theres someone he said  a shrug moved jolyons shoulders  i dont know at all i imagine you may have both lived as if the other were dead its usual in these cases  soames turned to the window a few early fallen oakleaves strewed the terrace already and were rolling round in the wind jolyon saw the figures of holly and val dartie moving across the lawn towards the stables im not going to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds he thought i must act for her the dad would have wished that and for a swift moment he seemed to see his fathers figure in the old armchair just beyond soames sitting with knees crossed the times in his hand it vanished  my father was fond of her he said quietly  why he should have been i dont know soames answered without looking round she brought trouble to your daughter june she brought trouble to everyone i gave her all she wanted i would have given her evenforgivenessbut she chose to leave me  in jolyon compassion was checked by the tone of that close voice what was there in the fellow that made it so difficult to be sorry for him  i can go and see her if you like he said i suppose she might be glad of a divorce but i know nothing  soames nodded  yes please go as i say i know her address but ive no wish to see her his tongue was busy with his lips as if they were very dry  youll have some tea said jolyon stifling the words and see the house and he led the way into the hall when he had rung the bell and ordered tea he went to his easel to turn his drawing to the wall he could not bear somehow that his work should be seen by soames who was standing there in the middle of the great room which had been designed expressly to afford wall space for his own pictures in his cousins face with its unseizable family likeness to himself and its chinny narrow concentrated look jolyon saw that which moved him to the thought that chap could never forget anythingnor ever give himself away hes pathetic     chapter viithe colt and the filly  when young val left the presence of the last generation he was thinking this is jolly dull uncle soames does take the bun i wonder what this fillys like he anticipated no pleasure from her society and suddenly he saw her standing there looking at him why she was pretty what luck  im afraid you dont know me he said my names val dartieim once removed second cousin something like that you know my mothers name was forsyte  holly whose slim brown hand remained in his because she was too shy to withdraw it said  i dont know any of my relations are there many  tons theyre awfulmost of them at least i dont knowsome of them ones relations always are arent they  i expect they think one awful too said holly  i dont know why they should no one could think you awful of course  holly looked at himthe wistful candour in those grey eyes gave young val a sudden feeling that he must protect her  i mean there are people and people he added astutely your dad looks awfully decent for instance  oh yes said holly fervently he is  a flush mounted in vals cheeksthat scene in the pandemonium promenadethe dark man with the pink carnation developing into his own father but you know what the forsytes are he said almost viciously oh i forgot you dont  what are they  oh fearfully careful not sportsmen a bit look at uncle soames  id like to said holly  val resisted a desire to run his arm through hers oh no he said lets go out youll see him quite soon enough whats your brother like  holly led the way on to the terrace and down to the lawn without answering how describe jolly who ever since she remembered anything had been her lord master and ideal  does he sit on you said val shrewdly i shall be knowing him at oxford have you got any horses  holly nodded would you like to see the stables  rather  they passed under the oak tree through a thin shrubbery into the stableyard there under a clocktower lay a fluffy brownandwhite dog so old that he did not get up but faintly waved the tail curled over his back  thats balthasar said holly hes so oldawfully old nearly as old as i am poor old boy hes devoted to dad  balthasar thats a rum name he isnt purebred you know  no but hes a darling and she bent down to stroke the dog gentle and supple with dark covered head and slim browned neck and hands she seemed to val strange and sweet like a thing slipped between him and all previous knowledge  when grandfather died she said he wouldnt eat for two days he saw him die you know  was that old uncle jolyon mother always says he was a topper  he was said holly simply and opened the stable door  in a loosebox stood a silver roan of about fifteen hands with a long black tail and mane this is minefairy  ah said val shes a jolly palfrey but you ought to bang her tail shed look much smarter then catching her wondering look he thought suddenly i dont knowanything she likes and he took a long sniff of the stable air horses are ripping arent they my dad he stopped  yes said holly  an impulse to unbosom himself almost overcame himbut not quite oh i dont know hes often gone a mucker over them im jolly keen on them tooriding and hunting i like racing awfully as well i should like to be a gentleman rider and oblivious of the fact that he had but one more day in town with two engagements he plumped out  i say if i hire a gee tomorrow will you come a ride in richmond park  holly clasped her hands  oh yes i simply love riding but theres jollys horse why dont you ride him here he is we could go after tea  val looked doubtfully at his trousered legs  he had imagined them immaculate before her eyes in high brown boots and bedford cords  i dont much like riding his horse he said he mightnt like it besides uncle soames wants to get back i expect not that i believe in buckling under to him you know you havent got an uncle have you this is rather a good beast he added scrutinising jollys horse a dark brown which was showing the whites of its eyes you havent got any hunting here i suppose  no i dont know that i want to hunt it must be awfully exciting of course but its cruel isnt it june says so  cruel ejaculated val oh thats all rot whos june  my sistermy halfsister you knowmuch older than me she had put her hands up to both cheeks of jollys horse and was rubbing her nose against its nose with a gentle snuffling noise which seemed to have an hypnotic effect on the animal val contemplated her cheek resting against the horses nose and her eyes gleaming round at him shes really a duck he thought  they returned to the house less talkative followed this time by the dog balthasar walking more slowly than anything on earth and clearly expecting them not to exceed his speed limit  this is a ripping place said val from under the oak tree where they had paused to allow the dog balthasar to come up  yes said holly and sighed of course i want to go everywhere i wish i were a gipsy  yes gipsies are jolly replied val with a conviction which had just come to him youre rather like one you know  hollys face shone suddenly and deeply like dark leaves gilded by the sun  to go madrabbiting everywhere and see everything and live in the openoh wouldnt it be fun  lets do it said val  oh yes lets  itd be grand sport just you and i  then holly perceived the quaintness and gushed  well weve got to do it said val obstinately but reddening too  i believe in doing things you want to do whats down there  the kitchengarden and the pond and the coppice and the farm  lets go down  holly glanced back at the house  its teatime i expect theres dad beckoning  val uttering a growly sound followed her towards the house  when they reentered the hall gallery the sight of two middleaged forsytes drinking tea together had its magical effect and they became quite silent it was indeed an impressive spectacle the two were seated side by side on an arrangement in marqueterie which looked like three silvery pink chairs made one with a low teatable in front of them they seemed to have taken up that position as far apart as the seat would permit so that they need not look at each other too much and they were eating and drinking rather than talkingsoames with his air of despising the teacake as it disappeared jolyon of finding himself slightly amusing to the casual eye neither would have seemed greedy but both were getting through a good deal of sustenance the two young ones having been supplied with food the process went on silent and absorbative till with the advent of cigarettes jolyon said to soames  and hows uncle james  thanks very shaky  were a wonderful family arent we the other day i was calculating the average age of the ten old forsytes from my fathers family bible i make it eightyfour already and five still living they ought to beat the record and looking whimsically at soames he added  we arent the men they were you know  soames smiled do you really think i shall admit that im not their equal he seemed to be saying or that ive got to give up anything especially life  we may live to their age perhaps pursued jolyon but selfconsciousness is a handicap you know and thats the difference between us weve lost conviction how and when selfconsciousness was born i never can make out my father had a little but i dont believe any other of the old forsytes ever had a scrap never to see yourself as others see you its a wonderful preservative the whole history of the last century is in the difference between us and between us and you he added gazing through a ring of smoke at val and holly uncomfortable under his quizzical regard therell beanother difference i wonder what  soames took out his watch  we must go he said if were to catch our train  uncle soames never misses a train muttered val with his mouth full  why should i soames answered simply  oh i dont know grumbled val other people do  at the front door he gave hollys slim brown hand a long and surreptitious squeeze  look out for me tomorrow he whispered three oclock ill wait for you in the road itll save time well have a ripping ride he gazed back at her from the lodge gate and but for the principles of a man about town would have waved his hand he felt in no mood to tolerate his uncles conversation but he was not in danger soames preserved a perfect muteness busy with faraway thoughts  the yellow leaves came down about those two walking the mile and a half which soames had traversed so often in those longago days when he came down to watch with secret pride the building of the housethat house which was to have been the home of him and her from whom he was now going to seek release he looked back once up that endless vista of autumn lane between the yellowing hedges what an age ago i dont want to see her he had said to jolyon was that true i may have to he thought and he shivered seized by one of those queer shudderings that they say mean footsteps on ones grave a chilly world a queer world and glancing sidelong at his nephew he thought wish i were his age i wonder what shes like now     chapter viiijolyon prosecutes trusteeship  when those two were gone jolyon did not return to his painting for daylight was failing but went to the study craving unconsciously a revival of that momentary vision of his father sitting in the old leather chair with his knees crossed and his straight eyes gazing up from under the dome of his massive brow often in this little room cosiest in the house jolyon would catch a moment of communion with his father not indeed that he had definitely any faith in the persistence of the human spiritthe feeling was not so logicalit was rather an atmospheric impact like a scent or one of those strong animistic impressions from forms or effects of light to which those with the artists eye are especially prone here onlyin this little unchanged room where his father had spent the most of his waking hourscould be retrieved the feeling that he was not quite gone that the steady counsel of that old spirit and the warmth of his masterful lovability endured  what would his father be advising now in this sudden recrudescence of an old tragedywhat would he say to this menace against her to whom he had taken such a fancy in the last weeks of his life i must do my best for her thought jolyon he left her to me in his will but what is the best  and as if seeking to regain the sapience the balance and shrewd common sense of that old forsyte he sat down in the ancient chair and crossed his knees but he felt a mere shadow sitting there nor did any inspiration come while the fingers of the wind tapped on the darkening panes of the frenchwindow  go and see her he thought or ask her to come down here whats her life been what is it now i wonder beastly to rake up things at this time of day again the figure of his cousin standing with a hand on a front door of a fine olivegreen leaped out vivid like one of those figures from oldfashioned clocks when the hour strikes and his words sounded in jolyons ears clearer than any chime i manage my own affairs ive told you once i tell you again we are not at home the repugnance he had then felt for soamesfor his flatcheeked shaven face full of spiritual bulldoggedness for his spare square sleek figure slightly crouched as it were over the bone he could not digestcame now again fresh as ever nay with an odd increase i dislike him he thought i dislike him to the very roots of me and thats lucky itll make it easier for me to back his wife halfartist and halfforsyte jolyon was constitutionally averse from what he termed ructions unless angered he conformed deeply to that classic description of the shedog erd ruther run than fight a little smile became settled in his beard ironical that soames should come down hereto this house built for himself how he had gazed and gaped at this ruin of his past intention furtively nosing at the walls and stairway appraising everything and intuitively jolyon thought i believe the fellow even now would like to be living here he could never leave off longing for what he once owned well i must act somehow or other but its a borea great bore  late that evening he wrote to the chelsea flat asking if irene would see him  the old century which had seen the plant of individualism flower so wonderfully was setting in a sky orange with coming storms rumours of war added to the briskness of a london turbulent at the close of the summer holidays and the streets to jolyon who was not often up in town had a feverish look due to these new motorcars and cabs of which he disapproved aesthetically he counted these vehicles from his hansom and made the proportion of them one in twenty they were one in thirty about a year ago he thought theyve come to stay just so much more rattling round of wheels and general stinkfor he was one of those rather rare liberals who object to anything new when it takes a material form and he instructed his driver to get down to the river quickly out of the traffic desiring to look at the water through the mellowing screen of planetrees at the little block of flats which stood back some fifty yards from the embankment he told the cabman to wait and went up to the first floor  yes mrs heron was at home  the effect of a settled if very modest income was at once apparent to him remembering the threadbare refinement in that tiny flat eight years ago when he announced her good fortune everything was now fresh dainty and smelled of flowers the general effect was silvery with touches of black hydrangea colour and gold a woman of great taste he thought time had dealt gently with jolyon for he was a forsyte but with irene time hardly seemed to deal at all or such was his impression she appeared to him not a day older standing there in molecoloured velvet corduroy with soft dark eyes and dark gold hair with outstretched hand and a little smile  wont you sit down  he had probably never occupied a chair with a fuller sense of embarrassment  you look absolutely unchanged he said  and you look younger cousin jolyon  jolyon ran his hands through his hair whose thickness was still a comfort to him  im ancient but i dont feel it thats one thing about painting it keeps you young titian lived to ninetynine and had to have plague to kill him off do you know the first time i ever saw you i thought of a picture by him  when did you see me for the first time  in the botanical gardens  how did you know me if youd never seen me before  by someone who came up to you he was looking at her hardily but her face did not change and she said quietly  yes many lives ago  what is your recipe for youth irene  people who dont live are wonderfully preserved  hm a bitter little saying people who dont live but an opening and he took it you remember my cousin soames  he saw her smile faintly at that whimsicality and at once went on  he came to see me the day before yesterday he wants a divorce do you  i the word seemed startled out of her after twelve years its rather late wont it be difficult  jolyon looked hard into her face unless he said  unless i have a lover now but i have never had one since  what did he feel at the simplicity and candour of those words relief surprise pity venus for twelve years without a lover  and yet he said i suppose you would give a good deal to be free too  i dont know what does it matter now  but if you were to love again  i should love in that simple answer she seemed to sum up the whole philosophy of one on whom the world had turned its back  well is there anything you would like me to say to him  only that im sorry hes not free he had his chance once i dont know why he didnt take it  because he was a forsyte we never part with things you know unless we want something in their place and not always then  irene smiled dont you cousin jolyoni think you do  of course im a bit of a mongrelnot quite a pure forsyte i never take the halfpennies off my cheques i put them on said jolyon uneasily  well what does soames want in place of me now  i dont know perhaps children  she was silent for a little looking down  yes she murmured its hard i would help him to be free if i could  jolyon gazed into his hat his embarrassment was increasing fast so was his admiration his wonder and his pity she was so lovely and so lonely and altogether it was such a coil  well he said i shall have to see soames if theres anything i can do for you im always at your service you must think of me as a wretched substitute for my father at all events ill let you know what happens when i speak to soames he may supply the material himself  she shook her head  you see he has a lot to lose and i have nothing i should like him to be free but i dont see what i can do  nor i at the moment said jolyon and soon after took his leave he went down to his hansom halfpast three soames would be at his office still  to the poultry he called through the trap in front of the houses of parliament and in whitehall newsvendors were calling grave situation in the transvaal but the cries hardly roused him absorbed in recollection of that very beautiful figure of her soft dark glance and the words i have never had one since what on earth did such a woman do with her life backwatered like this solitary unprotected with every mans hand against her or ratherreaching out to grasp her at the least sign and year after year she went on like that  the word poultry above the passing citizens brought him back to reality  forsyte bustard and forsyte in black letters on a ground the colour of peasoup spurred him to a sort of vigour and he went up the stone stairs muttering fusty musty ownerships well we couldnt do without them  i want mr soames forsyte he said to the boy who opened the door  what name  mr jolyon forsyte  the youth looked at him curiously never having seen a forsyte with a beard and vanished  the offices of forsyte bustard and forsyte had slowly absorbed the offices of tooting and bowles and occupied the whole of the first floor  the firm consisted now of nothing but soames and a number of managing and articled clerks the complete retirement of james some six years ago had accelerated business to which the final touch of speed had been imparted when bustard dropped off worn out as many believed by the suit of fryer versus forsyte more in chancery than ever and less likely to benefit its beneficiaries soames with his saner grasp of actualities had never permitted it to worry him on the contrary he had long perceived that providence had presented him therein with l200 a year net in perpetuity andwhy not  when jolyon entered his cousin was drawing out a list of holdings in consols which in view of the rumours of war he was going to advise his companies to put on the market at once before other companies did the same he looked round sidelong and said  how are you just one minute sit down wont you and having entered three amounts and set a ruler to keep his place he turned towards jolyon biting the side of his flat forefinger  yes he said  i have seen her  soames frowned  well  she has remained faithful to memory  having said that jolyon was ashamed his cousin had flushed a dusky yellowish red what had made him tease the poor brute  i was to tell you she is sorry you are not free twelve years is a long time you know your law and what chance it gives you soames uttered a curious little grunt and the two remained a full minute without speaking like wax thought jolyon watching that close face where the flush was fast subsiding hell never give me a sign of what hes thinking or going to do like wax and he transferred his gaze to a plan of that flourishing town bystreet on sea the future existence of which lay exposed on the wall to the possessive instincts of the firms clients the whimsical thought flashed through him i wonder if i shall get a bill of costs for thisto attending mr jolyon forsyte in the matter of my divorce to receiving his account of his visit to my wife and to advising him to go and see her again sixteen and eightpence  suddenly soames said i cant go on like this i tell you i cant go on like this his eyes were shifting from side to side like an animals when it looks for way of escape he really suffers thought jolyon ive no business to forget that just because i dont like him  surely he said gently it lies with yourself a man can always put these things through if hell take it on himself  soames turned square to him with a sound which seemed to come from somewhere very deep  why should i suffer more than ive suffered already why should i  jolyon could only shrug his shoulders his reason agreed his instinct rebelled he could not have said why  your father went on soames took an interest in herwhy goodness knows and i suppose you do too he gave jolyon a sharp look it seems to me that one only has to do another person a wrong to get all the sympathy i dont know in what way i was to blameive never known i always treated her well i gave her everything she could wish for i wanted her  again jolyons reason nodded again his instinct shook its head what is it he thought there must be something wrong in me yet if there is id rather be wrong than right  after all said soames with a sort of glum fierceness she was my wife  in a flash the thought went through his listener there it is ownerships well we all own things buthuman beings pah  you have to look at facts he said drily or rather the want of them  soames gave him another quick suspicious look  the want of them he said yes but i am not so sure  i beg your pardon replied jolyon ive told you what she said it was explicit  my experience has not been one to promote blind confidence in her word we shall see  jolyon got up  goodbye he said curtly  goodbye returned soames and jolyon went out trying to understand the look halfstartled halfmenacing on his cousins face he sought waterloo station in a disturbed frame of mind as though the skin of his moral being had been scraped and all the way down in the train he thought of irene in her lonely flat and of soames in his lonely office and of the strange paralysis of life that lay on them both in chancery he thought both their necks in chanceryand hers so pretty     chapter ixval hears the news  the keeping of engagements had not as yet been a conspicuous feature in the life of young val dartie so that when he broke two and kept one it was the latter event which caused him if anything the greater surprise while jogging back to town from robin hill after his ride with holly she had been even prettier than he had thought her yesterday on her silverroan longtailed palfrey and it seemed to him selfcritical in the brumous october gloaming and the outskirts of london that only his boots had shone throughout their twohour companionship he took out his new gold hunterpresent from jamesand looked not at the time but at sections of his face in the glittering back of its opened case he had a temporary spot over one eyebrow and it displeased him for it must have displeased her crum never had any spots together with crum rose the scene in the promenade of the pandemonium today he had not had the faintest desire to unbosom himself to holly about his father his father lacked poetry the stirrings of which he was feeling for the first time in his nineteen years the liberty with cynthia dark that almost mythical embodiment of rapture the pandemonium with the woman of uncertain ageboth seemed to val completely off fresh from communion with this new shy darkhaired young cousin of his she rode jolly well too so that it had been all the more flattering that she had let him lead her where he would in the long gallops of richmond park though she knew them so much better than he did looking back on it all he was mystified by the barrenness of his speech he felt that he could say an awful lot of fetching things if he had but the chance again and the thought that he must go back to littlehampton on the morrow and to oxford on the twelfthto that beastly exam toowithout the faintest chance of first seeing her again caused darkness to settle on his spirit even more quickly than on the evening he should write to her however and she had promised to answer perhaps too she would come up to oxford to see her brother that thought was like the first star which came out as he rode into padwicks livery stables in the purlieus of sloane square he got off and stretched himself luxuriously for he had ridden some twentyfive good miles the dartie within him made him chaffer for five minutes with young padwick concerning the favourite for the cambridgeshire then with the words put the gee down to my account he walked away a little wide at the knees and flipping his boots with his knotty little cane i dont feel a bit inclined to go out he thought i wonder if mother will stand fizz for my last night with fizz and recollection he could well pass a domestic evening  when he came down speckless after his bath he found his mother scrupulous in a low evening dress and to his annoyance his uncle soames they stopped talking when he came in then his uncle said  hed better be told  at those words which meant something about his father of course vals first thought was of holly was it anything beastly his mother began speaking  your father she said in her fashionably appointed voice while her fingers plucked rather pitifully at seagreen brocade your father my dear boy hasis not at newmarket hes on his way to south america hehes left us  val looked from her to soames left them was he sorry was he fond of his father it seemed to him that he did not know then suddenlyas at a whiff of gardenias and cigarshis heart twitched within him and he was sorry ones father belonged to one could not go off in this fashionit was not done nor had he always been the bounder of the pandemonium promenade there were precious memories of tailors shops and horses tips at school and general lavish kindness when in luck  but why he said then as a sportsman himself was sorry he had asked the mask of his mothers face was all disturbed and he burst out  all right mother dont tell me only what does it mean  a divorce val im afraid  val uttered a queer little grunt and looked quickly at his unclethat uncle whom he had been taught to look on as a guarantee against the consequences of having a father even against the dartie blood in his own veins the flatchecked visage seemed to wince and this upset him  it wont be public will it  so vividly before him had come recollection of his own eyes glued to the unsavoury details of many a divorce suit in the public press  cant it be done quietly somehow its so disgusting forfor mother andand everybody  everything will be done as quietly as it can you may be sure  yesbut why is it necessary at all mother doesnt want to marry again  himself the girls their name tarnished in the sight of his schoolfellows and of crum of the men at oxford ofholly unbearable what was to be gained by it  do you mother he said sharply  thus brought face to face with so much of her own feeling by the one she loved best in the world winifred rose from the empire chair in which she had been sitting she saw that her son would be against her unless he was told everything and yet how could she tell him thus still plucking at the green brocade she stared at soames val too stared at soames surely this embodiment of respectability and the sense of property could not wish to bring such a slur on his own sister  soames slowly passed a little inlaid paperknife over the smooth surface of a marqueterie table then without looking at his nephew he began  you dont understand what your mother has had to put up with these twenty years this is only the last straw val and glancing up sideways at winifred he added  shall i tell him  winifred was silent if he were not told he would be against her yet how dreadful to be told such things of his own father clenching her lips she nodded  soames spoke in a rapid even voice  he has always been a burden round your mothers neck she has paid his debts over and over again he has often been drunk abused and threatened her and now he is gone to buenos aires with a dancer and as if distrusting the efficacy of those words on the boy he went on quickly  he took your mothers pearls to give to her  val jerked up his hand then at that signal of distress winifred cried out  thatll do soamesstop  in the boy the dartie and the forsyte were struggling for debts drink dancers he had a certain sympathy but the pearlsno that was too much and suddenly he found his mothers hand squeezing his  you see he heard soames say we cant have it all begin over again theres a limit we must strike while the irons hot  val freed his hand  butyourenever going to bring out that about the pearls i couldnt stand thati simply couldnt  winifred cried out  no no valoh no thats only to show you how impossible your father is and his uncle nodded somewhat assuaged val took out a cigarette his father had bought him that thin curved case oh it was unbearablejust as he was going up to oxford  cant mother be protected without he said i could look after her it could always be done later if it was really necessary  a smile played for a moment round soames lips and became bitter  you dont know what youre talking of nothings so fatal as delay in such matters  why  i tell you boy nothings so fatal i know from experience  his voice had the ring of exasperation val regarded him roundeyed never having known his uncle express any sort of feeling oh yeshe remembered nowthere had been an aunt irene and something had happenedsomething which people kept dark he had heard his father once use an unmentionable word of her  i dont want to speak ill of your father soames went on doggedly but i know him well enough to be sure that hell be back on your mothers hands before a years over you can imagine what that will mean to her and to all of you after this the only thing is to cut the knot for good  in spite of himself val was impressed and happening to look at his mothers face he got what was perhaps his first real insight into the fact that his own feelings were not always what mattered most  all right mother he said well back you up only id like to know when itll be its my first term you know i dont want to be up there when it comes off  oh my dear boy murmured winifred it is a bore for you so by habit she phrased what from the expression of her face was the most poignant regret when will it be soames  cant tellnot for months we must get restitution first  what the deuce is that thought val what silly brutes lawyers are not for months i know one thing im not going to dine in and he said  awfully sorry mother ive got to go out to dinner now  though it was his last night winifred nodded almost gratefully they both felt that they had gone quite far enough in the expression of feeling  val sought the misty freedom of green street reckless and depressed and not till he reached piccadilly did he discover that he had only eighteenpence one couldnt dine off eighteenpence and he was very hungry he looked longingly at the windows of the iseeum club where he had often eaten of the best with his father those pearls there was no getting over them but the more he brooded and the further he walked the hungrier he naturally became short of trailing home there were only two places where he could gohis grandfathers in park lane and timothys in the bayswater road which was the less deplorable at his grandfathers he would probably get a better dinner on the spur of the moment at timothys they gave you a jolly good feed when they expected you not otherwise he decided on park lane not unmoved by the thought that to go up to oxford without affording his grandfather a chance to tip him was hardly fair to either of them his mother would hear he had been there of course and might think it funny but he couldnt help that he rang the bell  hullo warmson any dinner for me dyou think  theyre just going in master val mr forsyte will be very glad to see you he was saying at lunch that he never saw you nowadays  val grinned  well here i am kill the fatted calf warmson lets have fizz  warmson smiled faintlyin his opinion val was a young limb  i will ask mrs forsyte master val  i say val grumbled taking off his overcoat im not at school any more you know  warmson not without a sense of humour opened the door beyond the stagshorn coat stand with the words  mr valerus maam  confound him thought val entering  a warm embrace a well val from emily and a rather quavery so there you are at last from james restored his sense of dignity  why didnt you let us know theres only saddle of mutton champagne warmson said emily and they went in  at the great diningtable shortened to its utmost under which so many fashionable legs had rested james sat at one end emily at the other val halfway between them and something of the loneliness of his grandparents now that all their four children were flown reached the boys spirit i hope i shall kick the bucket long before im as old as grandfather he thought poor old chap hes as thin as a rail and lowering his voice while his grandfather and warmson were in discussion about sugar in the soup he said to emily  its pretty brutal at home granny i suppose you know  yes dear boy  uncle soames was there when i left i say isnt there anything to be done to prevent a divorce why is he so beastly keen on it  hush my dear murmured emily were keeping it from your grandfather  james voice sounded from the other end  whats that what are you talking about  about vals college returned emily young pariser was there james you rememberhe nearly broke the bank at monte carlo afterwards  james muttered that he did not knowval must look after himself up there or hed get into bad ways and he looked at his grandson with gloom out of which affection distrustfully glimmered  what im afraid of said val to his plate is of being hard up you know  by instinct he knew that the weak spot in that old man was fear of insecurity for his grandchildren  well said james and the soup in his spoon dribbled over youll have a good allowance but you must keep within it  of course murmured val if it is good how much will it be grandfather  three hundred and fifty its too much i had next to nothing at your age  val sighed he had hoped for four and been afraid of three i dont know what your young cousin has said james hes up there his fathers a rich man  arent you asked val hardily  i replied james flustered ive got so many expenses your father and he was silent  cousin jolyons got an awfully jolly place i went down there with uncle soamesripping stables  ah murmured james profoundly that housei knew how it would be and he lapsed into gloomy meditation over his fishbones his sons tragedy and the deep cleavage it had caused in the forsyte family had still the power to draw him down into a whirlpool of doubts and misgivings val who hankered to talk of robin hill because robin hill meant holly turned to emily and said  was that the house built for uncle soames and receiving her nod went on i wish youd tell me about him granny what became of aunt irene is she still going he seems awfully workedup about something tonight  emily laid her finger on her lips but the word irene had caught james ear  whats that he said staying a piece of mutton close to his lips whos been seeing her i knew we hadnt heard the last of that  now james said emily eat your dinner nobodys been seeing anybody  james put down his fork  there you go he said i might die before youd tell me of it is soames getting a divorce  nonsense said emily with incomparable aplomb soames is much too sensible  james had sought his own throat gathering the long white whiskers together on the skin and bone of it  sheshe was always he said and with that enigmatic remark the conversation lapsed for warmson had returned but later when the saddle of mutton had been succeeded by sweet savoury and dessert and val had received a cheque for twenty pounds and his grandfathers kisslike no other kiss in the world from lips pushed out with a sort of fearful suddenness as if yielding to weaknesshe returned to the charge in the hall  tell us about uncle soames granny why is he so keen on mothers getting a divorce  your uncle soames said emily and her voice had in it an exaggerated assurance is a lawyer my dear boy hes sure to know best  is he muttered val but what did become of aunt irene i remember she was jolly goodlooking  sheer said emily behaved very badly we dont talk about it  well i dont want everybody at oxford to know about our affairs ejaculated val its a brutal idea why couldnt father be prevented without its being made public  emily sighed she had always lived rather in an atmosphere of divorce owing to her fashionable proclivitiesso many of those whose legs had been under her table having gained a certain notoriety when however it touched her own family she liked it no better than other people but she was eminently practical and a woman of courage who never pursued a shadow in preference to its substance  your mother she said will be happier if shes quite free val goodnight my dear boy and dont wear loud waistcoats up at oxford theyre not the thing just now heres a little present  with another five pounds in his hand and a little warmth in his heart for he was fond of his grandmother he went out into park lane a wind had cleared the mist the autumn leaves were rustling and the stars were shining with all that money in his pocket an impulse to see life beset him but he had not gone forty yards in the direction of piccadilly when hollys shy face and her eyes with an imp dancing in their gravity came up before him and his hand seemed to be tingling again from the pressure of her warm gloved hand no dash it he thought im going home     chapter xsoames entertains the future  it was full late for the river but the weather was lovely and summer lingered below the yellowing leaves soames took many looks at the day from his riverside garden near mapledurham that sunday morning  with his own hands he put flowers about his little houseboat and equipped the punt in which after lunch he proposed to take them on the river placing those chineselooking cushions he could not tell whether or no he wished to take annette alone she was so very prettycould he trust himself not to say irrevocable words passing beyond the limits of discretion roses on the veranda were still in bloom and the hedges evergreen so that there was almost nothing of middleaged autumn to chill the mood yet was he nervous fidgety strangely distrustful of his powers to steer just the right course this visit had been planned to produce in annette and her mother a due sense of his possessions so that they should be ready to receive with respect any overture he might later be disposed to make he dressed with great care making himself neither too young nor too old very thankful that his hair was still thick and smooth and had no grey in it three times he went up to his picturegallery if they had any knowledge at all they must see at once that his collection alone was worth at least thirty thousand pounds he minutely inspected too the pretty bedroom overlooking the river where they would take off their hats it would be her bedroom ifif the matter went through and she became his wife going up to the dressingtable he passed his hand over the lilaccoloured pincushion into which were stuck all kinds of pins a bowl of potpourri exhaled a scent that made his head turn just a little his wife if only the whole thing could be settled out of hand and there was not the nightmare of this divorce to be gone through first and with gloom puckered on his forehead he looked out at the river shining beyond the roses and the lawn madame lamotte would never resist this prospect for her child annette would never resist her mother if only he were free he drove to the station to meet them what taste frenchwomen had madame lamotte was in black with touches of lilac colour annette in greyish lilac linen with cream coloured gloves and hat rather pale she looked and londony and her blue eyes were demure waiting for them to come down to lunch soames stood in the open frenchwindow of the diningroom moved by that sensuous delight in sunshine and flowers and trees which only came to the full when youth and beauty were there to share it with one he had ordered the lunch with intense consideration the wine was a very special sauterne the whole appointments of the meal perfect the coffee served on the veranda superexcellent madame lamotte accepted creme de menthe annette refused her manners were charming with just a suspicion of the conscious beauty creeping into them yes thought soames another year of london and that sort of life and shell be spoiled  madame was in sedate french raptures adorable le soleil est si bon how everything is chic is it not annette monsieur is a real monte cristo annette murmured assent with a look up at soames which he could not read he proposed a turn on the river but to punt two persons when one of them looked so ravishing on those chinese cushions was merely to suffer from a sense of lost opportunity so they went but a short way towards pangbourne drifting slowly back with every now and then an autumn leaf dropping on annette or on her mothers black amplitude and soames was not happy worried by the thought howwhenwherecan i saywhat they did not yet even know that he was married to tell them he was married might jeopardise his every chance yet if he did not definitely make them understand that he wished for annettes hand it would be dropping into some other clutch before he was free to claim it  at tea which they both took with lemon soames spoke of the transvaal  therell be war he said  madame lamotte lamented  ces pauvres gens bergers could they not be left to themselves  soames smiledthe question seemed to him absurd  surely as a woman of business she understood that the british could not abandon their legitimate commercial interests  ah that but madame lamotte found that the english were a little hypocrite they were talking of justice and the uitlanders not of business monsieur was the first who had spoken to her of that  the boers are only halfcivilised remarked soames they stand in the way of progress it will never do to let our suzerainty go  what does that mean to say suzerainty  what a strange word soames became eloquent roused by these threats to the principle of possession and stimulated by annettes eyes fixed on him he was delighted when presently she said  i think monsieur is right they should be taught a lesson she was sensible  of course he said we must act with moderation im no jingo we must be firm without bullying will you come up and see my pictures moving from one to another of these treasures he soon perceived that they knew nothing they passed his last mauve that remarkable study of a haycart going home as if it were a lithograph he waited almost with awe to see how they would view the jewel of his collectionan israels whose price he had watched ascending till he was now almost certain it had reached top value and would be better on the market again they did not view it at all this was a shock and yet to have in annette a virgin taste to form would be better than to have the silly halfbaked predilections of the english middleclass to deal with at the end of the gallery was a meissonier of which he was rather ashamedmeissonier was so steadily going down madame lamotte stopped before it  meissonier ah what a jewel soames took advantage of that moment very gently touching annettes arm he said  how do you like my place annette  she did not shrink did not respond she looked at him full looked down and murmured  who would not like it it is so beautiful  perhaps some day soames said and stopped  so pretty she was so selfpossessedshe frightened him those cornflowerblue eyes the turn of that creamy neck her delicate curvesshe was a standing temptation to indiscretion no no one must be sure of ones groundmuch surer if i hold off he thought it will tantalise her and he crossed over to madame lamotte who was still in front of the meissonier  yes thats quite a good example of his later work you must come again madame and see them lighted up you must both come and spend a night  enchanted would it not be beautiful to see them lighted by moonlight too the river must be ravishing  annette murmured  thou art sentimental maman  sentimental that blackrobed comely substantial frenchwoman of the world and suddenly he was certain as he could be that there was no sentiment in either of them all the better of what use sentiment and yet  he drove to the station with them and saw them into the train to the tightened pressure of his hand it seemed that annettes fingers responded just a little her face smiled at him through the dark  he went back to the carriage brooding go on home jordan he said to the coachman ill walk and he strode out into the darkening lanes caution and the desire of possession playing seesaw within him bon soir monsieur how softly she had said it to know what was in her mind the frenchthey were like catsone could tell nothing buthow pretty what a perfect young thing to hold in ones arms what a mother for his heir and he thought with a smile of his family and their surprise at a french wife and their curiosity and of the way he would play with it and buffet it confound them  the poplars sighed in the darkness an owl hooted shadows deepened in the water i will and must be free he thought i wont hang about any longer ill go and see irene if you want things done do them yourself i must live againlive and move and have my being and in echo to that queer biblicality churchbells chimed the call to evening prayer     chapter xiand visits the past  on a tuesday evening after dining at his club soames set out to do what required more courage and perhaps less delicacy than anything he had yet undertaken in his lifesave perhaps his birth and one other action he chose the evening indeed partly because irene was more likely to be in but mainly because he had failed to find sufficient resolution by daylight had needed wine to give him extra daring  he left his hansom on the embankment and walked up to the old church uncertain of the block of flats where he knew she lived he found it hiding behind a much larger mansion and having read the name mrs irene heronheron forsooth her maiden name so she used that again did shehe stepped back into the road to look up at the windows of the first floor light was coming through in the corner flat and he could hear a piano being played he had never had a love of music had secretly borne it a grudge in the old days when so often she had turned to her piano making of it a refuge place into which she knew he could not enter repulse the long repulse at first restrained and secret at last open bitter memory came with that sound it must be she playing and thus almost assured of seeing her he stood more undecided than ever shivers of anticipation ran through him his tongue felt dry his heart beat fast i have no cause to be afraid he thought and then the lawyer stirred within him was he doing a foolish thing ought he not to have arranged a formal meeting in the presence of her trustee no not before that fellow jolyon who sympathised with her never he crossed back into the doorway and slowly to keep down the beating of his heart mounted the single flight of stairs and rang the bell when the door was opened to him his sensations were regulated by the scent which camethat perfumefrom away back in the past bringing muffled remembrance fragrance of a drawingroom he used to enter of a house he used to ownperfume of dried roseleaves and honey  say mr forsyte he said your mistress will see me i know he had thought this out she would think it was jolyon  when the maid was gone and he was alone in the tiny hall where the light was dim from one pearlyshaded sconce and walls carpet everything was silvery making the walledin space all ghostly he could only think ridiculously shall i go in with my overcoat on or take it off the music ceased the maid said from the doorway  will you walk in sir  soames walked in he noted mechanically that all was still silvery and that the upright piano was of satinwood she had risen and stood recoiled against it her hand placed on the keys as if groping for support had struck a sudden discord held for a moment and released the light from the shaded pianocandle fell on her neck leaving her face rather in shadow she was in a black evening dress with a sort of mantilla over her shouldershe did not remember ever having seen her in black and the thought passed through him she dresses even when shes alone  you he heard her whisper  many times soames had rehearsed this scene in fancy rehearsal served him not at all he simply could not speak he had never thought that the sight of this woman whom he had once so passionately desired so completely owned and whom he had not seen for twelve years could affect him in this way he had imagined himself speaking and acting half as man of business half as judge and now it was as if he were in the presence not of a mere woman and erring wife but of some force subtle and elusive as atmosphere itself within him and outside a kind of defensive irony welled up in him  yes its a queer visit i hope youre well  thank you will you sit down  she had moved away from the piano and gone over to a windowseat sinking on to it with her hands clasped in her lap light fell on her there so that soames could see her face eyes hair strangely as he remembered them strangely beautiful  he sat down on the edge of a satinwood chair upholstered with silvercoloured stuff close to where he was standing  you have not changed he said  no what have you come for  to discuss things  i have heard what you want from your cousin  well  i am willing i have always been  the sound of her voice reserved and close the sight of her figure watchfully poised defensive was helping him now a thousand memories of her ever on the watch against him stirred and  perhaps you will be good enough then to give me information on which i can act the law must be complied with  i have none to give you that you dont know of  twelve years do you suppose i can believe that  i dont suppose you will believe anything i say but its the truth  soames looked at her hard he had said that she had not changed now he perceived that she had not in face except that it was more beautiful not in form except that it was a little fullerno she had changed spiritually there was more of her as it were something of activity and daring where there had been sheer passive resistance ah he thought thats her independent income confound uncle jolyon  i suppose youre comfortably off now he said  thank you yes  why didnt you let me provide for you i would have in spite of everything  a faint smile came on her lips but she did not answer  you are still my wife said soames why he said that what he meant by it he knew neither when he spoke nor after it was a truism almost preposterous but its effect was startling she rose from the windowseat and stood for a moment perfectly still looking at him he could see her bosom heaving then she turned to the window and threw it open  why do that he said sharply youll catch cold in that dress im not dangerous and he uttered a little sad laugh  she echoed itfaintly bitterly  it washabit  rather odd habit said soames as bitterly shut the window  she shut it and sat down again she had developed power this womanthiswife of his he felt it issuing from her as she sat there in a sort of armour and almost unconsciously he rose and moved nearer he wanted to see the expression on her face her eyes met his unflinching heavens how clear they were and what a dark brown against that white skin and that burntamber hair and how white her shoulders  funny sensation this he ought to hate her  you had better tell me he said its to your advantage to be free as well as to mine that old matter is too old  i have told you  do you mean to tell me there has been nothingnobody  nobody you must go to your own life  stung by that retort soames moved towards the piano and back to the hearth to and fro as he had been wont in the old days in their drawingroom when his feelings were too much for him  that wont do he said you deserted me in common justice its for you  he saw her shrug those white shoulders heard her murmur  yes why didnt you divorce me then should i have cared  he stopped and looked at her intently with a sort of curiosity what on earth did she do with herself if she really lived quite alone and why had he not divorced her the old feeling that she had never understood him never done him justice bit him while he stared at her  why couldnt you have made me a good wife he said  yes it was a crime to marry you i have paid for it you will find some way perhaps you neednt mind my name i have none to lose now i think you had better go  a sense of defeatof being defrauded of his selfjustification and of something else beyond power of explanation to himself beset soames like the breath of a cold fog mechanically he reached up took from the mantelshelf a little china bowl reversed it and said  lowestoft where did you get this i bought its fellow at jobsons and visited by the sudden memory of how those many years ago he and she had bought china together he remained staring at the little bowl as if it contained all the past her voice roused him  take it i dont want it  soames put it back on the shelf  will you shake hands he said  a faint smile curved her lips she held out her hand it was cold to his rather feverish touch shes made of ice he thoughtshe was always made of ice but even as that thought darted through him his senses were assailed by the perfume of her dress and body as though the warmth within her which had never been for him were struggling to show its presence and he turned on his heel he walked out and away as if someone with a whip were after him not even looking for a cab glad of the empty embankment and the cold river and the thickstrewn shadows of the planetree leavesconfused flurried sore at heart and vaguely disturbed as though he had made some deep mistake whose consequences he could not foresee and the fantastic thought suddenly assailed him if instead of i think you had better go she had said i think you had better stay what should he have felt what would he have done that cursed attraction of her was there for him even now after all these years of estrangement and bitter thoughts it was there ready to mount to his head at a sign a touch i was a fool to go he muttered ive advanced nothing who could imagine i never thought memory flown back to the first years of his marriage played him torturing tricks she had not deserved to keep her beautythe beauty he had owned and known so well and a kind of bitterness at the tenacity of his own admiration welled up in him most men would have hated the sight of her as she had deserved she had spoiled his life wounded his pride to death defrauded him of a son and yet the mere sight of her cold and resisting as ever had this power to upset him utterly it was some damned magnetism she had and no wonder if as she asserted she had lived untouched these last twelve years so bosinneycursed be his memoryhad lived on all this time with her soames could not tell whether he was glad of that knowledge or no  nearing his club at last he stopped to buy a paper a headline ran boers reported to repudiate suzerainty suzerainty just like her he thought she always did suzerainty i still have it by rights she must be awfully lonely in that wretched little flat     chapter xiion forsyte change  soames belonged to two clubs the connoisseurs which he put on his cards and seldom visited and the remove which he did not put on his cards and frequented he had joined this liberal institution five years ago having made sure that its members were now nearly all sound conservatives in heart and pocket if not in principle uncle nicholas had put him up the fine readingroom was decorated in the adam style  on entering that evening he glanced at the tape for any news about the transvaal and noted that consols were down sevensixteenths since the morning he was turning away to seek the readingroom when a voice behind him said  well soames that went off all right  it was uncle nicholas in a frockcoat and his special cutaway collar with a black tie passed through a ring heavens how young and dapper he looked at eightytwo  i think rogerd have been pleased his uncle went on the thing was very well done blackleys ill make a note of them buxtons done me no good these boers are upsetting methat fellow chamberlains driving the country into war what do you think  bound to come murmured soames  nicholas passed his hand over his thin cleanshaven cheeks very rosy after his summer cure a slight pout had gathered on his lips this business had revived all his liberal principles  i mistrust that chap hes a stormy petrel houseproperty will go down if theres war youll have trouble with rogers estate i often told him he ought to get out of some of his houses he was an opinionated beggar  there was a pair of you thought soames but he never argued with an uncle in that way preserving their opinion of him as a longheaded chap and the legal care of their property  they tell me at timothys said nicholas lowering his voice that dartie has gone off at last thatll be a relief to your father he was a rotten egg  again soames nodded if there was a subject on which the forsytes really agreed it was the character of montague dartie  you take care said nicholas or hell turn up again winifred had better have the tooth out i should say no use preserving whats gone bad  soames looked at him sideways his nerves exacerbated by the interview he had just come through disposed him to see a personal allusion in those words  im advising her he said shortly  well said nicholas the broughams waiting i must get home im very poorly remember me to your father  and having thus reconsecrated the ties of blood he passed down the steps at his youthful gait and was wrapped into his fur coat by the junior porter  ive never known uncle nicholas other than very poorly mused soames or seen him look other than everlasting what a family judging by him ive got thirtyeight years of health before me well im not going to waste them and going over to a mirror he stood looking at his face except for a line or two and three or four grey hairs in his little dark moustache had he aged any more than irene the prime of lifehe and she in the very prime of life and a fantastic thought shot into his mind absurd idiotic but again it came and genuinely alarmed by the recurrence as one is by the second fit of shivering which presages a feverish cold he sat down on the weighing machine eleven stone he had not varied two pounds in twenty years what age was she nearly thirtysevennot too old to have a childnot at all thirtyseven on the ninth of next month he remembered her birthday wellhe had always observed it religiously even that last birthday so soon before she left him when he was almost certain she was faithless four birthdays in his house he had looked forward to them because his gifts had meant a semblance of gratitude a certain attempt at warmth except indeed that last birthdaywhich had tempted him to be too religious and he shied away in thought memory heaps dead leaves on corpselike deeds from under which they do but vaguely offend the sense and then he thought suddenly i could send her a present for her birthday after all were christians couldntcouldnt we join up again and he uttered a deep sigh sitting there annette ah but between him and annette was the need for that wretched divorce suit and how  a man can always work these things if hell take it on himself jolyon had said  but why should he take the scandal on himself with his whole career as a pillar of the law at stake it was not fair it was quixotic twelve years separation in which he had taken no steps to free himself put out of court the possibility of using her conduct with bosinney as a ground for divorcing her by doing nothing to secure relief he had acquiesced even if the evidence could now be gathered which was more than doubtful besides his own pride would never let him use that old incident he had suffered from it too much no nothing but fresh misconduct on her partbut she had denied it andalmosthe had believed her hung up utterly hung up  he rose from the scoopedout red velvet seat with a feeling of constriction about his vitals he would never sleep with this going on in him and taking coat and hat again he went out moving eastward in trafalgar square he became aware of some special commotion travelling towards him out of the mouth of the strand it materialised in newspaper men calling out so loudly that no words whatever could be heard he stopped to listen and one came by  payper special ultimatium by krooger declaration of war soames bought the paper there it was in the stop press his first thought was the boers are committing suicide his second is there anything still i ought to sell if so he had missed the chancethere would certainly be a slump in the city tomorrow he swallowed this thought with a nod of defiance that ultimatum was insolentsooner than let it pass he was prepared to lose money they wanted a lesson and they would get it but it would take three months at least to bring them to heel there werent the troops out there always behind time the government confound those newspaper rats what was the use of waking everybody up breakfast tomorrow was quite soon enough and he thought with alarm of his father they would cry it down park lane hailing a hansom he got in and told the man to drive there  james and emily had just gone up to bed and after communicating the news to warmson soames prepared to follow he paused by afterthought to say  what do you think of it warmson  the butler ceased passing a hat brush over the silk hat soames had taken off and inclining his face a little forward said in a low voice well sir they avent a chance of course but im told theyre very good shots ive got a son in the inniskillings  you warmson why i didnt know you were married  no sir i dont talk of it i expect hell be going out  the slighter shock soames had felt on discovering that he knew so little of one whom he thought he knew so well was lost in the slight shock of discovering that the war might touch one personally born in the year of the crimean war he had only come to consciousness by the time the indian mutiny was over since then the many little wars of the british empire had been entirely professional quite unconnected with the forsytes and all they stood for in the body politic this war would surely be no exception but his mind ran hastily over his family two of the haymans he had heard were in some yeomanry or otherit had always been a pleasant thought there was a certain distinction about the yeomanry they wore or used to wear a blue uniform with silver about it and rode horses and archibald he remembered had once on a time joined the militia but had given it up because his father nicholas had made such a fuss about his wasting his time peacocking about in a uniform recently he had heard somewhere that young nicholas eldest very young nicholas had become a volunteer no thought soames mounting the stairs slowly theres nothing in that  he stood on the landing outside his parents bed and dressing rooms debating whether or not to put his nose in and say a reassuring word opening the landing window he listened the rumble from piccadilly was all the sound he heard and with the thought if these motorcars increase itll affect house property he was about to pass on up to the room always kept ready for him when he heard distant as yet the hoarse rushing call of a newsvendor there it was and coming past the house he knocked on his mothers door and went in  his father was sitting up in bed with his ears pricked under the white hair which emily kept so beautifully cut he looked pink and extraordinarily clean in his setting of white sheet and pillow out of which the points of his high thin nightgowned shoulders emerged in small peaks his eyes alone grey and distrustful under their withered lids were moving from the window to emily who in a wrapper was walking up and down squeezing a rubber ball attached to a scent bottle the room reeked faintly of the eaudecologne she was spraying  all right said soames its not a fire the boers have declared warthats all  emily stopped her spraying  oh was all she said and looked at james  soames too looked at his father he was taking it differently from their expectation as if some thought strange to them were working in him  hm he muttered suddenly i shant live to see the end of this  nonsense james itll be over by christmas  what do you know about it james answered her with asperity its a pretty mess at this time of night too he lapsed into silence and his wife and son as if hypnotised waited for him to say i cant telli dont know i knew how it would be but he did not the grey eyes shifted evidently seeing nothing in the room then movement occurred under the bedclothes and the knees were drawn up suddenly to a great height  they ought to send out roberts it all comes from that fellow gladstone and his majuba  the two listeners noted something beyond the usual in his voice something of real anxiety it was as if he had said i shall never see the old country peaceful and safe again i shall have to die before i know shes won and in spite of the feeling that james must not be encouraged to be fussy they were touched soames went up to the bedside and stroked his fathers hand which had emerged from under the bedclothes long and wrinkled with veins  mark my words said james consols will go to par for all i know val may go and enlist  oh come james cried emily you talk as if there were danger  her comfortable voice seemed to soothe james for once  well he muttered i told you how it would be i dont know im surenobody tells me anything are you sleeping here my boy  the crisis was past he would now compose himself to his normal degree of anxiety and assuring his father that he was sleeping in the house soames pressed his hand and went up to his room  the following afternoon witnessed the greatest crowd timothys had known for many a year on national occasions such as this it was indeed almost impossible to avoid going there not that there was any danger or rather only just enough to make it necessary to assure each other that there was none  nicholas was there early he had seen soames the night beforesoames had said it was bound to come this old kruger was in his dotagewhy he must be seventyfive if he was a day  nicholas was eightytwo what had timothy said he had had a fit after majuba these boers were a grasping lot the darkhaired francie who had arrived on his heels with the contradictious touch which became the free spirit of a daughter of roger chimed in  kettle and pot uncle nicholas what price the uitlanders what price indeed a new expression and believed to be due to her brother george  aunt juley thought francie ought not to say such a thing dear mrs macanders boy charlie macander was one and no one could call him grasping at this francie uttered one of her mots scandalising and so frequently repeated  well his fathers a scotchman and his mothers a cat  aunt juley covered her ears too late but aunt hester smiled as for nicholas he poutedwitticism of which he was not the author was hardly to his taste just then marian tweetyman arrived followed almost immediately by young nicholas on seeing his son nicholas rose  well i must be going he said nick here will tell you whatll win the race and with this hit at his eldest who as a pillar of accountancy and director of an insurance company was no more addicted to sport than his father had ever been he departed dear nicholas what race was that or was it only one of his jokes he was a wonderful man for his age how many lumps would dear marian take and how were giles and jesse aunt juley supposed their yeomanry would be very busy now guarding the coast though of course the boers had no ships but one never knew what the french might do if they had the chance especially since that dreadful fashoda scare which had upset timothy so terribly that he had made no investments for months afterwards it was the ingratitude of the boers that was so dreadful after everything had been done for themdr jameson imprisoned and he was so nice mrs macander had always said and sir alfred milner sent out to talk to themsuch a clever man she didnt know what they wanted  but at this moment occurred one of those sensationsso precious at timothyswhich great occasions sometimes bring forth  miss june forsyte  aunts juley and hester were on their feet at once trembling from smothered resentment and old affection bubbling up and pride at the return of a prodigal june well this was a surprise dear juneafter all these years and how well she was looking not changed at all it was almost on their lips to add and how is your dear grandfather forgetting in that giddy moment that poor dear jolyon had been in his grave for seven years now  ever the most courageous and downright of all the forsytes june with her decided chin and her spirited eyes and her hair like flame sat down slight and short on a gilt chair with a beadworked seat for all the world as if ten years had not elapsed since she had been to see themten years of travel and independence and devotion to lame ducks those ducks of late had been all definitely painters etchers or sculptors so that her impatience with the forsytes and their hopelessly inartistic outlook had become intense indeed she had almost ceased to believe that her family existed and looked round her now with a sort of challenging directness which brought exquisite discomfort to the roomful she had not expected to meet any of them but the poor old things and why she had come to see them she hardly knew except that while on her way from oxford street to a studio in latimer road she had suddenly remembered them with compunction as two longneglected old lame ducks  aunt juley broke the hush again weve just been saying dear how dreadful it is about these boers and what an impudent thing of that old kruger  impudent said june i think hes quite right what business have we to meddle with them if he turned out all those wretched uitlanders it would serve them right theyre only after money  the silence of sensation was broken by francie saying  what are you a proboer undoubtedly the first use of that expression  well why cant we leave them alone said june just as in the open doorway the maid said mr soames forsyte sensation on sensation greeting was almost held up by curiosity to see how june and he would take this encounter for it was shrewdly suspected if not quite known that they had not met since that old and lamentable affair of her fiance bosinney with soames wife they were seen to just touch each others hands and look each at the others left eye only aunt juley came at once to the rescue  dear june is so original fancy soames she thinks the boers are not to blame  they only want their independence said june and why shouldnt they have it  because answered soames with his smile a little on one side they happen to have agreed to our suzerainty  suzerainty repeated june scornfully we shouldnt like anyones suzerainty over us  they got advantages in payment replied soames a contract is a contract  contracts are not always just fumed out june and when theyre not they ought to be broken the boers are much the weaker we could afford to be generous  soames sniffed thats mere sentiment he said  aunt hester to whom nothing was more awful than any kind of disagreement here leaned forward and remarked decisively  what lovely weather it has been for the time of year  but june was not to be diverted  i dont know why sentiment should be sneered at its the best thing in the world she looked defiantly round and aunt juley had to intervene again  have you bought any pictures lately soames  her incomparable instinct for the wrong subject had not failed her soames flushed to disclose the name of his latest purchases would be like walking into the jaws of disdain for somehow they all knew of junes predilection for genius not yet on its legs and her contempt for success unless she had had a finger in securing it  one or two he muttered  but junes face had changed the forsyte within her was seeing its chance why should not soames buy some of the pictures of eric cobbleyher last lame duck and she promptly opened her attack did soames know his work it was so wonderful he was the coming man  oh yes soames knew his work it was in his view splashy and would never get hold of the public  june blazed up  of course it wont thats the last thing one would wish for i thought you were a connoisseur not a picturedealer  of course soames is a connoisseur aunt juley said hastily he has wonderful tastehe can always tell beforehand whats going to be successful  oh gasped june and sprang up from the beadcovered chair i hate that standard of success why cant people buy things because they like them  you mean said francie because you like them  and in the slight pause young nicholas was heard saying gently that violet his fourth was taking lessons in pastel he didnt know if they were any use  well goodbye auntie said june i must get on and kissing her aunts she looked defiantly round the room said goodbye again and went a breeze seemed to pass out with her as if everyone had sighed  the third sensation came before anyone had time to speak  mr james forsyte  james came in using a stick slightly and wrapped in a fur coat which gave him a fictitious bulk  everyone stood up james was so old and he had not been at timothys for nearly two years  its hot in here he said  soames divested him of his coat and as he did so could not help admiring the glossy way his father was turned out james sat down all knees elbows frockcoat and long white whiskers  whats the meaning of that he said  though there was no apparent sense in his words they all knew that he was referring to june his eyes searched his sons face  i thought id come and see for myself what have they answered kruger  soames took out an evening paper and read the headline  instant action by our governmentstate of war existing  ah said james and sighed i was afraid theyd cut and run like old gladstone we shall finish with them this time  all stared at him james always fussy nervous anxious james with his continual i told you how it would be and his pessimism and his cautious investments there was something uncanny about such resolution in this the oldest living forsyte  wheres timothy said james he ought to pay attention to this  aunt juley said she didnt know timothy had not said much at lunch today aunt hester rose and threaded her way out of the room and francie said rather maliciously  the boers are a hard nut to crack uncle james  hm muttered james where do you get your information nobody tells me  young nicholas remarked in his mild voice that nick his eldest was now going to drill regularly  ah muttered james and stared before himhis thoughts were on val hes got to look after his mother he said hes got no time for drilling and that with that father of his this cryptic saying produced silence until he spoke again  what did june want here and his eyes rested with suspicion on all of them in turn her fathers a rich man now the conversation turned on jolyon and when he had been seen last it was supposed that he went abroad and saw all sorts of people now that his wife was dead his watercolours were on the line and he was a successful man francie went so far as to say  i should like to see him again he was rather a dear  aunt juley recalled how he had gone to sleep on the sofa one day where james was sitting he had always been very amiable what did soames think  knowing that jolyon was irenes trustee all felt the delicacy of this question and looked at soames with interest a faint pink had come up in his cheeks  hes going grey he said  indeed had soames seen him soames nodded and the pink vanished  james said suddenly welli dont know i cant tell  it so exactly expressed the sentiment of everybody present that there was something behind everything that nobody responded but at this moment aunt hester returned  timothy she said in a low voice timothy has bought a map and hes put inhes put in three flags  timothy had a sigh went round the company  if timothy had indeed put in three flags already wellit showed what the nation could do when it was roused the war was as good as over     chapter xiiijolyon finds out where he is  jolyon stood at the window in hollys old night nursery converted into a studio not because it had a north light but for its view over the prospect away to the grand stand at epsom he shifted to the side window which overlooked the stableyard and whistled down to the dog balthasar who lay for ever under the clock tower the old dog looked up and wagged his tail poor old boy thought jolyon shifting back to the other window  he had been restless all this week since his attempt to prosecute trusteeship uneasy in his conscience which was ever acute disturbed in his sense of compassion which was easily excited and with a queer sensation as if his feeling for beauty had received some definite embodiment autumn was getting hold of the old oaktree its leaves were browning sunshine had been plentiful and hot this summer as with trees so with mens lives i ought to live long thought jolyon im getting mildewed for want of heat if i cant work i shall be off to paris but memory of paris gave him no pleasure besides how could he go he must stay and see what soames was going to do im her trustee i cant leave her unprotected he thought it had been striking him as curious how very clearly he could still see irene in her little drawingroom which he had only twice entered her beauty must have a sort of poignant harmony no literal portrait would ever do her justice the essence of her wasah i what the noise of hoofs called him back to the other window holly was riding into the yard on her longtailed palfrey she looked up and he waved to her she had been rather silent lately getting old he supposed beginning to want her future as they all didyoungsters  time was certainly the devil and with the feeling that to waste this swifttravelling commodity was unforgivable folly he took up his brush but it was no use he could not concentrate his eyebesides the light was going ill go up to town he thought in the hall a servant met him  a lady to see you sir mrs heron  extraordinary coincidence passing into the picturegallery as it was still called he saw irene standing over by the window  she came towards him saying  ive been trespassing i came up through the coppice and garden i always used to come that way to see uncle jolyon  you couldnt trespass here replied jolyon history makes that impossible i was just thinking of you  irene smiled and it was as if something shone through not mere spiritualityserener completer more alluring  history she answered i once told uncle jolyon that love was for ever well it isnt only aversion lasts  jolyon stared at her had she got over bosinney at last  yes he said aversions deeper than love or hate because its a natural product of the nerves and we dont change them  i came to tell you that soames has been to see me he said a thing that frightened me he said you are still my wife  what ejaculated jolyon you ought not to live alone and he continued to stare at her afflicted by the thought that where beauty was nothing ever ran quite straight which no doubt was why so many people looked on it as immoral  what more  he asked me to shake hands  did you  yes when he came in im sure he didnt want to he changed while he was there  ah you certainly ought not to go on living there alone  i know no woman i could ask and i cant take a lover to order cousin jolyon  heaven forbid said jolyon what a damnable position will you stay to dinner no well let me see you back to town i wanted to go up this evening  truly  truly ill be ready in five minutes  on that walk to the station they talked of pictures and music contrasting the english and french characters and the difference in their attitude to art but to jolyon the colours in the hedges of the long straight lane the twittering of chaffinches who kept pace with them the perfume of weeds being already burned the turn of her neck the fascination of those dark eyes bent on him now and then the lure of her whole figure made a deeper impression than the remarks they exchanged unconsciously he held himself straighter walked with a more elastic step  in the train he put her through a sort of catechism as to what she did with her days  made her dresses shopped visited a hospital played her piano translated from the french  she had regular work from a publisher it seemed which supplemented her income a little she seldom went out in the evening ive been living alone so long you see that i dont mind it a bit i believe im naturally solitary  i dont believe that said jolyon do you know many people  very few  at waterloo they took a hansom and he drove with her to the door of her mansions squeezing her hand at parting he said  you know you could always come to us at robin hill you must let me know everything that happens goodbye irene  goodbye she answered softly  jolyon climbed back into his cab wondering why he had not asked her to dine and go to the theatre with him solitary starved hungup life that she had hotch potch club he said through the trapdoor as his hansom debouched on to the embankment a man in tophat and overcoat passed walking quickly so close to the wall that he seemed to be scraping it  by jove thought jolyon soames himself whats he up to now and stopping the cab round the corner he got out and retraced his steps to where he could see the entrance to the mansions soames had halted in front of them and was looking up at the light in her windows if he goes in thought jolyon what shall i do what have i the right to do what the fellow had said was true she was still his wife absolutely without protection from annoyance well if he goes in he thought i follow and he began moving towards the mansions again soames advanced he was in the very entrance now but suddenly he stopped spun round on his heel and came back towards the river what now thought jolyon in a dozen steps hell recognise me and he turned tail his cousins footsteps kept pace with his own but he reached his cab and got in before soames had turned the corner go on he said through the trap soames figure ranged up alongside  hansom he said engaged hallo  hallo answered jolyon you  the quick suspicion on his cousins face white in the lamplight decided him  i can give you a lift he said if youre going west  thanks answered soames and got in  ive been seeing irene said jolyon when the cab had started  indeed  you went to see her yesterday yourself i understand  i did said soames shes my wife you know  the tone the halflifted sneering lip roused sudden anger in jolyon but he subdued it  you ought to know best he said but if you want a divorce its not very wise to go seeing her is it one cant run with the hare and hunt with the hounds  youre very good to warn me said soames but i have not made up my mind  she has said jolyon looking straight before him you cant take things up you know as they were twelve years ago  that remains to be seen  look here said jolyon shes in a damnable position and i am the only person with any legal say in her affairs  except myself retorted soames who am also in a damnable position hers is what she made for herself mine what she made for me i am not at all sure that in her own interests i shant require her to return to me  what exclaimed jolyon and a shiver went through his whole body  i dont know what you may mean by what answered soames coldly your say in her affairs is confined to paying out her income please bear that in mind in choosing not to disgrace her by a divorce i retained my rights and as i say i am not at all sure that i shant require to exercise them  my god ejaculated jolyon and he uttered a short laugh  yes said soames and there was a deadly quality in his voice ive not forgotten the nickname your father gave me the man of property im not called names for nothing  this is fantastic murmured jolyon well the fellow couldnt force his wife to live with him those days were past anyway and he looked around at soames with the thought is he real this man but soames looked very real sitting square yet almost elegant with the clipped moustache on his pale face and a tooth showing where a lip was lifted in a fixed smile there was a long silence while jolyon thought instead of helping her ive made things worse suddenly soames said  it would be the best thing that could happen to her in many ways  at those words such a turmoil began taking place in jolyon that he could barely sit still in the cab it was as if he were boxed up with hundreds of thousands of his countrymen boxed up with that something in the national character which had always been to him revolting something which he knew to be extremely natural and yet which seemed to him inexplicabletheir intense belief in contracts and vested rights their complacent sense of virtue in the exaction of those rights here beside him in the cab was the very embodiment the corporeal sum as it were of the possessive instincthis own kinsman too it was uncanny and intolerable but theres something more in it than that he thought with a sick feeling the dog they say returns to his vomit the sight of her has reawakened something beauty the devils in it  as i say said soames i have not made up my mind i shall be obliged if you will kindly leave her quite alone  jolyon bit his lips he who had always hated rows almost welcomed the thought of one now  i can give you no such promise he said shortly  very well said soames then we know where we are ill get down here and stopping the cab he got out without word or sign of farewell jolyon travelled on to his club  the first news of the war was being called in the streets but he paid no attention what could he do to help her if only his father were alive he could have done so much but why could he not do all that his father could have done was he not old enoughturned fifty and twice married with grownup daughters and a son queer he thought if she were plain i shouldnt be thinking twice about it beauty is the devil when youre sensitive to it and into the club readingroom he went with a disturbed heart in that very room he and bosinney had talked one summer afternoon he well remembered even now the disguised and secret lecture he had given that young man in the interests of june the diagnosis of the forsytes he had hazarded and how he had wondered what sort of woman it was he was warning him against and now he was almost in want of a warning himself its deuced funny he thought really deuced funny     chapter xivsoames discovers what he wants  it is so much easier to say then we know where we are than to mean anything particular by the words and in saying them soames did but vent the jealous rankling of his instincts he got out of the cab in a state of wary angerwith himself for not having seen irene with jolyon for having seen her and now with his inability to tell exactly what he wanted  he had abandoned the cab because he could not bear to remain seated beside his cousin and walking briskly eastwards he thought i wouldnt trust that fellow jolyon a yard once outcast always outcast the chap had a natural sympathy withwithlaxity he had shied at the word sin because it was too melodramatic for use by a forsyte  indecision in desire was to him a new feeling he was like a child between a promised toy and an old one which had been taken away from him and he was astonished at himself only last sunday desire had seemed simplejust his freedom and annette ill go and dine there he thought to see her might bring back his singleness of intention calm his exasperation clear his mind  the restaurant was fairly fulla good many foreigners and folk whom from their appearance he took to be literary or artistic scraps of conversation came his way through the clatter of plates and glasses he distinctly heard the boers sympathised with the british government blamed dont think much of their clientele he thought he went stolidly through his dinner and special coffee without making his presence known and when at last he had finished was careful not to be seen going towards the sanctum of madame lamotte they were as he entered having suppersuch a much nicerlooking supper than the dinner he had eaten that he felt a kind of griefand they greeted him with a surprise so seemingly genuine that he thought with sudden suspicion i believe they knew i was here all the time he gave annette a look furtive and searching so pretty seemingly so candid could she be angling for him he turned to madame lamotte and said  ive been dining here  really if she had only known there were dishes she could have recommended what a pity soames was confirmed in his suspicion i must look out what im doing he thought sharply  another little cup of very special coffee monsieur a liqueur grand marnier and madame lamotte rose to order these delicacies  alone with annette soames said well annette with a defensive little smile about his lips  the girl blushed this which last sunday would have set his nerves tingling now gave him much the same feeling a man has when a dog that he owns wriggles and looks at him he had a curious sense of power as if he could have said to her come and kiss me and she would have come and yetit was strangebut there seemed another face and form in the room too and the itch in his nerves was it for thator for this he jerked his head towards the restaurant and said you have some queer customers do you like this life  annette looked up at him for a moment looked down and played with her fork  no she said i do not like it  ive got her thought soames if i want her but do i want her she was graceful she was prettyvery pretty she was fresh she had taste of a kind his eyes travelled round the little room but the eyes of his mind went another journeya halflight and silvery walls a satinwood piano a woman standing against it reined back as it were from hima woman with white shoulders that he knew and dark eyes that he had sought to know and hair like dull dark amber and as in an artist who strives for the unrealisable and is ever thirsty so there rose in him at that moment the thirst of the old passion he had never satisfied  well he said calmly youre young theres everything before you  annette shook her head  i think sometimes there is nothing before me but hard work i am not so in love with work as mother  your mother is a wonder said soames faintly mocking she will never let failure lodge in her house  annette sighed it must be wonderful to be rich  oh youll be rich some day answered soames still with that faint mockery dont be afraid  annette shrugged her shoulders monsieur is very kind and between her pouting lips she put a chocolate  yes my dear thought soames theyre very pretty  madame lamotte with coffee and liqueur put an end to that colloquy soames did not stay long  outside in the streets of soho which always gave him such a feeling of property improperly owned he mused if only irene had given him a son he wouldnt now be squirming after women the thought had jumped out of its little dark sentrybox in his inner consciousness a sonsomething to look forward to something to make the rest of life worth while something to leave himself to some perpetuity of self if i had a son he thought bitterly a proper legal son i could make shift to go on as i used one womans much the same as another after all but as he walked he shook his head no one woman was not the same as another many a time had he tried to think that in the old days of his thwarted married life and he had always failed he was failing now he was trying to think annette the same as that other but she was not she had not the lure of that old passion and irenes my wife he thought my legal wife i have done nothing to put her away from me why shouldnt she come back to me its the right thing the lawful thing it makes no scandal no disturbance if its disagreeable to herbut why should it be im not a leper and sheshes no longer in love why should he be put to the shifts and the sordid disgraces and the lurking defeats of the divorce court when there she was like an empty house only waiting to be retaken into use and possession by him who legally owned her to one so secretive as soames the thought of reentry into quiet possession of his own property with nothing given away to the world was intensely alluring no he mused im glad i went to see that girl i know now what i want most if only irene will come back ill be as considerate as she wishes she could live her own life but perhapsperhaps she would come round to me there was a lump in his throat and doggedly along by the railings of the green park towards his fathers house he went trying to tread on his shadow walking before him in the brilliant moonlight     part ii     chapter ithe third generation  jolly forsyte was strolling down high street oxford on a november afternoon val dartie was strolling up jolly had just changed out of boating flannels and was on his way to the fryingpan to which he had recently been elected val had just changed out of riding clothes and was on his way to the firea bookmakers in cornmarket  hallo said jolly  hallo replied val  the cousins had met but twice jolly the secondyear man having invited the freshman to breakfast and last evening they had seen each other again under somewhat exotic circumstances  over a tailors in the cornmarket resided one of those privileged young beings called minors whose inheritances are large whose parents are dead whose guardians are remote and whose instincts are vicious at nineteen he had commenced one of those careers attractive and inexplicable to ordinary mortals for whom a single bankruptcy is good as a feast already famous for having the only roulette table then to be found in oxford he was anticipating his expectations at a dazzling rate he outcrummed crum though of a sanguine and rather beefy type which lacked the latters fascinating languor for val it had been in the nature of baptism to be taken there to play roulette in the nature of confirmation to get back into college after hours through a window whose bars were deceptive once during that evening of delight glancing up from the seductive green before him he had caught sight through a cloud of smoke of his cousin standing opposite rouge gagne impair et manque he had not seen him again  come in to the fryingpan and have tea said jolly and they went in  a stranger seeing them together would have noticed an unseizable resemblance between these second cousins of the third generations of forsytes the same bone formation in face though jollys eyes were darker grey his hair lighter and more wavy  tea and buttered buns waiter please said jolly  have one of my cigarettes said val i saw you last night how did you do  i didnt play  i won fifteen quid  though desirous of repeating a whimsical comment on gambling he had once heard his father makewhen youre fleeced youre sick and when you fleece youre sorryjolly contented himself with  rotten game i think i was at school with that chap hes an awful fool  oh i dont know said val as one might speak in defence of a disparaged god hes a pretty good sport  they exchanged whiffs in silence  you met my people didnt you said jolly theyre coming up tomorrow  val grew a little red  really i can give you a rare good tip for the manchester november handicap  thanks i only take interest in the classic races  you cant make any money over them said val  i hate the ring said jolly theres such a row and stink i like the paddock  i like to back my judgment answered val  jolly smiled his smile was like his fathers  i havent got any i always lose money if i bet  you have to buy experience of course  yes but its all messedup with doing people in the eye  of course or theyll do youthats the excitement  jolly looked a little scornful  what do you do with yourself row  noride and drive about im going to play polo next term if i can get my granddad to stump up  thats old uncle james isnt it whats he like  older than forty hills said val and always thinking hes going to be ruined  i suppose my granddad and he were brothers  i dont believe any of that old lot were sportsmen said val they must have worshipped money  mine didnt said jolly warmly  val flipped the ash off his cigarette  moneys only fit to spend he said i wish the deuce i had more  jolly gave him that direct upward look of judgment which he had inherited from old jolyon one didnt talk about money and again there was silence while they drank tea and ate the buttered buns  where are your people going to stay asked val elaborately casual  rainbow what do you think of the war  rotten so far the boers arent sports a bit why dont they come out into the open  why should they theyve got everything against them except their way of fighting i rather admire them  they can ride and shoot admitted val but theyre a lousy lot do you know crum  of merton only by sight hes in that fast set too isnt he rather ladida and brummagem  val said fixedly hes a friend of mine  oh sorry and they sat awkwardly staring past each other having pitched on their pet points of snobbery for jolly was forming himself unconsciously on a set whose motto was  we defy you to bore us life isnt half long enough and were going to talk faster and more crisply do more and know more and dwell less on any subject than you can possibly imagine we are the bestmade of wire and whipcord and val was unconsciously forming himself on a set whose motto was we defy you to interest or excite us we have had every sensation or if we havent we pretend we have we are so exhausted with living that no hours are too small for us we will lose our shirts with equanimity we have flown fast and are past everything all is cigarette smoke bismillah competitive spirit bonedeep in the english was obliging those two young forsytes to have ideals and at the close of a century ideals are mixed the aristocracy had already in the main adopted the jumpingjesus principle though here and there one like crumwho was an honourablestood starkly languid for that gamblers nirvana which had been the summum bonum of the old dandies and of the mashers in the eighties and round crum were still gathered a forlorn hope of bluebloods with a plutocratic following  but there was between the cousins another far less obvious antipathycoming from the unseizable family resemblance which each perhaps resented or from some halfconsciousness of that old feud persisting still between their branches of the clan formed within them by odd words or halfhints dropped by their elders and jolly tinkling his teaspoon was musing his tiepin and his waistcoat and his drawl and his bettinggood lord  and val finishing his bun was thinking hes rather a young beast  i suppose youll be meeting your people he said getting up i wish youd tell them i should like to show them over bncnot that theres anything much thereif theyd care to come  thanks ill ask them  would they lunch ive got rather a decent scout  jolly doubted if they would have time  youll ask them though  very good of you said jolly fully meaning that they should not go but instinctively polite he added youd better come and have dinner with us tomorrow  rather what time  seventhirty  dress  no and they parted a subtle antagonism alive within them  holly and her father arrived by a midday train it was her first visit to the city of spires and dreams and she was very silent looking almost shyly at the brother who was part of this wonderful place after lunch she wandered examining his household gods with intense curiosity jollys sittingroom was panelled and art represented by a set of bartolozzi prints which had belonged to old jolyon and by college photographsof young men live young men a little heroic and to be compared with her memories of val jolyon also scrutinised with care that evidence of his boys character and tastes  jolly was anxious that they should see him rowing so they set forth to the river holly between her brother and her father felt elated when heads were turned and eyes rested on her that they might see him to the best advantage they left him at the barge and crossed the river to the towingpath slight in buildfor of all the forsytes only old swithin and george were beefyjolly was rowing two in a trial eight he looked very earnest and strenuous with pride jolyon thought him the bestlooking boy of the lot holly as became a sister was more struck by one or two of the others but would not have said so for the world the river was bright that afternoon the meadows lush the trees still beautiful with colour distinguished peace clung around the old city jolyon promised himself a days sketching if the weather held the eight passed a second time spurting home along the bargesjollys face was very set so as not to show that he was blown they returned across the river and waited for him  oh said jolly in the christ church meadows i had to ask that chap val dartie to dine with us tonight he wanted to give you lunch and show you bnc so i thought id better then you neednt go i dont like him much  hollys rather sallow face had become suffused with pink  why not  oh i dont know he seems to me rather showy and bad form what are his people like dad hes only a second cousin isnt he  jolyon took refuge in a smile  ask holly he said she saw his uncle  i liked val holly answered staring at the ground before her his uncle lookedawfully different she stole a glance at jolly from under her lashes  did you ever said jolyon with whimsical intention hear our family history my dears its quite a fairy tale the first jolyon forsyteat all events the first we know anything of and that would be your greatgreatgrandfatherdwelt in the land of dorset on the edge of the sea being by profession an agriculturalist as your greataunt put it and the son of an agriculturistfarmers in fact your grandfather used to call them very small beer he looked at jolly to see how his lordliness was standing it and with the other eye noted hollys malicious pleasure in the slight drop of her brothers face  we may suppose him thick and sturdy standing for england as it was before the industrial era began the second jolyon forsyteyour greatgrandfather jolly better known as superior dosset forsytebuilt houses so the chronicle runs begat ten children and migrated to london town it is known that he drank sherry we may suppose him representing the england of napoleons wars and general unrest the eldest of his six sons was the third jolyon your grandfather my dearstea merchant and chairman of companies one of the soundest englishmen who ever livedand to me the dearest jolyons voice had lost its irony and his son and daughter gazed at him solemnly he was just and tenacious tender and young at heart you remember him and i remember him pass to the others your greatuncle james thats young vals grandfather had a son called soameswhereby hangs a tale of no love lost and i dont think ill tell it you james and the other eight children of superior dosset of whom there are still five alive may be said to have represented victorian england with its principles of trade and individualism at five per cent and your money backif you know what that means at all events theyve turned thirty thousand pounds into a cool million between them in the course of their long lives they never did a wild thingunless it was your greatuncle swithin who i believe was once swindled at thimblerig and was called fourinhand forsyte because he drove a pair their day is passing and their type not altogether for the advantage of the country they were pedestrian but they too were sound i am the fourth jolyon forsytea poor holder of the name  no dad said jolly and holly squeezed his hand  yes repeated jolyon a poor specimen representing im afraid nothing but the end of the century unearned income amateurism and individual libertya different thing from individualism jolly you are the fifth jolyon forsyte old man and you open the ball of the new century  as he spoke they turned in through the college gates and holly said its fascinating dad  none of them quite knew what she meant jolly was grave  the rainbow distinguished as only an oxford hostel can be for lack of modernity provided one small oakpanelled private sittingroom in which holly sat to receive whitefrocked shy and alone when the only guest arrived rather as one would touch a moth val took her hand and wouldnt she wear this measly flower it would look ripping in her hair he removed a gardenia from his coat  oh no thank youi couldnt but she took it and pinned it at her neck having suddenly remembered that word showy vals buttonhole would give offence and she so much wanted jolly to like him did she realise that val was at his best and quietest in her presence and was that perhaps half the secret of his attraction for her  i never said anything about our ride val  rather not its just between us  by the uneasiness of his hands and the fidgeting of his feet he was giving her a sense of power very delicious a soft feeling toothe wish to make him happy  do tell me about oxford it must be ever so lovely  val admitted that it was frightfully decent to do what you liked the lectures were nothing and there were some very good chaps only he added of course i wish i was in town and could come down and see you  holly moved one hand shyly on her knee and her glance dropped  you havent forgotten he said suddenly gathering courage that were going madrabbiting together  holly smiled  oh that was only makebelieve one cant do that sort of thing after ones grown up you know  dash it cousins can said val next long vacit begins in june you know and goes on for everwell watch our chance  but though the thrill of conspiracy ran through her veins holly shook her head it wont come off she murmured  wont it said val fervently whos going to stop it not your father or your brother  at this moment jolyon and jolly came in and romance fled into vals patent leather and hollys white satin toes where it itched and tingled during an evening not conspicuous for openheartedness  sensitive to atmosphere jolyon soon felt the latent antagonism between the boys and was puzzled by holly so he became unconsciously ironical which is fatal to the expansiveness of youth a letter handed to him after dinner reduced him to a silence hardly broken till jolly and val rose to go he went out with them smoking his cigar and walked with his son to the gates of christ church turning back he took out the letter and read it again beneath a lamp   dear jolyon  soames came again tonightmy thirtyseventh birthday you were right i mustnt stay here im going tomorrow to the piedmont hotel but i wont go abroad without seeing you i feel lonely and downhearted  yours affectionately  irene   he folded the letter back into his pocket and walked on astonished at the violence of his feelings what had the fellow said or done  he turned into high street down the turf and on among a maze of spires and domes and long college fronts and walls bright or darkshadowed in the strong moonlight in this very heart of englands gentility it was difficult to realise that a lonely woman could be importuned or hunted but what else could her letter mean soames must have been pressing her to go back to him again with public opinion and the law on his side too eighteenninetynine he thought gazing at the broken glass shining on the top of a villa garden wall but when it comes to property were still a heathen people ill go up tomorrow morning i dare say itll be best for her to go abroad yet the thought displeased him why should soames hunt her out of england besides he might follow and out there she would be still more helpless against the attentions of her own husband i must tread warily he thought that fellow could make himself very nasty i didnt like his manner in the cab the other night his thoughts turned to his daughter june could she help once on a time irene had been her greatest friend and now she was a lame duck such as must appeal to junes nature he determined to wire to his daughter to meet him at paddington station retracing his steps towards the rainbow he questioned his own sensations would he be upsetting himself over every woman in like case no he would not the candour of this conclusion discomfited him and finding that holly had gone up to bed he sought his own room but he could not sleep and sat for a long time at his window huddled in an overcoat watching the moonlight on the roofs  next door holly too was awake thinking of the lashes above and below vals eyes especially below and of what she could do to make jolly like him better the scent of the gardenia was strong in her little bedroom and pleasant to her  and val leaning out of his firstfloor window in bnc was gazing at a moonlit quadrangle without seeing it at all seeing instead holly slim and whitefrocked as she sat beside the fire when he first went in  but jolly in his bedroom narrow as a ghost lay with a hand beneath his cheek and dreamed he was with val in one boat rowing a race against him while his father was calling from the towpath two get your hands away there bless you     chapter iisoames puts it to the touch  of all those radiant firms which emblazon with their windows the west end of london gaves and cortegal were considered by soames the most attractive word just coming into fashion he had never had his uncle swithins taste in precious stones and the abandonment by irene when she left his house in 1887 of all the glittering things he had given her had disgusted him with this form of investment but he still knew a diamond when he saw one and during the week before her birthday he had taken occasion on his way into the poultry or his way out therefrom to dally a little before the greater jewellers where one got if not ones moneys worth at least a certain cachet with the goods  constant cogitation since his drive with jolyon had convinced him more and more of the supreme importance of this moment in his life the supreme need for taking steps and those not wrong and alongside the dry and reasoned sense that it was now or never with his selfpreservation now or never if he were to range himself and found a family went the secret urge of his senses roused by the sight of her who had once been a passionately desired wife and the conviction that it was a sin against common sense and the decent secrecy of forsytes to waste the wife he had  in an opinion on winifreds case dreamer qche would much have preferred waterbuck but they had made him a judge so late in the day as to rouse the usual suspicion of a political jobhad advised that they should go forward and obtain restitution of conjugal rights a point which to soames had never been in doubt when they had obtained a decree to that effect they must wait to see if it was obeyed if not it would constitute legal desertion and they should obtain evidence of misconduct and file their petition for divorce all of which soames knew perfectly well they had marked him ten and one this simplicity in his sisters case only made him the more desperate about the difficulty in his own everything in fact was driving him towards the simple solution of irenes return if it were still against the grain with her had he not feelings to subdue injury to forgive pain to forget he at least had never injured her and this was a world of compromise he could offer her so much more than she had now he would be prepared to make a liberal settlement on her which could not be upset he often scrutinised his image in these days he had never been a peacock like that fellow dartie or fancied himself a womans man but he had a certain belief in his own appearancenot unjustly for it was wellcoupled and preserved neat healthy pale unblemished by drink or excess of any kind the forsyte jaw and the concentration of his face were in his eyes virtues so far as he could tell there was no feature of him which need inspire dislike  thoughts and yearnings with which one lives daily become natural even if farfetched in their inception if he could only give tangible proof enough of his determination to let bygones be bygones and to do all in his power to please her why should she not come back to him  he entered gaves and cortegals therefore on the morning of november the 9th to buy a certain diamond brooch four twentyfive and dirt cheap sir at the money its a ladys brooch there was that in his mood which made him accept without demur and he went on into the poultry with the flat green morocco case in his breast pocket several times that day he opened it to look at the seven soft shining stones in their velvet oval nest  if the lady doesnt like it sir happy to exchange it any time but theres no fear of that if only there were not he got through a vast amount of work only soother of the nerves he knew a cablegram came while he was in the office with details from the agent in buenos aires and the name and address of a stewardess who would be prepared to swear to what was necessary it was a timely spur to soames with his rooted distaste for the washing of dirty linen in public and when he set forth by underground to victoria station he received a fresh impetus towards the renewal of his married life from the account in his evening paper of a fashionable divorce suit the homing instinct of all true forsytes in anxiety and trouble the corporate tendency which kept them strong and solid made him choose to dine at park lane he neither could nor would breath a word to his people of his intentiontoo reticent and proudbut the thought that at least they would be glad if they knew and wish him luck was heartening  james was in lugubrious mood for the fire which the impudence of krugers ultimatum had lit in him had been coldwatered by the poor success of the last month and the exhortations to effort in the times he didnt know where it would end soames sought to cheer him by the continual use of the word buller but james couldnt tell there was colleyand he got stuck on that hill and this ladysmith was down in a hollow and altogether it looked to him a pretty kettle of fish he thought they ought to be sending the sailorsthey were the chaps they did a lot of good in the crimea soames shifted the ground of consolation winifred had heard from val that there had been a rag and a bonfire on guy fawkes day at oxford and that he had escaped detection by blacking his face  ah james muttered hes a clever little chap but he shook his head shortly afterwards and remarked that he didnt know what would become of him and looking wistfully at his son murmured on that soames had never had a boy he would have liked a grandson of his own name and nowwell there it was  soames flinched he had not expected such a challenge to disclose the secret in his heart and emily who saw him wince said  nonsense james dont talk like that  but james not looking anyone in the face muttered on there were roger and nicholas and jolyon they all had grandsons and swithin and timothy had never married he had done his best but he would soon be gone now and as though he had uttered words of profound consolation he was silent eating brains with a fork and a piece of bread and swallowing the bread  soames excused himself directly after dinner it was not really cold but he put on his fur coat which served to fortify him against the fits of nervous shivering to which he had been subject all day subconsciously he knew that he looked better thus than in an ordinary black overcoat then feeling the morocco case flat against his heart he sallied forth he was no smoker but he lit a cigarette and smoked it gingerly as he walked along he moved slowly down the row towards knightsbridge timing himself to get to chelsea at ninefifteen what did she do with herself evening after evening in that little hole how mysterious women were one lived alongside and knew nothing of them what could she have seen in that fellow bosinney to send her mad for there was madness after all in what she had donecrazy moonstruck madness in which all sense of values had been lost and her life and his life ruined and for a moment he was filled with a sort of exaltation as though he were a man read of in a story who possessed by the christian spirit would restore to her all the prizes of existence forgiving and forgetting and becoming the godfather of her future under a tree opposite knightsbridge barracks where the moonlight struck down clear and white he took out once more the morocco case and let the beams draw colour from those stones yes they were of the first water but at the hard closing snap of the case another cold shiver ran through his nerves and he walked on faster clenching his gloved hands in the pockets of his coat almost hoping she would not be in the thought of how mysterious she was again beset him dining alone there night after nightin an evening dress too as if she were making believe to be in society playing the pianoto herself not even a dog or cat so far as he had seen and that reminded him suddenly of the mare he kept for station work at mapledurham if ever he went to the stable there she was quite alone half asleep and yet on her home journeys going more freely than on her way out as if longing to be back and lonely in her stable i would treat her well he thought incoherently i would be very careful and all that capacity for home life of which a mocking fate seemed for ever to have deprived him swelled suddenly in soames so that he dreamed dreams opposite south kensington station in the kings road a man came slithering out of a public house playing a concertina soames watched him for a moment dance crazily on the pavement to his own drawling jagged sounds then crossed over to avoid contact with this piece of drunken foolery a night in the lockup what asses people were but the man had noticed his movement of avoidance and streams of genial blasphemy followed him across the street i hope theyll run him in thought soames viciously to have ruffians like that about with women out alone a womans figure in front had induced this thought her walk seemed oddly familiar and when she turned the corner for which he was bound his heart began to beat he hastened on to the corner to make certain yes it was irene he could not mistake her walk in that little drab street she threaded two more turnings and from the last corner he saw her enter her block of flats to make sure of her now he ran those few paces hurried up the stairs and caught her standing at her door he heard the latchkey in the lock and reached her side just as she turned round startled in the open doorway  dont be alarmed he said breathless i happened to see you let me come in a minute  she had put her hand up to her breast her face was colourless her eyes widened by alarm then seeming to master herself she inclined her head and said very well  soames closed the door he too had need to recover and when she had passed into the sittingroom waited a full minute taking deep breaths to still the beating of his heart at this moment so fraught with the future to take out that morocco case seemed crude yet not to take it out left him there before her with no preliminary excuse for coming and in this dilemma he was seized with impatience at all this paraphernalia of excuse and justification this was a sceneit could be nothing else and he must face it he heard her voice uncomfortably pathetically soft  why have you come again didnt you understand that i would rather you did not  he noticed her clothesa dark brown velvet corduroy a sable boa a small round toque of the same they suited her admirably she had money to spare for dress evidently he said abruptly  its your birthday i brought you this and he held out to her the green morocco case  oh nono  soames pressed the clasp the seven stones gleamed out on the pale grey velvet  why not he said just as a sign that you dont bear me illfeeling any longer  i couldnt  soames took it out of the case  let me just see how it looks  she shrank back  he followed thrusting his hand with the brooch in it against the front of her dress she shrank again  soames dropped his hand  irene he said let bygones be bygones if i can surely you might lets begin again as if nothing had been wont you his voice was wistful and his eyes resting on her face had in them a sort of supplication  she who was standing literally with her back against the wall gave a little gulp and that was all her answer soames went on  can you really want to live all your days halfdead in this little hole come back to me and ill give you all you want you shall live your own life i swear it  he saw her face quiver ironically  yes he repeated but i mean it this time ill only ask one thing i just wanti just want a son dont look like that i want one its hard his voice had grown hurried so that he hardly knew it for his own and twice he jerked his head back as if struggling for breath it was the sight of her eyes fixed on him dark with a sort of fascinated fright which pulled him together and changed that painful incoherence to anger  is it so very unnatural he said between his teeth is it unnatural to want a child from ones own wife you wrecked our life and put this blight on everything we go on only half alive and without any future is it so very unflattering to you that in spite of everything ii still want you for my wife speak for goodness sake do speak  irene seemed to try but did not succeed  i dont want to frighten you said soames more gently heaven knows i only want you to see that i cant go on like this i want you back i want you  irene raised one hand and covered the lower part of her face but her eyes never moved from his as though she trusted in them to keep him at bay and all those years barren and bitter sinceah whenalmost since he had first known her surged up in one great wave of recollection in soames and a spasm that for his life he could not control constricted his face  its not too late he said its notif youll only believe it  irene uncovered her lips and both her hands made a writhing gesture in front of her breast soames seized them  dont she said under her breath but he stood holding on to them trying to stare into her eyes which did not waver then she said quietly  i am alone here you wont behave again as you once behaved  dropping her hands as though they had been hot irons he turned away was it possible that there could be such relentless unforgiveness could that one act of violent possession be still alive within her did it bar him thus utterly and doggedly he said without looking up  i am not going till youve answered me i am offering what few men would bring themselves to offer i want aa reasonable answer  and almost with surprise he heard her say  you cant have a reasonable answer reason has nothing to do with it you can only have the brutal truth i would rather die  soames stared at her  oh he said and there intervened in him a sort of paralysis of speech and movement the kind of quivering which comes when a man has received a deadly insult and does not yet know how he is going to take it or rather what it is going to do with him  oh he said again as bad as that indeed you would rather die thats pretty  i am sorry you wanted me to answer i cant help the truth can i  at that queer spiritual appeal soames turned for relief to actuality he snapped the brooch back into its case and put it in his pocket  the truth he said theres no such thing with women its nervesnerves  he heard the whisper  yes nerves dont lie havent you discovered that he was silent obsessed by the thought i will hate this woman i will hate her that was the trouble if only he could he shot a glance at her who stood unmoving against the wall with her head up and her hands clasped for all the world as if she were going to be shot and he said quickly  i dont believe a word of it you have a lover if you hadnt you wouldnt be such asuch a little idiot he was conscious before the expression in her eyes that he had uttered something of a nonsequitur and dropped back too abruptly into the verbal freedom of his connubial days he turned away to the door but he could not go out something within himthat most deep and secret forsyte quality the impossibility of letting go the impossibility of seeing the fantastic and forlorn nature of his own tenacityprevented him he turned about again and there stood with his back against the door as hers was against the wall opposite quite unconscious of anything ridiculous in this separation by the whole width of the room  do you ever think of anybody but yourself he said  irenes lips quivered then she answered slowly  do you ever think that i found out my mistakemy hopeless terrible mistakethe very first week of our marriage that i went on trying three yearsyou know i went on trying was it for myself  soames gritted his teeth god knows what it was ive never understood you i shall never understand you you had everything you wanted and you can have it again and more whats the matter with me i ask you a plain question what is it unconscious of the pathos in that enquiry he went on passionately im not lame im not loathsome im not a boor im not a fool what is it whats the mystery about me  her answer was a long sigh  he clasped his hands with a gesture that for him was strangely full of expression when i came here tonight i wasi hopedi meant everything that i could to do away with the past and start fair again and you meet me with nerves and silence and sighs theres nothing tangible its likeits like a spiders web  yes  that whisper from across the room maddened soames afresh  well i dont choose to be in a spiders web ill cut it he walked straight up to her now what he had gone up to her to do he really did not know but when he was close the old familiar scent of her clothes suddenly affected him he put his hands on her shoulders and bent forward to kiss her he kissed not her lips but a little hard line where the lips had been drawn in then his face was pressed away by her hands he heard her say oh no shame compunction sense of futility flooded his whole being he turned on his heel and went straight out     chapter iiivisit to irene  jolyon found june waiting on the platform at paddington she had received his telegram while at breakfast her abodea studio and two bedrooms in a st johns wood gardenhad been selected by her for the complete independence which it guaranteed unwatched by mrs grundy unhindered by permanent domestics she could receive lame ducks at any hour of day or night and not seldom had a duck without studio of its own made use of junes she enjoyed her freedom and possessed herself with a sort of virginal passion the warmth which she would have lavished on bosinney and of whichgiven her forsyte tenacityhe must surely have tired she now expended in championship of the underdogs and budding geniuses of the artistic world she lived in fact to turn ducks into the swans she believed they were the very fervour of her protection warped her judgments but she was loyal and liberal her small eager hand was ever against the oppressions of academic and commercial opinion and though her income was considerable her bank balance was often a minus quantity  she had come to paddington station heated in her soul by a visit to eric cobbley a miserable gallery had refused to let that straighthaired genius have his oneman show after all its impudent manager after visiting his studio had expressed the opinion that it would only be a onehorse show from the selling point of view this crowning example of commercial cowardice towards her favourite lame duckand he so hard up with a wife and two children that he had caused her account to be overdrawnwas still making the blood glow in her small resolute face and her redgold hair to shine more than ever she gave her father a hug and got into a cab with him having as many fish to fry with him as he with her it became at once a question which would fry them first  jolyon had reached the words my dear i want you to come with me when glancing at her face he perceived by her blue eyes moving from side to sidelike the tail of a preoccupied catthat she was not attending dad is it true that i absolutely cant get at any of my money  only the income fortunately my love  how perfectly beastly cant it be done somehow there must be a way i know i could buy a small gallery for ten thousand pounds  a small gallery murmured jolyon seems a modest desire but your grandfather foresaw it  i think cried june vigorously that all this care about money is awful when theres so much genius in the world simply crushed out for want of a little i shall never marry and have children why shouldnt i be able to do some good instead of having it all tied up in case of things which will never come off  our name is forsyte my dear replied jolyon in the ironical voice to which his impetuous daughter had never quite grown accustomed and forsytes you know are people who so settle their property that their grandchildren in case they should die before their parents have to make wills leaving the property that will only come to themselves when their parents die do you follow that nor do i but its a fact anyway we live by the principle that so long as there is a possibility of keeping wealth in the family it must not go out if you die unmarried your money goes to jolly and holly and their children if they marry isnt it pleasant to know that whatever you do you can none of you be destitute  but cant i borrow the money  jolyon shook his head you could rent a gallery no doubt if you could manage it out of your income  june uttered a contemptuous sound  yes and have no income left to help anybody with  my dear child murmured jolyon wouldnt it come to the same thing  no said june shrewdly i could buy for ten thousand that would only be four hundred a year but i should have to pay a thousand a year rent and that would only leave me five hundred if i had the gallery dad think what i could do i could make eric cobbleys name in no time and ever so many others  names worth making make themselves in time  when theyre dead  did you ever know anybody living my dear improved by having his name made  yes you said june pressing his arm  jolyon started i he thought oh ah now shes going to ask me to do something we take it out we forsytes each in our different ways  june came closer to him in the cab  darling she said you buy the gallery and ill pay you four hundred a year for it then neither of us will be any the worse off besides its a splendid investment  jolyon wriggled dont you think he said that for an artist to buy a gallery is a bit dubious besides ten thousand pounds is a lump and im not a commercial character  june looked at him with admiring appraisement  of course youre not but youre awfully businesslike and im sure we could make it pay itll be a perfect way of scoring off those wretched dealers and people and again she squeezed her fathers arm  jolyons face expressed quizzical despair  where is this desirable gallery splendidly situated i suppose  just off cork street  ah thought jolyon i knew it was just off somewhere now for what i want out of her  well ill think of it but not just now you remember irene i want you to come with me and see her soames is after her again she might be safer if we could give her asylum somewhere  the word asylum which he had used by chance was of all most calculated to rouse junes interest  irene i havent seen her since of course id love to help her  it was jolyons turn to squeeze her arm in warm admiration for this spirited generoushearted little creature of his begetting  irene is proud he said with a sidelong glance in sudden doubt of junes discretion shes difficult to help we must tread gently this is the place i wired her to expect us lets send up our cards  i cant bear soames said june as she got out he sneers at everything that isnt successful  irene was in what was called the ladies drawingroom of the piedmont hotel  nothing if not morally courageous june walked straight up to her former friend kissed her cheek and the two settled down on a sofa never sat on since the hotels foundation jolyon could see that irene was deeply affected by this simple forgiveness  so soames has been worrying you he said  i had a visit from him last night he wants me to go back to him  youre not going of course cried june  irene smiled faintly and shook her head but his position is horrible she murmured  its his own fault he ought to have divorced you when he could  jolyon remembered how fervently in the old days june had hoped that no divorce would smirch her dead and faithless lovers name  let us hear what irene is going to do he said  irenes lips quivered but she spoke calmly  id better give him fresh excuse to get rid of me  how horrible cried june  what else can i do  out of the question said jolyon very quietly sans amour  he thought she was going to cry but getting up quickly she half turned her back on them and stood regaining control of herself  june said suddenly  well i shall go to soames and tell him he must leave you alone what does he want at his age  a child its not unnatural  a child cried june scornfully of course to leave his money to if he wants one badly enough let him take somebody and have one then you can divorce him and he can marry her  jolyon perceived suddenly that he had made a mistake to bring juneher violent partizanship was fighting soames battle  it would be best for irene to come quietly to us at robin hill and see how things shape  of course said june only  irene looked full at jolyonin all his many attempts afterwards to analyze that glance he never could succeed  no i should only bring trouble on you all i will go abroad  he knew from her voice that this was final the irrelevant thought flashed through him well i could see her there but he said  dont you think you would be more helpless abroad in case he followed  i dont know i can but try  june sprang up and paced the room its all horrible she said why should people be tortured and kept miserable and helpless year after year by this disgusting sanctimonious law but someone had come into the room and june came to a standstill jolyon went up to irene  do you want money  no  and would you like me to let your flat  yes jolyon please  when shall you be going  tomorrow  you wont go back there in the meantime will you this he said with an anxiety strange to himself  no ive got all i want here  youll send me your address  she put out her hand to him i feel youre a rock  built on sand answered jolyon pressing her hand hard but its a pleasure to do anything at any time remember that and if you change your mind come along june say goodbye  june came from the window and flung her arms round irene  dont think of him she said under her breath enjoy yourself and bless you  with a memory of tears in irenes eyes and of a smile on her lips they went away extremely silent passing the lady who had interrupted the interview and was turning over the papers on the table  opposite the national gallery june exclaimed  of all undignified beasts and horrible laws  but jolyon did not respond he had something of his fathers balance and could see things impartially even when his emotions were roused irene was right soames position was as bad or worse than her own as for the lawit catered for a human nature of which it took a naturally low view and feeling that if he stayed in his daughters company he would in one way or another commit an indiscretion he told her he must catch his train back to oxford and hailing a cab left her to turners watercolours with the promise that he would think over that gallery  but he thought over irene instead pity they said was akin to love if so he was certainly in danger of loving her for he pitied her profoundly to think of her drifting about europe so handicapped and lonely i hope to goodness shell keep her head he thought she might easily grow desperate in fact now that she had cut loose from her poor threads of occupation he couldnt imagine how she would go onso beautiful a creature hopeless and fair game for anyone in his exasperation was more than a little fear and jealousy women did strange things when they were driven into corners i wonder what soames will do now he thought a rotten idiotic state of things and i suppose they would say it was her own fault very preoccupied and sore at heart he got into his train mislaid his ticket and on the platform at oxford took his hat off to a lady whose face he seemed to remember without being able to put a name to her not even when he saw her having tea at the rainbow     chapter ivwhere forsytes fear to tread  quivering from the defeat of his hopes with the green morocco case still flat against his heart soames revolved thoughts bitter as death a spiders web walking fast and noting nothing in the moonlight he brooded over the scene he had been through over the memory of her figure rigid in his grasp and the more he brooded the more certain he became that she had a loverher words i would sooner die were ridiculous if she had not even if she had never loved him she had made no fuss until bosinney came on the scene no she was in love again or she would not have made that melodramatic answer to his proposal which in all the circumstances was reasonable very well that simplified matters  ill take steps to know where i am he thought ill go to polteeds the first thing tomorrow morning  but even in forming that resolution he knew he would have trouble with himself he had employed polteeds agency several times in the routine of his profession even quite lately over darties case but he had never thought it possible to employ them to watch his own wife  it was too insulting to himself  he slept over that project and his wounded prideor rather kept vigil only while shaving did he suddenly remember that she called herself by her maiden name of heron polteed would not know at first at all events whose wife she was would not look at him obsequiously and leer behind his back she would just be the wife of one of his clients and that would be truefor was he not his own solicitor  he was literally afraid not to put his design into execution at the first possible moment lest after all he might fail himself and making warmson bring him an early cup of coffee he stole out of the house before the hour of breakfast he walked rapidly to one of those small west end streets where polteeds and other firms ministered to the virtues of the wealthier classes hitherto he had always had polteed to see him in the poultry but he well knew their address and reached it at the opening hour in the outer office a room furnished so cosily that it might have been a moneylenders he was attended by a lady who might have been a schoolmistress  i wish to see mr claud polteed he knows menever mind my name  to keep everybody from knowing that he soames forsyte was reduced to having his wife spied on was the overpowering consideration  mr claud polteedso different from mr lewis polteedwas one of those men with dark hair slightly curved noses and quick brown eyes who might be taken for jews but are really phoenicians he received soames in a room hushed by thickness of carpet and curtains it was in fact confidentially furnished without trace of document anywhere to be seen  greeting soames deferentially he turned the key in the only door with a certain ostentation  if a client sends for me he was in the habit of saying he takes what precaution he likes if he comes here we convince him that we have no leakages i may safely say we lead in security if in nothing elsenow sir what can i do for you  soames gorge had risen so that he could hardly speak it was absolutely necessary to hide from this man that he had any but professional interest in the matter and mechanically his face assumed its sideway smile  ive come to you early like this because theres not an hour to loseif he lost an hour he might fail himself yet have you a really trustworthy woman free  mr polteed unlocked a drawer produced a memorandum ran his eyes over it and locked the drawer up again  yes he said the very woman  soames had seated himself and crossed his legsnothing but a faint flush which might have been his normal complexion betrayed him  send her off at once then to watch a mrs irene heron of flat c truro mansions chelsea till further notice  precisely said mr polteed divorce i presume and he blew into a speakingtube mrs blanch in i shall want to speak to her in ten minutes  deal with any reports yourself resumed soames and send them to me personally marked confidential sealed and registered my client exacts the utmost secrecy  mr polteed smiled as though saying you are teaching your grandmother my dear sir and his eyes slid over soames face for one unprofessional instant  make his mind perfectly easy he said do you smoke  no said soames understand me nothing may come of this if a name gets out or the watching is suspected it may have very serious consequences  mr polteed nodded i can put it into the cipher category under that system a name is never mentioned we work by numbers  he unlocked another drawer and took out two slips of paper wrote on them and handed one to soames  keep that sir its your key i retain this duplicate the case well call 7x the party watched will be 17 the watcher 19 the mansions 25 yourselfi should say your firm31 my firm 32 myself 2 in case you should have to mention your client in writing i have called him 43 any person we suspect will be 47 a second person 51 any special hint or instruction while were about it  no said soames that isevery consideration compatible  again mr polteed nodded expense  soames shrugged in reason he answered curtly and got up keep it entirely in your own hands  entirely said mr polteed appearing suddenly between him and the door i shall be seeing you in that other case before long good morning sir his eyes slid unprofessionally over soames once more and he unlocked the door  good morning said soames looking neither to right nor left  out in the street he swore deeply quietly to himself a spiders web and to cut it he must use this spidery secret unclean method so utterly repugnant to one who regarded his private life as his most sacred piece of property but the die was cast he could not go back and he went on into the poultry and locked away the green morocco case and the key to that cipher destined to make crystalclear his domestic bankruptcy  odd that one whose life was spent in bringing to the public eye all the private coils of property the domestic disagreements of others should dread so utterly the public eye turned on his own and yet not odd for who should know so well as he the whole unfeeling process of legal regulation  he worked hard all day winifred was due at four oclock he was to take her down to a conference in the temple with dreamer qc and waiting for her he reread the letter he had caused her to write the day of darties departure requiring him to return   dear montague  i have received your letter with the news that you have left me for ever and are on your way to buenos aires it has naturally been a great shock i am taking this earliest opportunity of writing to tell you that i am prepared to let bygones be bygones if you will return to me at once i beg you to do so i am very much upset and will not say any more now i am sending this letter registered to the address you left at your club please cable to me  your still affectionate wife  winifred dartie   ugh what bitter humbug he remembered leaning over winifred while she copied what he had pencilled and how she had said laying down her pen suppose he comes soames in such a strange tone of voice as if she did not know her own mind he wont come he had answered till hes spent his money thats why we must act at once annexed to the copy of that letter was the original of darties drunken scrawl from the iseeum club soames could have wished it had not been so manifestly penned in liquor just the sort of thing the court would pitch on he seemed to hear the judges voice say you took this seriously seriously enough to write him as you did do you think he meant it never mind the fact was clear that dartie had sailed and had not returned annexed also was his cabled answer impossible return dartie soames shook his head if the whole thing were not disposed of within the next few months the fellow would turn up again like a bad penny it saved a thousand a year at least to get rid of him besides all the worry to winifred and his father i must stiffen dreamers back he thought we must push it on  winifred who had adopted a kind of halfmourning which became her fair hair and tall figure very well arrived in james barouche drawn by james pair soames had not seen it in the city since his father retired from business five years ago and its incongruity gave him a shock times are changing he thought one doesnt know whatll go next top hats even were scarcer he enquired after val val said winifred wrote that he was going to play polo next term she thought he was in a very good set she added with fashionably disguised anxiety will there be much publicity about my affair soames must it be in the papers its so bad for him and the girls  with his own calamity all raw within him soames answered  the papers are a pushing lot its very difficult to keep things out they pretend to be guarding the publics morals and they corrupt them with their beastly reports but we havent got to that yet were only seeing dreamer today on the restitution question of course he understands that its to lead to a divorce but you must seem genuinely anxious to get dartie backyou might practice that attitude today  winifred sighed  oh what a clown montys been she said  soames gave her a sharp look it was clear to him that she could not take her dartie seriously and would go back on the whole thing if given half a chance his own instinct had been firm in this matter from the first to save a little scandal now would only bring on his sister and her children real disgrace and perhaps ruin later on if dartie were allowed to hang on to them going downhill and spending the money james would leave his daughter though it was all tied up that fellow would milk the settlements somehow and make his family pay through the nose to keep him out of bankruptcy or even perhaps gaol they left the shining carriage with the shining horses and the shininghatted servants on the embankment and walked up to dreamer qcs chambers in crown office row  mr bellby is here sir said the clerk mr dreamer will be ten minutes  mr bellby the juniornot as junior as he might have been for soames only employed barristers of established reputation it was indeed something of a mystery to him how barristers ever managed to establish that which made him employ themmr bellby was seated taking a final glance through his papers he had come from court and was in wig and gown which suited a nose jutting out like the handle of a tiny pump his small shrewd blue eyes and rather protruding lower lipno better man to supplement and stiffen dreamer  the introduction to winifred accomplished they leaped the weather and spoke of the war soames interrupted suddenly  if he doesnt comply we cant bring proceedings for six months i want to get on with the matter bellby  mr bellby who had the ghost of an irish brogue smiled at winifred and murmured the laws delays mrs dartie  six months repeated soames itll drive it up to june we shant get the suit on till after the long vacation we must put the screw on bellbyhe would have all his work cut out to keep winifred up to the scratch  mr dreamer will see you now sir  they filed in mr bellby going first and soames escorting winifred after an interval of one minute by his watch  dreamer qc in a gown but divested of wig was standing before the fire as if this conference were in the nature of a treat he had the leathery rather oily complexion which goes with great learning a considerable nose with glasses perched on it and little greyish whiskers he luxuriated in the perpetual cocking of one eye and the concealment of his lower with his upper lip which gave a smothered turn to his speech he had a way too of coming suddenly round the corner on the person he was talking to this with a disconcerting tone of voice and a habit of growling before he began to speakhad secured a reputation second in probate and divorce to very few having listened eye cocked to mr bellbys breezy recapitulation of the facts he growled and said  i know all that and coming round the corner at winifred smothered the words  we want to get him back dont we mrs dartie  soames interposed sharply  my sisters position of course is intolerable  dreamer growled exactly now can we rely on the cabled refusal or must we wait till after christmas to give him a chance to have writtenthats the point isnt it  the sooner soames began  what do you say bellby said dreamer coming round his corner  mr bellby seemed to sniff the air like a hound  we wont be on till the middle of december weve no need to give um more rope than that  no said soames why should my sister be incommoded by his choosing to go  to jericho said dreamer again coming round his corner quite so people oughtnt to go to jericho ought they mrs dartie and he raised his gown into a sort of fantail i agree we can go forward is there anything more  nothing at present said soames meaningly i wanted you to see my sister  dreamer growled softly delighted good evening and let fall the protection of his gown  they filed out winifred went down the stairs soames lingered in spite of himself he was impressed by dreamer  the evidence is all right i think he said to bellby between ourselves if we dont get the thing through quick we never may dyou think he understands that  ill make um said bellby good man thoughgood man  soames nodded and hastened after his sister he found her in a draught biting her lips behind her veil and at once said  the evidence of the stewardess will be very complete  winifreds face hardened she drew herself up and they walked to the carriage and all through that silent drive back to green street the souls of both of them revolved a single thought why oh why should i have to expose my misfortune to the public like this why have to employ spies to peer into my private troubles they were not of my making     chapter vjolly sits in judgment  the possessive instinct which so determinedly balked was animating two members of the forsyte family towards riddance of what they could no longer possess was hardening daily in the british body politic nicholas originally so doubtful concerning a war which must affect property had been heard to say that these boers were a pigheaded lot they were causing a lot of expense and the sooner they had their lesson the better he would send out wolseley seeing always a little further than other peoplewhence the most considerable fortune of all the forsyteshe had perceived already that buller was not the mana bull of a chap who just went butting and if they didnt look out ladysmith would fall this was early in december so that when black week came he was enabled to say to everybody i told you so during that week of gloom such as no forsyte could remember very young nicholas attended so many drills in his corps the devils own that young nicholas consulted the family physician about his sons health and was alarmed to find that he was perfectly sound the boy had only just eaten his dinners and been called to the bar at some expense and it was in a way a nightmare to his father and mother that he should be playing with military efficiency at a time when military efficiency in the civilian population might conceivably be wanted his grandfather of course poohpoohed the notion too thoroughly educated in the feeling that no british war could be other than little and professional and profoundly distrustful of imperial commitments by which moreover he stood to lose for he owned de beers now going down fast more than a sufficient sacrifice on the part of his grandson  at oxford however rather different sentiments prevailed the inherent effervescence of conglomerate youth had during the two months of the term before black week been gradually crystallising out into vivid oppositions normal adolescence ever in england of a conservative tendency though not taking things too seriously was vehement for a fight to a finish and a good licking for the boers of this larger faction val dartie was naturally a member radical youth on the other hand a small but perhaps more vocal body was for stopping the war and giving the boers autonomy until black week however the groups were amorphous without sharp edges and argument remained but academic jolly was one of those who knew not where he stood a streak of his grandfather old jolyons love of justice prevented him from seeing one side only moreover in his set of the best there was a jumpingjesus of extremely advanced opinions and some personal magnetism jolly wavered his father too seemed doubtful in his views and though as was proper at the age of twenty he kept a sharp eye on his father watchful for defects which might still be remedied still that father had an air which gave a sort of glamour to his creed of ironic tolerance artists of course were notoriously hamletlike and to this extent one must discount for ones father even if one loved him but jolyons original view that to put your nose in where you arent wanted as the uitlanders had done and then work the oracle till you get on top is not being quite the clean potato had whether founded in fact or no a certain attraction for his son who thought a deal about gentility on the other hand jolly could not abide such as his set called cranks and vals set called smugs so that he was still balancing when the clock of black week struck onetwothree came those ominous repulses at stormberg magersfontein colenso the sturdy english soul reacting after the first cried ah but methuen after the second ah but buller then in inspissated gloom hardened and jolly said to himself no damn it weve got to lick the beggars now i dont care whether were right or wrong and if he had known it his father was thinking the same thought  that next sunday last of the term jolly was bidden to wine with one of the best after the second toast buller and damnation to the boers drunkno heel tapsin the college burgundy he noticed that val dartie also a guest was looking at him with a grin and saying something to his neighbour he was sure it was disparaging the last boy in the world to make himself conspicuous or cause public disturbance jolly grew rather red and shut his lips the queer hostility he had always felt towards his secondcousin was strongly and suddenly reinforced all right he thought you wait my friend more wine than was good for him as the custom was helped him to remember when they all trooped forth to a secluded spot to touch val on the arm  what did you say about me in there  maynt i say what i like  no  well i said you were a proboerand so you are  youre a liar  dyou want a row  of course but not here in the garden  all right come on  they went eyeing each other askance unsteady and unflinching they climbed the garden railings the spikes on the top slightly ripped vals sleeve and occupied his mind jollys mind was occupied by the thought that they were going to fight in the precincts of a college foreign to them both it was not the thing but never mindthe young beast  they passed over the grass into very nearly darkness and took off their coats  youre not screwed are you said jolly suddenly i cant fight you if youre screwed  no more than you  all right then  without shaking hands they put themselves at once into postures of defence they had drunk too much for science and so were especially careful to assume correct attitudes until jolly smote val almost accidentally on the nose after that it was all a dark and ugly scrimmage in the deep shadow of the old trees with no one to call time till battered and blown they unclinched and staggered back from each other as a voice said  your names young gentlemen  at this bland query spoken from under the lamp at the garden gate like some demand of a god their nerves gave way and snatching up their coats they ran at the railings shinned up them and made for the secluded spot whence they had issued to the fight here in dim light they mopped their faces and without a word walked ten paces apart to the college gate they went out silently val going towards the broad along the brewery jolly down the lane towards the high his head still fumed was busy with regret that he had not displayed more science passing in review the counters and knockout blows which he had not delivered his mind strayed on to an imagined combat infinitely unlike that which he had just been through infinitely gallant with sash and sword with thrust and parry as if he were in the pages of his beloved dumas he fancied himself la mole and aramis bussy chicot and dartagnan rolled into one but he quite failed to envisage val as coconnas brissac or rochefort the fellow was just a confounded cousin who didnt come up to cocker never mind he had given him one or two proboer the word still rankled and thoughts of enlisting jostled his aching head of riding over the veldt firing gallantly while the boers rolled over like rabbits and turning up his smarting eyes he saw the stars shining between the housetops of the high and himself lying out on the karoo whatever that was rolled in a blanket with his rifle ready and his gaze fixed on a glittering heaven  he had a fearful head next morning which he doctored as became one of the best by soaking it in cold water brewing strong coffee which he could not drink and only sipping a little hock at lunch the legend that some fool had run into him round a corner accounted for a bruise on his cheek he would on no account have mentioned the fight for on second thoughts it fell far short of his standards  the next day he went down and travelled through to robin hill nobody was there but june and holly for his father had gone to paris he spent a restless and unsettled vacation quite out of touch with either of his sisters june indeed was occupied with lame ducks whom as a rule jolly could not stand especially that eric cobbley and his family hopeless outsiders who were always littering up the house in the vacation and between holly and himself there was a strange division as if she were beginning to have opinions of her own which was sounnecessary he punched viciously at a ball rode furiously but alone in richmond park making a point of jumping the stiff high hurdles put up to close certain worn avenues of grasskeeping his nerve in he called it jolly was more afraid of being afraid than most boys are he bought a rifle too and put a range up in the home field shooting across the pond into the kitchengarden wall to the peril of gardeners with the thought that some day perhaps he would enlist and save south africa for his country in fact now that they were appealing for yeomanry recruits the boy was thoroughly upset ought he to go none of the best so far as he knewand he was in correspondence with severalwere thinking of joining if they had been making a move he would have gone at oncevery competitive and with a strong sense of form he could not bear to be left behind in anythingbut to do it off his own bat might look like swagger because of course it wasnt really necessary besides he did not want to go for the other side of this young forsyte recoiled from leaping before he looked it was altogether mixed pickles within him hot and sickly pickles and he became quite unlike his serene and rather lordly self  and then one day he saw that which moved him to uneasy wrathtwo riders in a glade of the park close to the ham gate of whom she on the lefthand was most assuredly holly on her silver roan and he on the righthand as assuredly that squirt val dartie his first impulse was to urge on his own horse and demand the meaning of this portent tell the fellow to bunk and take holly home his secondto feel that he would look a fool if they refused he reined his horse in behind a tree then perceived that it was equally impossible to spy on them nothing for it but to go home and await her coming sneaking out with that young bounder he could not consult with june because she had gone up that morning in the train of eric cobbley and his lot and his father was still in that rotten paris he felt that this was emphatically one of those moments for which he had trained himself assiduously at school where he and a boy called brent had frequently set fire to newspapers and placed them in the centre of their studies to accustom them to coolness in moments of danger he did not feel at all cool waiting in the stableyard idly stroking the dog balthasar who queasy as an old fat monk and sad in the absence of his master turned up his face panting with gratitude for this attention it was half an hour before holly came flushed and ever so much prettier than she had any right to look he saw her look at him quicklyguiltily of coursethen followed her in and taking her arm conducted her into what had been their grandfathers study the room not much used now was still vaguely haunted for them both by a presence with which they associated tenderness large drooping white moustaches the scent of cigar smoke and laughter here jolly in the prime of his youth before he went to school at all had been wont to wrestle with his grandfather who even at eighty had an irresistible habit of crooking his leg here holly perched on the arm of the great leather chair had stroked hair curving silvery over an ear into which she would whisper secrets through that window they had all three sallied times without number to cricket on the lawn and a mysterious game called wopsydoozle not to be understood by outsiders which made old jolyon very hot here once on a warm night holly had appeared in her nighty having had a bad dream to have the clutch of it released and here jolly having begun the day badly by introducing fizzy magnesia into mademoiselle beauces newlaid egg and gone on to worse had been sent down in the absence of his father to the ensuing dialogue  now my boy you mustnt go on like this  well she boxed my ears gran so i only boxed hers and then she boxed mine again  strike a lady thatll never do have you begged her pardon  not yet  then you must go and do it at once come along  but she began it gran and she had two to my one  my dear it was an outrageous thing to do  well she lost her temper and i didnt lose mine  come along  you come too then gran  wellthis time only  and they had gone hand in hand  herewhere the waverley novels and byrons works and gibbons roman empire and humboldts cosmos and the bronzes on the mantelpiece and that masterpiece of the oily school dutch fishingboats at sunset were fixed as fate and for all sign of change old jolyon might have been sitting there still with legs crossed in the arm chair and domed forehead and deep eyes grave above the timeshere they came those two grandchildren and jolly said  i saw you and that fellow in the park  the sight of blood rushing into her cheeks gave him some satisfaction she ought to be ashamed  well she said  jolly was surprised he had expected more or less  do you know he said weightily that he called me a proboer last term and i had to fight him  who won  jolly wished to answer i should have but it seemed beneath him  look here he said whats the meaning of it without telling anybody  why should i dad isnt here why shouldnt i ride with him  youve got me to ride with i think hes an awful young rotter  holly went pale with anger  he isnt its your own fault for not liking him  and slipping past her brother she went out leaving him staring at the bronze venus sitting on a tortoise which had been shielded from him so far by his sisters dark head under her soft felt riding hat he felt queerly disturbed shaken to his young foundations a lifelong domination lay shattered round his feet he went up to the venus and mechanically inspected the tortoise  why didnt he like val dartie he could not tell ignorant of family history barely aware of that vague feud which had started thirteen years before with bosinneys defection from june in favour of soames wife knowing really almost nothing about val he was at sea he just did dislike him the question however was what should he do val dartie it was true was a secondcousin but it was not the thing for holly to go about with him and yet to tell of what he had chanced on was against his creed in this dilemma he went and sat in the old leather chair and crossed his legs it grew dark while he sat there staring out through the long window at the old oaktree ample yet bare of leaves becoming slowly just a shape of deeper dark printed on the dusk  grandfather he thought without sequence and took out his watch he could not see the hands but he set the repeater going five oclock his grandfathers first gold hunter watch buttersmooth with ageall the milling worn from it and dented with the mark of many a fall the chime was like a little voice from out of that golden age when they first came from st johns wood london to this housecame driving with grandfather in his carriage and almost instantly took to the trees trees to climb and grandfather watering the geraniumbeds below what was to be done tell dad he must come home confide in juneonly she was soso sudden do nothing and trust to luck after all the vac would soon be over go up and see val and warn him off but how get his address holly wouldnt give it him a maze of paths a cloud of possibilities he lit a cigarette when he had smoked it halfway through his brow relaxed almost as if some thin old hand had been passed gently over it and in his ear something seemed to whisper do nothing be nice to holly be nice to her my dear and jolly heaved a sigh of contentment blowing smoke through his nostrils  but up in her room divested of her habit holly was still frowning he is nothe is not were the words which kept forming on her lips     chapter vijolyon in two minds  a little private hotel over a wellknown restaurant near the gare st lazare was jolyons haunt in paris he hated his fellow forsytes abroadvapid as fish out of water in their welltrodden runs the opera rue de rivoli and moulin rouge their air of having come because they wanted to be somewhere else as soon as possible annoyed him but no other forsyte came near this haunt where he had a wood fire in his bedroom and the coffee was excellent paris was always to him more attractive in winter the acrid savour from woodsmoke and chestnutroasting braziers the sharpness of the wintry sunshine on bright rays the open cafes defying keenaired winter the selfcontained brisk boulevard crowds all informed him that in winter paris possessed a soul which like a migrant bird in high summer flew away  he spoke french well had some friends knew little places where pleasant dishes could be met with queer types observed he felt philosophic in paris the edge of irony sharpened life took on a subtle purposeless meaning became a bunch of flavours tasted a darkness shot with shifting gleams of light  when in the first week of december he decided to go to paris he was far from admitting that irenes presence was influencing him he had not been there two days before he owned that the wish to see her had been more than half the reason in england one did not admit what was natural he had thought it might be well to speak to her about the letting of her flat and other matters but in paris he at once knew better there was a glamour over the city on the third day he wrote to her and received an answer which procured him a pleasurable shiver of the nerves   my dear jolyon  it will be a happiness for me to see you  irene   he took his way to her hotel on a bright day with a feeling such as he had often had going to visit an adored picture no woman so far as he remembered had ever inspired in him this special sensuous and yet impersonal sensation he was going to sit and feast his eyes and come away knowing her no better but ready to go and feast his eyes again tomorrow such was his feeling when in the tarnished and ornate little lounge of a quiet hotel near the river she came to him preceded by a small pageboy who uttered the word madame and vanished her face her smile the poise of her figure were just as he had pictured and the expression of her face said plainly a friend  well he said what news poor exile  none  nothing from soames  nothing  i have let the flat for you and like a good steward i bring you some money how do you like paris  while he put her through this catechism it seemed to him that he had never seen lips so fine and sensitive the lower lip curving just a little upwards the upper touched at one corner by the least conceivable dimple it was like discovering a woman in what had hitherto been a sort of soft and breathedon statue almost impersonally admired she owned that to be alone in paris was a little difficult and yet paris was so full of its own life that it was often she confessed as innocuous as a desert besides the english were not liked just now  that will hardly be your case said jolyon you should appeal to the french  it has its disadvantages  jolyon nodded  well you must let me take you about while im here well start tomorrow come and dine at my pet restaurant and well go to the operacomique  it was the beginning of daily meetings  jolyon soon found that for those who desired a static condition of the affections paris was at once the first and last place in which to be friendly with a pretty woman revelation was alighting like a bird in his heart singing elle est ton reve elle est ton reve sometimes this seemed natural sometimes ludicrousa bad case of elderly rapture having once been ostracised by society he had never since had any real regard for conventional morality but the idea of a love which she could never returnand how could she at his agehardly mounted beyond his subconscious mind he was full too of resentment at the waste and loneliness of her life aware of being some comfort to her and of the pleasure she clearly took in their many little outings he was amiably desirous of doing and saying nothing to destroy that pleasure it was like watching a starved plant draw up water to see her drink in his companionship so far as they could tell no one knew her address except himself she was unknown in paris and he but little known so that discretion seemed unnecessary in those walks talks visits to concerts picturegalleries theatres little dinners expeditions to versailles st cloud even fontainebleau and time fledone of those full months without past to it or future what in his youth would certainly have been headlong passion was now perhaps as deep a feeling but far gentler tempered to protective companionship by admiration hopelessness and a sense of chivalryarrested in his veins at least so long as she was there smiling and happy in their friendship and always to him more beautiful and spiritually responsive for her philosophy of life seemed to march in admirable step with his own conditioned by emotion more than by reason ironically mistrustful susceptible to beauty almost passionately humane and tolerant yet subject to instinctive rigidities of which as a mere man he was less capable and during all this companionable month he never quite lost that feeling with which he had set out on the first day as if to visit an adored work of art a wellnigh impersonal desire the futureinexorable pendant to the present he took care not to face for fear of breaking up his untroubled manner but he made plans to renew this time in places still more delightful where the sun was hot and there were strange things to see and paint the end came swiftly on the 20th of january with a telegram  have enlisted in imperial yeomanry jolly  jolyon received it just as he was setting out to meet her at the louvre it brought him up with a round turn while he was lotuseating here his boy whose philosopher and guide he ought to be had taken this great step towards danger hardship perhaps even death he felt disturbed to the soul realising suddenly how irene had twined herself round the roots of his being thus threatened with severance the tie between themfor it had become a kind of tieno longer had impersonal quality the tranquil enjoyment of things in common jolyon perceived was gone for ever he saw his feeling as it was in the nature of an infatuation ridiculous perhaps but so real that sooner or later it must disclose itself and now as it seemed to him he could not must not make any such disclosure the news of jolly stood inexorably in the way he was proud of this enlistment proud of his boy for going off to fight for the country for on jolyons proboerism too black week had left its mark and so the end was reached before the beginning well luckily he had never made a sign  when he came into the gallery she was standing before the virgin of the rocks graceful absorbed smiling and unconscious have i to give up seeing that he thought its unnatural so long as shes willing that i should see her he stood unnoticed watching her storing up the image of her figure envying the picture on which she was bending that long scrutiny twice she turned her head towards the entrance and he thought thats for me at last he went forward  look he said  she read the telegram and he heard her sigh  that sigh too was for him his position was really cruel to be loyal to his son he must just shake her hand and go to be loyal to the feeling in his heart he must at least tell her what that feeling was could she would she understand the silence in which he was gazing at that picture  im afraid i must go home at once he said at last i shall miss all this awfully  so shall i but of course you must go  well said jolyon holding out his hand  meeting her eyes a flood of feeling nearly mastered him  such is life he said take care of yourself my dear  he had a stumbling sensation in his legs and feet as if his brain refused to steer him away from her from the doorway he saw her lift her hand and touch its fingers with her lips he raised his hat solemnly and did not look back again     chapter viidartie versus dartie  the suitdartie versus dartiefor restitution of those conjugal rights concerning which winifred was at heart so deeply undecided followed the laws of subtraction towards day of judgment this was not reached before the courts rose for christmas but the case was third on the list when they sat again winifred spent the christmas holidays a thought more fashionably than usual with the matter locked up in her lowcut bosom james was particularly liberal to her that christmas expressing thereby his sympathy and relief at the approaching dissolution of her marriage with that precious rascal which his old heart felt but his old lips could not utter  the disappearance of dartie made the fall in consols a comparatively small matter and as to the scandalthe real animus he felt against that fellow and the increasing lead which property was attaining over reputation in a true forsyte about to leave this world served to drug a mind from which all allusions to the matter except his own were studiously kept what worried him as a lawyer and a parent was the fear that dartie might suddenly turn up and obey the order of the court when made that would be a pretty howdedo the fear preyed on him in fact so much that in presenting winifred with a large christmas cheque he said its chiefly for that chap out there to keep him from coming back it was of course to pitch away good money but all in the nature of insurance against that bankruptcy which would no longer hang over him if only the divorce went through and he questioned winifred rigorously until she could assure him that the money had been sent poor womanit cost her many a pang to send what must find its way into the vanitybag of that creature soames hearing of it shook his head they were not dealing with a forsyte reasonably tenacious of his purpose it was very risky without knowing how the land lay out there still it would look well with the court and he would see that dreamer brought it out i wonder he said suddenly where that ballet goes after the argentine never omitting a chance of reminder for he knew that winifred still had a weakness if not for dartie at least for not laundering him in public though not good at showing admiration he admitted that she was behaving extremely well with all her children at home gaping like young birds for news of their fatherimogen just on the point of coming out and val very restive about the whole thing he felt that val was the real heart of the matter to winifred who certainly loved him beyond her other children the boy could spoke the wheel of this divorce yet if he set his mind to it and soames was very careful to keep the proximity of the preliminary proceedings from his nephews ears he did more he asked him to dine at the remove and over vals cigar introduced the subject which he knew to be nearest to his heart  i hear he said that you want to play polo up at oxford  val became less recumbent in his chair  rather he said  well continued soames thats a very expensive business your grandfather isnt likely to consent to it unless he can make sure that hes not got any other drain on him and he paused to see whether the boy understood his meaning  vals thick dark lashes concealed his eyes but a slight grimace appeared on his wide mouth and he muttered  i suppose you mean my dad  yes said soames im afraid it depends on whether he continues to be a drag or not and said no more letting the boy dream it over  but val was also dreaming in those days of a silverroan palfrey and a girl riding it though crum was in town and an introduction to cynthia dark to be had for the asking val did not ask indeed he shunned crum and lived a life strange even to himself except in so far as accounts with tailor and livery stable were concerned to his mother his sisters his young brother he seemed to spend this vacation in seeing fellows and his evenings sleepily at home they could not propose anything in daylight that did not meet with the one response sorry ive got to see a fellow and he was put to extraordinary shifts to get in and out of the house unobserved in riding clothes until being made a member of the goats club he was able to transport them there where he could change unregarded and slip off on his hack to richmond park he kept his growing sentiment religiously to himself not for a world would he breathe to the fellows whom he was not seeing anything so ridiculous from the point of view of their creed and his but he could not help its destroying his other appetites it was coming between him and the legitimate pleasures of youth at last on its own in a way which must he knew make him a milksop in the eyes of crum all he cared for was to dress in his lastcreated riding togs and steal away to the robin hill gate where presently the silver roan would come demurely sidling with its slim and darkhaired rider and in the glades bare of leaves they would go off side by side not talking very much riding races sometimes and sometimes holding hands more than once of an evening in a moment of expansion he had been tempted to tell his mother how this shy sweet cousin had stolen in upon him and wrecked his life but bitter experience that all persons above thirtyfive were spoilsports prevented him after all he supposed he would have to go through with college and she would have to come out before they could be married so why complicate things so long as he could see her sisters were teasing and unsympathetic beings a brother worse so there was no one to confide in ah and this beastly divorce business what a misfortune to have a name which other people hadnt if only he had been called gordon or scott or howard or something fairly common but dartiethere wasnt another in the directory one might as well have been named morkin for all the covert it afforded so matters went on till one day in the middle of january the silverroan palfrey and its rider were missing at the tryst lingering in the cold he debated whether he should ride on to the house but jolly might be there and the memory of their dark encounter was still fresh within him one could not be always fighting with her brother so he returned dismally to town and spent an evening plunged in gloom at breakfast next day he noticed that his mother had on an unfamiliar dress and was wearing her hat the dress was black with a glimpse of peacock blue the hat black and largeshe looked exceptionally well but when after breakfast she said to him come in here val and led the way to the drawingroom he was at once beset by qualms winifred carefully shut the door and passed her handkerchief over her lips inhaling the violette de parme with which it had been soaked val thought has she found out about holly  her voice interrupted  are you going to be nice to me dear boy  val grinned doubtfully  will you come with me this morning  ive got to see began val but something in her face stopped him i say he said you dont mean  yes i have to go to the court this morning alreadythat dd business which he had almost succeeded in forgetting since nobody ever mentioned it in selfcommiseration he stood picking little bits of skin off his fingers then noticing that his mothers lips were all awry he said impulsively all right mother ill come the brutes what brutes he did not know but the expression exactly summed up their joint feeling and restored a measure of equanimity  i suppose id better change into a shooter he muttered escaping to his room he put on the shooter a higher collar a pearl pin and his neatest grey spats to a somewhat blasphemous accompaniment looking at himself in the glass he said well im damned if im going to show anything and went down he found his grandfathers carriage at the door and his mother in furs with the appearance of one going to a mansion house assembly they seated themselves side by side in the closed barouche and all the way to the courts of justice val made but one allusion to the business in hand therell be nothing about those pearls will there  the little tufted white tails of winifreds muff began to shiver  oh no she said itll be quite harmless today your grandmother wanted to come too but i wouldnt let her i thought you could take care of me you look so nice val just pull your coat collar up a little more at the backthats right  if they bully you began val  oh they wont i shall be very cool its the only way  they wont want me to give evidence or anything  no dear its all arranged and she patted his hand the determined front she was putting on it stayed the turmoil in vals chest and he busied himself in drawing his gloves off and on he had taken what he now saw was the wrong pair to go with his spats they should have been grey but were deerskin of a dark tan whether to keep them on or not he could not decide they arrived soon after ten it was his first visit to the law courts and the building struck him at once  by jove he said as they passed into the hall thisd make four or five jolly good racket courts  soames was awaiting them at the foot of some stairs  here you are he said without shaking hands as if the event had made them too familiar for such formalities its happerly browne court i we shall be on first  a sensation such as he had known when going in to bat was playing now in the top of vals chest but he followed his mother and uncle doggedly looking at no more than he could help and thinking that the place smelled fuggy people seemed to be lurking everywhere and he plucked soames by the sleeve  i say uncle youre not going to let those beastly papers in are you  soames gave him the sideway look which had reduced many to silence in its time  in here he said you neednt take off your furs winifred  val entered behind them nettled and with his head up in this confounded hole everybodyand there were a good many of themseemed sitting on everybody elses knee though really divided from each other by pews and val had a feeling that they might all slip down together into the well this however was but a momentary visionof mahogany and black gowns and white blobs of wigs and faces and papers all rather secret and whisperybefore he was sitting next his mother in the front row with his back to it all glad of her violette de parme and taking off his gloves for the last time his mother was looking at him he was suddenly conscious that she had really wanted him there next to her and that he counted for something in this business  all right he would show them squaring his shoulders he crossed his legs and gazed inscrutably at his spats but just then an old johnny in a gown and long wig looking awfully like a funny raddled woman came through a door into the high pew opposite and he had to uncross his legs hastily and stand up with everybody else  dartie versus dartie  it seemed to val unspeakably disgusting to have ones name called out like this in public and suddenly conscious that someone nearly behind him had begun talking about his family he screwed his face round to see an old bewigged buffer who spoke as if he were eating his own wordsqueerlooking old cuss the sort of man he had seen once or twice dining at park lane and punishing the port he knew now where they dug them up all the same he found the old buffer quite fascinating and would have continued to stare if his mother had not touched his arm reduced to gazing before him he fixed his eyes on the judges face instead why should that old sportsman with his sarcastic mouth and his quickmoving eyes have the power to meddle with their private affairshadnt he affairs of his own just as many and probably just as nasty and there moved in val like an illness all the deepseated individualism of his breed the voice behind him droned along differences about money mattersextravagance of the respondent what a word was that his fatherstrained situationfrequent absences on the part of mr dartie my client very rightly your ludship will agree was anxious to check a coursebut lead to ruinremonstratedgambling at cards and on the racecourse thats right thought val pile it on crisis early in october when the respondent wrote her this letter from his club val sat up and his ears burned i propose to read it with the emendations necessary to the epistle of a gentleman who has beenshall we say dining me lud  old brute thought val flushing deeper youre not paid to make jokes  you will not get the chance to insult me again in my own house i am leaving the country tomorrow its played outan expression your ludship not unknown in the mouths of those who have not met with conspicuous success  sniggering owls thought val and his flush deepened  i am tired of being insulted by you my client will tell your ludship that these socalled insults consisted in her calling him the limita very mild expression i venture to suggest in all the circumstances  val glanced sideways at his mothers impassive face it had a hunted look in the eyes poor mother he thought and touched her arm with his own the voice behind droned on  i am going to live a new life m d  and next day me lud the respondent left by the steamship tuscarora for buenos aires since then we have nothing from him but a cabled refusal in answer to the letter which my client wrote the following day in great distress begging him to return to her with your ludships permission i shall now put mrs dartie in the box  when his mother rose val had a tremendous impulse to rise too and say look here im going to see you jolly well treat her decently he subdued it however heard her saying the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and looked up she made a rich figure of it in her furs and large hat with a slight flush on her cheekbones calm matteroffact and he felt proud of her thus confronting all these confounded lawyers the examination began knowing that this was only the preliminary to divorce val followed with a certain glee the questions framed so as to give the impression that she really wanted his father back it seemed to him that they were foxing old bagwigs finely  and he received a most unpleasant jar when the judge said suddenly  now why did your husband leave younot because you called him the limit you know  val saw his uncle lift his eyes to the witness box without moving his face heard a shuffle of papers behind him and instinct told him that the issue was in peril had uncle soames and the old buffer behind made a mess of it his mother was speaking with a slight drawl  no my lord but it had gone on a long time  what had gone on  our differences about money  but you supplied the money do you suggest that he left you to better his position  the brute the old brute and nothing but the brute thought val suddenly he smells a rat hes trying to get at the pastry and his heart stood still ifif he did then of course he would know that his mother didnt really want his father back his mother spoke again a thought more fashionably  no my lord but you see i had refused to give him any more money it took him a long time to believe that but he did at lastand when he did  i see you had refused but youve sent him some since  my lord i wanted him back  and you thought that would bring him  i dont know my lord i acted on my fathers advice  something in the judges face in the sound of the papers behind him in the sudden crossing of his uncles legs told val that she had made just the right answer crafty he thought by jove what humbug it all is  the judge was speaking  just one more question mrs dartie are you still fond of your husband  vals hands slack behind him became fists what business had that judge to make things human suddenly to make his mother speak out of her heart and say what perhaps she didnt know herself before all these people it wasnt decent his mother answered rather low yes my lord val saw the judge nod wish i could take a cockshy at your head he thought irreverently as his mother came back to her seat beside him witnesses to his fathers departure and continued absence followedone of their own maids even which struck val as particularly beastly there was more talking all humbug and then the judge pronounced the decree for restitution and they got up to go val walked out behind his mother chin squared eyelids drooped doing his level best to despise everybody his mothers voice in the corridor roused him from an angry trance  you behaved beautifully dear it was such a comfort to have you your uncle and i are going to lunch  all right said val i shall have time to go and see that fellow and parting from them abruptly he ran down the stairs and out into the air he bolted into a hansom and drove to the goats club his thoughts were on holly and what he must do before her brother showed her this thing in tomorrows paper                  when val had left them soames and winifred made their way to the cheshire cheese he had suggested it as a meeting place with mr bellby at that early hour of noon they would have it to themselves and winifred had thought it would be amusing to see this farfamed hostelry having ordered a light repast to the consternation of the waiter they awaited its arrival together with that of mr bellby in silent reaction after the hour and a halfs suspense on the tenterhooks of publicity mr bellby entered presently preceded by his nose as cheerful as they were glum well they had got the decree of restitution and what was the matter with that  quite said soames in a suitably low voice but we shall have to begin again to get evidence hell probably try the divorceit will look fishy if it comes out that we knew of misconduct from the start his questions showed well enough that he doesnt like this restitution dodge  pho said mr bellby cheerily hell forget why man hell have tried a hundred cases between now and then besides hes bound by precedent to give ye your divorce if the evidence is satisfactory we wont let um know that mrs dartie had knowledge of the facts dreamer did it very nicelyhes got a fatherly touch about um  soames nodded  and i compliment ye mrs dartie went on mr bellby yeve a natural gift for giving evidence steady as a rock  here the waiter arrived with three plates balanced on one arm and the remark i urried up the pudden sir youll find plenty o lark in it today  mr bellby applauded his forethought with a dip of his nose but soames and winifred looked with dismay at their light lunch of gravified brown masses touching them gingerly with their forks in the hope of distinguishing the bodies of the tasty little songgivers having begun however they found they were hungrier than they thought and finished the lot with a glass of port apiece conversation turned on the war soames thought ladysmith would fall and it might last a year bellby thought it would be over by the summer both agreed that they wanted more men there was nothing for it but complete victory since it was now a question of prestige winifred brought things back to more solid ground by saying that she did not want the divorce suit to come on till after the summer holidays had begun at oxford then the boys would have forgotten about it before val had to go up again the london season too would be over the lawyers reassured her an interval of six months was necessaryafter that the earlier the better people were now beginning to come in and they partedsoames to the city bellby to his chambers winifred in a hansom to park lane to let her mother know how she had fared the issue had been so satisfactory on the whole that it was considered advisable to tell james who never failed to say day after day that he didnt know about winifreds affair he couldnt tell as his sands ran out the importance of mundane matters became increasingly grave to him as if he were feeling i must make the most of it and worry well i shall soon have nothing to worry about  he received the report grudgingly it was a newfangled way of going about things and he didnt know but he gave winifred a cheque saying  i expect youll have a lot of expense thats a new hat youve got on why doesnt val come and see us  winifred promised to bring him to dinner soon and going home she sought her bedroom where she could be alone now that her husband had been ordered back into her custody with a view to putting him away from her for ever she would try once more to find out from her sore and lonely heart what she really wanted     chapter viiithe challenge  the morning had been misty verging on frost but the sun came out while val was jogging towards the roehampton gate whence he would canter on to the usual tryst his spirits were rising rapidly there had been nothing so very terrible in the mornings proceedings beyond the general disgrace of violated privacy if we were engaged he thought what happens wouldnt matter he felt indeed like human society which kicks and clamours at the results of matrimony and hastens to get married and he galloped over the winterdried grass of richmond park fearing to be late but again he was alone at the trysting spot and this second defection on the part of holly upset him dreadfully he could not go back without seeing her today emerging from the park he proceeded towards robin hill he could not make up his mind for whom to ask suppose her father were back or her sister or brother were in he decided to gamble and ask for them all first so that if he were in luck and they were not there it would be quite natural in the end to ask for holly while if any of them were inan excuse for a ride must be his saving grace  only miss holly is in sir  oh thanks might i take my horse round to the stables and would you sayher cousin mr val dartie  when he returned she was in the hall very flushed and shy she led him to the far end and they sat down on a wide windowseat  ive been awfully anxious said val in a low voice whats the matter  jolly knows about our riding  is he in  no but i expect he will be soon  then cried val and diving forward he seized her hand she tried to withdraw it failed gave up the attempt and looked at him wistfully  first of all he said i want to tell you something about my family my dad you know isnt altogetheri mean hes left my mother and theyre trying to divorce him so theyve ordered him to come back you see youll see that in the paper tomorrow  her eyes deepened in colour and fearful interest her hand squeezed his but the gambler in val was roused now and he hurried on  of course theres nothing very much at present but there will be i expect before its over divorce suits are beastly you know i wanted to tell you becausebecauseyou ought to knowif and he began to stammer gazing at her troubled eyes ifif youre going to be a darling and love me holly i love youever so and i want to be engaged he had done it in a manner so inadequate that he could have punched his own head and dropping on his knees he tried to get nearer to that soft troubled face you do love medont you if you dont i there was a moment of silence and suspense so awful that he could hear the sound of a mowingmachine far out on the lawn pretending there was grass to cut then she swayed forward her free hand touched his hair and he gasped oh holly  her answer was very soft oh val  he had dreamed of this moment but always in an imperative mood as the masterful young lover and now he felt humble touched trembly he was afraid to stir off his knees lest he should break the spell lest if he did she should shrink and deny her own surrenderso tremulous was she in his grasp with her eyelids closed and his lips nearing them her eyes opened seemed to swim a little he pressed his lips to hers suddenly he sprang up there had been footsteps a sort of startled grunt he looked round no one but the long curtains which barred off the outer hall were quivering  my god who was that  holly too was on her feet  jolly i expect she whispered  val clenched fists and resolution  all right he said i dont care a bit now were engaged and striding towards the curtains he drew them aside there at the fireplace in the hall stood jolly with his back elaborately turned val went forward jolly faced round on him  i beg your pardon for hearing he said  with the best intentions in the world val could not help admiring him at that moment his face was clear his voice quiet he looked somehow distinguished as if acting up to principle  well val said abruptly its nothing to you  oh said jolly you come this way and he crossed the hall val followed at the study door he felt a touch on his arm hollys voice said  im coming too  no said jolly  yes said holly  jolly opened the door and they all three went in once in the little room they stood in a sort of triangle on three corners of the worn turkey carpet awkwardly upright not looking at each other quite incapable of seeing any humour in the situation  val broke the silence  holly and i are engaged  jolly stepped back and leaned against the lintel of the window  this is our house he said im not going to insult you in it but my fathers away im in charge of my sister youve taken advantage of me  i didnt mean to said val hotly  i think you did said jolly if you hadnt meant to youd have spoken to me or waited for my father to come back  there were reasons said val  what reasons  about my familyive just told her i wanted her to know before things happen  jolly suddenly became less distinguished  youre kids he said and you know you are  i am not a kid said val  you areyoure not twenty  well what are you  i am twenty said jolly  only just anyway im as good a man as you  jollys face crimsoned then clouded some struggle was evidently taking place in him and val and holly stared at him so clearly was that struggle marked they could even hear him breathing then his face cleared up and became oddly resolute  well see that he said i dare you to do what im going to do  dare me  jolly smiled yes he said dare you and i know very well you wont  a stab of misgiving shot through val this was riding very blind  i havent forgotten that youre a fireeater said jolly slowly and i think thats about all you are or that you called me a proboer  val heard a gasp above the sound of his own hard breathing and saw hollys face poked a little forward very pale with big eyes  yes went on jolly with a sort of smile we shall soon see im going to join the imperial yeomanry and i dare you to do the same mr val dartie  vals head jerked on its stem it was like a blow between the eyes so utterly unthought of so extreme and ugly in the midst of his dreaming and he looked at holly with eyes grown suddenly touchingly haggard  sit down said jolly take your time think it over well and he himself sat down on the arm of his grandfathers chair  val did not sit down he stood with hands thrust deep into his breeches pocketshands clenched and quivering the full awfulness of this decision one way or the other knocked at his mind with double knocks as of an angry postman if he did not take that dare he was disgraced in hollys eyes and in the eyes of that young enemy her brute of a brother yet if he took it ah then all would vanishher face her eyes her hair her kisses just begun  take your time said jolly again i dont want to be unfair  and they both looked at holly she had recoiled against the bookshelves reaching to the ceiling her dark head leaned against gibbons roman empire her eyes in a sort of soft grey agony were fixed on val and he who had not much gift of insight had suddenly a gleam of vision she would be proud of her brotherthat enemy she would be ashamed of him his hands came out of his pockets as if lifted by a spring  all right he said done  hollys faceoh it was queer he saw her flush start forward he had done the right thingher face was shining with wistful admiration jolly stood up and made a little bow as who should say youve passed  tomorrow then he said well go together  recovering from the impetus which had carried him to that decision val looked at him maliciously from under his lashes all right he thought one to you i shall have to joinbut ill get back on you somehow and he said with dignity i shall be ready  well meet at the main recruiting office then said jolly at twelve oclock and opening the window he went out on to the terrace conforming to the creed which had made him retire when he surprised them in the hall  the confusion in the mind of val thus left alone with her for whom he had paid this sudden price was extreme the mood of showingoff was still however uppermost one must do the wretched thing with an air  we shall get plenty of riding and shooting anyway he said thats one comfort and it gave him a sort of grim pleasure to hear the sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of her heart  oh the warll soon be over he said perhaps we shant even have to go out i dont care except for you he would be out of the way of that beastly divorce it was an illwind he felt her warm hand slip into his jolly thought he had stopped their loving each other did he he held her tightly round the waist looking at her softly through his lashes smiling to cheer her up promising to come down and see her soon feeling somehow six inches taller and much more in command of her than he had ever dared feel before many times he kissed her before he mounted and rode back to town so swiftly on the least provocation does the possessive instinct flourish and grow     chapter ixdinner at james  dinner parties were not now given at james in park laneto every house the moment comes when master or mistress is no longer up to it no more can nine courses be served to twenty mouths above twenty fine white expanses nor does the household cat any longer wonder why she is suddenly shut up  so with something like excitement emilywho at seventy would still have liked a little feast and fashion now and thenordered dinner for six instead of two herself wrote a number of foreign words on cards and arranged the flowersmimosa from the riviera and white roman hyacinths not from rome there would only be of course james and herself soames winifred val and imogenbut she liked to pretend a little and dally in imagination with the glory of the past she so dressed herself that james remarked  what are you putting on that thing for youll catch cold  but emily knew that the necks of women are protected by love of shining unto fourscore years and she only answered  let me put you on one of those dickies i got you james then youll only have to change your trousers and put on your velvet coat and there youll be val likes you to look nice  dicky said james youre always wasting your money on something  but he suffered the change to be made till his neck also shone murmuring vaguely  hes an extravagant chap im afraid  a little brighter in the eye with rather more colour than usual in his cheeks he took his seat in the drawingroom to wait for the sound of the frontdoor bell  ive made it a proper dinner party emily said comfortably i thought it would be good practice for imogenshe must get used to it now shes coming out  james uttered an indeterminate sound thinking of imogen as she used to climb about his knee or pull christmas crackers with him  shell be pretty he muttered i shouldnt wonder  she is pretty said emily she ought to make a good match  there you go murmured james shed much better stay at home and look after her mother a second dartie carrying off his pretty granddaughter would finish him he had never quite forgiven emily for having been as much taken in by montague dartie as he himself had been  wheres warmson he said suddenly i should like a glass of madeira tonight  theres champagne james  james shook his head no body he said i cant get any good out of it  emily reached forward on her side of the fire and rang the bell  your master would like a bottle of madeira opened warmson  no no said james the tips of his ears quivering with vehemence and his eyes fixed on an object seen by him alone look here warmson you go to the inner cellar and on the middle shelf of the end bin on the left youll see seven bottles take the one in the centre and dont shake it its the last of the madeira i had from mr jolyon when we came in herenever been moved it ought to be in prime condition still but i dont know i cant tell  very good sir responded the withdrawing warmson  i was keeping it for our golden wedding said james suddenly but i shant live three years at my age  nonsense james said emily dont talk like that  i ought to have got it up myself murmured james hell shake it as likely as not and he sank into silent recollection of long moments among the open gasjets the cobwebs and the good smell of winesoaked corks which had been appetiser to so many feasts in the wine from that cellar was written the history of the forty odd years since he had come to the park lane house with his young bride and of the many generations of friends and acquaintances who had passed into the unknown its depleted bins preserved the record of family festivityall the marriages births deaths of his kith and kin and when he was gone there it would be and he didnt know what would become of it itd be drunk or spoiled he shouldnt wonder  from that deep reverie the entrance of his son dragged him followed very soon by that of winifred and her two eldest  they went down arminarmjames with imogen the debutante because his pretty grandchild cheered him soames with winifred emily with val whose eyes lighting on the oysters brightened this was to be a proper full blowout with fizz and port and he felt in need of it after what he had done that day as yet undivulged after the first glass or two it became pleasant to have this bombshell up his sleeve this piece of sensational patriotism or example rather of personal daring to displayfor his pleasure in what he had done for his queen and country was so far entirely personal he was now a blood indissolubly connected with guns and horses he had a right to swaggernot of course that he was going to he should just announce it quietly when there was a pause and glancing down the menu he determined on bombe aux fraises as the proper moment there would be a certain solemnity while they were eating that once or twice before they reached that rosy summit of the dinner he was attacked by remembrance that his grandfather was never told anything still the old boy was drinking madeira and looking jolly fit besides he ought to be pleased at this setoff to the disgrace of the divorce the sight of his uncle opposite too was a sharp incentive he was so far from being a sportsman that it would be worth a lot to see his face besides better to tell his mother in this way than privately which might upset them both he was sorry for her but after all one couldnt be expected to feel much for others when one had to part from holly  his grandfathers voice travelled to him thinly val try a little of the madeira with your ice you wont get that up at college  val watched the slow liquid filling his glass the essential oil of the old wine glazing the surface inhaled its aroma and thought now for it it was a rich moment he sipped and a gentle glow spread in his veins already heated with a rapid look round he said i joined the imperial yeomanry today granny and emptied his glass as though drinking the health of his own act  what it was his mothers desolate little word  young jolly forsyte and i went down there together  you didnt sign from uncle soames  rather we go into camp on monday  i say cried imogen  all looked at james he was leaning forward with his hand behind his ear  whats that he said whats he saying i cant hear  emily reached forward to pat vals hand  its only that val has joined the yeomanry james its very nice for him hell look his best in uniform  joined therubbish came from james tremulously loud you cant see two yards before your nose hehell have to go out there why hell be fighting before he knows where he is  val saw imogens eyes admiring him and his mother still and fashionable with her handkerchief before her lips  suddenly his uncle spoke  youre under age  i thought of that smiled val i gave my age as twentyone  he heard his grandmothers admiring well val that was plucky of you was conscious of warmson deferentially filling his champagne glass and of his grandfathers voice moaning i dont know whatll become of you if you go on like this  imogen was patting his shoulder his uncle looking at him sidelong only his mother sat unmoving till affected by her stillness val said  its all right you know we shall soon have them on the run i only hope i shall come in for something  he felt elated sorry tremendously important all at once this would show uncle soames and all the forsytes how to be sportsmen he had certainly done something heroic and exceptional in giving his age as twentyone  emilys voice brought him back to earth  you mustnt have a second glass james warmson  wont they be astonished at timothys burst out imogen id give anything to see their faces do you have a sword val or only a popgun  what made you  his uncles voice produced a slight chill in the pit of vals stomach made him how answer that he was grateful for his grandmothers comfortable  well i think its very plucky of val im sure hell make a splendid soldier hes just the figure for it we shall all be proud of him  what had young jolly forsyte to do with it why did you go together pursued soames uncannily relentless i thought you werent friendly with him  im not mumbled val but i wasnt going to be beaten by him he saw his uncle look at him quite differently as if approving his grandfather was nodding too his grandmother tossing her head they all approved of his not being beaten by that cousin of his there must be a reason val was dimly conscious of some disturbing point outside his range of vision as it might be the unlocated centre of a cyclone and staring at his uncles face he had a quite unaccountable vision of a woman with dark eyes gold hair and a white neck who smelt nice and had pretty silken clothes which he had liked feeling when he was quite small by jove yes aunt irene she used to kiss him and he had bitten her arm once playfully because he liked itso soft his grandfather was speaking  whats his father doing  hes away in paris val said staring at the very queer expression on his uncles face likelike that of a snarling dog  artists said james the word coming from the very bottom of his soul broke up the dinner  opposite his mother in the cab going home val tasted the afterfruits of heroism like medlars overripe  she only said indeed that he must go to his tailors at once and have his uniform properly made and not just put up with what they gave him but he could feel that she was very much upset it was on his lips to console her with the spoken thought that he would be out of the way of that beastly divorce but the presence of imogen and the knowledge that his mother would not be out of the way restrained him he felt aggrieved that she did not seem more proud of him when imogen had gone to bed he risked the emotional  im awfully sorry to have to leave you mother  well i must make the best of it we must try and get you a commission as soon as we can then you wont have to rough it so do you know any drill val  not a scrap  i hope they wont worry you much i must take you about to get the things tomorrow goodnight kiss me  with that kiss soft and hot between his eyes and those words i hope they wont worry you much in his ears he sat down to a cigarette before a dying fire the heat was out of himthe glow of cutting a dash it was all a damned heartaching bore ill be even with that chap jolly he thought trailing up the stairs past the room where his mother was biting her pillow to smother a sense of desolation which was trying to make her sob  and soon only one of the diners at james was awakesoames in his bedroom above his fathers  so that fellow jolyon was in pariswhat was he doing there hanging round irene the last report from polteed had hinted that there might be something soon could it be this that fellow with his beard and his cursed amused way of speakingson of the old man who had given him the nickname man of property and bought the fatal house from him soames had ever resented having had to sell the house at robin hill never forgiven his uncle for having bought it or his cousin for living in it  reckless of the cold he threw his window up and gazed out across the park bleak and dark the january night little sound of traffic a frost coming bare trees a star or two ill see polteed tomorrow he thought by god im mad i think to want her still that fellow if um no     chapter xdeath of the dog balthasar  jolyon who had crossed from calais by night arrived at robin hill on sunday morning he had sent no word beforehand so walked up from the station entering his domain by the coppice gate coming to the log seat fashioned out of an old fallen trunk he sat down first laying his overcoat on it  lumbago he thought thats what love ends in at my time of life and suddenly irene seemed very near just as she had been that day of rambling at fontainebleau when they had sat on a log to eat their lunch hauntingly near odour drawn out of fallen leaves by the palefiltering sunlight soaked his nostrils im glad it isnt spring he thought with the scent of sap and the song of birds and the bursting of the blossoms it would have been unbearable i hope i shall be over it by then old fool that i am and picking up his coat he walked on into the field he passed the pond and mounted the hill slowly  near the top a hoarse barking greeted him up on the lawn above the fernery he could see his old dog balthasar the animal whose dim eyes took his master for a stranger was warning the world against him jolyon gave his special whistle even at that distance of a hundred yards and more he could see the dawning recognition in the obese brownwhite body the old dog got off his haunches and his tail closecurled over his back began a feeble excited fluttering he came waddling forward gathered momentum and disappeared over the edge of the fernery jolyon expected to meet him at the wicket gate but balthasar was not there and rather alarmed he turned into the fernery on his fat side looking up with eyes already glazing the old dog lay  what is it my poor old man cried jolyon balthasars curled and fluffy tail just moved his filming eyes seemed saying i cant get up master but im glad to see you  jolyon knelt down his eyes very dimmed could hardly see the slowly ceasing heave of the dogs side he raised the head a littlevery heavy  what is it dear man where are you hurt the tail fluttered once the eyes lost the look of life jolyon passed his hands all over the inert warm bulk there was nothingthe heart had simply failed in that obese body from the emotion of his masters return jolyon could feel the muzzle where a few whitish bristles grew cooling already against his lips he stayed for some minutes kneeling with his hand beneath the stiffening head the body was very heavy when he bore it to the top of the field leaves had drifted there and he strewed it with a covering of them there was no wind and they would keep him from curious eyes until the afternoon ill bury him myself he thought eighteen years had gone since he first went into the st johns wood house with that tiny puppy in his pocket strange that the old dog should die just now was it an omen he turned at the gate to look back at that russet mound then went slowly towards the house very choky in the throat  june was at home she had come down hotfoot on hearing the news of jollys enlistment his patriotism had conquered her feeling for the boers the atmosphere of his house was strange and pocketty when jolyon came in and told them of the dog balthasars death the news had a unifying effect a link with the past had snappedthe dog balthasar two of them could remember nothing before his day to june he represented the last years of her grandfather to jolyon that life of domestic stress and aesthetic struggle before he came again into the kingdom of his fathers love and wealth and he was gone  in the afternoon he and jolly took picks and spades and went out to the field they chose a spot close to the russet mound so that they need not carry him far and carefully cutting off the surface turf began to dig they dug in silence for ten minutes and then rested  well old man said jolyon so you thought you ought  yes answered jolly i dont want to a bit of course  how exactly those words represented jolyons own state of mind  i admire you for it old boy i dont believe i should have done it at your agetoo much of a forsyte im afraid but i suppose the type gets thinner with each generation your son if you have one may be a pure altruist who knows  he wont be like me then dad im beastly selfish  no my dear that you clearly are not jolly shook his head and they dug again  strange life a dogs said jolyon suddenly the only fourfooter with rudiments of altruism and a sense of god  jolly looked at his father  do you believe in god dad ive never known  at so searching a question from one to whom it was impossible to make a light reply jolyon stood for a moment feeling his back tried by the digging  what do you mean by god he said there are two irreconcilable ideas of god theres the unknowable creative principleone believes in that and theres the sum of altruism in mannaturally one believes in that  i see that leaves out christ doesnt it  jolyon stared christ the link between those two ideas out of the mouth of babes here was orthodoxy scientifically explained at last the sublime poem of the christ life was mans attempt to join those two irreconcilable conceptions of god and since the sum of human altruism was as much a part of the unknowable creative principle as anything else in nature and the universe a worse link might have been chosen after all funnyhow one went through life without seeing it in that sort of way  what do you think old man he said  jolly frowned of course my first year we talked a good bit about that sort of thing but in the second year one gives it up i dont know whyits awfully interesting  jolyon remembered that he also had talked a good deal about it his first year at cambridge and given it up in his second  i suppose said jolly its the second god you mean that old balthasar had a sense of  yes or he would never have burst his poor old heart because of something outside himself  but wasnt that just selfish emotion really  jolyon shook his head no dogs are not pure forsytes they love something outside themselves  jolly smiled  well i think im one he said you know i only enlisted because i dared val dartie to  but why  we bar each other said jolly shortly  ah muttered jolyon so the feud went on unto the third generationthis modern feud which had no overt expression  shall i tell the boy about it he thought but to what endif he had to stop short of his own part  and jolly thought its for holly to let him know about that chap if she doesnt it means she doesnt want him told and i should be sneaking anyway ive stopped it id better leave well alone  so they dug on in silence till jolyon said  now old man i think its big enough and resting on their spades they gazed down into the hole where a few leaves had drifted already on a sunset wind  i cant bear this part of it said jolyon suddenly  let me do it dad he never cared much for me  jolyon shook his head  well lift him very gently leaves and all id rather not see him again ill take his head now  with extreme care they raised the old dogs body whose faded tan and white showed here and there under the leaves stirred by the wind they laid it heavy cold and unresponsive in the grave and jolly spread more leaves over it while jolyon deeply afraid to show emotion before his son began quickly shovelling the earth on to that still shape there went the past if only there were a joyful future to look forward to it was like stamping down earth on ones own life they replaced the turf carefully on the smooth little mound and grateful that they had spared each others feelings returned to the house arminarm     chapter xitimothy stays the rot  on forsyte change news of the enlistment spread fast together with the report that june not to be outdone was going to become a red cross nurse these events were so extreme so subversive of pure forsyteism as to have a binding effect upon the family and timothys was thronged next sunday afternoon by members trying to find out what they thought about it all and exchange with each other a sense of family credit giles and jesse hayman would no longer defend the coast but go to south africa quite soon jolly and val would be following in april as to junewell you never knew what she would really do  the retirement from spion kop and the absence of any good news from the seat of war imparted an air of reality to all this clinched in startling fashion by timothy the youngest of the old forsytesscarcely eighty in fact popularly supposed to resemble their father superior dosset even in his bestknown characteristic of drinking sherryhad been invisible for so many years that he was almost mythical a long generation had elapsed since the risks of a publishers business had worked on his nerves at the age of forty so that he had got out with a mere thirtyfive thousand pounds in the world and started to make his living by careful investment putting by every year at compound interest he had doubled his capital in forty years without having once known what it was like to shake in his shoes over money matters he was now putting aside some two thousand a year and with the care he was taking of himself expected so aunt hester said to double his capital again before he died what he would do with it then with his sisters dead and himself dead was often mockingly queried by free spirits such as francie euphemia or young nicholas second christopher whose spirit was so free that he had actually said he was going on the stage all admitted however that this was best known to timothy himself and possibly to soames who never divulged a secret  those few forsytes who had seen him reported a man of thick and robust appearance not very tall with a brownred complexion grey hair and little of the refinement of feature with which most of the forsytes had been endowed by superior dossets wife a woman of some beauty and a gentle temperament it was known that he had taken surprising interest in the war sticking flags into a map ever since it began and there was uneasiness as to what would happen if the english were driven into the sea when it would be almost impossible for him to put the flags in the right places as to his knowledge of family movements or his views about them little was known save that aunt hester was always declaring that he was very upset it was then in the nature of a portent when forsytes arriving on the sunday after the evacuation of spion kop became conscious one after the other of a presence seated in the only really comfortable armchair back to the light concealing the lower part of his face with a large hand and were greeted by the awed voice of aunt hester  your uncle timothy my dear  timothys greeting to them all was somewhat identical and rather as it were passed over by him than expressed  how de do how de do xcuse me gettin up  francie was present and eustace had come in his car winifred had brought imogen breaking the ice of the restitution proceedings with the warmth of family appreciation at vals enlistment and marian tweetyman with the last news of giles and jesse these with aunt juley and hester young nicholas euphemia andof all peoplegeorge who had come with eustace in the car constituted an assembly worthy of the familys palmiest days there was not one chair vacant in the whole of the little drawingroom and anxiety was felt lest someone else should arrive  the constraint caused by timothys presence having worn off a little conversation took a military turn george asked aunt juley when she was going out with the red cross almost reducing her to a state of gaiety whereon he turned to nicholas and said  young nicks a warrior bold isnt he whens he going to don the wild khaki  young nicholas smiling with a sort of sweet deprecation intimated that of course his mother was very anxious  the dromios are off i hear said george turning to marian tweetyman we shall all be there soon en avant the forsytes roll bowl or pitch whos for a cooler  aunt juley gurgled george was so droll should hester get timothys map then he could show them all where they were  at a sound from timothy interpreted as assent aunt hester left the room  george pursued his image of the forsyte advance addressing timothy as field marshal and imogen whom he had noted at once for a pretty fillyas vivandiere and holding his top hat between his knees he began to beat it with imaginary drumsticks the reception accorded to his fantasy was mixed all laughedgeorge was licensed but all felt that the family was being rotted and this seemed to them unnatural now that it was going to give five of its members to the service of the queen george might go too far and there was relief when he got up offered his arm to aunt juley marched up to timothy saluted him kissed his aunt with mock passion said oh what a treat dear papa come on eustace and walked out followed by the grave and fastidious eustace who had never smiled  aunt juleys bewildered fancy not waiting for the map you mustnt mind him timothy hes so droll broke the hush and timothy removed the hand from his mouth  i dont know what things are comin to he was heard to say whats all this about goin out there thats not the way to beat those boers  francie alone had the hardihood to observe what is then uncle timothy  all this newfangled volunteerin and expenselettin money out of the country  just then aunt hester brought in the map handling it like a baby with eruptions with the assistance of euphemia it was laid on the piano a small colwood grand last played on it was believed the summer before aunt ann died thirteen years ago timothy rose he walked over to the piano and stood looking at his map while they all gathered round  there you are he said thats the position up to date and very poor it is hm  yes said francie greatly daring but how are you going to alter it uncle timothy without more men  men said timothy you dont want menwastin the countrys money you want a napoleon hed settle it in a month  but if you havent got him uncle timothy  thats their business replied timothy what have we kept the army up forto eat their heads off in time of peace they ought to be ashamed of themselves comin on the country to help them like this let every man stick to his business and we shall get on  and looking round him he added almost angrily  volunteerin indeed throwin good money after bad we must save conserve energy thats the only way and with a prolonged sound not quite a sniff and not quite a snort he trod on euphemias toe and went out leaving a sensation and a faint scent of barleysugar behind him  the effect of something said with conviction by one who has evidently made a sacrifice to say it is ever considerable and the eight forsytes left behind all women except young nicholas were silent for a moment round the map then francie said  really i think hes right you know after all what is the army for they ought to have known its only encouraging them  my dear cried aunt juley but theyve been so progressive think of their giving up their scarlet they were always so proud of it and now they all look like convicts hester and i were saying only yesterday we were sure they must feel it very much fancy what the iron duke would have said  the new colours very smart said winifred val looks quite nice in his  aunt juley sighed  i do so wonder what jolyons boy is like to think weve never seen him his father must be so proud of him  his fathers in paris said winifred  aunt hesters shoulder was seen to mount suddenly as if to ward off her sisters next remark for juleys crumpled cheeks had gushed  we had dear little mrs macander here yesterday just back from paris and whom dyou think she saw there in the street youll never guess  we shant try auntie said euphemia  irene imagine after all this time walking with a fair beard  auntie youll kill me a fair beard  i was going to say said aunt juley severely a fairbearded gentleman and not a day older she was always so pretty she added with a sort of lingering apology  oh tell us about her auntie cried imogen i can just remember her shes the skeleton in the family cupboard isnt she and theyre such fun  aunt hester sat down really juley had done it now  she wasnt much of a skeleton as i remember her murmured euphemia extremely wellcovered  my dear said aunt juley what a peculiar way of putting itnot very nice  no but what was she like persisted imogen  ill tell you my child said francie a kind of modern venus very welldressed  euphemia said sharply venus was never dressed and she had blue eyes of melting sapphire  at this juncture nicholas took his leave  mrs nick is awfully strict said francie with a laugh  she has six children said aunt juley its very proper she should be careful  was uncle soames awfully fond of her pursued the inexorable imogen moving her dark luscious eyes from face to face  aunt hester made a gesture of despair just as aunt juley answered  yes your uncle soames was very much attached to her  i suppose she ran off with someone  no certainly not that isnot precisely  what did she do then auntie  come along imogen said winifred we must be getting back  but aunt juley interjected resolutely sheshe didnt behave at all well  oh bother cried imogen thats as far as i ever get  well my dear said francie she had a love affair which ended with the young mans death and then she left your uncle i always rather liked her  she used to give me chocolates murmured imogen and smell nice  of course remarked euphemia  not of course at all replied francie who used a particularly expensive essence of gillyflower herself  i cant think what we are about said aunt juley raising her hands talking of such things  was she divorced asked imogen from the door  certainly not cried aunt juley that iscertainly not  a sound was heard over by the far door timothy had reentered the back drawingroom ive come for my map he said whos been divorced  no one uncle replied francie with perfect truth  timothy took his map off the piano  dont lets have anything of that sort in the family he said all this enlistins bad enough the countrys breakin up i dont know what were comin to he shook a thick finger at the room too many women nowadays and they dont know what they want  so saying he grasped the map firmly with both hands and went out as if afraid of being answered  the seven women whom he had addressed broke into a subdued murmur out of which emerged francies really the forsytes and aunt juleys he must have his feet in mustard and hot water tonight hester will you tell jane the blood has gone to his head again im afraid  that evening when she and hester were sitting alone after dinner she dropped a stitch in her crochet and looked up  hester i cant think where ive heard that dear soames wants irene to come back to him again who was it told us that george had made a funny drawing of him with the words he wont be happy till he gets it  eustace answered aunt hester from behind the times he had it in his pocket but he wouldnt show it us  aunt juley was silent ruminating the clock ticked the times crackled the fire sent forth its rustling purr aunt juley dropped another stitch  hester she said i have had such a dreadful thought  then dont tell me said aunt hester quickly  oh but i must you cant think how dreadful her voice sank to a whisper  jolyonjolyon they say has ahas a fair beard now     chapter xiiprogress of the chase  two days after the dinner at james mr polteed provided soames with food for thought  a gentleman he said consulting the key concealed in his left hand 47 as we say has been paying marked attention to 17 during the last month in paris but at present there seems to have been nothing very conclusive the meetings have all been in public places without concealmentrestaurants the opera the comique the louvre luxembourg gardens lounge of the hotel and so forth she has not yet been traced to his rooms nor vice versa they went to fontainebleaubut nothing of value in short the situation is promising but requires patience and looking up suddenly he added  one rather curious point47 has the same name aser31  the fellow knows im her husband thought soames  christian namean odd onejolyon continued mr polteed we know his address in paris and his residence here we dont wish of course to be running a wrong hare  go on with it but be careful said soames doggedly  instinctive certainty that this detective fellow had fathomed his secret made him all the more reticent  excuse me said mr polteed ill just see if theres anything fresh in  he returned with some letters relocking the door he glanced at the envelopes  yes heres a personal one from 19 to myself  well said soames   um said mr polteed she says 47 left for england today address on his baggage robin hill parted from 17 in louvre gallery at 330 nothing very striking thought it best to stay and continue observation of 17 you will deal with 47 in england if you think desirable no doubt and mr polteed lifted an unprofessional glance on soames as though he might be storing material for a book on human nature after he had gone out of business very intelligent woman 19 and a wonderful makeup not cheap but earns her money well theres no suspicion of being shadowed so far but after a time as you know sensitive people are liable to get the feeling of it without anything definite to go on i should rather advise lettingup on 17 and keeping an eye on 47 we cant get at correspondence without great risk i hardly advise that at this stage but you can tell your client that its looking up very well and again his narrowed eyes gleamed at his taciturn customer  no said soames suddenly i prefer that you should keep the watch going discreetly in paris and not concern yourself with this end  very well replied mr polteed we can do it  whatwhat is the manner between them  ill read you what she says said mr polteed unlocking a bureau drawer and taking out a file of papers she sums it up somewhere confidentially yes here it is 17 very attractiveconclude 47 longer in the tooth slang for age you knowdistinctly gonewaiting his time17 perhaps holding off for terms impossible to say without knowing more but inclined to think on the wholedoesnt know her mindlikely to act on impulse some day both have style  what does that mean said soames between close lips  well murmured mr polteed with a smile showing many white teeth an expression we use in other words its not likely to be a weekend businesstheyll come together seriously or not at all  hm muttered soames thats all is it  yes said mr polteed but quite promising  spider thought soames goodday  he walked into the green park that he might cross to victoria station and take the underground into the city for so late in january it was warm sunlight through the haze sparkled on the frosty grassan illumined cobweb of a day  little spidersand great spiders and the greatest spinner of all his own tenacity for ever wrapping its cocoon of threads round any clear way out what was that fellow hanging round irene for was it really as polteed suggested or was jolyon but taking compassion on her loneliness as he would call itsentimental radical chap that he had always been if it were indeed as polteed hinted soames stood still it could not be the fellow was seven years older than himself no better looking no richer what attraction had he  besides hes come back he thought that doesnt lookill go and see him and taking out a card he wrote  if you can spare half an hour some afternoon this week i shall be at the connoisseurs any day between 530 and 6 or i could come to the hotch potch if you prefer it i want to see yous f  he walked up st jamess street and confided it to the porter at the hotch potch  give mr jolyon forsyte this as soon as he comes in he said and took one of the new motor cabs into the city  jolyon received that card the same afternoon and turned his face towards the connoisseurs what did soames want now had he got wind of paris and stepping across st jamess street he determined to make no secret of his visit but it wont do he thought to let him know shes there unless he knows already in this complicated state of mind he was conducted to where soames was drinking tea in a small baywindow  no tea thanks said jolyon but ill go on smoking if i may  the curtains were not yet drawn though the lamps outside were lighted the two cousins sat waiting on each other  youve been in paris i hear said soames at last  yes just back  young val told me he and your boy are going off then jolyon nodded  you didnt happen to see irene i suppose it appears shes abroad somewhere  jolyon wreathed himself in smoke before he answered yes i saw her  how was she  very well  there was another silence then soames roused himself in his chair  when i saw you last he said i was in two minds we talked and you expressed your opinion i dont wish to reopen that discussion i only wanted to say this my position with her is extremely difficult i dont want you to go using your influence against me what happened is a very long time ago im going to ask her to let bygones be bygones  you have asked her you know murmured jolyon  the idea was new to her then it came as a shock but the more she thinks of it the more she must see that its the only way out for both of us  thats not my impression of her state of mind said jolyon with particular calm and forgive my saying you misconceive the matter if you think reason comes into it at all  he saw his cousins pale face grow palerhe had used without knowing it irenes own words  thanks muttered soames but i see things perhaps more plainly than you think i only want to be sure that you wont try to influence her against me  i dont know what makes you think i have any influence said jolyon but if i have im bound to use it in the direction of what i think is her happiness i am what they call a feminist i believe  feminist repeated soames as if seeking to gain time does that mean that youre against me  bluntly said jolyon im against any woman living with any man whom she definitely dislikes it appears to me rotten  and i suppose each time you see her you put your opinions into her mind  i am not likely to be seeing her  not going back to paris  not so far as i know said jolyon conscious of the intent watchfulness in soames face  well thats all i had to say anyone who comes between man and wife you know incurs heavy responsibility  jolyon rose and made him a slight bow  goodbye he said and without offering to shake hands moved away leaving soames staring after him we forsytes thought jolyon hailing a cab are very civilised with simpler folk that might have come to a row if it werent for my boy going to the war the war a gust of his old doubt swept over him a precious war domination of peoples or of women attempts to master and possess those who did not want you the negation of gentle decency possession vested rights and anyone agin emoutcast thank heaven he thought i always felt agin em anyway yes even before his first disastrous marriage he could remember fuming over the bludgeoning of ireland or the matrimonial suits of women trying to be free of men they loathed parsons would have it that freedom of soul and body were quite different things pernicious doctrine body and soul could not thus be separated free will was the strength of any tie and not its weakness i ought to have told soames he thought that i think him comic ah but hes tragic too was there anything indeed more tragic in the world than a man enslaved by his own possessive instinct who couldnt see the sky for it or even enter fully into what another person felt i must write and warn her he thought hes going to have another try and all the way home to robin hill he rebelled at the strength of that duty to his son which prevented him from posting back to paris  but soames sat long in his chair the prey of a no less gnawing achea jealous ache as if it had been revealed to him that this fellow held precedence of himself and had spun fresh threads of resistance to his way out does that mean that youre against me he had got nothing out of that disingenuous question feminist phrasey fellow i mustnt rush things he thought i have some breathing space hes not going back to paris unless he was lying ill let the spring come though how the spring could serve him save by adding to his ache he could not tell and gazing down into the street where figures were passing from pool to pool of the light from the high lamps he thought nothing seems any goodnothing seems worth while im loneythats the trouble  he closed his eyes and at once he seemed to see irene in a dark street below a churchpassing turning her neck so that he caught the gleam of her eyes and her white forehead under a little dark hat which had gold spangles on it and a veil hanging down behind he opened his eyesso vividly he had seen her a woman was passing below but not she oh no there was nothing there     chapter xiiihere we are again  imogens frocks for her first season exercised the judgment of her mother and the purse of her grandfather all through the month of march with forsyte tenacity winifred quested for perfection it took her mind off the slowly approaching rite which would give her a freedom but doubtfully desired took her mind too off her boy and his fast approaching departure for a war from which the news remained disquieting like bees busy on summer flowers or bright gadflies hovering and darting over spiky autumn blossoms she and her little daughter tall nearly as herself and with a bust measurement not far inferior hovered in the shops of regent street the establishments of hanover square and of bond street lost in consideration and the feel of fabrics dozens of young women of striking deportment and peculiar gait paraded before winifred and imogen draped in creations the modelsvery new modom quite the latest thing which those two reluctantly turned down would have filled a museum the models which they were obliged to have nearly emptied james bank it was no good doing things by halves winifred felt in view of the need for making this first and sole untarnished season a conspicuous success their patience in trying the patience of those impersonal creatures who swam about before them could alone have been displayed by such as were moved by faith it was for winifred a long prostration before her dear goddess fashion fervent as a catholic might make before the virgin for imogen an experience by no means too unpleasantshe often looked so nice and flattery was implicit everywhere in a word it was amusing  on the afternoon of the 20th of march having as it were gutted skywards they had sought refreshment over the way at caramel and bakers and stored with chocolate frothed at the top with cream turned homewards through berkeley square of an evening touched with spring opening the doorfreshly painted a light olivegreen nothing neglected that year to give imogen a good sendoffwinifred passed towards the silver basket to see if anyone had called and suddenly her nostrils twitched what was that scent  imogen had taken up a novel sent from the library and stood absorbed rather sharply because of the queer feeling in her breast winifred said  take that up dear and have a rest before dinner  imogen still reading passed up the stairs winifred heard the door of her room slammed to and drew a long savouring breath was it spring tickling her senseswhipping up nostalgia for her clown against all wisdom and outraged virtue a male scent a faint reek of cigars and lavenderwater not smelt since that early autumn night six months ago when she had called him the limit whence came it or was it ghost of scentsheer emanation from memory she looked round her nothingnot a thing no tiniest disturbance of her hall nor of the diningroom a little daydream of a scentillusory saddening silly in the silver basket were new cards two with mr and mrs polegate thom and one with mr polegate thom thereon she sniffed them but they smelled severe i must be tired she thought ill go and lie down upstairs the drawingroom was darkened waiting for some hand to give it evening light and she passed on up to her bedroom this too was halfcurtained and dim for it was six oclock winifred threw off her coatthat scent againthen stood as if shot transfixed against the bedrail something dark had risen from the sofa in the far corner a word of horrorin her familyescaped her god  its imonty said a voice  clutching the bedrail winifred reached up and turned the switch of the light hanging above her dressingtable he appeared just on the rim of the lights circumference emblazoned from the absence of his watchchain down to boots neat and sooty brown butyessplit at the toecap his chest and face were shadowy surely he was thinor was it a trick of the light he advanced lighted now from toecap to the top of his dark headsurely a little grizzled his complexion had darkened sallowed his black moustache had lost boldness become sardonic there were lines which she did not know about his face there was no pin in his tie his suitahshe knew thatbut how unpressed unglossy she stared again at the toecap of his boot something big and relentless had been at him had turned and twisted raked and scraped him and she stayed not speaking motionless staring at that crack across the toe  well he said i got the order im back  winifreds bosom began to heave the nostalgia for her husband which had rushed up with that scent was struggling with a deeper jealousy than any she had felt yet there he wasa dark and as if harried shadow of his sleek and brazen self what force had done this to himsqueezed him like an orange to its dry rind that woman  im back he said again ive had a beastly time by god i came steerage ive got nothing but what i stand up in and that bag  and who has the rest cried winifred suddenly alive how dared you come you knew it was just for divorce that you got that order to come back dont touch me  they held each to the rail of the big bed where they had spent so many years of nights together many times yesmany times she had wanted him back but now that he had come she was filled with this cold and deadly resentment he put his hand up to his moustache but did not frizz and twist it in the old familiar way he just pulled it downwards  gad he said if you knew the time ive had  im glad i dont  are the kids all right  winifred nodded how did you get in  with my key  then the maids dont know you cant stay here monty  he uttered a little sardonic laugh  where then  anywhere  well look at me thatthat damned  if you mention her cried winifred i go straight out to park lane and i dont come back  suddenly he did a simple thing but so uncharacteristic that it moved her he shut his eyes it was as if he had said all right im dead to the world  you can have a room for the night she said your things are still here only imogen is at home  he leaned back against the bedrail well its in your hands and his own made a writhing movement ive been through it you neednt hit too hardit isnt worth while ive been frightened ive been frightened freddie  that old pet name disused for years and years sent a shiver through winifred  what am i to do with him she thought what in gods name am i to do with him  got a cigarette  she gave him one from a little box she kept up there for when she couldnt sleep at night and lighted it with that action the matteroffact side of her nature came to life again  go and have a hot bath ill put some clothes out for you in the dressingroom we can talk later  he nodded and fixed his eyes on herthey looked halfdead or was it that the folds in the lids had become heavier  hes not the same she thought he would never be quite the same again but what would he be  all right he said and went towards the door he even moved differently like a man who has lost illusion and doubts whether it is worth while to move at all  when he was gone and she heard the water in the bath running she put out a complete set of garments on the bed in his dressingroom then went downstairs and fetched up the biscuit box and whisky putting on her coat again and listening a moment at the bathroom door she went down and out in the street she hesitated past seven oclock would soames be at his club or at park lane she turned towards the latter back  soames had always feared itshe had sometimes hoped it back so like himclown that he waswith this here we are again to make fools of them allof the law of soames of herself  yet to have done with the law not to have that murky cloud hanging over her and the children what a relief ah but how to accept his return that woman had ravaged him taken from him passion such as he had never bestowed on herself such as she had not thought him capable of there was the sting that selfish blatant clown of hers whom she herself had never really stirred had been swept and ungarnished by another woman insulting too insulting not right not decent to take him back and yet she had asked for him the law perhaps would make her now he was as much her husband as evershe had put herself out of court and all he wanted no doubt was moneyto keep him in cigars and lavenderwater that scent after all im not old she thought not old yet but that woman who had reduced him to those words ive been through it ive been frightenedfrightened freddie she neared her fathers house driven this way and that while all the time the forsyte undertow was drawing her to deep conclusion that after all he was her property to be held against a robbing world and so she came to james  mr soames in his room ill go up dont say im here  her brother was dressing she found him before a mirror tying a black bow with an air of despising its ends  hullo he said contemplating her in the glass whats wrong  monty said winifred stonily  soames spun round what  back  hoist muttered soames with our own petard why the deuce didnt you let me try cruelty i always knew it was too much risk this way  oh dont talk about that what shall i do  soames answered with a deep deep sound  well said winifred impatiently  what has he to say for himself  nothing one of his boots is split across the toe  soames stared at her  ah he said of course on his beam ends soit begins again thisll about finish father  cant we keep it from him  impossible he has an uncanny flair for anything thats worrying  and he brooded with fingers hooked into his blue silk braces there ought to be some way in law he muttered to make him safe  no cried winifred i wont be made a fool of again id sooner put up with him  the two stared at each other their hearts were full of feeling but they could give it no expressionforsytes that they were  where did you leave him  in the bath and winifred gave a little bitter laugh the only thing hes brought back is lavenderwater  steady said soames youre thoroughly upset ill go back with you  whats the use  we ought to make terms with him  terms itll always be the same when he recoverscards and betting drink and she was silent remembering the look on her husbands face the burnt childthe burnt child perhaps  recovers replied soames is he ill  no burnt out thats all  soames took his waistcoat from a chair and put it on he took his coat and got into it he scented his handkerchief with eaudecologne threaded his watchchain and said we havent any luck  and in the midst of her own trouble winifred was sorry for him as if in that little saying he had revealed deep trouble of his own  id like to see mother she said  shell be with father in their room come down quietly to the study ill get her  winifred stole down to the little dark study chiefly remarkable for a canaletto too doubtful to be placed elsewhere and a fine collection of law reports unopened for many years here she stood with her back to marooncoloured curtains closedrawn staring at the empty grate till her mother came in followed by soames  oh my poor dear said emily how miserable you look in here this is too bad of him really  as a family they had so guarded themselves from the expression of all unfashionable emotion that it was impossible to go up and give her daughter a good hug but there was comfort in her cushioned voice and her still dimpled shoulders under some rare black lace summoning pride and the desire not to distress her mother winifred said in her most offhand voice  its all right mother no good fussing  i dont see said emily looking at soames why winifred shouldnt tell him that shell prosecute him if he doesnt keep off the premises he took her pearls and if hes not brought them back thats quite enough  winifred smiled they would all plunge about with suggestions of this and that but she knew already what she would be doing and that wasnothing the feeling that after all she had won a sort of victory retained her property was every moment gaining ground in her no if she wanted to punish him she could do it at home without the world knowing  well said emily come into the diningroom comfortablyyou must stay and have dinner with us leave it to me to tell your father and as winifred moved towards the door she turned out the light not till then did they see the disaster in the corridor  there attracted by light from a room never lighted james was standing with his duncoloured camelhair shawl folded about him so that his arms were not free and his silvered head looked cut off from his fashionably trousered legs as if by an expanse of desert he stood inimitably storklike with an expression as if he saw before him a frog too large to swallow  whats all this he said tell your father you never tell me anything  the moment found emily without reply it was winifred who went up to him and laying one hand on each of his swathed helpless arms said  montys not gone bankrupt father hes only come back  they all three expected something serious to happen and were glad she had kept that grip of his arms but they did not know the depth of root in that shadowy old forsyte something wry occurred about his shaven mouth and chin something scratchy between those long silvery whiskers then he said with a sort of dignity hell be the death of me i knew how it would be  you mustnt worry father said winifred calmly i mean to make him behave  ah said james here take this thing off im hot they unwound the shawl he turned and walked firmly to the diningroom  i dont want any soup he said to warmson and sat down in his chair they all sat down too winifred still in her hat while warmson laid the fourth place when he left the room james said whats he brought back  nothing father  james concentrated his eyes on his own image in a tablespoon divorce he muttered rubbish what was i about i ought to have paid him an allowance to stay out of england soames you go and propose it to him  it seemed so right and simple a suggestion that even winifred was surprised when she said no ill keep him now hes back he must just behavethats all  they all looked at her it had always been known that winifred had pluck  out there said james elliptically who knows what cutthroats you look for his revolver dont go to bed without you ought to have warmson to sleep in the house ill see him myself tomorrow  they were touched by this declaration and emily said comfortably thats right james we wont have any nonsense  ah muttered james darkly i cant tell  the advent of warmson with fish diverted conversation  when directly after dinner winifred went over to kiss her father goodnight he looked up with eyes so full of question and distress that she put all the comfort she could into her voice  its all right daddy dear dont worry i shant need anyonehes quite bland i shall only be upset if you worry goodnight bless you  james repeated the words bless you as if he did not quite know what they meant and his eyes followed her to the door  she reached home before nine and went straight upstairs  dartie was lying on the bed in his dressingroom fully redressed in a blue serge suit and pumps his arms were crossed behind his head and an extinct cigarette drooped from his mouth  winifred remembered ridiculously the flowers in her windowboxes after a blazing summer day the way they lay or rather stoodparched yet rested by the suns retreat it was as if a little dew had come already on her burntup husband  he said apathetically i suppose youve been to park lane hows the old man  winifred could not help the bitter answer not dead  he winced actually he winced  understand monty she said i will not have him worried if you arent going to behave yourself you may go back you may go anywhere have you had dinner  no  would you like some  he shrugged his shoulders  imogen offered me some i didnt want any  imogen in the plenitude of emotion winifred had forgotten her  so youve seen her what did she say  she gave me a kiss  with mortification winifred saw his dark sardonic face relaxed yes she thought he cares for her not for me a bit  darties eyes were moving from side to side  does she know about me he said  it flashed through winifred that here was the weapon she needed he minded their knowing  no val knows the others dont they only know you went away  she heard him sigh with relief  but they shall know she said firmly if you give me cause  all right he muttered hit me im down  winifred went up to the bed look here monty i dont want to hit you i dont want to hurt you i shant allude to anything im not going to worry whats the use she was silent a moment i cant stand any more though and i wont youd better know youve made me suffer but i used to be fond of you for the sake of that she met the heavylidded gaze of his brown eyes with the downward stare of her greengrey eyes touched his hand suddenly turned her back and went into her room  she sat there a long time before her glass fingering her rings thinking of this subdued dark man almost a stranger to her on the bed in the other room resolutely not worrying but gnawed by jealousy of what he had been through and now and again just visited by pity     chapter xivoutlandish night  soames doggedly let the spring comeno easy task for one conscious that time was flying his birds in the bush no nearer the hand no issue from the web anywhere visible mr polteed reported nothing except that his watch went oncosting a lot of money val and his cousin were gone to the war whence came news more favourable dartie was behaving himself so far james had retained his health business prospered almost terriblythere was nothing to worry soames except that he was held up could make no step in any direction  he did not exactly avoid soho for he could not afford to let them think that he had piped off as james would have put ithe might want to pipe on again at any minute but he had to be so restrained and cautious that he would often pass the door of the restaurant bretagne without going in and wander out of the purlieus of that region which always gave him the feeling of having been possessively irregular  he wandered thus one may night into regent street and the most amazing crowd he had ever seen a shrieking whistling dancing jostling grotesque and formidably jovial crowd with false noses and mouthorgans penny whistles and long feathers every appanage of idiocy as it seemed to him mafeking of course it had been relieved good but was that an excuse who were these people what were they where had they come from into the west end his face was tickled his ears whistled into girls cried keep your hair on stucco a youth so knocked off his tophat that he recovered it with difficulty crackers were exploding beneath his nose between his feet he was bewildered exasperated offended this stream of people came from every quarter as if impulse had unlocked floodgates let flow waters of whose existence he had heard perhaps but believed in never this then was the populace the innumerable living negation of gentility and forsyteism this wasegaddemocracy it stank yelled was hideous in the east end or even soho perhapsbut here in regent street in piccadilly what were the police about in 1900 soames with his forsyte thousands had never seen the cauldron with the lid off and now looking into it could hardly believe his scorching eyes the whole thing was unspeakable these people had no restraint they seemed to think him funny such swarms of them rude coarse laughingand what laughter  nothing sacred to them he shouldnt be surprised if they began to break windows in pall mall past those august dwellings to enter which people paid sixty pounds this shrieking whistling dancing dervish of a crowd was swarming from the club windows his own kind were looking out on them with regulated amusement they didnt realise why this was seriousmight come to anything the crowd was cheerful but some day they would come in different mood he remembered there had been a mob in the late eighties when he was at brighton they had smashed things and made speeches but more than dread he felt a deep surprise they were hystericalit wasnt english and all about the relief of a little town as big aswatford six thousand miles away restraint reserve those qualities to him more dear almost than life those indispensable attributes of property and culture where were they it wasnt english no it wasnt english so soames brooded threading his way on it was as if he had suddenly caught sight of someone cutting the covenant for quiet possession out of his legal documents or of a monster lurking and stalking out in the future casting its shadow before their want of stolidity their want of reverence it was like discovering that ninetenths of the people of england were foreigners and if that were sothen anything might happen  at hyde park corner he ran into george forsyte very sunburnt from racing holding a false nose in his hand  hallo soames he said have a nose  soames responded with a pale smile  got this from one of these sportsmen went on george who had evidently been dining had to lay him outfor trying to bash my hat i say one of these days we shall have to fight these chaps theyre getting so damned cheekyall radicals and socialists they want our goods you tell uncle james that itll make him sleep  in vino veritas thought soames but he only nodded and passed on up hamilton place there was but a trickle of roysterers in park lane not very noisy and looking up at the houses he thought after all were the backbone of the country they wont upset us easily possessions nine points of the law  but as he closed the door of his fathers house behind him all that queer outlandish nightmare in the streets passed out of his mind almost as completely as if having dreamed it he had awakened in the warm clean morning comfort of his springmattressed bed  walking into the centre of the great empty drawingroom he stood still  a wife somebody to talk things over with one had a right damn it one had a right     part iii     chapter isoames in paris  soames had travelled little aged nineteen he had made the petty tour with his father mother and winifredbrussels the rhine switzerland and home by way of paris aged twentyseven just when he began to take interest in pictures he had spent five hot weeks in italy looking into the renaissancenot so much in it as he had been led to expectand a fortnight in paris on his way back looking into himself as became a forsyte surrounded by people so strongly selfcentred and foreign as the french his knowledge of their language being derived from his public school he did not understand them when they spoke silence he had found better for all parties one did not make a fool of oneself he had disliked the look of the mens clothes the closedin cabs the theatres which looked like beehives the galleries which smelled of beeswax he was too cautious and too shy to explore that side of paris supposed by forsytes to constitute its attraction under the rose and as for a collectors bargainnot one to be had as nicholas might have put itthey were a grasping lot he had come back uneasy saying paris was overrated  when therefore in june of 1900 he went to paris it was but his third attempt on the centre of civilisation this time however the mountain was going to mahomet for he felt by now more deeply civilised than paris and perhaps he really was moreover he had a definite objective this was no mere genuflexion to a shrine of taste and immorality but the prosecution of his own legitimate affairs he went indeed because things were getting past a joke the watch went on and on andnothingnothing jolyon had never returned to paris and no one else was suspect busy with new and very confidential matters soames was realising more than ever how essential reputation is to a solicitor but at night and in his leisure moments he was ravaged by the thought that time was always flying and money flowing in and his own future as much in irons as ever since mafeking night he had become aware that a young fool of a doctor was hanging round annette twice he had come across hima cheerful young fool not more than thirty  nothing annoyed soames so much as cheerfulnessan indecent extravagant sort of quality which had no relation to facts the mixture of his desires and hopes was in a word becoming torture and lately the thought had come to him that perhaps irene knew she was being shadowed it was this which finally decided him to go and see for himself to go and once more try to break down her repugnance her refusal to make her own and his path comparatively smooth once more if he failed againwell he would see what she did with herself anyway  he went to an hotel in the rue caumartin highly recommended to forsytes where practically nobody spoke french he had formed no plan he did not want to startle her yet must contrive that she had no chance to evade him by flight and next morning he set out in bright weather  paris had an air of gaiety a sparkle over its starshape which almost annoyed soames he stepped gravely his nose lifted a little sideways in real curiosity he desired now to understand things french was not annette french there was much to be got out of his visit if he could only get it in this laudable mood and the place de la concorde he was nearly run down three times he came on the cours la reine where irenes hotel was situated almost too suddenly for he had not yet fixed on his procedure crossing over to the river side he noted the building white and cheerfullooking with green sunblinds seen through a screen of planetree leaves and conscious that it would be far better to meet her casually in some open place than to risk a call he sat down on a bench whence he could watch the entrance it was not quite eleven oclock and improbable that she had yet gone out some pigeons were strutting and preening their feathers in the pools of sunlight between the shadows of the planetrees a workman in a blue blouse passed and threw them crumbs from the paper which contained his dinner a bonne coiffed with ribbon shepherded two little girls with pigtails and frilled drawers a cab meandered by whose cocher wore a blue coat and a blackglazed hat to soames a kind of affectation seemed to cling about it all a sort of picturesqueness which was out of date a theatrical people the french he lit one of his rare cigarettes with a sense of injury that fate should be casting his life into outlandish waters he shouldnt wonder if irene quite enjoyed this foreign life she had never been properly englisheven to look at and he began considering which of those windows could be hers under the green sunblinds how could he word what he had come to say so that it might pierce the defence of her proud obstinacy he threw the fagend of his cigarette at a pigeon with the thought i cant stay here for ever twiddling my thumbs better give it up and call on her in the late afternoon but he still sat on heard twelve strike and then halfpast ill wait till one he thought while im about it but just then he started up and shrinkingly sat down again a woman had come out in a creamcoloured frock and was moving away under a fawncoloured parasol irene herself he waited till she was too far away to recognise him then set out after her she was strolling as though she had no particular objective moving if he remembered rightly toward the bois de boulogne for half an hour at least he kept his distance on the far side of the way till she had passed into the bois itself was she going to meet someone after all some confounded frenchmanone of those bel ami chaps perhaps who had nothing to do but hang about womenfor he had read that book with difficulty and a sort of disgusted fascination he followed doggedly along a shady alley losing sight of her now and then when the path curved and it came back to him how long ago one night in hyde park he had slid and sneaked from tree to tree from seat to seat hunting blindly ridiculously in burning jealousy for her and young bosinney the path bent sharply and hurrying he came on her sitting in front of a small fountaina little greenbronze niobe veiled in hair to her slender hips gazing at the pool she had wept he came on her so suddenly that he was past before he could turn and take off his hat she did not start up she had always had great selfcommandit was one of the things he most admired in her one of his greatest grievances against her because he had never been able to tell what she was thinking had she realised that he was following her selfpossession made him angry and disdaining to explain his presence he pointed to the mournful little niobe and said  thats rather a good thing  he could see then that she was struggling to preserve her composure  i didnt want to startle you is this one of your haunts  yes  a little lonely as he spoke a lady strolling by paused to look at the fountain and passed on  irenes eyes followed her  no she said prodding the ground with her parasol never lonely one has always ones shadow  soames understood and looking at her hard he exclaimed  well its your own fault you can be free of it at any moment irene come back to me and be free  irene laughed  dont cried soames stamping his foot its inhuman listen is there any condition i can make which will bring you back to me if i promise you a separate houseand just a visit now and then  irene rose something wild suddenly in her face and figure  none none none you may hunt me to the grave i will not come  outraged and on edge soames recoiled  dont make a scene he said sharply and they both stood motionless staring at the little niobe whose greenish flesh the sunlight was burnishing  thats your last word then muttered soames clenching his hands you condemn us both  irene bent her head i cant come back goodbye  a feeling of monstrous injustice flared up in soames  stop he said and listen to me a moment you gave me a sacred vowyou came to me without a penny you had all i could give you you broke that vow without cause you made me a byword you refused me a child youve left me in prison youyou still move me so that i want youi want you well what do you think of yourself  irene turned her face was deadly pale her eyes burning dark  god made me as i am she said wicked if you likebut not so wicked that ill give myself again to a man i hate  the sunlight gleamed on her hair as she moved away and seemed to lay a caress all down her clinging creamcoloured frock  soames could neither speak nor move that word hateso extreme so primitivemade all the forsyte in him tremble with a deep imprecation he strode away from where she had vanished and ran almost into the arms of the lady sauntering backthe fool the shadowing fool  he was soon dripping with perspiration in the depths of the bois  well he thought i need have no consideration for her now she has not a grain of it for me ill show her this very day that shes my wife still  but on the way home to his hotel he was forced to the conclusion that he did not know what he meant one could not make scenes in public and short of scenes in public what was there he could do he almost cursed his own thinskinnedness she might deserve no consideration but healas deserved some at his own hands and sitting lunchless in the hall of his hotel with tourists passing every moment baedeker in hand he was visited by black dejection in irons his whole life with every natural instinct and every decent yearning gagged and fettered and all because fate had driven him seventeen years ago to set his heart upon this womanso utterly that even now he had no real heart to set on any other cursed was the day he had met her and his eyes for seeing in her anything but the cruel venus she was and yet still seeing her with the sunlight on the clinging china crepe of her gown he uttered a little groan so that a tourist who was passing thought man in pain lets see what did i have for lunch  later in front of a cafe near the opera over a glass of cold tea with lemon and a straw in it he took the malicious resolution to go and dine at her hotel if she were there he would speak to her if she were not he would leave a note he dressed carefully and wrote as follows  your idyll with that fellow jolyon forsyte is known to me at all events if you pursue it understand that i will leave no stone unturned to make things unbearable for him s f  he sealed this note but did not address it refusing to write the maiden name which she had impudently resumed or to put the word forsyte on the envelope lest she should tear it up unread then he went out and made his way through the glowing streets abandoned to evening pleasureseekers entering her hotel he took his seat in a far corner of the diningroom whence he could see all entrances and exits she was not there he ate little quickly watchfully she did not come he lingered in the lounge over his coffee drank two liqueurs of brandy but still she did not come he went over to the keyboard and examined the names number twelve on the first floor and he determined to take the note up himself he mounted redcarpeted stairs past a little salon eighttentwelve should he knock push the note under or he looked furtively round and turned the handle the door opened but into a little space leading to another door he knocked on thatno answer the door was locked it fitted very closely to the floor the note would not go under he thrust it back into his pocket and stood a moment listening he felt somehow certain that she was not there and suddenly he came away passing the little salon down the stairs he stopped at the bureau and said  will you kindly see that mrs heron has this note  madame heron left today monsieursuddenly about three oclock there was illness in her family  soames compressed his lips oh he said do you know her address  non monsieur england i think  soames put the note back into his pocket and went out he hailed an open horsecab which was passing  drive me anywhere  the man who obviously did not understand smiled and waved his whip and soames was borne along in that little yellowwheeled victoria all over starshaped paris with here and there a pause and the question cest par ici monsieur no go on till the man gave it up in despair and the yellowwheeled chariot continued to roll between the tall flatfronted shuttered houses and planetree avenuesa little flying dutchman of a cab  like my life thought soames without object on and on     chapter iiin the web  soames returned to england the following day and on the third morning received a visit from mr polteed who wore a flower and carried a brown billycock hat soames motioned him to a seat  the news from the war is not so bad is it said mr polteed i hope i see you well sir  thanks quite  mr polteed leaned forward smiled opened his hand looked into it and said softly  i think weve done your business for you at last  what ejaculated soames  nineteen reports quite suddenly what i think we shall be justified in calling conclusive evidence and mr polteed paused  well  on the 10th instant after witnessing an interview between 17 and a party earlier in the day 19 can swear to having seen him coming out of her bedroom in the hotel about ten oclock in the evening with a little care in the giving of the evidence that will be enough especially as 17 has left parisno doubt with the party in question in fact they both slipped off and we havent got on to them again yet but we shallwe shall shes worked hard under very difficult circumstances and im glad shes brought it off at last mr polteed took out a cigarette tapped its end against the table looked at soames and put it back the expression on his clients face was not encouraging  who is this new person said soames abruptly  that we dont know shell swear to the fact and shes got his appearance pat  mr polteed took out a letter and began reading  middleaged medium height blue dittoes in afternoon evening dress at night pale dark hair small dark moustache flat cheeks good chin grey eyes small feet guilty look  soames rose and went to the window he stood there in sardonic fury congenital idiotspidery congenital idiot seven months at fifteen pounds a weekto be tracked down as his own wifes lover guilty look he threw the window open  its hot he said and came back to his seat  crossing his knees he bent a supercilious glance on mr polteed  i doubt if thats quite good enough he said drawling the words with no name or address i think you may let that lady have a rest and take up our friend 47 at this end whether polteed had spotted him he could not tell but he had a mental vision of him in the midst of his cronies dissolved in inextinguishable laughter guilty look damnation  mr polteed said in a tone of urgency almost of pathos i assure you we have put it through sometimes on less than that its paris you know attractive woman living alone why not risk it sir we might screw it up a peg  soames had sudden insight the fellows professional zeal was stirred greatest triumph of my career got a man his divorce through a visit to his own wifes bedroom something to talk of there when i retire and for one wild moment he thought why not after all hundreds of men of medium height had small feet and a guilty look  im not authorised to take any risk he said shortly  mr polteed looked up  pity he said quite a pity that other affair seemed very costive  soames rose  never mind that please watch 47 and take care not to find a mares nest goodmorning  mr polteeds eye glinted at the words mares nest  very good you shall be kept informed  and soames was alone again the spidery dirty ridiculous business laying his arms on the table he leaned his forehead on them full ten minutes he rested thus till a managing clerk roused him with the draft prospectus of a new issue of shares very desirable in manifold and toppings that afternoon he left work early and made his way to the restaurant bretagne only madame lamotte was in would monsieur have tea with her  soames bowed  when they were seated at right angles to each other in the little room he said abruptly  i want a talk with you madame  the quick lift of her clear brown eyes told him that she had long expected such words  i have to ask you something first that young doctorwhats his name is there anything between him and annette  her whole personality had become as it were like jetclearcut black hard shining  annette is young she said so is monsieur le docteur between young people things move quickly but annette is a good daughter ah what a jewel of a nature  the least little smile twisted soames lips  nothing definite then  but definiteno indeed the young man is veree nice butwhat would you there is no money at present  she raised her willowpatterned teacup soames did the same their eyes met  i am a married man he said living apart from my wife for many years i am seeking to divorce her  madame lamotte put down her cup indeed what tragic things there were the entire absence of sentiment in her inspired a queer species of contempt in soames  i am a rich man he added fully conscious that the remark was not in good taste it is useless to say more at present but i think you understand  madames eyes so open that the whites showed above them looked at him very straight  ah camais nous avons le temps was all she said another little cup soames refused and taking his leave walked westward  he had got that off his mind she would not let annette commit herself with that cheerful young ass until but what chance of his ever being able to say im free what chance the future had lost all semblance of reality he felt like a fly entangled in cobweb filaments watching the desirable freedom of the air with pitiful eyes  he was short of exercise and wandered on to kensington gardens and down queens gate towards chelsea perhaps she had gone back to her flat that at all events he could find out for since that last and most ignominious repulse his wounded selfrespect had taken refuge again in the feeling that she must have a lover he arrived before the little mansions at the dinnerhour no need to enquire a greyhaired lady was watering the flowerboxes in her window it was evidently let and he walked slowly past again along the riveran evening of clear quiet beauty all harmony and comfort except within his heart     chapter iiirichmond park  on the afternoon that soames crossed to france a cablegram was received by jolyon at robin hill  your son down with enteric no immediate danger will cable again  it reached a household already agitated by the imminent departure of june whose berth was booked for the following day she was indeed in the act of confiding eric cobbley and his family to her fathers care when the message arrived  the resolution to become a red cross nurse taken under stimulus of jollys enlistment had been loyally fulfilled with the irritation and regret which all forsytes feel at what curtails their individual liberties enthusiastic at first about the wonderfulness of the work she had begun after a month to feel that she could train herself so much better than others could train her and if holly had not insisted on following her example and being trained too she must inevitably have cried off the departure of jolly and val with their troop in april had further stiffened her failing resolve but now on the point of departure the thought of leaving eric cobbley with a wife and two children adrift in the cold waters of an unappreciative world weighed on her so that she was still in danger of backing out the reading of that cablegram with its disquieting reality clinched the matter she saw herself already nursing jollyfor of course they would let her nurse her own brother jolyonever wide and doubtfulhad no such hope poor june  could any forsyte of her generation grasp how rude and brutal life was ever since he knew of his boys arrival at cape town the thought of him had been a kind of recurrent sickness in jolyon he could not get reconciled to the feeling that jolly was in danger all the time the cablegram grave though it was was almost a relief he was now safe from bullets anyway and yetthis enteric was a virulent disease the times was full of deaths therefrom why could he not be lying out there in that upcountry hospital and his boy safe at home the unforsytean selfsacrifice of his three children indeed had quite bewildered jolyon he would eagerly change places with jolly because he loved his boy but no such personal motive was influencing them he could only think that it marked the decline of the forsyte type  late that afternoon holly came out to him under the old oaktree she had grown up very much during these last months of hospital training away from home and seeing her approach he thought she has more sense than june child though she is more wisdom thank god she isnt going out she had seated herself in the swing very silent and still she feels this thought jolyon as much as i and seeing her eyes fixed on him he said dont take it to heart too much my child if he werent ill he might be in much greater danger  holly got out of the swing  i want to tell you something dad it was through me that jolly enlisted and went out  hows that  when you were away in paris val dartie and i fell in love we used to ride in richmond park we got engaged jolly found it out and thought he ought to stop it so he dared val to enlist it was all my fault dad and i want to go out too because if anything happens to either of them i should feel awful besides im just as much trained as june  jolyon gazed at her in a stupefaction that was tinged with irony so this was the answer to the riddle he had been asking himself and his three children were forsytes after all surely holly might have told him all this before but he smothered the sarcastic sayings on his lips tenderness to the young was perhaps the most sacred article of his belief he had got no doubt what he deserved engaged so this was why he had so lost touch with her and to young val dartienephew of soamesin the other camp it was all terribly distasteful he closed his easel and set his drawing against the tree  have you told june  yes she says shell get me into her cabin somehow its a single cabin but one of us could sleep on the floor if you consent shell go up now and get permission  consent thought jolyon rather late in the day to ask for that but again he checked himself  youre too young my dear they wont let you  june knows some people that she helped to go to cape town if they wont let me nurse yet i could stay with them and go on training there let me go dad  jolyon smiled because he could have cried  i never stop anyone from doing anything he said  holly flung her arms round his neck  oh dad you are the best in the world  that means the worst thought jolyon if he had ever doubted his creed of tolerance he did so then  im not friendly with vals family he said and i dont know val but jolly didnt like him  holly looked at the distance and said  i love him  that settles it said jolyon dryly then catching the expression on her face he kissed her with the thought is anything more pathetic than the faith of the young unless he actually forbade her going it was obvious that he must make the best of it so he went up to town with june whether due to her persistence or the fact that the official they saw was an old school friend of jolyons they obtained permission for holly to share the single cabin he took them to surbiton station the following evening and they duly slid away from him provided with money invalid foods and those letters of credit without which forsytes do not travel  he drove back to robin hill under a brilliant sky to his late dinner served with an added care by servants trying to show him that they sympathised eaten with an added scrupulousness to show them that he appreciated their sympathy but it was a real relief to get to his cigar on the terrace of flagstonescunningly chosen by young bosinney for shape and colourwith night closing in around him so beautiful a night hardly whispering in the trees and smelling so sweet that it made him ache the grass was drenched with dew and he kept to those flagstones up and down till presently it began to seem to him that he was one of three not wheeling but turning right about at each end so that his father was always nearest to the house and his son always nearest to the terrace edge each had an arm lightly within his arm he dared not lift his hand to his cigar lest he should disturb them and it burned away dripping ash on him till it dropped from his lips at last which were getting hot they left him then and his arms felt chilly three jolyons in one jolyon they had walked  he stood still counting the soundsa carriage passing on the highroad a distant train the dog at gages farm the whispering trees the groom playing on his penny whistle a multitude of stars up therebright and silent so far off no moon as yet just enough light to show him the dark flags and swords of the iris flowers along the terrace edgehis favourite flower that had the nights own colour on its curving crumpled petals he turned round to the house big unlighted not a soul beside himself to live in all that part of it stark loneliness he could not go on living here alone and yet so long as there was beauty why should a man feel lonely the answeras to some idiots riddlewas because he did the greater the beauty the greater the loneliness for at the back of beauty was harmony and at the back of harmony wasunion beauty could not comfort if the soul were out of it the night maddeningly lovely with bloom of grapes on it in starshine and the breath of grass and honey coming from it he could not enjoy while she who was to him the life of beauty its embodiment and essence was cut off from him utterly cut off now he felt by honourable decency  he made a poor fist of sleeping striving too hard after that resignation which forsytes find difficult to reach bred to their own way and left so comfortably off by their fathers but after dawn he dozed off and soon was dreaming a strange dream  he was on a stage with immensely high rich curtainshigh as the very starsstretching in a semicircle from footlights to footlights he himself was very small a little black restless figure roaming up and down and the odd thing was that he was not altogether himself but soames as well so that he was not only experiencing but watching this figure of himself and soames was trying to find a way out through the curtains which heavy and dark kept him in several times he had crossed in front of them before he saw with delight a sudden narrow rifta tall chink of beauty the colour of iris flowers like a glimpse of paradise remote ineffable stepping quickly forward to pass into it he found the curtains closing before him bitterly disappointed heor was it soamesmoved on and there was the chink again through the parted curtains which again closed too soon this went on and on and he never got through till he woke with the word irene on his lips the dream disturbed him badly especially that identification of himself with soames  next morning finding it impossible to work he spent hours riding jollys horse in search of fatigue and on the second day he made up his mind to move to london and see if he could not get permission to follow his daughters to south africa he had just begun to pack the following morning when he received this letter   green hotel  june 13  richmond  my dear jolyon  you will be surprised to see how near i am to you paris became impossibleand i have come here to be within reach of your advice i would so love to see you again since you left paris i dont think i have met anyone i could really talk to is all well with you and with your boy no one knows i think that i am here at present  always your friend  irene   irene within three miles of himand again in flight he stood with a very queer smile on his lips this was more than he had bargained for  about noon he set out on foot across richmond park and as he went along he thought richmond park by jove it suits us forsytes not that forsytes lived therenobody lived there save royalty rangers and the deerbut in richmond park nature was allowed to go so far and no further putting up a brave show of being natural seeming to say look at my instinctsthey are almost passions very nearly out of hand but not quite of course the very hub of possession is to possess oneself yes richmond park possessed itself even on that bright day of june with arrowy cuckoos shifting the treepoints of their calls and the wood doves announcing high summer  the green hotel which jolyon entered at one oclock stood nearly opposite that more famous hostelry the crown and sceptre it was modest highly respectable never out of cold beef gooseberry tart and a dowager or two so that a carriage and pair was almost always standing before the door  in a room draped in chintz so slippery as to forbid all emotion irene was sitting on a piano stool covered with crewel work playing hansel and gretel out of an old score above her on a wall not yet morrispapered was a print of the queen on a pony amongst deerhounds scotch caps and slain stags beside her in a pot on the windowsill was a white and rosy fuchsia the victorianism of the room almost talked and in her clinging frock irene seemed to jolyon like venus emerging from the shell of the past century  if the proprietor had eyes he said he would show you the door you have broken through his decorations thus lightly he smothered up an emotional moment having eaten cold beef pickled walnut gooseberry tart and drunk stonebottle gingerbeer they walked into the park and light talk was succeeded by the silence jolyon had dreaded  you havent told me about paris he said at last  no ive been shadowed for a long time one gets used to that but then soames came by the little niobethe same story would i go back to him  incredible  she had spoken without raising her eyes but she looked up now those dark eyes clinging to his said as no words could have i have come to an end if you want me here i am  for sheer emotional intensity had he everold as he waspassed through such a moment  the words irene i adore you almost escaped him then with a clearness of which he would not have believed mental vision capable he saw jolly lying with a white face turned to a white wall  my boy is very ill out there he said quietly  irene slipped her arm through his  lets walk on i understand  no miserable explanation to attempt she had understood and they walked on among the bracken kneehigh already between the rabbitholes and the oaktrees talking of jolly he left her two hours later at the richmond hill gate and turned towards home  she knows of my feeling for her then he thought of course one could not keep knowledge of that from such a woman     chapter ivover the river  jolly was tired to death of dreams they had left him now too wan and weak to dream again left him to lie torpid faintly remembering faroff things just able to turn his eyes and gaze through the window near his cot at the trickle of river running by in the sands at the straggling milkbush of the karoo beyond he knew what the karoo was now even if he had not seen a boer roll over like a rabbit or heard the whine of flying bullets this pestilence had sneaked on him before he had smelled powder a thirsty day and a rash drink or perhaps a tainted fruitwho knew not he who had not even strength left to grudge the evil thing its victoryjust enough to know that there were many lying here with him that he was sore with frenzied dreaming just enough to watch that thread of river and be able to remember faintly those faraway things  the sun was nearly down it would be cooler soon he would have liked to know the timeto feel his old watch so buttersmooth to hear the repeater strike it would have been friendly homelike he had not even strength to remember that the old watch was last wound the day he began to lie here the pulse of his brain beat so feebly that faces which came and went nurses doctors orderlys were indistinguishable just one indifferent face and the words spoken about him meant all the same thing and that almost nothing those things he used to do though far and faint were more distinctwalking past the foot of the old steps at harrow billhere sir here sirwrapping boots in the westminster gazette greenish paper shining bootsgrandfather coming from somewhere darka smell of earththe mushroom house robin hill burying poor old balthasar in the leaves dad home  consciousness came again with noticing that the river had no water in itsomeone was speaking too want anything no what could one want too weak to wantonly to hear his watch strike  holly she wouldnt bowl properly oh pitch them up not sneaks back her two and bow he was two consciousness came once more with a sense of the violet dusk outside and a rising bloodred crescent moon his eyes rested on it fascinated in the long minutes of brainnothingness it went moving up and up  hes going doctor not pack boots again never mind your form two dont cry go quietlyover the riversleep dark if somebody wouldstrikehiswatch     chapter vsoames acts  a sealed letter in the handwriting of mr polteed remained unopened in soames pocket throughout two hours of sustained attention to the affairs of the new colliery company which declining almost from the moment of old jolyons retirement from the chairmanship had lately run down so fast that there was now nothing for it but a windingup he took the letter out to lunch at his city club sacred to him for the meals he had eaten there with his father in the early seventies when james used to like him to come and see for himself the nature of his future life  here in a remote corner before a plate of roast mutton and mashed potato he read   dear sir  in accordance with your suggestion we have duly taken the matter up at the other end with gratifying results observation of 47 has enabled us to locate 17 at the green hotel richmond the two have been observed to meet daily during the past week in richmond park nothing absolutely crucial has so far been notified but in conjunction with what we had from paris at the beginning of the year i am confident we could now satisfy the court we shall of course continue to watch the matter until we hear from you  very faithfully yours  claud polteed   soames read it through twice and beckoned to the waiter  take this away its cold  shall i bring you some more sir  no get me some coffee in the other room  and paying for what he had not eaten he went out passing two acquaintances without sign of recognition  satisfy the court he thought sitting at a little round marble table with the coffee before him that fellow jolyon he poured out his coffee sweetened and drank it he would disgrace him in the eyes of his own children and rising with that resolution hot within him he found for the first time the inconvenience of being his own solicitor he could not treat this scandalous matter in his own office he must commit the soul of his private dignity to a stranger some other professional dealer in family dishonour who was there he could go to linkman and laver in budge row perhapsreliable not too conspicuous only nodding acquaintances but before he saw them he must see polteed again but at this thought soames had a moment of sheer weakness to part with his secret how find the words how subject himself to contempt and secret laughter yet after all the fellow knew alreadyoh yes he knew and feeling that he must finish with it now he took a cab into the west end  in this hot weather the window of mr polteeds room was positively open and the only precaution was a wire gauze preventing the intrusion of flies two or three had tried to come in and been caught so that they seemed to be clinging there with the intention of being devoured presently mr polteed following the direction of his clients eye rose apologetically and closed the window  posing ass thought soames like all who fundamentally believe in themselves he was rising to the occasion and with his little sideway smile he said ive had your letter im going to act i suppose you know who the lady youve been watching really is mr polteeds expression at that moment was a masterpiece it so clearly said well what do you think but mere professional knowledge i assure youpray forgive it he made a little half airy movement with his hand as who should say such thingssuch things will happen to us all  very well then said soames moistening his lips theres no need to say more im instructing linkman and laver of budge row to act for me i dont want to hear your evidence but kindly make your report to them at five oclock and continue to observe the utmost secrecy  mr polteed half closed his eyes as if to comply at once my dear sir he said  are you convinced asked soames with sudden energy that there is enough  the faintest movement occurred to mr polteeds shoulders  you can risk it he murmured with what we have and human nature you can risk it  soames rose you will ask for mr linkman thanks dont get up he could not bear mr polteed to slide as usual between him and the door in the sunlight of piccadilly he wiped his forehead this had been the worst of ithe could stand the strangers better and he went back into the city to do what still lay before him  that evening in park lane watching his father dine he was overwhelmed by his old longing for a sona son to watch him eat as he went down the years to be taken on his knee as james on a time had been wont to take him a son of his own begetting who could understand him because he was the same flesh and bloodunderstand and comfort him and become more rich and cultured than himself because he would start even better off to get oldlike that thin grey wiryfrail figure sitting thereand be quite alone with possessions heaping up around him to take no interest in anything because it had no future and must pass away from him to hands and mouths and eyes for whom he cared no jot no he would force it through now and be free to marry and have a son to care for him before he grew to be like the old old man his father wistfully watching now his sweetbread now his son  in that mood he went up to bed but lying warm between those fine linen sheets of emilys providing he was visited by memories and torture visions of irene almost the solid feeling of her body beset him why had he ever been fool enough to see her again and let this flood back on him so that it was pain to think of her with that fellowthat stealing fellow     chapter via summer day  his boy was seldom absent from jolyons mind in the days which followed the first walk with irene in richmond park no further news had come enquiries at the war office elicited nothing nor could he expect to hear from june and holly for three weeks at least in these days he felt how insufficient were his memories of jolly and what an amateur of a father he had been there was not a single memory in which anger played a part not one reconciliation because there had never been a rupture nor one hearttoheart confidence not even when jollys mother died nothing but halfironical affection he had been too afraid of committing himself in any direction for fear of losing his liberty or interfering with that of his boy  only in irenes presence had he relief highly complicated by the evergrowing perception of how divided he was between her and his son with jolly was bound up all that sense of continuity and social creed of which he had drunk deeply in his youth and again during his boys public school and varsity lifeall that sense of not going back on what father and son expected of each other with irene was bound up all his delight in beauty and in nature and he seemed to know less and less which was the stronger within him from such sentimental paralysis he was rudely awakened however one afternoon just as he was starting off to richmond by a young man with a bicycle and a face oddly familiar who came forward faintly smiling  mr jolyon forsyte thank you placing an envelope in jolyons hand he wheeled off the path and rode away bewildered jolyon opened it  admiralty probate and divorce forsyte v forsyte and forsyte  a sensation of shame and disgust was followed by the instant reaction why heres the very thing you want and you dont like it but she must have had one too and he must go to her at once he turned things over as he went along it was an ironical business for whatever the scriptures said about the heart it took more than mere longings to satisfy the law they could perfectly well defend this suit or at least in good faith try to but the idea of doing so revolted jolyon if not her lover in deed he was in desire and he knew that she was ready to come to him her face had told him so not that he exaggerated her feeling for him she had had her grand passion and he could not expect another from her at his age but she had trust in him affection for him and must feel that he would be a refuge surely she would not ask him to defend the suit knowing that he adored her thank heaven she had not that maddening british conscientiousness which refused happiness for the sake of refusing she must rejoice at this chance of being free after seventeen years of death in life as to publicity the fat was in the fire to defend the suit would not take away the slur jolyon had all the proper feeling of a forsyte whose privacy is threatened if he was to be hung by the law by all means let it be for a sheep moreover the notion of standing in a witness box and swearing to the truth that no gesture not even a word of love had passed between them seemed to him more degrading than to take the tacit stigma of being an adulterermore truly degrading considering the feeling in his heart and just as bad and painful for his children the thought of explaining away if he could before a judge and twelve average englishmen their meetings in paris and the walks in richmond park horrified him the brutality and hypocritical censoriousness of the whole process the probability that they would not be believedthe mere vision of her whom he looked on as the embodiment of nature and of beauty standing there before all those suspicious gloating eyes was hideous to him no no to defend a suit only made a london holiday and sold the newspapers a thousand times better accept what soames and the gods had sent  besides he thought honestly who knows whether even for my boys sake i could have stood this state of things much longer anyway her neck will be out of chancery at last thus absorbed he was hardly conscious of the heavy heat the sky had become overcast purplish with little streaks of white a heavy heatdrop plashed a little star pattern in the dust of the road as he entered the park phew he thought thunder i hope shes not come to meet me theres a ducking up there but at that very minute he saw irene coming towards the gate we must scuttle back to robin hill he thought                     the storm had passed over the poultry at four oclock bringing welcome distraction to the clerks in every office soames was drinking a cup of tea when a note was brought in to him   dear sir  forsyte v forsyte and forsyte  in accordance with your instructions we beg to inform you that we personally served the respondent and corespondent in this suit today at richmond and robin hill respectively  faithfully yours  linkman and laver   for some minutes soames stared at that note ever since he had given those instructions he had been tempted to annul them it was so scandalous such a general disgrace the evidence too what he had heard of it had never seemed to him conclusive somehow he believed less and less that those two had gone all lengths but this of course would drive them to it and he suffered from the thought that fellow to have her love where he had failed was it too late now that they had been brought up sharp by service of this petition had he not a lever with which he could force them apart but if i dont act at once he thought it will be too late now theyve had this thing ill go and see him ill go down  and sick with nervous anxiety he sent out for one of the newfangled motorcabs it might take a long time to run that fellow to ground and goodness knew what decision they might come to after such a shock if i were a theatrical ass he thought i suppose i should be taking a horsewhip or a pistol or something he took instead a bundle of papers in the case of magentie versus wake intending to read them on the way down he did not even open them but sat quite still jolted and jarred unconscious of the draught down the back of his neck or the smell of petrol he must be guided by the fellows attitude the great thing was to keep his head  london had already begun to disgorge its workers as he neared putney bridge the antheap was on the move outwards what a lot of ants all with a living to get holding on by their eyelids in the great scramble perhaps for the first time in his life soames thought i could let go if i liked nothing could touch me i could snap my fingers live as i wishedenjoy myself no one could not live as he had and just drop it allsettle down in capua to spend the money and reputation he had made a mans life was what he possessed and sought to possess only fools thought otherwisefools and socialists and libertines  the cab was passing villas now going a great pace fifteen miles an hour i should think he mused thisll take people out of town to live and he thought of its bearing on the portions of london owned by his fatherhe himself had never taken to that form of investment the gambler in him having all the outlet needed in his pictures and the cab sped on down the hill past wimbledon common this interview surely a man of fiftytwo with grownup children and hung on the line would not be reckless he wont want to disgrace the family he thought he was as fond of his father as i am of mine and they were brothers that woman brings destructionwhat is it in her ive never known the cab branched off along the side of a wood and he heard a late cuckoo calling almost the first he had heard that year he was now almost opposite the site he had originally chosen for his house and which had been so unceremoniously rejected by bosinney in favour of his own choice he began passing his handkerchief over his face and hands taking deep breaths to give him steadiness keep ones head he thought keep ones head  the cab turned in at the drive which might have been his own and the sound of music met him he had forgotten the fellows daughters  i may be out again directly he said to the driver or i may be kept some time and he rang the bell  following the maid through the curtains into the inner hall he felt relieved that the impact of this meeting would be broken by june or holly whichever was playing in there so that with complete surprise he saw irene at the piano and jolyon sitting in an armchair listening they both stood up blood surged into soames brain and all his resolution to be guided by this or that left him utterly the look of his farmer forbearsdogged forsytes down by the sea from superior dosset backgrinned out of his face  very pretty he said  he heard the fellow murmur  this is hardly the placewell go to the study if you dont mind and they both passed him through the curtain opening in the little room to which he followed them irene stood by the open window and the fellow close to her by a big chair soames pulled the door to behind him with a slam the sound carried him back all those years to the day when he had shut out jolyonshut him out for meddling with his affairs  well he said what have you to say for yourselves  the fellow had the effrontery to smile  what we have received today has taken away your right to ask i should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery  oh said soames you think so i came to tell you that ill divorce her with every circumstance of disgrace to you both unless you swear to keep clear of each other from now on  he was astonished at his fluency because his mind was stammering and his hands twitching neither of them answered but their faces seemed to him as if contemptuous  well he said youirene  her lips moved but jolyon laid his hand on her arm  let her alone said soames furiously irene will you swear it  no  oh and you  still less  so then youre guilty are you  yes guilty it was irene speaking in that serene voice with that unreached air which had maddened him so often and carried beyond himself he cried  you are a devil  go out leave this house or ill do you an injury  that fellow to talk of injuries did he know how near his throat was to being scragged  a trustee he said embezzling trust property a thief stealing his cousins wife  call me what you like you have chosen your part we have chosen ours go out  if he had brought a weapon soames might have used it at that moment  ill make you pay he said  i shall be very happy  at that deadly turning of the meaning of his speech by the son of him who had nicknamed him the man of property soames stood glaring it was ridiculous  there they were kept from violence by some secret force no blow possible no words to meet the case but he could not did not know how to turn and go away his eyes fastened on irenes facethe last time he would ever see that fatal facethe last time no doubt  you he said suddenly i hope youll treat him as you treated methats all  he saw her wince and with a sensation not quite triumph not quite relief he wrenched open the door passed out through the hall and got into his cab he lolled against the cushion with his eyes shut never in his life had he been so near to murderous violence never so thrown away the restraint which was his second nature he had a stripped and naked feeling as if all virtue had gone out of himlife meaningless mindstriking work sunlight streamed in on him but he felt cold the scene he had passed through had gone from him already what was before him would not materialise he could catch on to nothing and he felt frightened as if he had been hanging over the edge of a precipice as if with another turn of the screw sanity would have failed him im not fit for it he thought i mustntim not fit for it the cab sped on and in mechanical procession trees houses people passed but had no significance i feel very queer he thought ill take a turkish bathive been very near to something it wont do the cab whirred its way back over the bridge up the fulham road along the park  to the hammam said soames  curious that on so warm a summer day heat should be so comforting crossing into the hot room he met george forsyte coming out red and glistening  hallo said george what are you training for youve not got much superfluous  buffoon soames passed him with his sideway smile lying back rubbing his skin uneasily for the first signs of perspiration he thought let them laugh i wont feel anything i cant stand violence its not good for me     chapter viia summer night  soames left dead silence in the little study thank you for that good lie said jolyon suddenly come outthe air in here is not what it was  in front of a long high southerly wall on which were trained peachtrees the two walked up and down in silence old jolyon had planted some cupressustrees at intervals between this grassy terrace and the dipping meadow full of buttercups and oxeyed daisies for twelve years they had flourished till their dark spiral shapes had quite a look of italy birds fluttered softly in the wet shrubbery the swallows swooped past with a steelblue sheen on their swift little bodies the grass felt springy beneath the feet its green refreshed butterflies chased each other after that painful scene the quiet of nature was wonderfully poignant under the sunsoaked wall ran a narrow strip of gardenbed full of mignonette and pansies and from the bees came a low hum in which all other sounds were setthe mooing of a cow deprived of her calf the calling of a cuckoo from an elmtree at the bottom of the meadow who would have thought that behind them within ten miles london beganthat london of the forsytes with its wealth its misery its dirt and noise its jumbled stone isles of beauty its grey sea of hideous brick and stucco that london which had seen irenes early tragedy and jolyons own hard days that web that princely workhouse of the possessive instinct  and while they walked jolyon pondered those words i hope youll treat him as you treated me that would depend on himself could he trust himself did nature permit a forsyte not to make a slave of what he adored could beauty be confided to him or should she not be just a visitor coming when she would possessed for moments which passed to return only at her own choosing we are a breed of spoilers thought jolyon close and greedy the bloom of life is not safe with us let her come to me as she will when she will not at all if she will not let me be just her standby her perchingplace nevernever her cage  she was the chink of beauty in his dream was he to pass through the curtains now and reach her was the rich stuff of many possessions the close encircling fabric of the possessive instinct walling in that little black figure of himself and soameswas it to be rent so that he could pass through into his vision find there something not of the senses only let me he thought ah let me only know how not to grasp and destroy  but at dinner there were plans to be made tonight she would go back to the hotel but tomorrow he would take her up to london he must instruct his solicitorjack herring not a finger must be raised to hinder the process of the law damages exemplary judicial strictures costs what they likedlet it go through at the first moment so that her neck might be out of chancery at last tomorrow he would see herringthey would go and see him together and thenabroad leaving no doubt no difficulty about evidence making the lie she had told into the truth he looked round at her and it seemed to his adoring eyes that more than a woman was sitting there the spirit of universal beauty deep mysterious which the old painters titian giorgione botticelli had known how to capture and transfer to the faces of their womenthis flying beauty seemed to him imprinted on her brow her hair her lips and in her eyes  and this is to be mine he thought it frightens me  after dinner they went out on to the terrace to have coffee they sat there long the evening was so lovely watching the summer night come very slowly on it was still warm and the air smelled of lime blossomearly this summer two bats were flighting with the faint mysterious little noise they make he had placed the chairs in front of the study window and moths flew past to visit the discreet light in there there was no wind and not a whisper in the old oaktree twenty yards away the moon rose from behind the copse nearly full and the two lights struggled till moonlight conquered changing the colour and quality of all the garden stealing along the flagstones reaching their feet climbing up changing their faces  well said jolyon at last youll be tired dear wed better start the maid will show you hollys room and he rang the study bell the maid who came handed him a telegram watching her take irene away he thought this must have come an hour or more ago and she didnt bring it out to us that shows well well be hung for a sheep soon and opening the telegram he read  jolyon forsyte robin hillyour son passed painlessly away on june 20th deep sympathysome name unknown to him  he dropped it spun round stood motionless the moon shone in on him a moth flew in his face the first day of all that he had not thought almost ceaselessly of jolly he went blindly towards the window struck against the old armchairhis fathersand sank down on to the arm of it he sat there huddled forward staring into the night gone out like a candle flame far from home from love all by himself in the dark his boy from a little chap always so good to himso friendly twenty years old and cut down like grassto have no life at all i didnt really know him he thought and he didnt know me but we loved each other its only love that matters  to die out therelonelywanting themwanting home this seemed to his forsyte heart more painful more pitiful than death itself no shelter no protection no love at the last and all the deeply rooted clanship in him the family feeling and essential clinging to his own flesh and blood which had been so strong in old jolyon was so strong in all the forsytesfelt outraged cut and torn by his boys lonely passing better far if he had died in battle without time to long for them to come to him to call out for them perhaps in his delirium  the moon had passed behind the oaktree now endowing it with uncanny life so that it seemed watching himthe oaktree his boy had been so fond of climbing out of which he had once fallen and hurt himself and hadnt cried  the door creaked he saw irene come in pick up the telegram and read it he heard the faint rustle of her dress she sank on her knees close to him and he forced himself to smile at her she stretched up her arms and drew his head down on her shoulder the perfume and warmth of her encircled him her presence gained slowly his whole being     chapter viiijames in waiting  sweated to serenity soames dined at the remove and turned his face toward park lane his father had been unwell lately this would have to be kept from him never till that moment had he realised how much the dread of bringing james grey hairs down with sorrow to the grave had counted with him how intimately it was bound up with his own shrinking from scandal his affection for his father always deep had increased of late years with the knowledge that james looked on him as the real prop of his decline it seemed pitiful that one who had been so careful all his life and done so much for the family nameso that it was almost a byword for solid wealthy respectabilityshould at his last gasp have to see it in all the newspapers this was like lending a hand to death that final enemy of forsytes i must tell mother he thought and when it comes on we must keep the papers from him somehow he sees hardly anyone letting himself in with his latchkey he was beginning to ascend he stairs when he became conscious of commotion on the secondfloor landing his mothers voice was saying  now james youll catch cold why cant you wait quietly  his fathers answering  wait im always waiting why doesnt he come in  you can speak to him tomorrow morning instead of making a guy of yourself on the landing  hell go up to bed i shouldnt wonder i shant sleep  now come back to bed james  um i might die before tomorrow morning for all you can tell  you shant have to wait till tomorrow morning ill go down and bring him up dont fuss  there you goalways so cockahoop he maynt come in at all  well if he doesnt come in you wont catch him by standing out here in your dressinggown  soames rounded the last bend and came in sight of his fathers tall figure wrapped in a brown silk quilted gown stooping over the balustrade above light fell on his silvery hair and whiskers investing his head with a sort of halo  here he is he heard him say in a voice which sounded injured and his mothers comfortable answer from the bedroom door  thats all right come in and ill brush your hair james extended a thin crooked finger oddly like the beckoning of a skeleton and passed through the doorway of his bedroom  what is it thought soames what has he got hold of now  his father was sitting before the dressingtable sideways to the mirror while emily slowly passed two silverbacked brushes through and through his hair she would do this several times a day for it had on him something of the effect produced on a cat by scratching between its ears  there you are he said ive been waiting  soames stroked his shoulder and taking up a silver buttonhook examined the mark on it  well he said youre looking better  james shook his head  i want to say something your mother hasnt heard he announced emilys ignorance of what he hadnt told her as if it were a grievance  your fathers been in a great state all the evening im sure i dont know what about  the faint whiskwhisk of the brushes continued the soothing of her voice  no you know nothing said james soames can tell me and fixing his grey eyes in which there was a look of strain uncomfortable to watch on his son he muttered  im getting on soames at my age i cant tell i might die any time therell be a lot of money theres rachel and cicely got no children and vals out therethat chap his father will get hold of all he can and somebodyll pick up imogen i shouldnt wonder  soames listened vaguelyhe had heard all this before whishwhish went the brushes  if thats all said emily  all cried james its nothing im coming to that and again his eyes strained pitifully at soames  its you my boy he said suddenly you ought to get a divorce  that word from those of all lips was almost too much for soames composure his eyes reconcentrated themselves quickly on the buttonhook and as if in apology james hurried on  i dont know whats become of herthey say shes abroad your uncle swithin used to admire herhe was a funny fellow so he always alluded to his dead twinthe stout and the lean of it they had been called she wouldnt be alone i should say and with that summingup of the effect of beauty on human nature he was silent watching his son with eyes doubting as a birds soames too was silent whishwhish went the brushes  come james soames knows best its his business  ah said james and the word came from deep down but theres all my money and theres hiswhos it to go to and when he dies the name goes out  soames replaced the buttonhook on the lace and pink silk of the dressingtable coverlet  the name said emily there are all the other forsytes  as if that helped me muttered james i shall be in my grave and therell be nobody unless he marries again  youre quite right said soames quietly im getting a divorce  james eyes almost started from his head  what he cried there nobody tells me anything  well said emily who would have imagined you wanted it my dear boy that is a surprise after all these years  itll be a scandal muttered james as if to himself but i cant help that dont brush so hard whenll it come on  before the long vacation its not defended  james lips moved in secret calculation i shant live to see my grandson he muttered  emily ceased brushing of course you will james soames will be as quick as he can  there was a long silence till james reached out his arm  here lets have the eaudecologne and putting it to his nose he moved his forehead in the direction of his son soames bent over and kissed that brow just where the hair began a relaxing quiver passed over james face as though the wheels of anxiety within were running down  ill get to bed he said i shant want to see the papers when that comes theyre a morbid lot i cant pay attention to them im too old  queerly affected soames went to the door he heard his father say  here im tired ill say a prayer in bed  and his mother answering  thats right james itll be ever so much more comfy     chapter ixout of the web  on forsyte change the announcement of jollys death among a batch of troopers caused mixed sensation strange to read that jolyon forsyte fifth of the name in direct descent had died of disease in the service of his country and not be able to feel it personally it revived the old grudge against his father for having estranged himself for such was still the prestige of old jolyon that the other forsytes could never quite feel as might have been expected that it was they who had cut off his descendants for irregularity the news increased of course the interest and anxiety about val but then vals name was dartie and even if he were killed in battle or got the victoria cross it would not be at all the same as if his name were forsyte not even casualty or glory to the haymans would be really satisfactory family pride felt defrauded  how the rumour arose then that something very dreadful my dear was pending no one least of all soames could tell secret as he kept everything possibly some eye had seen forsyte v forsyte and forsyte in the cause list and had added it to irene in paris with a fair beard possibly some wall at park lane had ears the fact remained that it was knownwhispered among the old discussed among the youngthat family pride must soon receive a blow  soames paying one of his sunday visits to timothyspaying it with the feeling that after the suit came on he would be paying no morefelt knowledge in the air as he came in nobody of course dared speak of it before him but each of the four other forsytes present held their breath aware that nothing could prevent aunt juley from making them all uncomfortable she looked so piteously at soames she checked herself on the point of speech so often that aunt hester excused herself and said she must go and bathe timothys eyehe had a sty coming soames impassive slightly supercilious did not stay long he went out with a curse stifled behind his pale just smiling lips  fortunately for the peace of his mind cruelly tortured by the coming scandal he was kept busy day and night with plans for his retirementfor he had come to that grim conclusion to go on seeing all those people who had known him as a longheaded chap an astute adviserafter thatno the fastidiousness and pride which was so strangely so inextricably blended in him with possessive obtuseness revolted against the thought he would retire live privately go on buying pictures make a great name as a collectorafter all his heart was more in that than it had ever been in law in pursuance of this now fixed resolve he had to get ready to amalgamate his business with another firm without letting people know for that would excite curiosity and make humiliation cast its shadow before he had pitched on the firm of cuthcott holliday and kingson two of whom were dead the full name after the amalgamation would therefore be cuthcott holliday kingson forsyte bustard and forsyte but after debate as to which of the dead still had any influence with the living it was decided to reduce the title to cuthcott kingson and forsyte of whom kingson would be the active and soames the sleeping partner for leaving his name prestige and clients behind him soames would receive considerable value  one night as befitted a man who had arrived at so important a stage of his career he made a calculation of what he was worth and after writing off liberally for depreciation by the war found his value to be some hundred and thirty thousand pounds at his fathers death which could not alas be delayed much longer he must come into at least another fifty thousand and his yearly expenditure at present just reached two standing among his pictures he saw before him a future full of bargains earned by the trained faculty of knowing better than other people selling what was about to decline keeping what was still going up and exercising judicious insight into future taste he would make a unique collection which at his death would pass to the nation under the title forsyte bequest  if the divorce went through he had determined on his line with madame lamotte she had he knew but one real ambitionto live on her renter in paris near her grandchildren he would buy the goodwill of the restaurant bretagne at a fancy price madame would live like a queenmother in paris on the interest invested as she would know how incidentally soames meant to put a capable manager in her place and make the restaurant pay good interest on his money there were great possibilities in soho on annette he would promise to settle fifteen thousand pounds whether designedly or not precisely the sum old jolyon had settled on that woman  a letter from jolyons solicitor to his own had disclosed the fact that those two were in italy and an opportunity had been duly given for noting that they had first stayed at an hotel in london the matter was clear as daylight and would be disposed of in half an hour or so but during that halfhour he soames would go down to hell and after that halfhour all bearers of the forsyte name would feel the bloom was off the rose he had no illusions like shakespeare that roses by any other name would smell as sweet the name was a possession a concrete unstained piece of property the value of which would be reduced some twenty per cent at least unless it were roger who had once refused to stand for parliament andoh ironyjolyon hung on the line there had never been a distinguished forsyte but that very lack of distinction was the names greatest asset it was a private name intensely individual and his own property it had never been exploited for good or evil by intrusive report he and each member of his family owned it wholly sanely secretly without any more interference from the public than had been necessitated by their births their marriages their deaths and during these weeks of waiting and preparing to drop the law he conceived for that law a bitter distaste so deeply did he resent its coming violation of his name forced on him by the need he felt to perpetuate that name in a lawful manner the monstrous injustice of the whole thing excited in him a perpetual suppressed fury he had asked no better than to live in spotless domesticity and now he must go into the witness box after all these futile barren years and proclaim his failure to keep his wifeincur the pity the amusement the contempt of his kind it was all upside down she and that fellow ought to be the sufferers and theywere in italy in these weeks the law he had served so faithfully looked on so reverently as the guardian of all property seemed to him quite pitiful what could be more insane than to tell a man that he owned his wife and punish him when someone unlawfully took her away from him did the law not know that a mans name was to him the apple of his eye that it was far harder to be regarded as cuckold than as seducer he actually envied jolyon the reputation of succeeding where he soames had failed the question of damages worried him too he wanted to make that fellow suffer but he remembered his cousins words i shall be very happy with the uneasy feeling that to claim damages would make not jolyon but himself suffer he felt uncannily that jolyon would rather like to pay themthe chap was so loose besides to claim damages was not the thing to do the claim indeed had been made almost mechanically and as the hour drew near soames saw in it just another dodge of this insensitive and topsyturvy law to make him ridiculous so that people might sneer and say oh yes he got quite a good price for her and he gave instructions that his counsel should state that the money would be given to a home for fallen women he was a long time hitting off exactly the right charity but having pitched on it he used to wake up in the night and think it wont do too lurid itll draw attention something quieterbetter taste he did not care for dogs or he would have named them and it was in desperation at lastfor his knowledge of charities was limitedthat he decided on the blind that could not be inappropriate and it would make the jury assess the damages high  a good many suits were dropping out of the list which happened to be exceptionally thin that summer so that his case would be reached before august as the day grew nearer winifred was his only comfort she showed the fellowfeeling of one who had been through the mill and was the femmesole in whom he confided well knowing that she would not let dartie into her confidence that ruffian would be only too rejoiced at the end of july on the afternoon before the case he went in to see her they had not yet been able to leave town because dartie had already spent their summer holiday and winifred dared not go to her father for more money while he was waiting not to be told anything about this affair of soames  soames found her with a letter in her hand  that from val he asked gloomily what does he say  he says hes married said winifred  whom to for goodness sake  winifred looked up at him  to holly forsyte jolyons daughter  what  he got leave and did it i didnt even know he knew her awkward isnt it  soames uttered a short laugh at that characteristic minimisation  awkward well i dont suppose theyll hear about this till they come back theyd better stay out there that fellow will give her money  but i want val back said winifred almost piteously i miss him he helps me to get on  i know murmured soames hows dartie behaving now  it might be worse but its always money would you like me to come down to the court tomorrow soames  soames stretched out his hand for hers the gesture so betrayed the loneliness in him that she pressed it between her two  never mind old boy youll feel ever so much better when its all over  i dont know what ive done said soames huskily i never have its all upside down i was fond of her ive always been  winifred saw a drop of blood ooze out of his lip and the sight stirred her profoundly  of course she said its been too bad of her all along but what shall i do about this marriage of vals soames i dont know how to write to him with this coming on youve seen that child is she pretty  yes shes pretty said soames darkladylike enough  that doesnt sound so bad thought winifred jolyon had style  it is a coil she said what will father say  mustnt be told said soames the warll soon be over now youd better let val take to farming out there  it was tantamount to saying that his nephew was lost  i havent told monty winifred murmured desolately  the case was reached before noon next day and was over in little more than half an hour soamespale spruce sadeyed in the witnessboxhad suffered so much beforehand that he took it all like one dead the moment the decree nisi was pronounced he left the courts of justice  four hours until he became public property solicitors divorce suit a surly dogged anger replaced that dead feeling within him damn them all he thought i wont run away ill act as if nothing had happened and in the sweltering heat of fleet street and ludgate hill he walked all the way to his city club lunched and went back to his office he worked there stolidly throughout the afternoon  on his way out he saw that his clerks knew and answered their involuntary glances with a look so sardonic that they were immediately withdrawn in front of st pauls he stopped to buy the most gentlemanly of the evening papers yes there he was wellknown solicitors divorce cousin corespondent damages given to the blindso they had got that in at every other face he thought i wonder if you know and suddenly he felt queer as if something were racing round in his head  what was this he was letting it get hold of him he mustnt he would be ill he mustnt think he would get down to the river and row about and fish im not going to be laid up he thought  it flashed across him that he had something of importance to do before he went out of town madame lamotte he must explain the law another six months before he was really free only he did not want to see annette and he passed his hand over the top of his headit was very hot  he branched off through covent garden on this sultry day of late july the garbagetainted air of the old market offended him and soho seemed more than ever the disenchanted home of rapscallionism alone the restaurant bretagne neat daintily painted with its blue tubs and the dwarf trees therein retained an aloof and frenchified selfrespect it was the slack hour and pale trim waitresses were preparing the little tables for dinner soames went through into the private part to his discomfiture annette answered his knock she too looked pale and dragged down by the heat  you are quite a stranger she said languidly  soames smiled  i havent wished to be ive been busy  wheres your mother annette ive got some news for her  mother is not in  it seemed to soames that she looked at him in a queer way what did she know how much had her mother told her the worry of trying to make that out gave him an alarming feeling in the head he gripped the edge of the table and dizzily saw annette come forward her eyes clear with surprise he shut his own and said  its all right ive had a touch of the sun i think the sun what he had was a touch of darkness annettes voice french and composed said  sit down it will pass then her hand pressed his shoulder and soames sank into a chair when the dark feeling dispersed and he opened his eyes she was looking down at him what an inscrutable and odd expression for a girl of twenty  do you feel better  its nothing said soames instinct told him that to be feeble before her was not helping himage was enough handicap without that willpower was his fortune with annette he had lost ground these latter months from indecisionhe could not afford to lose any more he got up and said  ill write to your mother im going down to my river house for a long holiday i want you both to come there presently and stay its just at its best you will wont you  it will be veree nice a pretty little roll of that r but no enthusiasm and rather sadly he added  youre feeling the heat too arent you annette itll do you good to be on the river goodnight annette swayed forward there was a sort of compunction in the movement  are you fit to go shall i give you some coffee  no said soames firmly give me your hand  she held out her hand and soames raised it to his lips when he looked up her face wore again that strange expression i cant tell he thought as he went out but i mustnt thinki mustnt worry  but worry he did walking toward pall mall english not of her religion middleaged scarred as it were by domestic tragedy what had he to give her only wealth social position leisure admiration it was much but was it enough for a beautiful girl of twenty he felt so ignorant about annette he had too a curious fear of the french nature of her mother and herself they knew so well what they wanted they were almost forsytes they would never grasp a shadow and miss a substance  the tremendous effort it was to write a simple note to madame lamotte when he reached his club warned him still further that he was at the end of his tether   my dear madame he said  you will see by the enclosed newspaper cutting that i obtained my decree of divorce today by the english law i shall not however be free to marry again till the decree is confirmed six months hence in the meanwhile i have the honor to ask to be considered a formal suitor for the hand of your daughter i shall write again in a few days and beg you both to come and stay at my river house  i am dear madame  sincerely yours  soames forsyte   having sealed and posted this letter he went into the diningroom three mouthfuls of soup convinced him that he could not eat and causing a cab to be summoned he drove to paddington station and took the first train to reading he reached his house just as the sun went down and wandered out on to the lawn the air was drenched with the scent of pinks and picotees in his flowerborders a stealing coolness came off the river  restpeace let a poor fellow rest let not worry and shame and anger chase like evil nightbirds in his head like those doves perched halfsleeping on their dovecot like the furry creatures in the woods on the far side and the simple folk in their cottages like the trees and the river itself whitening fast in twilight like the darkening cornflowerblue sky where stars were coming uplet him cease from himself and rest     chapter xpassing of an age  the marriage of soames with annette took place in paris on the last day of january 1901 with such privacy that not even emily was told until it was accomplished  the day after the wedding he brought her to one of those quiet hotels in london where greater expense can be incurred for less result than anywhere else under heaven her beauty in the best parisian frocks was giving him more satisfaction than if he had collected a perfect bit of china or a jewel of a picture he looked forward to the moment when he would exhibit her in park lane in green street and at timothys  if some one had asked him in those days in confidenceare you in love with this girl he would have replied in love what is love if you mean do i feel to her as i did towards irene in those old days when i first met her and she would not have me when i sighed and starved after her and couldnt rest a minute until she yieldedno if you mean do i admire her youth and prettiness do my senses ache a little when i see her moving aboutyes do i think she will keep me straight make me a creditable wife and a good mother for my childrenagain yes  what more do i need and what more do threequarters of the women who are married get from the men who marry them and if the enquirer had pursued his query and do you think it was fair to have tempted this girl to give herself to you for life unless you have really touched her heart he would have answered the french see these things differently from us they look at marriage from the point of view of establishments and children and from my own experience i am not at all sure that theirs is not the sensible view i shall not expect this time more than i can get or she can give years hence i shouldnt be surprised if i have trouble with her but i shall be getting old i shall have children by then i shall shut my eyes i have had my great passion hers is perhaps to comei dont suppose it will be for me i offer her a great deal and i dont expect much in return except children or at least a son but one thing i am sure ofshe has very good sense  and if insatiate the enquirer had gone on you do not look then for spiritual union in this marriage soames would have lifted his sideway smile and rejoined thats as it may be if i get satisfaction for my senses perpetuation of myself good taste and good humour in the house it is all i can expect at my age i am not likely to be going out of my way towards any farfetched sentimentalism whereon the enquirer must in good taste have ceased enquiry  the queen was dead and the air of the greatest city upon earth grey with unshed tears furcoated and tophatted with annette beside him in dark furs soames crossed park lane on the morning of the funeral procession to the rails in hyde park little moved though he ever was by public matters this event supremely symbolical this summingup of a long rich period impressed his fancy in 37 when she came to the throne superior dosset was still building houses to make london hideous and james a stripling of twentysix just laying the foundations of his practice in the law coaches still ran men wore stocks shaved their upper lips ate oysters out of barrels tigers swung behind cabriolets women said la and owned no property there were manners in the land and pigsties for the poor unhappy devils were hanged for little crimes and dickens had but just begun to write wellnigh two generations had slipped byof steamboats railways telegraphs bicycles electric light telephones and now these motorcarsof such accumulated wealth that eight per cent had become three and forsytes were numbered by the thousand morals had changed manners had changed men had become monkeys twiceremoved god had become mammonmammon so respectable as to deceive himself sixtyfour years that favoured property and had made the upper middle class buttressed chiselled polished it till it was almost indistinguishable in manners morals speech appearance habit and soul from the nobility an epoch which had gilded individual liberty so that if a man had money he was free in law and fact and if he had not money he was free in law and not in fact an era which had canonised hypocrisy so that to seem to be respectable was to be a great age whose transmuting influence nothing had escaped save the nature of man and the nature of the universe  and to witness the passing of this age londonits pet and fancywas pouring forth her citizens through every gate into hyde park hub of victorianism happy huntingground of forsytes under the grey heavens whose drizzle just kept off the dark concourse gathered to see the show the good old queen full of years and virtue had emerged from her seclusion for the last time to make a london holiday from houndsditch acton ealing hampstead islington and bethnal green from hackney hornsey leytonstone battersea and fulham and from those green pastures where forsytes flourishmayfair and kensington st james and belgravia bayswater and chelsea and the regents park the people swarmed down on to the roads where death would presently pass with dusky pomp and pageantry never again would a queen reign so long or people have a chance to see so much history buried for their money a pity the war dragged on and that the wreath of victory could not be laid upon her coffin all else would be there to follow and commemoratesoldiers sailors foreign princes halfmasted bunting tolling bells and above all the surging great darkcoated crowd with perhaps a simple sadness here and there deep in hearts beneath black clothes put on by regulation after all more than a queen was going to her rest a woman who had braved sorrow lived well and wisely according to her lights  out in the crowd against the railings with his arm hooked in annettes soames waited yes the age was passing what with this trade unionism and labour fellows in the house of commons with continental fiction and something in the general feel of everything not to be expressed in words things were very different he recalled the crowd on mafeking night and george forsyte saying theyre all socialists they want our goods like james soames didnt know he couldnt tellwith edward on the throne things would never be as safe again as under good old viccy convulsively he pressed his young wifes arm there at any rate was something substantially his own domestically certain again at last something which made property worth whilea real thing once more pressed close against her and trying to ward others off soames was content the crowd swayed round them ate sandwiches and dropped crumbs boys who had climbed the planetrees chattered above like monkeys threw twigs and orangepeel it was past time they should be coming soon and suddenly a little behind them to the left he saw a tallish man with a soft hat and short grizzling beard and a tallish woman in a little round fur cap and veil jolyon and irene talking smiling at each other close together like annette and himself they had not seen him and stealthily with a very queer feeling in his heart soames watched those two they looked happy what had they come here forinherently illicit creatures rebels from the victorian ideal what business had they in this crowd each of them twice exiled by moralitymaking a boast as it were of love and laxity he watched them fascinated admitting grudgingly even with his arm thrust through annettes thatthat sheireneno he would not admit it and he turned his eyes away he would not see them and let the old bitterness the old longing rise up within him and then annette turned to him and said those two people soames they know you i am sure who are they  soames nosed sideways  what people  there you see them just turning away they know you  no soames answered a mistake my dear  a lovely face and how she walk elle est tres distinguee  soames looked then into his life out of his life she had walked like that swaying and erect remote unseizable ever eluding the contact of his soul he turned abruptly from that receding vision of the past  youd better attend he said theyre coming now  but while he stood grasping her arm seemingly intent on the head of the procession he was quivering with the sense of always missing something with instinctive regret that he had not got them both  slow came the music and the march till in silence the long line wound in through the park gate he heard annette whisper how sad it is and beautiful felt the clutch of her hand as she stood up on tiptoe and the crowds emotion gripped him there it wasthe bier of the queen coffin of the age slow passing and as it went by there came a murmuring groan from all the long line of those who watched a sound such as soames had never heard so unconscious primitive deep and wild that neither he nor any knew whether they had joined in uttering it strange sound indeed tribute of an age to its own death ah ah the hold on life had slipped that which had seemed eternal was gone the queengod bless her  it moved on with the bier that travelling groan as a fire moves on over grass in a thin line it kept step and marched alongside down the dense crowds mile after mile it was a human sound and yet inhuman pushed out by animal subconsciousness by intimate knowledge of universal death and change none of usnone of us can hold on for ever  it left silence for a littlea very little time till tongues began eager to retrieve interest in the show soames lingered just long enough to gratify annette then took her out of the park to lunch at his fathers in park lane  james had spent the morning gazing out of his bedroom window the last show he would see last of so many so she was gone well she was getting an old woman swithin and he had seen her crownedslim slip of a girl not so old as imogen she had got very stout of late jolyon and he had seen her married to that german chap her husbandhe had turned out all right before he died and left her with that son of his and he remembered the many evenings he and his brothers and their cronies had wagged their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his salad days and now he had come to the throne they said he had steadied downhe didnt knowcouldnt tell hed make the money fly still he shouldnt wonder what a lot of people out there it didnt seem so very long since he and swithin stood in the crowd outside westminster abbey when she was crowned and swithin had taken him to cremorne afterwardsracketty chap swithin no it didnt seem much longer ago than jubilee year when he had joined with roger in renting a balcony in piccadilly  jolyon swithin roger all gone and he would be ninety in august and there was soames married again to a french girl the french were a queer lot but they made good mothers he had heard things changed they said this german emperor was here for the funeral his telegram to old kruger had been in shocking taste he should not be surprised if that chap made trouble some day change hm well they must look after themselves when he was gone he didnt know where hed be and now emily had asked dartie to lunch with winifred and imogen to meet soames wifeshe was always doing something and there was irene living with that fellow jolyon they said hed marry her now he supposed  my brother jolyon he thought what would he have said to it all and somehow the utter impossibility of knowing what his elder brother once so looked up to would have said so worried james that he got up from his chair by the window and began slowly feebly to pace the room  she was a pretty thing too he thought i was fond of her perhaps soames didnt suit heri dont knowi cant tell we never had any trouble with our wives women had changed everything had changed and now the queen was deadwell there it was a movement in the crowd brought him to a standstill at the window his nose touching the pane and whitening from the chill of it they had got her as far as hyde park cornerthey were passing now why didnt emily come up here where she could see instead of fussing about lunch he missed her at that momentmissed her through the bare branches of the planetrees he could just see the procession could see the hats coming off the peoples headsa lot of them would catch colds he shouldnt wonder a voice behind him said  youve got a capital view here james  there you are muttered james why didnt you come before you might have missed it  and he was silent staring with all his might  whats the noise he asked suddenly  theres no noise returned emily what are you thinking ofthey wouldnt cheer  i can hear it  nonsense james  no sound came through those double panes what james heard was the groaning in his own heart at sight of his age passing  dont you ever tell me where im buried he said suddenly i shant want to know and he turned from the window there she went the old queen shed had a lot of anxietyshed be glad to be out of it he should think  emily took up the hairbrushes  therell be just time to brush your head she said before they come you must look your best james  ah muttered james they say shes pretty  the meeting with his new daughterinlaw took place in the diningroom james was seated by the fire when she was brought in he placed his hands on the arms of the chair and slowly raised himself stooping and immaculate in his frockcoat thin as a line in euclid he received annettes hand in his and the anxious eyes of his furrowed face which had lost its colour now doubted above her a little warmth came into them and into his cheeks refracted from her bloom  how are you he said youve been to see the queen i suppose did you have a good crossing  in this way he greeted her from whom he hoped for a grandson of his name  gazing at him so old thin white and spotless annette murmured something in french which james did not understand  yes yes he said you want your lunch i expect soames ring the bell we wont wait for that chap dartie but just then they arrived dartie had refused to go out of his way to see the old girl with an early cocktail beside him he had taken a squint from the smokingroom of the iseeum so that winifred and imogen had been obliged to come back from the park to fetch him thence his brown eyes rested on annette with a stare of almost startled satisfaction the second beauty that fellow soames had picked up what women could see in him well she would play him the same trick as the other no doubt but in the meantime he was a lucky devil and he brushed up his moustache having in nine months of green street domesticity regained almost all his flesh and his assurance despite the comfortable efforts of emily winifreds composure imogens enquiring friendliness darties showingoff and james solicitude about her food it was not soames felt a successful lunch for his bride he took her away very soon  that monsieur dartie said annette in the cab je naime pas ce typela  no by george said soames  your sister is veree amiable and the girl is pretty your father is veree old i think your mother has trouble with him i should not like to be her  soames nodded at the shrewdness the clear hard judgment in his young wife but it disquieted him a little the thought may have just flashed through him too when im eighty shell be fiftyfive having trouble with me  theres just one other house of my relations i must take you to he said youll find it funny but we must get it over and then well dine and go to the theatre  in this way he prepared her for timothys but timothys was different they were delighted to see dear soames after this long long time and so this was annette  you are so pretty my dear almost too young and pretty for dear soames arent you but hes very attentive and carefulsuch a good hush aunt juley checked herself and placed her lips just under each of annettes eyesshe afterwards described them to francie who dropped in as cornflowerblue so pretty i quite wanted to kiss them i must say dear soames is a perfect connoisseur in her french way and not so very french either i think shes as prettythough not so distinguished not so alluringas irene because she was alluring wasnt she with that white skin and those dark eyes and that hair couleur dewhat was it i always forget  feuille morte francie prompted  of course dead leavesso strange i remember when i was a girl before we came to london we had a foxhound puppyto walk it was called then it had a tan top to its head and a white chest and beautiful dark brown eyes and it was a lady  yes auntie said francie but i dont see the connection  oh replied aunt juley rather flustered it was so alluring and her eyes and hair you know she was silent as if surprised in some indelicacy feuille morte she added suddenly hesterdo remember that  considerable debate took place between the two sisters whether timothy should or should not be summoned to see annette  oh dont bother said soames  but its no trouble only of course annettes being french might upset him a little he was so scared about fashoda i think perhaps we had better not run the risk hester its nice to have her all to ourselves isnt it and how are you soames have you quite got over your  hester interposed hurriedly  what do you think of london annette  soames disquieted awaited the reply it came sensible composed oh i know london i have visited before  he had never ventured to speak to her on the subject of the restaurant the french had different notions about gentility and to shrink from connection with it might seem to her ridiculous he had waited to be married before mentioning it and now he wished he hadnt  and what part do you know best said aunt juley  soho said annette simply  soames snapped his jaw  soho repeated aunt juley soho  thatll go round the family thought soames  its very french and interesting he said  yes murmured aunt juley your uncle roger had some houses there once he was always having to turn the tenants out i remember  soames changed the subject to mapledurham  of course said aunt juley you will be going down there soon to settle in we are all so looking forward to the time when annette has a dear little  juley cried aunt hester desperately ring tea  soames dared not wait for tea and took annette away  i shouldnt mention soho if i were you he said in the cab its rather a shady part of london and youre altogether above that restaurant business now i mean he added i want you to know nice people and the english are fearful snobs  annettes clear eyes opened a little smile came on her lips  yes she said  hm thought soames thats meant for me and he looked at her hard shes got good business instincts he thought i must make her grasp it once for all  look here annette its very simple only it wants understanding our professional and leisured classes still think themselves a cut above our business classes except of course the very rich it may be stupid but there it is you see it isnt advisable in england to let people know that you ran a restaurant or kept a shop or were in any kind of trade it may have been extremely creditable but it puts a sort of label on you you dont have such a good time or meet such nice peoplethats all  i see said annette it is the same in france  oh murmured soames at once relieved and taken aback of course class is everything really  yes said annette comme vous etes sage  thats all right thought soames watching her lips only shes pretty cynical his knowledge of french was not yet such as to make him grieve that she had not said tu he slipped his arm round her and murmured with an effort  et vous etes ma belle femme  annette went off into a little fit of laughter  oh non she said oh non ne parlez pas francais soames what is that old lady your aunt looking forward to  soames bit his lip god knows he said shes always saying something but he knew better than god     chapter xisuspended animation  the war dragged on nicholas had been heard to say that it would cost three hundred millions if it cost a penny before theyd done with it the incometax was seriously threatened still there would be south africa for their money once for all and though the possessive instinct felt badly shaken at three oclock in the morning it recovered by breakfasttime with the recollection that one gets nothing in this world without paying for it so on the whole people went about their business much as if there were no war no concentration camps no slippery de wet no feeling on the continent no anything unpleasant indeed the attitude of the nation was typified by timothys map whose animation was suspendedfor timothy no longer moved the flags and they could not move themselves not even backwards and forwards as they should have done  suspended animation went further it invaded forsyte change and produced a general uncertainty as to what was going to happen next the announcement in the marriage column of the times jolyon forsyte to irene only daughter of the late professor heron had occasioned doubt whether irene had been justly described and yet on the whole relief was felt that she had not been entered as irene late the wife or the divorced wife of soames forsyte altogether there had been a kind of sublimity from the first about the way the family had taken that affair as james had phrased it there it was no use to fuss nothing to be had out of admitting that it had been a nasty jarin the phraseology of the day  but what would happen now that both soames and jolyon were married again that was very intriguing george was known to have laid eustace six to four on a little jolyon before a little soames george was so droll it was rumoured too that he and dartie had a bet as to whether james would attain the age of ninety though which of them had backed james no one knew  early in may winifred came round to say that val had been wounded in the leg by a spent bullet and was to be discharged his wife was nursing him he would have a little limpnothing to speak of he wanted his grandfather to buy him a farm out there where he could breed horses her father was giving holly eight hundred a year so they could be quite comfortable because his grandfather would give val five he had said but as to the farm he didnt knowcouldnt tell he didnt want val to go throwing away his money  but you know said winifred he must do something  aunt hester thought that perhaps his dear grandfather was wise because if he didnt buy a farm it couldnt turn out badly  but val loves horses said winifred itd be such an occupation for him  aunt juley thought that horses were very uncertain had not montague found them so  vals different said winifred he takes after me  aunt juley was sure that dear val was very clever i always remember she added how he gave his bad penny to a beggar his dear grandfather was so pleased he thought it showed such presence of mind i remember his saying that he ought to go into the navy  aunt hester chimed in did not winifred think that it was much better for the young people to be secure and not run any risk at their age  well said winifred if they were in london perhaps in london its amusing to do nothing but out there of course hell simply get bored to death  aunt hester thought that it would be nice for him to work if he were quite sure not to lose by it it was not as if they had no money timothy of course had done so well by retiring aunt juley wanted to know what montague had said  winifred did not tell her for montague had merely remarked wait till the old man dies  at this moment francie was announced her eyes were brimming with a smile  well she said what do you think of it  of what dear  in the times this morning  we havent seen it we always read it after dinner timothy has it till then  francie rolled her eyes  do you think you ought to tell us said aunt juley what was it  irenes had a son at robin hill  aunt juley drew in her breath but she said they were only married in march  yes auntie isnt it interesting  well said winifred im glad i was sorry for jolyon losing his boy it might have been val  aunt juley seemed to go into a sort of dream i wonder she murmured what dear soames will think he has so wanted to have a son himself a little bird has always told me that  well said winifred hes going tobar accidents  gladness trickled out of aunt juleys eyes  how delightful she said when  november  such a lucky month but she did wish it could be sooner it was a long time for james to wait at his age  to wait they dreaded it for james but they were used to it themselves indeed it was their great distraction to wait for the times to read for one or other of their nieces or nephews to come in and cheer them up for news of nicholas health for that decision of christophers about going on the stage for information concerning the mine of mrs macanders nephew for the doctor to come about hesters inclination to wake up early in the morning for books from the library which were always out for timothy to have a cold for a nice quiet warm day not too hot when they could take a turn in kensington gardens to wait one on each side of the hearth in the drawingroom for the clock between them to strike their thin veined knuckled hands plying knittingneedles and crochethooks their hair ordered to stoplike canutes wavesfrom any further advance in colour to wait in their black silks or satins for the court to say that hester might wear her dark green and juley her darker maroon to wait slowly turning over and over in their old minds the little joys and sorrows events and expectancies of their little family world as cows chew patient cuds in a familiar field and this new event was so well worth waiting for soames had always been their pet with his tendency to give them pictures and his almost weekly visits which they missed so much and his need for their sympathy evoked by the wreck of his first marriage this new eventthe birth of an heir to soameswas so important for him and for his dear father too that james might not have to die without some certainty about things james did so dislike uncertainty and with montague of course he could not feel really satisfied to leave no grandchildren but the young darties after all ones own name did count and as james ninetieth birthday neared they wondered what precautions he was taking he would be the first of the forsytes to reach that age and set as it were a new standard in holding on to life that was so important they felt at their ages eightyseven and eightyfive though they did not want to think of themselves when they had timothy who was not yet eightytwo to think of there was of course a better world in my fathers house are many mansions was one of aunt juleys favourite sayingsit always comforted her with its suggestion of house property which had made the fortune of dear roger the bible was indeed a great resource and on very fine sundays there was church in the morning and sometimes juley would steal into timothys study when she was sure he was out and just put an open new testament casually among the books on his little tablehe was a great reader of course having been a publisher but she had noticed that timothy was always cross at dinner afterwards and smither had told her more than once that she had picked books off the floor in doing the room still with all that they did feel that heaven could not be quite so cosy as the rooms in which they and timothy had been waiting so long aunt hester especially could not bear the thought of the exertion any change or rather the thought of a changefor there never was anyalways upset her very much aunt juley who had more spirit sometimes thought it would be quite exciting she had so enjoyed that visit to brighton the year dear susan died but then brighton one knew was nice and it was so difficult to tell what heaven would be like so on the whole she was more than content to wait  on the morning of james birthday august the 5th they felt extraordinary animation and little notes passed between them by the hand of smither while they were having breakfast in their beds smither must go round and take their love and little presents and find out how mr james was and whether he had passed a good night with all the excitement and on the way back would smither call in at green streetit was a little out of her way but she could take the bus up bond street afterwards it would be a nice little change for herand ask dear mrs dartie to be sure and look in before she went out of town  all this smither didan undeniable servant trained many years ago under aunt ann to a perfection not now procurable mr james so mrs james said had passed an excellent night he sent his love mrs james had said he was very funny and had complained that he didnt know what all the fuss was about oh and mrs dartie sent her love and she would come to tea  aunts juley and hester rather hurt that their presents had not received special mentionthey forgot every year that james could not bear to receive presents throwing away their money on him as he always called itwere delighted it showed that james was in good spirits and that was so important for him and they began to wait for winifred she came at four bringing imogen and maud just back from school and getting such a pretty girl too so that it was extremely difficult to ask for news about annette aunt juley however summoned courage to enquire whether winifred had heard anything and if soames was anxious  uncle soames is always anxious auntie interrupted imogen he cant be happy now hes got it  the words struck familiarly on aunt juleys ears ah yes that funny drawing of georges which had not been shown them but what did imogen mean that her uncle always wanted more than he could have it was not at all nice to think like that  imogens voice rose clear and clipped  imagine annettes only two years older than me it must be awful for her married to uncle soames  aunt juley lifted her hands in horror  my dear she said you dont know what youre talking about your uncle soames is a match for anybody hes a very clever man and goodlooking and wealthy and most considerate and careful and not at all old considering everything  imogen turning her luscious glance from one to the other of the old dears only smiled  i hope said aunt juley quite severely that you will marry as good a man  i shant marry a good man auntie murmured imogen theyre dull  if you go on like this replied aunt juley still very much upset you wont marry anybody wed better not pursue the subject and turning to winifred she said how is montague  that evening while they were waiting for dinner she murmured  ive told smither to get up half a bottle of the sweet champagne hester i think we ought to drink dear james health andand the health of soames wife only lets keep that quite secret ill just say like this and you know hester and then well drink it might upset timothy  its more likely to upset us said aunt nester but we must i suppose for such an occasion  yes said aunt juley rapturously it is an occasion only fancy if he has a dear little boy to carry the family on i do feel it so important now that irene has had a son winifred says george is calling jolyon the threedecker because of his three families you know george is droll and fancy irene is living after all in the house soames had built for them both it does seem hard on dear soames and hes always been so regular  that night in bed excited and a little flushed still by her glass of wine and the secrecy of the second toast she lay with her prayerbook opened flat and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed by the light from her readinglamp young things it was so nice for them all and she would be so happy if she could see dear soames happy but of course he must be now in spite of what imogen had said he would have all that he wanted property and wife and children and he would live to a green old age like his dear father and forget all about irene and that dreadful case if only she herself could be here to buy his children their first rockinghorse smither should choose it for her at the stores nice and dappled ah how roger used to rock her until she fell off oh dear that was a long time ago it was in my fathers house are many mansionsa little scrattling noise caught her earbut no mice she thought mechanically the noise increased there it was a mouse how naughty of smither to say there wasnt it would be eating through the wainscot before they knew where they were and they would have to have the builders in they were such destructive things and she lay with her eyes just moving following in her mind that little scrattling sound and waiting for sleep to release her from it     chapter xiibirth of a forsyte  soames walked out of the garden door crossed the lawn stood on the path above the river turned round and walked back to the garden door without having realised that he had moved the sound of wheels crunching the drive convinced him that time had passed and the doctor gone what exactly had he said  this is the position mr forsyte i can make pretty certain of her life if i operate but the baby will be born dead if i dont operate the baby will most probably be born alive but its a great risk for the mothera great risk in either case i dont think she can ever have another child in her state she obviously cant decide for herself and we cant wait for her mother its for you to make the decision while im getting whats necessary i shall be back within the hour  the decision what a decision no time to get a specialist down no time for anything  the sound of wheels died away but soames still stood intent then suddenly covering his ears he walked back to the river to come before its time like this with no chance to foresee anything not even to get her mother here it was for her mother to make that decision and she couldnt arrive from paris till tonight if only he could have understood the doctors jargon the medical niceties so as to be sure he was weighing the chances properly but they were greek to himlike a legal problem to a layman and yet he must decide he brought his hand away from his brow wet though the air was chilly these sounds which came from her room to go back there would only make it more difficult he must be calm clear on the one hand life nearly certain of his young wife death quite certain of his child andno more children afterwards on the other death perhaps of his wife nearly certain life for the child andno more children afterwards which to choose it had rained this last fortnightthe river was very full and in the water collected round the little houseboat moored by his landingstage were many leaves from the woods above brought off by a frost leaves fell lives drifted downdeath to decide about death and no one to give him a hand life lost was lost for good let nothing go that you could keep for if it went you couldnt get it back it left you bare like those trees when they lost their leaves barer and barer until you too withered and came down and by a queer somersault of thought he seemed to see not annette lying up there behind that windowpane on which the sun was shining but irene lying in their bedroom in montpellier square as it might conceivably have been her fate to lie sixteen years ago would he have hesitated then not a moment operate operate make certain of her life no decisiona mere instinctive cry for help in spite of his knowledge even then that she did not love him but this ah there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for annette many times these last months especially since she had been growing frightened he had wondered she had a will of her own was selfish in her french way and yetso pretty what would she wishto take the risk i know she wants the child he thought if its born dead and no more chance afterwardsitll upset her terribly no more chance all for nothing married life with her for years and years without a child nothing to steady her shes too young nothing to look forward to for herfor me for me he struck his hands against his chest why couldnt he think without bringing himself inget out of himself and see what he ought to do the thought hurt him then lost edge as if it had come in contact with a breastplate out of oneself impossible out into soundless scentless touchless sightless space the very idea was ghastly futile and touching there the bedrock of reality the bottom of his forsyte spirit soames rested for a moment when one ceased all ceased it might go on but thered be nothing in it  he looked at his watch in half an hour the doctor would be back he must decide if against the operation and she died how face her mother and the doctor afterwards how face his own conscience it was his child that she was having if for the operationthen he condemned them both to childlessness and for what else had he married her but to have a lawful heir and his fatherat deaths door waiting for the news its cruel he thought i ought never to have such a thing to settle its cruel he turned towards the house some deep simple way of deciding he took out a coin and put it back if he spun it he knew he would not abide by what came up he went into the diningroom furthest away from that room whence the sounds issued the doctor had said there was a chance in here that chance seemed greater the river did not flow nor the leaves fall a fire was burning soames unlocked the tantalus he hardly ever touched spirits but nowhe poured himself out some whisky and drank it neat craving a faster flow of blood that fellow jolyon he thought he had children already he has the woman i really loved and now a son by her and iim asked to destroy my only child annette cant die its not possible shes strong  he was still standing sullenly at the sideboard when he heard the doctors carriage and went out to him he had to wait for him to come downstairs  well doctor  the situations the same have you decided  yes said soames dont operate  not you understandthe risks great  in soames set face nothing moved but the lips  you said there was a chance  a chance yes not much of one  you say the baby must be born dead if you do  yes  do you still think that in any case she cant have another  one cant be absolutely sure but its most unlikely  shes strong said soames well take the risk  the doctor looked at him very gravely its on your shoulders he said with my own wife i couldnt  soames chin jerked up as if someone had hit him  am i of any use up there he asked  no keep away  i shall be in my picturegallery then you know where  the doctor nodded and went upstairs  soames continued to stand listening by this time tomorrow he thought i may have her death on my hands no it was unfairmonstrous to put it that way sullenness dropped on him again and he went up to the gallery he stood at the window the wind was in the north it was cold clear very blue sky heavy ragged white clouds chasing across the river blue too through the screen of goldening trees the woods all rich with colour glowing burnishedan early autumn if it were his own life would he be taking that risk but shed take the risk of losing me he thought sooner than lose her child she doesnt really love me what could one expecta girl and french the one thing really vital to them both vital to their marriage and their futures was a child ive been through a lot for this he thought ill hold onhold on theres a chance of keeping botha chance one kept till things were takenone naturally kept he began walking round the gallery he had made one purchase lately which he knew was a fortune in itself and he halted before ita girl with dull gold hair which looked like filaments of metal gazing at a little golden monster she was holding in her hand even at this tortured moment he could just feel the extraordinary nature of the bargain he had madeadmire the quality of the table the floor the chair the girls figure the absorbed expression on her face the dull gold filaments of her hair the bright gold of the little monster collecting pictures growing richer richer what use if he turned his back abruptly on the picture and went to the window some of his doves had flown up from their perches round the dovecot and were stretching their wings in the wind in the clear sharp sunlight their whiteness almost flashed they flew far making a flungup hieroglyphic against the sky annette fed the doves it was pretty to see her they took it out of her hand they knew she was matteroffact a choking sensation came into his throat she would notcould not die she was tootoo sensible and she was strong really strong like her mother in spite of her fair prettiness  it was already growing dark when at last he opened the door and stood listening not a sound a milky twilight crept about the stairway and the landings below he had turned back when a sound caught his ear peering down he saw a black shape moving and his heart stood still what was it death the shape of death coming from her door no only a maid without cap or apron she came to the foot of his flight of stairs and said breathlessly  the doctor wants to see you sir  he ran down she stood flat against the wall to let him pass and said  oh sir its over  over said soames with a sort of menace what dyou mean  its born sir  he dashed up the four steps in front of him and came suddenly on the doctor in the dim passage the man was wiping his brow  well he said quick  both living its all right i think  soames stood quite still covering his eyes  i congratulate you he heard the doctor say it was touch and go  soames let fall the hand which was covering his face  thanks he said thanks very much what is it  daughterluckily a son would have killed herthe head  a daughter  the utmost care of both he hears the doctor say and we shall do when does the mother come  tonight between nine and ten i hope  ill stay till then do you want to see them  not now said soames before you go ill have dinner sent up to you and he went downstairs  relief unspeakable and yeta daughter it seemed to him unfair to have taken that riskto have been through this agonyand what agonyfor a daughter he stood before the blazing fire of wood logs in the hall touching it with his toe and trying to readjust himself my father he thought a bitter disappointment no disguising it one never got all one wanted in this life and there was no otherat least if there was it was no use  while he was standing there a telegram was brought him  come up at once your father sinking fastmother  he read it with a choking sensation one would have thought he couldnt feel anything after these last hours but he felt this halfpast seven a train from reading at nine and madames train if she had caught it came in at eightfortyhe would meet that and go on he ordered the carriage ate some dinner mechanically and went upstairs the doctor came out to him  theyre sleeping  i wont go in said soames with relief my fathers dying i have togo up is it all right  the doctors face expressed a kind of doubting admiration if they were all as unemotional he might have been saying  yes i think you may go with an easy mind youll be down soon  tomorrow said soames heres the address  the doctor seemed to hover on the verge of sympathy  goodnight said soames abruptly and turned away he put on his fur coat death it was a chilly business he smoked a cigarette in the carriageone of his rare cigarettes the night was windy and flew on black wings the carriage lights had to search out the way his father that old old man a comfortless nightto die  the london train came in just as he reached the station and madame lamotte substantial darkclothed very yellow in the lamplight came towards the exit with a dressingbag  this all you have asked soames  but yes i had not the time how is my little one  doing wellboth a girl  a girl what joy i had a frightful crossing  her black bulk solid unreduced by the frightful crossing climbed into the brougham  and you mon cher  my fathers dying said soames between his teeth im going up give my love to annette  tiens murmured madame lamotte quel malheur  soames took his hat off and moved towards his train the french he thought     chapter xiiijames is told  a simple cold caught in the room with double windows where the air and the people who saw him were filtered as it were the room he had not left since the middle of septemberand james was in deep waters a little cold passing his little strength and flying quickly to his lungs he mustnt catch cold the doctor had declared and he had gone and caught it when he first felt it in his throat he had said to his nursefor he had one nowthere i knew how it would be airing the room like that for a whole day he was highly nervous about himself and went in advance of all precautions and remedies drawing every breath with extreme care and having his temperature taken every hour emily was not alarmed  but next morning when she went in the nurse whispered he wont have his temperature taken  emily crossed to the side of the bed where he was lying and said softly how do you feel james holding the thermometer to his lips james looked up at her  whats the good of that he murmured huskily i dont want to know  then she was alarmed he breathed with difficulty he looked terribly frail white with faint red discolorations she had had trouble with him goodness knew but he was james had been james for nearly fifty years she couldnt remember or imagine life without jamesjames behind all his fussiness his pessimism his crusty shell deeply affectionate really kind and generous to them all  all that day and the next he hardly uttered a word but there was in his eyes a noticing of everything done for him a look on his face which told her he was fighting and she did not lose hope his very stillness the way he conserved every little scrap of energy showed the tenacity with which he was fighting it touched her deeply and though her face was composed and comfortable in the sickroom tears ran down her cheeks when she was out of it  about teatime on the third dayshe had just changed her dress keeping her appearance so as not to alarm him because he noticed everythingshe saw a difference its no use im tired was written plainly across that white face and when she went up to him he muttered send for soames  yes james she said comfortably all rightat once and she kissed his forehead a tear dropped there and as she wiped it off she saw that his eyes looked grateful much upset and without hope now she sent soames the telegram  when he entered out of the black windy night the big house was still as a grave warmsons broad face looked almost narrow he took the fur coat with a sort of added care saying  will you have a glass of wine sir  soames shook his head and his eyebrows made enquiry  warmsons lips twitched hes asking for you sir and suddenly he blew his nose its a long time sir he said that ive been with mr forsytea long time  soames left him folding the coat and began to mount the stairs this house where he had been born and sheltered had never seemed to him so warm and rich and cosy as during this last pilgrimage to his fathers room it was not his taste but in its own substantial lincrusta way it was the acme of comfort and security and the night was so dark and windy the grave so cold and lonely  he paused outside the door no sound came from within he turned the handle softly and was in the room before he was perceived the light was shaded his mother and winifred were sitting on the far side of the bed the nurse was moving away from the near side where was an empty chair for me thought soames as he moved from the door his mother and sister rose but he signed with his hand and they sat down again he went up to the chair and stood looking at his father james breathing was as if strangled his eyes were closed and in soames looking on his father so worn and white and wasted listening to his strangled breathing there rose a passionate vehemence of anger against nature cruel inexorable nature kneeling on the chest of that wisp of a body slowly pressing out the breath pressing out the life of the being who was dearest to him in the world his father of all men had lived a careful life moderate abstemious and this was his rewardto have life slowly painfully squeezed out of him and without knowing that he spoke he said its cruel  he saw his mother cover her eyes and winifred bow her face towards the bed women they put up with things so much better than men he took a step nearer to his father for three days james had not been shaved and his lips and chin were covered with hair hardly more snowy than his forehead it softened his face gave it a queer look already not of this world his eyes opened soames went quite close and bent over the lips moved  here i am father  umwhatwhat news they never tell the voice died and a flood of emotion made soames face work so that he could not speak tell himyes but what he made a great effort got his lips together and said  good news dear goodannette a son  ah it was the queerest sound ugly relieved pitiful triumphantlike the noise a baby makes getting what it wants the eyes closed and that strangled sound of breathing began again soames recoiled to the chair and stonily sat down the lie he had told based as it were on some deep temperamental instinct that after death james would not know the truth had taken away all power of feeling for the moment his arm brushed against something it was his fathers naked foot in the struggle to breathe he had pushed it out from under the clothes soames took it in his hand a cold foot light and thin white very cold what use to put it back to wrap up that which must be colder soon he warmed it mechanically with his hand listening to his fathers laboured breathing while the power of feeling rose again within him a little sob quickly smothered came from winifred but his mother sat unmoving with her eyes fixed on james soames signed to the nurse  wheres the doctor he whispered  hes been sent for  cant you do anything to ease his breathing  only an injection and he cant stand it the doctor said while he was fighting  hes not fighting whispered soames hes being slowly smothered its awful  james stirred uneasily as if he knew what they were saying soames rose and bent over him james feebly moved his two hands and soames took them  he wants to be pulled up whispered the nurse  soames pulled he thought he pulled gently but a look almost of anger passed over james face the nurse plumped the pillows soames laid the hands down and bending over kissed his fathers forehead as he was raising himself again james eyes bent on him a look which seemed to come from the very depths of what was left within im done my boy it seemed to say take care of them take care of yourself take carei leave it all to you  yes yes soames whispered yes yes  behind him the nurse did he knew not what for his father made a tiny movement of repulsion as if resenting that interference and almost at once his breathing eased away became quiet he lay very still the strained expression on his face passed a curious white tranquillity took its place his eyelids quivered rested the whole face rested at ease only by the faint puffing of his lips could they tell that he was breathing soames sank back on his chair and fell to cherishing the foot again he heard the nurse quietly crying over there by the fire curious that she a stranger should be the only one of them who cried he heard the quiet lick and flutter of the fire flames one more old forsyte going to his long restwonderful they werewonderful how he had held on his mother and winifred were leaning forward hanging on the sight of james lips but soames bent sideways over the feet warming them both they gave him comfort colder and colder though they grew suddenly he started up a sound a dreadful sound such as he had never heard was coming from his fathers lips as if an outraged heart had broken with a long moan what a strong heart to have uttered that farewell it ceased soames looked into the face no motion no breath dead he kissed the brow turned round and went out of the room he ran upstairs to the bedroom his old bedroom still kept for him flung himself face down on the bed and broke into sobs which he stilled with the pillow  a little later he went downstairs and passed into the room james lay alone wonderfully calm free from shadow and anxiety with the gravity on his ravaged face which underlies great age the worn fine gravity of old coins  soames looked steadily at that face at the fire at all the room with windows thrown open to the london night  goodbye he whispered and went out     chapter xivhis  he had much to see to that night and all next day a telegram at breakfast reassured him about annette and he only caught the last train back to reading with emilys kiss on his forehead and in his ears her words  i dont know what i should have done without you my dear boy  he reached his house at midnight the weather had changed was mild again as though having finished its work and sent a forsyte to his last account it could relax a second telegram received at dinnertime had confirmed the good news of annette and instead of going in soames passed down through the garden in the moonlight to his houseboat he could sleep there quite well bitterly tired he lay down on the sofa in his fur coat and fell asleep he woke soon after dawn and went on deck he stood against the rail looking west where the river swept round in a wide curve under the woods in soames appreciation of natural beauty was curiously like that of his farmer ancestors a sense of grievance if it wasnt there sharpened no doubt and civilised by his researches among landscape painting but dawn has power to fertilise the most matteroffact vision and he was stirred it was another world from the river he knew under that remote cool light a world into which man had not entered an unreal world like some strange shore sighted by discovery its colour was not the colour of convention was hardly colour at all its shapes were brooding yet distinct its silence stunning it had no scent why it should move him he could not tell unless it were that he felt so alone in it bare of all relationship and all possessions into such a world his father might be voyaging for all resemblance it had to the world he had left and soames took refuge from it in wondering what painter could have done it justice the whitegrey water was likelike the belly of a fish was it possible that this world on which he looked was all private property except the waterand even that was tapped no tree no shrub not a blade of grass not a bird or beast not even a fish that was not owned and once on a time all this was jungle and marsh and water and weird creatures roamed and sported without human cognizance to give them names rotting luxuriance had rioted where those tall carefully planted woods came down to the water and marshmisted reeds on that far side had covered all the pasture well they had got it under kennelled it all up labelled it and stowed it in lawyers offices and a good thing too but once in a way as now the ghost of the past came out to haunt and brood and whisper to any human who chanced to be awake out of my unowned loneliness you all came into it some day you will all return  and soames who felt the chill and the eeriness of that worldnew to him and so very old the world unowned visiting the scene of its pastwent down and made himself tea on a spiritlamp when he had drunk it he took out writing materials and wrote two paragraphs  on the 20th instant at his residence in park lane james forsyte in his ninetyfirst year funeral at noon on the 24th at highgate no flowers by request  on the 20th instant at the shelter mapledurham annette wife of soames forsyte of a daughter and underneath on the blottingpaper he traced the word son  it was eight oclock in an ordinary autumn world when he went across to the house bushes across the river stood round and brightcoloured out of a milky haze the woodsmoke went up blue and straight and his doves cooed preening their feathers in the sunlight  he stole up to his dressingroom bathed shaved put on fresh linen and dark clothes  madame lamotte was beginning her breakfast when he went down  she looked at his clothes said dont tell me and pressed his hand annette is prettee well but the doctor say she can never have no more children you knew that soames nodded its a pity mais la petite est adorable du cafe  soames got away from her as soon as he could she offended himsolid matteroffact quick clearfrench he could not bear her vowels her rs he resented the way she had looked at him as if it were his fault that annette could never bear him a son his fault he even resented her cheap adoration of the daughter he had not yet seen  curious how he jibbed away from sight of his wife and child  one would have thought he must have rushed up at the first moment on the contrary he had a sort of physical shrinking from itfastidious possessor that he was he was afraid of what annette was thinking of him author of her agonies afraid of the look of the baby afraid of showing his disappointment with the present andthe future  he spent an hour walking up and down the drawingroom before he could screw his courage up to mount the stairs and knock on the door of their room  madame lamotte opened it  ah at last you come elle vous attend she passed him and soames went in with his noiseless step his jaw firmly set his eyes furtive  annette was very pale and very pretty lying there the baby was hidden away somewhere he could not see it he went up to the bed and with sudden emotion bent and kissed her forehead  here you are then soames she said i am not so bad now but i suffered terribly terribly i am glad i cannot have any more oh how i suffered  soames stood silent stroking her hand words of endearment of sympathy absolutely would not come the thought passed through him an english girl wouldnt have said that at this moment he knew with certainty that he would never be near to her in spirit and in truth nor she to him he had collected herthat was all and jolyons words came rushing into his mind i should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery well he had got it out had he got it in again  we must feed you up he said youll soon be strong  dont you want to see baby soames she is asleep  of course said soames very much  he passed round the foot of the bed to the other side and stood staring for the first moment what he saw was much what he had expected to seea baby but as he stared and the baby breathed and made little sleeping movements with its tiny features it seemed to assume an individual shape grew to be like a picture a thing he would know again not repulsive strangely budlike and touching it had dark hair he touched it with his finger he wanted to see its eyes they opened they were darkwhether blue or brown he could not tell the eyes winked stared they had a sort of sleepy depth in them and suddenly his heart felt queer warm as if elated  ma petite fleur annette said softly  fleur repeated soames fleur well call her that

galsworthy     awakening         to charles scribner     awakening  through the massive skylight illuminating the hall at robin hill the july sunlight at five oclock fell just where the broad stairway turned and in that radiant streak little jon forsyte stood bluelinensuited his hair was shining and his eyes from beneath a frown for he was considering how to go downstairs this last of innumerable times before the car brought his father and mother home four at a time and five at the bottom stale down the banisters but in which fashion on his face feet foremost very stale on his stomach sideways paltry on his back with his arms stretched down on both sides forbidden or on his face head foremost in a manner unknown as yet to any but himself such was the cause of the frown on the illuminated face of little jon  in that summer of 1909 the simple souls who even then desired to simplify the english tongue had of course no cognizance of little jon or they would have claimed him for a disciple but one can be too simple in this life for his real name was jolyon and his living father and dead halfbrother had usurped of old the other shortenings jo and jolly as a fact little jon had done his best to conform to convention and spell himself first jhon then john not till his father had explained the sheer necessity had he spelled his name jon  up till now that father had possessed what was left of his heart by the groom bob who played the concertina and his nurse da who wore the violet dress on sundays and enjoyed the name of spraggins in that private life lived at odd moments even by domestic servants his mother had only appeared to him as it were in dreams smelling delicious smoothing his forehead just before he fell asleep and sometimes docking his hair of a golden brown colour when he cut his head open against the nursery fender she was there to be bled over and when he had nightmare she would sit on his bed and cuddle his head against her neck she was precious but remote because da was so near and there is hardly room for more than one woman at a time in a mans heart with his father too of course he had special bonds of union for little jon also meant to be a painter when he grew upwith the one small difference that his father painted pictures and little jon intended to paint ceilings and walls standing on a board between two stepladders in a dirtywhite apron and a lovely smell of whitewash his father also took him riding in richmond park on his pony mouse socalled because it was socoloured  little jon had been born with a silver spoon in a mouth which was rather curly and large he had never heard his father or his mother speak in an angry voice either to each other himself or anybody else the groom bob cook jane bella and the other servants even da who alone restrained him in his courses had special voices when they talked to him he was therefore of opinion that the world was a place of perfect and perpetual gentility and freedom  a child of 1901 he had come to consciousness when his country just over that bad attack of scarlet fever the boer war was preparing for the liberal revival of 1906 coercion was unpopular parents had exalted notions of giving their offspring a good time they spoiled their rods spared their children and anticipated the results with enthusiasm in choosing moreover for his father an amiable man of fiftytwo who had already lost an only son and for his mother a woman of thirtyeight whose first and only child he was little jon had done well and wisely what had saved him from becoming a cross between a lap dog and a little prig had been his fathers adoration of his mother for even little jon could see that she was not merely just his mother and that he played second fiddle to her in his fathers heart what he played in his mothers heart he knew not yet as for auntie june his halfsister but so old that she had grown out of the relationship she loved him of course but was too sudden his devoted da too had a spartan touch his bath was cold and his knees were bare he was not encouraged to be sorry for himself as to the vexed question of his education little jon shared the theory of those who considered that children should not be forced he rather liked the mademoiselle who came for two hours every morning to teach him her language together with history geography and sums nor were the piano lessons which his mother gave him disagreeable for she had a way of luring him from tune to tune never making him practise one which did not give him pleasure so that he remained eager to convert ten thumbs into eight fingers under his father he learned to draw pleasurepigs and other animals he was not a highly educated little boy yet on the whole the silver spoon stayed in his mouth without spoiling it though da sometimes said that other children would do him a world of good  it was a disillusionment then when at the age of nearly seven she held him down on his back because he wanted to do something of which she did not approve this first interference with the free individualism of a forsyte drove him almost frantic there was something appalling in the utter helplessness of that position and the uncertainty as to whether it would ever come to an end suppose she never let him get up any more he suffered torture at the top of his voice for fifty seconds worse than anything was his perception that da had taken all that time to realise the agony of fear he was enduring thus dreadfully was revealed to him the lack of imagination in the human being  when he was let up he remained convinced that da had done a dreadful thing though he did not wish to bear witness against her he had been compelled by fear of repetition to seek his mother and say mum dont let da hold me down on my back again  his mother her hands held up over her head and in them two plaits of haircouleur de feuille morte as little jon had not yet learned to call ithad looked at him with eyes like little bits of his brown velvet tunic and answered  no darling i wont  she being in the nature of a goddess little jon was satisfied especially when from under the diningtable at breakfast where he happened to be waiting for a mushroom he had overheard her say to his father  then will you tell da dear or shall i shes so devoted to him and his fathers answer  well she mustnt show it that way i know exactly what it feels like to be held down on ones back no forsyte can stand it for a minute  conscious that they did not know him to be under the table little jon was visited by the quite new feeling of embarrassment and stayed where he was ravaged by desire for the mushroom  such had been his first dip into the dark abysses of existence nothing much had been revealed to him after that till one day having gone down to the cowhouse for his drink of milk fresh from the cow after garratt had finished milking he had seen clovers calf dead inconsolable and followed by an upset garratt he had sought da but suddenly aware that she was not the person he wanted had rushed away to find his father and had run into the arms of his mother  clovers calfs dead oh oh it looked so soft  his mothers clasp and her  yes darling there there had stayed his sobbing but if clovers calf could die anything couldnot only bees flies beetles and chickensand look soft like that this was appallingand soon forgotten  the next thing had been to sit on a bumble bee a poignant experience which his mother had understood much better than da and nothing of vital importance had happened after that till the year turned when following a day of utter wretchedness he had enjoyed a disease composed of little spots bed honey in a spoon and many tangerine oranges it was then that the world had flowered to auntie june he owed that flowering for no sooner was he a little lame duck than she came rushing down from london bringing with her the books which had nurtured her own berserker spirit born in the noted year of 1869 aged and of many colours they were stored with the most formidable happenings of these she read to little jon till he was allowed to read to himself whereupon she whisked back to london and left them with him in a heap those books cooked his fancy till he thought and dreamed of nothing but midshipmen and dhows pirates rafts sandalwood traders iron horses sharks battles tartars red indians balloons north poles and other extravagant delights the moment he was suffered to get up he rigged his bed fore and aft and set out from it in a narrow bath across green seas of carpet to a rock which he climbed by means of its mahogany drawer knobs to sweep the horizon with his drinking tumbler screwed to his eye in search of rescuing sails he made a daily raft out of the towel stand the tea tray and his pillows he saved the juice from his french plums bottled it in an empty medicine bottle and provisioned the raft with the rum that it became also with pemmican made out of little savedup bits of chicken sat on and dried at the fire and with lime juice against scurvy extracted from the peel of his oranges and a little economised juice he made a north pole one morning from the whole of his bedclothes except the bolster and reached it in a birchbark canoe in private life the fender after a terrible encounter with a polar bear fashioned from the bolster and four skittles dressed up in das nightgown after that his father seeking to steady his imagination brought him ivanhoe bevis a book about king arthur and tom browns schooldays he read the first and for three days built defended and stormed front de boeufs castle taking every part in the piece except those of rebecca and rowena with piercing cries of en avant de bracy and similar utterances after reading the book about king arthur he became almost exclusively sir lamorac de galis because though there was very little about him he preferred his name to that of any other knight and he rode his old rockinghorse to death armed with a long bamboo bevis he found tame besides it required woods and animals of which he had none in his nursery except his two cats fitz and puck forsyte who permitted no liberties for tom brown he was as yet too young there was relief in the house when after the fourth week he was permitted to go down and out  the month being march the trees were exceptionally like the masts of ships and for little jon that was a wonderful spring extremely hard on his knees suits and the patience of da who had the washing and reparation of his clothes every morning the moment his breakfast was over he could be viewed by his mother and father whose windows looked out that way coming from the study crossing the terrace climbing the old oak tree his face resolute and his hair bright he began the day thus because there was not time to go far afield before his lessons the old trees variety never staled it had mainmast foremast topgallant mast and he could always come down by the halyardsor ropes of the swing after his lessons completed by eleven he would go to the kitchen for a thin piece of cheese a biscuit and two french plumsprovision enough for a jollyboat at leastand eat it in some imaginative way then armed to the teeth with gun pistols and sword he would begin the serious climbing of the morning encountering by the way innumerable slavers indians pirates leopards and bears he was seldom seen at that hour of the day without a cutlass in his teeth like dick needham amid the rapid explosion of copper caps and many were the gardeners he brought down with yellow peas shot out of his little gun he lived a life of the most violent action  jon said his father to his mother under the oak tree is terrible im afraid hes going to turn out a sailor or something hopeless do you see any sign of his appreciating beauty  not the faintest  well thank heaven hes no turn for wheels or engines i can bear anything but that but i wish hed take more interest in nature  hes imaginative jolyon  yes in a sanguinary way does he love anyone just now  no only everyone there never was anyone born more loving or more lovable than jon  being your boy irene  at this moment little jon lying along a branch high above them brought them down with two peas but that fragment of talk lodged thick in his small gizzard loving lovable imaginative sanguinary  the leaves also were thick by now and it was time for his birthday which occurring every year on the twelfth of may was always memorable for his chosen dinner of sweetbread mushrooms macaroons and ginger beer  between that eighth birthday however and the afternoon when he stood in the july radiance at the turning of the stairway several important things had happened  da worn out by washing his knees or moved by that mysterious instinct which forces even nurses to desert their nurslings left the very day after his birthday in floods of tears to be marriedof all thingsto a man little jon from whom it had been kept was inconsolable for an afternoon it ought not to have been kept from him two large boxes of soldiers and some artillery together with the young buglers which had been among his birthday presents cooperated with his grief in a sort of conversion and instead of seeking adventures in person and risking his own life he began to play imaginative games in which he risked the lives of countless tin soldiers marbles stones and beans of these forms of chair a canon he made collections and using them alternately fought the peninsular the seven years the thirty years and other wars about which he had been reading of late in a big history of europe which had been his grandfathers he altered them to suit his genius and fought them all over the floor in his day nursery so that nobody could come in for fearing of disturbing gustavus adolphus king of sweden or treading on an army of austrians because of the sound of the word he was passionately addicted to the austrians and finding there were so few battles in which they were successful he had to invent them in his games his favourite generals were prince eugene the archduke charles and wallenstein tilly and mack musichall turns he heard his father call them one day whatever that might mean one really could not love very much austrian though they were for euphonic reasons too he doted on turenne  this phase which caused his parents anxiety because it kept him indoors when he ought to have been out lasted through may and half of june till his father killed it by bringing home to him tom sawyer and huckleberry finn when he read those books something happened in him and he went out of doors again in passionate quest of a river there being none on the premises at robin hill he had to make one out of the pond which fortunately had water lilies dragonflies gnats bullrushes and three small willow trees on this pond after his father and garratt had ascertained by sounding that it had a reliable bottom and was nowhere more than two feet deep he was allowed a little collapsible canoe in which he spent hours and hours paddling and lying down out of sight of indian joe and other enemies on the shore of the pond too he built himself a wigwam about four feet square of old biscuit tins roofed in by boughs in this he would make little fires and cook the birds he had not shot with his gun hunting in the coppice and fields or the fish he did not catch in the pond because there were none this occupied the rest of june and that july when his father and mother were away in ireland he led a lonely life of make believe during those five weeks of summer weather with gun wigwam water and canoe and however hard his active little brain tried to keep the sense of beauty away she did creep in on him for a second now and then perching on the wing of a dragonfly glistening on the water lilies or brushing his eyes with her blue as he lay on his back in ambush  auntie june who had been left in charge had a grownup in the house with a cough and a large piece of putty which he was making into a face so she hardly ever came down to see him in the pond once however she brought with her two other grownups little jon who happened to have painted his naked self bright blue and yellow in stripes out of his fathers watercolour box and put some ducks feathers in his hair saw them coming andambushed himself among the willows as he had foreseen they came at once to his wigwam and knelt down to look inside so that with a bloodcurdling yell he was able to take the scalps of auntie june and the woman grownup in an almost complete manner before they kissed him the names of the two grownups were auntie holly and uncle val who had a brown face and a little limp and laughed at him terribly he took a fancy to auntie holly who seemed to be a sister too but they both went away the same afternoon and he did not see them again three days before his father and mother were to come home auntie june also went off in a great hurry taking the grownup who coughed and his piece of putty and mademoiselle said poor man he was veree ill i forbid you to go into his room jon little jon who rarely did things merely because he was told not to refrained from going though he was bored and lonely in truth the day of the pond was past and he was filled to the brim of his soul with restlessness and the want of somethingnot a tree not a gunsomething soft those last two days had seemed months in spite of cast up by the sea wherein he was reading about mother lee and her terrible wrecking bonfire he had gone up and down the stairs perhaps a hundred times in those two days and often from the day nursery where he slept now had stolen into his mothers room looked at everything without touching and on into the dressingroom and standing on one leg beside the bath like slingsby had whispered  ho ho ho dog my cats mysteriously to bring luck then stealing back he had opened his mothers wardrobe and taken a long sniff which seemed to bring him nearer tohe didnt know what  he had done this just before he stood in the streak of sunlight debating in which of the several ways he should slide down the banisters they all seemed silly and in a sudden languor he began descending the steps one by one during that descent he could remember his father quite distinctlythe short grey beard the deep eyes twinkling the furrow between them the funny smile the thin figure which always seemed so tall to little jon but his mother he couldnt see all that represented her was something swaying with two dark eyes looking back at him and the scent of her wardrobe  bella was in the hall drawing aside the big curtains and opening the front door little jon said wheedling  bella  yes master jon  do lets have tea under the oak tree when they come i know theyd like it best  you mean youd like it best  little jon considered  no they would to please me  bella smiled very well ill take it out if youll stay quiet here and not get into mischief before they come  little jon sat down on the bottom step and nodded bella came close and looked him over  get up she said  little jon got up she scrutinized him behind he was not green and his knees seemed clean  all right she said my arent you brown give me a kiss  and little jon received a peck on his hair  what jam he asked im so tired of waiting  gooseberry and strawberry  num they were his favourites  when she was gone he sat still for quite a minute it was quiet in the big hall open to its east end so that he could see one of his trees a brig sailing very slowly across the upper lawn in the outer hall shadows were slanting from the pillars little jon got up jumped one of them and walked round the clump of iris plants which filled the pool of greywhite marble in the centre the flowers were pretty but only smelled a very little he stood in the open doorway and looked out supposesuppose they didnt come he had waited so long that he felt he could not bear that and his attention slid at once from such finality to the dust motes in the bluish sunlight coming in thrusting his hand up he tried to catch some bella ought to have dusted that piece of air but perhaps they werent dustonly what sunlight was made of and he looked to see whether the sunlight out of doors was the same it was not he had said he would stay quiet in the hall but he simply couldnt any more and crossing the gravel of the drive he lay down on the grass beyond pulling six daisies he named them carefully sir lamorac sir tristram sir lancelot sir palimedes sir bors sir gawain and fought them in couples till only sir lamorac whom he had selected for a specially stout stalk had his head on and even he after three encounters looked worn and waggly a beetle was moving slowly in the grass which almost wanted cutting every blade was a small tree round whose trunk the beetle had to glide little jon stretched out sir lamorac feet foremost and stirred the creature up it scuttled painfully little jon laughed lost interest and sighed his heart felt empty he turned over and lay on his back there was a scent of honey from the lime trees in flower and in the sky the blue was beautiful with a few white clouds which looked and perhaps tasted like lemon ice he could hear bob playing way down upon de suwannee ribber on his concertina and it made him nice and sad he turned over again and put his ear to the groundindians could hear things coming ever so farbut he could hear nothingonly the concertina and almost instantly he did hear a grinding sound a faint toot yes it was a carcomingcoming up he jumped should he wait in the porch or rush upstairs and as they came in shout look and slide slowly down the banisters head foremost should he the car turned in at the drive it was too late and he only waited jumping up and down in his excitement the car came quickly whirred and stopped his father got out exactly like life he bent down and little jon bobbed upthey bumped his father said  bless us well old man you are brown just as he would and the sense of expectationof something wantedbubbled unextinguished in little jon then with a long shy look he saw his mother in a blue dress with a blue motor scarf over her cap and hair smiling he jumped as high as ever he could twined his legs behind her back and hugged he heard her gasp and felt her hugging back his eyes very dark blue just then looked into hers very dark brown till her lips closed on his eyebrow and squeezing with all his might he heard her creak and laugh and say  you are strong jon  he slid down at that and rushed into the hall dragging her by the hand  while he was eating his jam beneath the oak tree he noticed things about his mother that he had never seemed to see before her cheeks for instance were creamy there were silver threads in her dark goldy hair her throat had no knob in it like bellas and she went in and out softly he noticed too some little lines running away from the corners of her eyes and a nice darkness under them she was ever so beautiful more beautiful than da or mademoiselle or auntie june or even auntie holly to whom he had taken a fancy even more beautiful than bella who had pink cheeks and came out too suddenly in places this new beautifulness of his mother had a kind of particular importance and he ate less than he had expected to  when tea was over his father wanted him to walk round the gardens he had a long conversation with his father about things in general avoiding his private lifesir lamorac the austrians and the emptiness he had felt these last three days now so suddenly filled up his father told him of a place called glensofantrim where he and his mother had been and of the little people who came out of the ground there when it was very quiet little jon came to a halt with his heels apart  do you really believe they do daddy no jon but i thought you might  why  youre younger than i and theyre fairies little jon squared the dimple in his chin  i dont believe in fairies i never see any ha said his father  does mum  his father smiled his funny smile  no she only sees pan  whats pan  the goaty god who skips about in wild and beautiful places  was he in glensofantrim  mum said so  little jon took his heels up and led on  did you see him  no i only saw venus anadyomene  little jon reflected venus was in his book about the greeks and trojans then anna was her christian and dyomene her surname  but it appeared on inquiry that it was one word which meant rising from the foam  did she rise from the foam in glensofantrim  yes every day  what is she like daddy  like mum  oh then she must be but he stopped at that rushed at a wall scrambled up and promptly scrambled down again the discovery that his mother was beautiful was one which he felt must absolutely be kept to himself his fathers cigar however took so long to smoke that at last he was compelled to say  i want to see what mums brought home do you mind daddy  he pitched the motive low to absolve him from unmanliness and was a little disconcerted when his father looked at him right through heaved an important sigh and answered  all right old man you go and love her  he went with a pretence of slowness and then rushed to make up he entered her bedroom from his own the door being open she was still kneeling before a trunk and he stood close to her quite still  she knelt up straight and said  well jon  i thought id just come and see  having given and received another hug he mounted the windowseat and tucking his legs up under him watched her unpack he derived a pleasure from the operation such as he had not yet known partly because she was taking out things which looked suspicious and partly because he liked to look at her she moved differently from anybody else especially from bella she was certainly the refinedestlooking person he had ever seen she finished the trunk at last and knelt down in front of him  have you missed us jon  little jon nodded and having thus admitted his feelings continued to nod  but you had auntie june  oh she had a man with a cough  his mothers face changed and looked almost angry he added hastily  he was a poor man mum he coughed awfully ii liked him  his mother put her hands behind his waist  you like everybody jon  little jon considered  up to a point he said auntie june took me to church one sunday  to church oh  she wanted to see how it would affect me and did it  yes i came over all funny so she took me home again very quick i wasnt sick after all i went to bed and had hot brandy and water and read the boys of beechwood it was scrumptious  his mother bit her lip  when was that  oh abouta long time agoi wanted her to take me again but she wouldnt you and daddy never go to church do you  no we dont  why dont you  his mother smiled  well dear we both of us went when we were little perhaps we went when we were too little  i see said little jon its dangerous  you shall judge for yourself about all those things as you grow up  little jon replied in a calculating manner  i dont want to grow up much i dont want to go to school a sudden overwhelming desire to say something more to say what he really felt turned him red ii want to stay with you and be your lover mum  then with an instinct to improve the situation he added quickly i dont want to go to bed tonight either im simply tired of going to bed every night  have you had any more nightmares  only about one may i leave the door open into your room tonight mum  yes just a little little jon heaved a sigh of satisfaction  what did you see in glensofantrim  nothing but beauty darling  what exactly is beauty  what exactly isoh jon thats a poser  can i see it for instance his mother got up and sat beside him you do every day the sky is beautiful the stars and moonlit nights and then the birds the flowers the treestheyre all beautiful look out of the windowtheres beauty for you jon  oh yes thats the view is that all  all no the sea is wonderfully beautiful and the waves with their foam flying back  did you rise from it every day mum  his mother smiled well we bathed  little jon suddenly reached out and caught her neck in his hands  i know he said mysteriously youre it really and all the rest is makebelieve  she sighed laughed said oh jon  little jon said critically  do you think bella beautiful for instance i hardly do  bella is young thats something  but you look younger mum if you bump against bella she hurts  i dont believe da was beautiful when i come to think of it and mademoiselles almost ugly  mademoiselle has a very nice face oh yes nice i love your little rays mum  rays  little jon put his finger to the outer corner of her eye  oh those but theyre a sign of age  they come when you smile  but they usent to  oh well i like them do you love me mum  i doi do love you darling  ever so  ever so  more than i thought you did  muchmuch more  well so do i so that makes it even  conscious that he had never in his life so given himself away he felt a sudden reaction to the manliness of sir lamorac dick needham huck finn and other heroes  shall i show you a thing or two he said and slipping out of her arms he stood on his head then fired by her obvious admiration he mounted the bed and threw himself head foremost from his feet on to his back without touching anything with his hands he did this several times  that evening having inspected what they had brought he stayed up to dinner sitting between them at the little round table they used when they were alone he was extremely excited his mother wore a frenchgrey dress with creamy lace made out of little scriggly roses round her neck which was browner than the lace he kept looking at her till at last his fathers funny smile made him suddenly attentive to his slice of pineapple it was later than he had ever stayed up when he went to bed his mother went up with him and he undressed very slowly so as to keep her there when at last he had nothing on but his pyjamas he said  promise you wont go while i say my prayers  i promise  kneeling down and plunging his face into the bed little jon hurried up under his breath opening one eye now and then to see her standing perfectly still with a smile on her face our fatherso went his last prayer which art in heaven hallowed be thy mum thy kingdom mumon earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily mum and forgive us our trespasses on earth as it is in heaven and trespass against us for thine is the evil the power and the glory for ever and ever amum look out he sprang and for a long minute remained in her arms once in bed he continued to hold her hand  you wont shut the door any more than that will you are you going to be long mum  i must go down and play to daddy  oh well i shall hear you  i hope not you must go to sleep  i can sleep any night  well this is just a night like any other  oh noits extra special  on extra special nights one always sleeps soundest  but if i go to sleep mum i shant hear you come up  well when i do ill come in and give you a kiss then if youre awake youll know and if youre not youll still know youve had one  little jon sighed all right he said i suppose i must put up with that mum  yes  what was her name that daddy believes in venus anna diomedes  oh my angel anadyomene  yes but i like my name for you much better  what is yours jon  little jon answered shyly  guinevere its out of the round tableive only just thought of it only of course her hair was down  his mothers eyes looking past him seemed to float  you wont forget to come mum  not if youll go to sleep  thats a bargain then and little jon screwed up his eyes  he felt her lips on his forehead heard her footsteps opened his eyes to see her gliding through the doorway and sighing screwed them up again  then time began  for some ten minutes of it he tried loyally to sleep counting a great number of thistles in a row das old recipe for bringing slumber he seemed to have been hours counting it must he thought be nearly time for her to come up now he threw the bedclothes back im hot he said and his voice sounded funny in the darkness like someone elses why didnt she come he sat up he must look he got out of bed went to the window and pulled the curtain a slice aside it wasnt dark but he couldnt tell whether because of daylight or the moon which was very big it had a funny wicked face as if laughing at him and he did not want to look at it then remembering that his mother had said moonlit nights were beautiful he continued to stare out in a general way the trees threw thick shadows the lawn looked like spilt milk and a long long way he could see oh very far right over the world and it all looked different and swimmy there was a lovely smell too in his open window  i wish i had a dove like noah he thought  the moony moon was round and bright it shone and shone and made it light  after that rhyme which came into his head all at once he became conscious of music very softlovely mum playing he bethought himself of a macaroon he had laid up in his chest of drawers and getting it came back to the window he leaned out now munching now holding his jaws to hear the music better da used to say that angels played on harps in heaven but it wasnt half so lovely as mum playing in the moony night with him eating a macaroon a cockchafer buzzed by a moth flew in his face the music stopped and little jon drew his head in she must be coming he didnt want to be found awake he got back into bed and pulled the clothes nearly over his head but he had left a streak of moonlight coming in it fell across the floor near the foot of the bed and he watched it moving ever so slowly towards him as if it were alive the music began again but he could only just hear it now sleepy music prettysleepymusicsleepyslee  and time slipped by the music rose fell ceased the moonbeam crept towards his face little jon turned in his sleep till he lay on his back with one brown fist still grasping the bedclothes the corners of his eyes twitchedhe had begun to dream he dreamed he was drinking milk out of a pan that was the moon opposite a great black cat which watched him with a funny smile like his fathers he heard it whisper dont drink too much it was the cats milk of course and he put out his hand amicably to stroke the creature but it was no longer there the pan had become a bed in which he was lying and when he tried to get out he couldnt find the edge he couldnt find ithehecouldnt get out it was dreadful  he whimpered in his sleep the bed had begun to go round too it was outside him and inside him going round and round and getting fiery and mother lee out of cast up by the sea was stirring it oh so horrible she looked faster and fastertill he and the bed and mother lee and the moon and the cat were all one wheel going round and round and up and upawfulawfulawful  he shrieked  a voice saying darling darling got through the wheel and he awoke standing on his bed with his eyes wide open  there was his mother with her hair like guineveres and clutching her he buried his face in it  oh oh  its all right treasure youre awake now there there its nothing  but little jon continued to say oh oh  her voice went on velvety in his ear  it was the moonlight sweetheart coming on your face  little jon burbled into her nightgown  you said it was beautiful oh  not to sleep in jon who let it in did you draw the curtains  i wanted to see the time ii looked out ii heard you playing mum ii ate my macaroon but he was growing slowly comforted and the instinct to excuse his fear revived within him  mother lee went round in me and got all fiery he mumbled  well jon what can you expect if you eat macaroons after youve gone to bed  only one mum it made the music ever so more beautiful i was waiting for youi nearly thought it was tomorrow  my ducky its only just eleven now  little jon was silent rubbing his nose on her neck  mum is daddy in your room  not tonight  can i come  if you wish my precious  half himself again little jon drew back  you look different mum ever so younger  its my hair darling  little jon laid hold of it thick dark gold with a few silver threads  i like it he said i like you best of all like this  taking her hand he had begun dragging her towards the door he shut it as they passed with a sigh of relief  which side of the bed do you like mum  the left side  all right  wasting no time giving her no chance to change her mind little jon got into the bed which seemed much softer than his own he heaved another sigh screwed his head into the pillow and lay examining the battle of chariots and swords and spears which always went on outside blankets where the little hairs stood up against the light  it wasnt anything really was it he said  from before her glass his mother answered  nothing but the moon and your imagination heated up you mustnt get so excited jon  but still not quite in possession of his nerves little jon answered boastfully  i wasnt afraid really of course and again he lay watching the spears and chariots it all seemed very long  oh mum do hurry up  darling i have to plait my hair  oh not tonight youll only have to unplait it again tomorrow im sleepy now if you dont come i shant be sleepy soon  his mother stood up white and flowey before the winged mirror he could see three of her with her neck turned and her hair bright under the light and her dark eyes smiling it was unnecessary and he said  do come mum im waiting  very well my love ill come  little jon closed his eyes everything was turning out most satisfactory only she must hurry up he felt the bed shake she was getting in and still with his eyes closed he said sleepily its nice isnt it  he heard her voice say something felt her lips touching his nose and snuggling up beside her who lay awake and loved him with her thoughts he fell into the dreamless sleep which rounded off his past       to let        from out the fatal loins of those two foes      a pair of starcrossed lovers take their life                             romeo and juliet    to charles scribner     part i     iencounter  soames forsyte emerged from the knightsbridge hotel where he was staying in the afternoon of the 12th of may 1920 with the intention of visiting a collection of pictures in a gallery off cork street and looking into the future he walked since the war he never took a cab if he could help it their drivers were in his view an uncivil lot though now that the war was over and supply beginning to exceed demand again getting more civil in accordance with the custom of human nature still he had not forgiven them deeply identifying them with gloomy memories and now dimly like all members of their class with revolution the considerable anxiety he had passed through during the war and the more considerable anxiety he had since undergone in the peace had produced psychological consequences in a tenacious nature he had mentally so frequently experienced ruin that he had ceased to believe in its material probability paying away four thousand a year in income and super tax one could not very well be worse off a fortune of a quarter of a million encumbered only by a wife and one daughter and very diversely invested afforded substantial guarantee even against that wildcat notion a levy on capital and as to confiscation of war profits he was entirely in favour of it for he had none and serve the beggars right the price of pictures moreover had if anything gone up and he had done better with his collection since the war began than ever before airraids also had acted beneficially on a spirit congenitally cautious and hardened a character already dogged to be in danger of being entirely dispersed inclined one to be less apprehensive of the more partial dispersions involved in levies and taxation while the habit of condemning the impudence of the germans had led naturally to condemning that of labour if not openly at least in the sanctuary of his soul  he walked there was moreover time to spare for fleur was to meet him at the gallery at four oclock and it was as yet but halfpast two it was good for him to walkhis liver was a little constricted and his nerves rather on edge his wife was always out when she was in town and his daughter would flibbertygibbet all over the place like most young women since the war still he must be thankful that she had been too young to do anything in that war itself not of course that he had not supported the war from its inception with all his soul but between that and supporting it with the bodies of his wife and daughter there had been a gap fixed by something oldfashioned within him which abhorred emotional extravagance he had for instance strongly objected to annette so attractive and in 1914 only thirtyfour going to her native france her chere patrie as under the stimulus of war she had begun to call it to nurse her braves poilus forsooth ruining her health and her looks as if she were really a nurse he had put a stopper on it let her do needlework for them at home or knit she had not gone therefore and had never been quite the same woman since a bad tendency of hers to mock at him not openly but in continual little ways had grown as for fleur the war had resolved the vexed problem whether or not she should go to school she was better away from her mother in her war mood from the chance of airraids and the impetus to do extravagant things so he had placed her in a seminary as far west as had seemed to him compatible with excellence and had missed her horribly fleur he had never regretted the somewhat outlandish name by which at her birth he had decided so suddenly to call hermarked concession though it had been to the french fleur a pretty namea pretty child but restlesstoo restless and wilful knowing her power too over her father soames often reflected on the mistake it was to dote on his daughter to get old and dote sixtyfive he was getting on but he didnt feel it for fortunately perhaps considering annettes youth and good looks his second marriage had turned out a cool affair he had known but one real passion in his lifefor that first wife of hisirene yes and that fellow his cousin jolyon who had gone off with her was looking very shaky they said no wonder at seventytwo after twenty years of a third marriage  soames paused a moment in his march to lean over the railings of the row a suitable spot for reminiscence halfway between that house in park lane which had seen his birth and his parents deaths and the little house in montpellier square where thirtyfive years ago he had enjoyed his first edition of matrimony now after twenty years of his second edition that old tragedy seemed to him like a previous existencewhich had ended when fleur was born in place of the son he had hoped for for many years he had ceased regretting even vaguely the son who had not been born fleur filled the bill in his heart after all she bore his name and he was not looking forward at all to the time when she would change it indeed if he ever thought of such a calamity it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the fellow who married herwhy not since as it seemed women were equal to men nowadays and soames secretly convinced that they were not passed his curved hand over his face vigorously till it reached the comfort of his chin thanks to abstemious habits he had not grown fat and gabby his nose was pale and thin his grey moustache closeclipped his eyesight unimpaired a slight stoop closened and corrected the expansion given to his face by the heightening of his forehead in the recession of his grey hair little change had time wrought in the warmest of the young forsytes as the last of the old forsytestimothynow in his hundred and first year would have phrased it  the shade from the planetrees fell on his neat homburg hat he had given up top hatsit was no use attracting attention to wealth in days like these planetrees his thoughts travelled sharply to madridthe easter before the war when having to make up his mind about that goya picture he had taken a voyage of discovery to study the painter on his spot the fellow had impressed himgreat range real genius highly as the chap ranked he would rank even higher before they had finished with him the second goya craze would be greater even than the first oh yes and he had bought on that visit he hadas never beforecommissioned a copy of a fresco painting called la vendimia wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo who had reminded him of his daughter he had it now in the gallery at mapledurham and rather poor it wasyou couldnt copy goya he would still look at it however if his daughter were not there for the sake of something irresistibly reminiscent in the light erect balance of the figure the width between the arching eyebrows the eager dreaming of the dark eyes curious that fleur should have dark eyes when his own were greyno pure forsyte had brown eyesand her mothers blue but of course her grandmother lamottes eyes were dark as treacle  he began to walk on again toward hyde park corner no greater change in all england than in the row born almost within hail of it he could remember it from 1860 on brought there as a child between the crinolines to stare at tighttrousered dandies in whiskers riding with a cavalry seat to watch the doffing of curlybrimmed and white top hats the leisurely air of it all and the little bowlegged man in a long red waistcoat who used to come among the fashion with dogs on several strings and try to sell one to his mother king charles spaniels italian greyhounds affectionate to her crinolineyou never saw them now you saw no quality of any sort indeed just working people sitting in dull rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in pot hats riding astride or desultory colonials charging up and down on dismallooking hacks with here and there little girls on ponies or old gentlemen jogging their livers or an orderly trying a great galumphing cavalry horse no thoroughbreds no grooms no bowing no scraping no gossipnothing only the trees the samethe trees indifferent to the generations and declensions of mankind a democratic englanddishevelled hurried noisy and seemingly without an apex and that something fastidious in the soul of soames turned over within him gone forever the close borough of rank and polish wealth there wasoh yes wealthhe himself was a richer man than his father had ever been but manners flavour quality all gone engulfed in one vast ugly shoulderrubbing petrolsmelling cheerio little halfbeaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking here and there dispersed and chetif as annette would say but nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to and into this new hurlyburly of bad manners and loose morals his daughterflower of his lifewas flung and when those labour chaps got powerif they ever didthe worst was yet to come  he passed out under the archway at last no longerthank goodnessdisfigured by the gungrey of its searchlight theyd better put a searchlight on to where theyre all going he thought and light up their precious democracy and he directed his steps along the club fronts of piccadilly george forsyte of course would be sitting in the bay window of the iseeum the chap was so big now that he was there nearly all his time like some immovable sardonic humorous eye noting the decline of men and things and soames hurried ever constitutionally uneasy beneath his cousins glance george who as he had heard had written a letter signed patriot in the middle of the war complaining of the governments hysteria in docking the oats of racehorses yes there he was tall ponderous neat cleanshaven with his smooth hair hardly thinned smelling no doubt of the best hairwash and a pink paper in his hand well he didnt change and for perhaps the first time in his life soames felt a kind of sympathy tapping in his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman with his weight his perfectly parted hair and bulllike gaze he was a guarantee that the old order would take some shifting yet he saw george move the pink paper as if inviting him to ascendthe chap must want to ask something about his property it was still under soames control for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that painful period twenty years back when he had divorced irene soames had found himself almost insensibly retaining control of all purely forsyte affairs  hesitating for just a moment he nodded and went in since the death of his brotherinlaw montague dartie in paris which no one had quite known what to make of except that it was certainly not suicidethe iseeum club had seemed more respectable to soames george too he knew had sown the last of his wild oats and was committed definitely to the joys of the table eating only of the very best so as to keep his weight down and owning as he said just one or two old screws to give me an interest in life he joined his cousin therefore in the bay window without the embarrassing sense of indiscretion he had been used to feel up there george put out a wellkept hand  havent seen you since the war he said hows your wife  thanks said soames coldly well enough  some hidden jest curved for a moment georges fleshy face and gloated from his eye  that belgian chap profond he said is a member here now hes a rum customer  quite muttered soames what did you want to see me about  old timothy he might go off the hooks at any moment i suppose hes made his will  yes  well you or somebody ought to give him a look uplast of the old lot hes a hundred you know they say hes like a mummy where are you goin to put him he ought to have a pyramid by rights  soames shook his head highgate the family vault  well i suppose the old girls would miss him if he was anywhere else they say he still takes an interest in food he might last on you know dont we get anything for the old forsytes ten of themaverage age eightyeighti worked it out that ought to be equal to triplets  is that all said soames i must be getting on  you unsociable devil georges eyes seemed to answer yes thats all look him up in his mausoleumthe old chap might want to prophesy the grin died on the rich curves of his face and he added havent you attorneys invented a way yet of dodging this damned income tax it hits the fixed inherited income like the very deuce i used to have two thousand five hundred a year now ive got a beggarly fifteen hundred and the price of living doubled  ah murmured soames the turfs in danger  over georges face moved a gleam of sardonic selfdefence  well he said they brought me up to do nothing and here i am in the sear and yellow getting poorer every day these labour chaps mean to have the lot before theyve done what are you going to do for a living when it comes i shall work a sixhour day teaching politicians how to see a joke take my tip soames go into parliament make sure of your four hundredand employ me  and as soames retired he resumed his seat in the bay window  soames moved along piccadilly deep in reflections excited by his cousins words he himself had always been a worker and a saver george always a drone and a spender and yet if confiscation once began it was hethe worker and the saverwho would be looted that was the negation of all virtue the overturning of all forsyte principles could civilization be built on any other he did not think so well they wouldnt confiscate his pictures for they wouldnt know their worth but what would they be worth if these maniacs once began to milk capital a drug on the market i dont care about myself he thought i could live on five hundred a year and never know the difference at my age but fleur this fortune so widely invested these treasures so carefully chosen and amassed were all forher and if it should turn out that he couldnt give or leave them to herwell life had no meaning and what was the use of going in to look at this crazy futuristic stuff with the view of seeing whether it had any future  arriving at the gallery off cork street however he paid his shilling picked up a catalogue and entered some ten persons were prowling round soames took steps and came on what looked to him like a lamppost bent by collision with a motor omnibus it was advanced some three paces from the wall and was described in his catalogue as jupiter he examined it with curiosity having recently turned some of his attention to sculpture if thats jupiter he thought i wonder what junos like and suddenly he saw her opposite she appeared to him like nothing so much as a pump with two handles lightly clad in snow he was still gazing at her when two of the prowlers halted on his left epatant he heard one say  jargon growled soames to himself  the others boyish voice replied  missed it old bean hes pulling your leg when jove and juno created he them he was saying ill see how much these fools will swallow and theyve lapped up the lot  you young duffer vospovitch is an innovator dont you see that hes brought satire into sculpture the future of plastic art of music painting and even architecture has set in satiric it was bound to people are tiredthe bottoms tumbled out of sentiment  well im quite equal to taking a little interest in beauty i was through the war youve dropped your handkerchief sir  soames saw a handkerchief held out in front of him he took it with some natural suspicion and approached it to his nose it had the right scentof distant eau de cologneand his initials in a corner slightly reassured he raised his eyes to the young mans face it had rather fawnlike ears a laughing mouth with half a toothbrush growing out of it on each side and small lively eyes above a normally dressed appearance  thank you he said and moved by a sort of irritation added glad to hear you like beauty thats rare nowadays  i dote on it said the young man but you and i are the last of the old guard sir  soames smiled  if you really care for pictures he said heres my card i can show you some quite good ones any sunday if youre down the river and care to look in  awfully nice of you sir ill drop in like a bird my names montmichael and he took off his hat  soames already regretting his impulse raised his own slightly in response with a downward look at the young mans companion who had a purple tie dreadful little sluglike whiskers and a scornful lookas if he were a poet  it was the first indiscretion he had committed for so long that he went and sat down in an alcove what had possessed him to give his card to a rackety young fellow who went about with a thing like that and fleur always at the back of his thoughts started out like a filigree figure from a clock when the hour strikes on the screen opposite the alcove was a large canvas with a great many square tomatocoloured blobs on it and nothing else so far as soames could see from where he sat he looked at his catalogue no 32 the future townpaul post i suppose thats satiric too he thought what a thing but his second impulse was more cautious it did not do to condemn hurriedly there had been those stripey streaky creations of monets which had turned out such trumps and then the stippled school and gauguin why even since the postimpressionists there had been one or two painters not to be sneezed at during the thirtyeight years of his connoisseurs life indeed he had marked so many movements seen the tides of taste and technique so ebb and flow that there was really no telling anything except that there was money to be made out of every change of fashion this too might quite well be a case where one must subdue primordial instinct or lose the market he got up and stood before the picture trying hard to see it with the eyes of other people above the tomato blobs was what he took to be a sunset till some one passing said hes got the airplanes wonderfully dont you think below the tomato blobs was a band of white with vertical black stripes to which he could assign no meaning whatever till some one else came by murmuring what expression he gets with his foreground expression of what soames went back to his seat the thing was rich as his father would have said and he wouldnt give a damn for it expression ah they were all expressionists now he had heard on the continent so it was coming here too was it he remembered the first wave of influenza in 1887or 8hatched in china so they said he wondered where thisthis expressionism had been hatched the thing was a regular disease  he had become conscious of a woman and a youth standing between him and the future town their backs were turned but very suddenly soames put his catalogue before his face and drawing his hat forward gazed through the slit between no mistaking that back elegant as ever though the hair above had gone grey irene his divorced wifeirene and this no doubt washer sonby that fellow jolyon forsytetheir boy six months older than his own girl and mumbling over in his mind the bitter days of his divorce he rose to get out of sight but quickly sat down again she had turned her head to speak to her boy her profile was still so youthful that it made her grey hair seem powdery as if fancydressed and her lips were smiling as soames first possessor of them had never seen them smile grudgingly he admitted her still beautiful and in figure almost as young as ever and how that boy smiled back at her emotion squeezed soames heart the sight infringed his sense of justice he grudged her that boys smileit went beyond what fleur gave him and it was undeserved their son might have been his son fleur might have been her daughter if she had kept straight he lowered his catalogue if she saw him all the better a reminder of her conduct in the presence of her son who probably knew nothing of it would be a salutary touch from the finger of that nemesis which surely must soon or late visit her then halfconscious that such a thought was extravagant for a forsyte of his age soames took out his watch past four fleur was late she had gone to his niece imogen cardigans and there they would keep her smoking cigarettes and gossiping and that he heard the boy laugh and say eagerly i say mum is this by one of auntie junes lame ducks  paul posti believe it is darling  the word produced a little shock in soames he had never heard her use it and then she saw him his eyes must have had in them something of george forsytes sardonic look for her gloved hand crisped the folds of her frock her eyebrows rose her face went stony she moved on  it is a caution said the boy catching her arm again  soames stared after them that boy was goodlooking with a forsyte chin and eyes deepgrey deep in but with something sunny like a glass of old sherry spilled over him his smile perhaps his hair better than they deservedthose two they passed from his view into the next room and soames continued to regard the future town but saw it not a little smile snarled up his lips he was despising the vehemence of his own feelings after all these years ghosts and yet as one grew oldwas there anything but what was ghostlike left yes there was fleur he fixed his eyes on the entrance she was due but she would keep him waiting of course and suddenly he became aware of a sort of human breezea short slight form clad in a seagreen djibbah with a metal belt and a fillet binding unruly redgold hair all streaked with grey she was talking to the gallery attendants and something familiar riveted his gazein her eyes her chin her hair her spiritsomething which suggested a thin skye terrier just before its dinner surely june forsyte his cousin juneand coming straight to his recess she sat down beside him deep in thought took out a tablet and made a pencil note soames sat unmoving a confounded thing cousinship disgusting he heard her murmur then as if resenting the presence of an overhearing stranger she looked at him the worst had happened  soames  soames turned his head a very little  how are you he said havent seen you for twenty years  no whatever made you come here  my sins said soames what stuff  stuff oh yesof course it hasnt arrived yet  it never will said soames it must be making a dead loss  of course it is  how dyou know  its my gallery  soames sniffed from sheer surprise  yours what on earth makes you run a show like this  i dont treat art as if it were grocery  soames pointed to the future town look at that whos going to live in a town like that or with it on his walls  june contemplated the picture for a moment  its a vision she said  the deuce  there was silence then june rose crazylooking creature he thought  well he said youll find your young stepbrother here with a woman i used to know if you take my advice youll close this exhibition  june looked back at him oh you forsyte she said and moved on about her light flyaway figure passing so suddenly away was a look of dangerous decisions forsyte of course he was a forsyte and so was she but from the time when as a mere girl she brought bosinney into his life to wreck it he had never hit it off with june and never would and here she was unmarried to this day owning a gallery and suddenly it came to soames how little he knew now of his own family the old aunts at timothys had been dead so many years there was no clearinghouse for news what had they all done in the war young rogers boy had been wounded st john haymans second son killed young nicholas eldest had got an o b e or whatever they gave them they had all joined up somehow he believed that boy of jolyons and irenes he supposed had been too young his own generation of course too old though giles hayman had driven a car for the red crossand jesse hayman been a special constablethose dromios had always been of a sporting type as for himself he had given a motor ambulance read the papers till he was sick of them passed through much anxiety bought no clothes lost seven pounds in weight he didnt know what more he could have done at his age indeed thinking it over it struck him that he and his family had taken this war very differently to that affair with the boers which had been supposed to tax all the resources of the empire in that old war of course his nephew val dartie had been wounded that fellow jolyons first son had died of enteric the dromios had gone out on horses and june had been a nurse but all that had seemed in the nature of a portent while in this war everybody had done their bit so far as he could make out as a matter of course it seemed to show the growth of something or otheror perhaps the decline of something else had the forsytes become less individual or more imperial or less provincial or was it simply that one hated germans why didnt fleur come so that he could get away he saw those three return together from the other room and pass back along the far side of the screen the boy was standing before the juno now and suddenly on the other side of her soames sawhis daughter with eyebrows raised as well they might be he could see her eyes glint sideways at the boy and the boy look back at her then irene slipped her hand through his arm and drew him on soames saw him glancing round and fleur looking after them as the three went out  a voice said cheerfully bit thick isnt it sir  the young man who had handed him his handkerchief was again passing soames nodded  i dont know what were coming to  oh thats all right sir answered the young man cheerfully they dont either  fleurs voice said hallo father here you are precisely as if he had been keeping her waiting  the young man snatching off his hat passed on  well said soames looking her up and down youre a punctual sort of young woman  this treasured possession of his life was of medium height and colour with short dark chestnut hair her wideapart brown eyes were set in whites so clear that they glinted when they moved and yet in repose were almost dreamy under very white blacklashed lids held over them in a sort of suspense she had a charming profile and nothing of her father in her face save a decided chin aware that his expression was softening as he looked at her soames frowned to preserve the unemotionalism proper to a forsyte he knew she was only too inclined to take advantage of his weakness  slipping her hand under his arm she said  who was that  he picked up my handkerchief we talked about the pictures  youre not going to buy that father  no said soames grimly nor that juno youve been looking at  fleur dragged at his arm oh lets go its a ghastly show  in the doorway they passed the young man called mont and his partner but soames had hung out a board marked trespassers will be prosecuted and he barely acknowledged the young fellows salute  well he said in the street whom did you meet at imogens  aunt winifred and that monsieur profond  oh muttered soames that chap what does your aunt see in him  i dont know he looks pretty deepmother says she likes him  soames grunted  cousin val and his wife were there too  what said soames i thought they were back in south africa  oh no theyve sold their farm cousin val is going to train racehorses on the sussex downs theyve got a jolly old manorhouse they asked me down there  soames coughed the news was distasteful to him whats his wife like now  very quiet but nice i think  soames coughed again hes a rackety chap your cousin val  oh no father theyre awfully devoted i promised to gosaturday to wednesday next  training racehorses said soames it was extravagant but not the reason for his distaste why the deuce couldnt his nephew have stayed out in south africa his own divorce had been bad enough without his nephews marriage to the daughter of the corespondent a halfsister too of june and of that boy whom fleur had just been looking at from under the pumphandle if he didnt look out she would come to know all about that old disgrace unpleasant things they were round him this afternoon like a swarm of bees  i dont like it he said  i want to see the racehorses murmured fleur and theyve promised i shall ride cousin val cant walk much you know but he can ride perfectly hes going to show me their gallops  racing said soames its a pity the war didnt knock that on the head hes taking after his father im afraid  i dont know anything about his father  no said soames grimly he took an interest in horses and broke his neck in paris walking downstairs good riddance for your aunt he frowned recollecting the inquiry into those stairs which he had attended in paris six years ago because montague dartie could not attend it himselfperfectly normal stairs in a house where they played baccarat either his winnings or the way he had celebrated them had gone to his brotherinlaws head the french procedure had been very loose he had had a lot of trouble with it  a sound from fleur distracted his attention look the people who were in the gallery with us  what people muttered soames who knew perfectly well  i think that womans beautiful  come into this pastrycooks said soames abruptly and tightening his grip on her arm he turned into a confectioners it wasfor hima surprising thing to do and he said rather anxiously what will you have  oh i dont want anything i had a cocktail and a tremendous lunch  we must have something now were here muttered soames keeping hold of her arm  two teas he said and two of those nougat things  but no sooner was his body seated than his soul sprang up those threethose three were coming in he heard irene say something to her boy and his answer  oh no mum this place is all right my stunt and the three sat down  at that moment most awkward of his existence crowded with ghosts and shadows from his past in presence of the only two women he had ever lovedhis divorced wife and his daughter by her successorsoames was not so much afraid of them as of his cousin june she might make a sceneshe might introduce those two childrenshe was capable of anything he bit too hastily at the nougat and it stuck to his plate working at it with his finger he glanced at fleur she was masticating dreamily but her eyes were on the boy the forsyte in him said think feel and youre done for and he wiggled his finger desperately plate did jolyon wear a plate did that woman wear a plate time had been when he had seen her wearing nothing that was something anyway which had never been stolen from him and she knew it though she might sit there calm and selfpossessed as if she had never been his wife an acid humour stirred in his forsyte blood a subtle pain divided by hairs breadth from pleasure if only june did not suddenly bring her hornets about his ears the boy was talking  of course auntie juneso he called his halfsister auntie did hewell she must be fifty if she was a dayits jolly good of you to encourage them onlyhang it all soames stole a glance irenes startled eyes were bent watchfully on her boy sheshe had these devotionsfor bosinneyfor that boys fatherfor this boy he touched fleurs arm and said  well have you had enough  one more father please  she would be sick he went to the counter to pay when he turned round again he saw fleur standing near the door holding a handkerchief which the boy had evidently just handed to her  f f he heard her say fleur forsyteits mine all right thank you ever so  good god she had caught the trick from what hed told her in the gallerymonkey  forsyte whythats my name too perhaps were cousins  really we must be there arent any others i live at mapledurham where do you  robin hill  question and answer had been so rapid that all was over before he could lift a finger he saw irenes face alive with startled feeling gave the slightest shake of his head and slipped his arm through fleurs  come along he said  she did not move  didnt you hear father isnt it queerour names the same are we cousins  whats that he said forsyte distant perhaps  my names jolyon sir jon for short  oh ah said soames yes distant how are you very good of you goodbye  he moved on  thanks awfully fleur was saying au revoir  au revoir he heard the boy reply     iifine fleur forsyte  emerging from the pastrycooks soames first impulse was to vent his nerves by saying to his daughter dropping your handkerchief to which her reply might well be i picked that up from you his second impulse therefore was to let sleeping dogs lie but she would surely question him he gave her a sidelong look and found she was giving him the same she said softly  why dont you like those cousins father soames lifted the corner of his lip  what made you think that  cela se voit  that sees itself what a way of putting it after twenty years of a french wife soames had still little sympathy with her language a theatrical affair and connected in his mind with all the refinements of domestic irony  how he asked  you must know them and you didnt make a sign i saw them looking at you  ive never seen the boy in my life replied soames with perfect truth  no but youve seen the others dear  soames gave her another look what had she picked up had her aunt winifred or imogen or val dartie and his wife been talking every breath of the old scandal had been carefully kept from her at home and winifred warned many times that he wouldnt have a whisper of it reach her for the world so far as she ought to know he had never been married before but her dark eyes whose southern glint and clearness often almost frightened him met his with perfect innocence  well he said your grandfather and his brother had a quarrel the two families dont know each other  how romantic  now what does she mean by that he thought the word was to him extravagant and dangerousit was as if she had said how jolly  and theyll continue not to know each other he added but instantly regretted the challenge in those words fleur was smiling in this age when young people prided themselves on going their own ways and paying no attention to any sort of decent prejudice he had said the very thing to excite her wilfulness then recollecting the expression on irenes face he breathed again  what sort of a quarrel he heard fleur say  about a house its ancient history for you your grandfather died the day you were born he was ninety  ninety are there many forsytes besides those in the red book  i dont know said soames theyre all dispersed now the old ones are dead except timothy  fleur clasped her hands  timothy isnt that delicious  not at all said soames it offended him that she should think timothy deliciousa kind of insult to his breed this new generation mocked at anything solid and tenacious you go and see the old boy he might want to prophesy ah if timothy could see the disquiet england of his greatnephews and greatnieces he would certainly give tongue and involuntarily he glanced up at the iseeum yesgeorge was still in the window with the same pink paper in his hand  where is robin hill father  robin hill robin hill round which all that tragedy had centred what did she want to know for  in surrey he muttered not far from richmond why  is the house there  what house  that they quarrelled about  yes but whats all that to do with you were going home tomorrowyoud better be thinking about your frocks  bless you theyre all thought about a family feud its like the bible or mark twainawfully exciting what did you do in the feud father  never you mind  oh but if im to keep it up  who said you were to keep it up  you darling  i i said it had nothing to do with you  just what i think you know so thats all right  she was too sharp for him fine as annette sometimes called her nothing for it but to distract her attention  theres a bit of rosaline point in here he said stopping before a shop that i thought you might like  when he had paid for it and they had resumed their progress fleur said  dont you think that boys mother is the most beautiful woman of her age youve ever seen  soames shivered uncanny the way she stuck to it  i dont know that i noticed her  dear i saw the corner of your eye  you see everythingand a great deal more it seems to me  whats her husband like he must be your first cousin if your fathers were brothers  dead for all i know said soames with sudden vehemence i havent seen him for twenty years  what was he  a painter  thats quite jolly  the words if you want to please me youll put those people out of your head sprang to soames lips but he choked them backhe must not let her see his feelings  he once insulted me he said  her quick eyes rested on his face  i see you didnt avenge it and it rankles poor father you let me have a go  it was really like lying in the dark with a mosquito hovering above his face such pertinacity in fleur was new to him and as they reached the hotel he said grimly  i did my best and thats enough about these people im going up till dinner  i shall sit here  with a parting look at her extended in a chaira look halfresentful halfadoringsoames moved into the lift and was transported to their suite on the fourth floor he stood by the window of the sittingroom which gave view over hyde park and drummed a finger on its pane his feelings were confused tetchy troubled the throb of that old wound scarred over by time and new interests was mingled with displeasure and anxiety and a slight pain in his chest where that nougat stuff had disagreed had annette come in not that she was any good to him in such a difficulty whenever she had questioned him about his first marriage he had always shut her up she knew nothing of it save that it had been the great passion of his life and his marriage with herself but domestic makeshift she had always kept the grudge of that up her sleeve as it were and used it commercially he listened a soundthe vague murmur of a womans movementswas coming through the door she was in he tapped  who  i said soames  she had been changing her frock and was still imperfectly clothed a striking figure before her glass there was a certain magnificence about her arms shoulders hair which had darkened since he first knew her about the turn of her neck the silkiness of her garments her darklashed greyblue eyesshe was certainly as handsome at forty as she had ever been a fine possession an excellent housekeeper a sensible and affectionate enough mother if only she werent always so frankly cynical about the relations between them soames who had no more real affection for her than she had for him suffered from a kind of english grievance in that she had never dropped even the thinnest veil of sentiment over their partnership like most of his countrymen and women he held the view that marriage should be based on mutual love but that when from a marriage love had disappeared or been found never to have really existedso that it was manifestly not based on loveyou must not admit it there it was and the love was notbut there you were and must continue to be thus you had it both ways and were not tarred with cynicism realism and immorality like the french moreover it was necessary in the interests of property he knew that she knew that they both knew there was no love between them but he still expected her not to admit in words or conduct such a thing and he could never understand what she meant when she talked of the hypocrisy of the english he said  whom have you got at the shelter next week  annette went on touching her lips delicately with salvehe always wished she wouldnt do that  your sister winifred and the carrdigansshe took up a tiny stick of blackand prosper profond  that belgian chap why him  annette turned her neck lazily touched one eyelash and said  he amuses winifred  i want some one to amuse fleur shes restive  rrestive repeated annette is it the first time you see that my friend she was born rrestive as you call it  would she never get that affected roll out of her rs  he touched the dress she had taken off and asked  what have you been doing  annette looked at him reflected in her glass her justbrightened lips smiled rather full rather ironical  enjoying myself she said  oh answered soames glumly ribbandry i suppose  it was his word for all that incomprehensible running in and out of shops that women went in for has fleur got her summer dresses  you dont ask if i have mine  you dont care whether i do or not  quite right well she has and i have mineterribly expensive  hm said soames what does that chap profond do in england  annette raised the eyebrows she had just finished  he yachts  ah said soames hes a sleepy chap  sometimes answered annette and her face had a sort of quiet enjoyment but sometimes very amusing  hes got a touch of the tarbrush about him  annette stretched herself  tarbrush she said what is that his mother was armenienne  thats it then muttered soames does he know anything about pictures  he knows about everythinga man of the world  well get some one for fleur i want to distract her shes going off on saturday to val dartie and his wife i dont like it  why not  since the reason could not be explained without going into family history soames merely answered  racketing about theres too much of it  i like that little mrs val she is very quiet and clever  i know nothing of her exceptthis things new and soames took up a creation from the bed  annette received it from him  would you hook me she said  soames hooked glancing once over her shoulder into the glass he saw the expression on her face faintly amused faintly contemptuous as much as to say thanks you will never learn no thank god he wasnt a frenchman he finished with a jerk and the words its too low here and he went to the door with the wish to get away from her and go down to fleur again  annette stayed a powderpuff and said with startling suddenness  que tu es grossier  he knew the expressionhe had reason to the first time she had used it he had thought it meant what a grocer you are and had not known whether to be relieved or not when better informed he resented the wordhe was not coarse if he was coarse what was that chap in the room beyond his who made those horrible noises in the morning when he cleared his throat or those people in the lounge who thought it wellbred to say nothing but what the whole world could hear at the top of their voicesquacking inanity coarse because he had said her dress was low well so it was he went out without reply  coming into the lounge from the far end he at once saw fleur where he had left her she sat with crossed knees slowly balancing a foot in silk stocking and grey shoe sure sign that she was dreaming her eyes showed it toothey went off like that sometimes and then in a moment she would come to life and be as quick and restless as a monkey and she knew so much so selfassured and not yet nineteen what was that odious word flapper dreadful young creaturessquealing and squawking and showing their legs the worst of them bad dreams the best of them powdered angels fleur was not a flapper not one of those slangy illbred young females and yet she was frighteningly selfwilled and full of life and determined to enjoy it enjoy the word brought no puritan terror to soames but it brought the terror suited to his temperament he had always been afraid to enjoy today for fear he might not enjoy tomorrow so much and it was terrifying to feel that his daughter was divested of that safeguard the very way she sat in that chair showed itlost in her dream he had never been lost in a dream himselfthere was nothing to be had out of it and where she got it from he did not know certainly not from annette and yet annette as a young girl when he was hanging about her had once had a flowery look well she had lost it now  fleur rose from her chairswiftly restlessly and flung herself down at a writingtable seizing ink and writing paper she began to write as if she had not time to breathe before she got her letter written and suddenly she saw him the air of desperate absorption vanished she smiled waved a kiss made a pretty face as if she were a little puzzled and a little bored  ah she was finefine     iiiat robin hill  jolyon forsyte had spent his boys nineteenth birthday at robin hill quietly going into his affairs he did everything quietly now because his heart was in a poor way and like all his family he disliked the idea of dying he had never realised how much till one day two years ago he had gone to his doctor about certain symptoms and been told  at any moment on any overstrain  he had taken it with a smilethe natural forsyte reaction against an unpleasant truth but with an increase of symptoms in the train on the way home he had realised to the full the sentence hanging over him to leave irene his boy his home his workthough he did little enough work now to leave them for unknown darkness for the unimaginable state for such nothingness that he would not even be conscious of wind stirring leaves above his grave nor of the scent of earth and grass of such nothingness that however hard he might try to conceive it he never could and must still hover on the hope that he might see again those he loved to realise this was to endure very poignant spiritual anguish before he reached home that day he had determined to keep it from irene he would have to be more careful than man had ever been for the least thing would give it away and make her as wretched as himself almost his doctor had passed him sound in other respects and seventy was nothing of an agehe would last a long time yet if he could  such a conclusion followed out for nearly two years develops to the full the subtler side of character naturally not abrupt except when nervously excited jolyon had become control incarnate the sad patience of old people who cannot exert themselves was masked by a smile which his lips preserved even in private he devised continually all manner of cover to conceal his enforced lack of exertion  mocking himself for so doing he counterfeited conversion to the simple life gave up wine and cigars drank a special kind of coffee with no coffee in it in short he made himself as safe as a forsyte in his condition could under the rose of his mild irony secure from discovery since his wife and son had gone up to town he had spent the fine may day quietly arranging his papers that he might die tomorrow without inconveniencing any one giving in fact a final polish to his terrestrial state having docketed and enclosed it in his fathers old chinese cabinet he put the key into an envelope wrote the words outside key of the chinese cabinet wherein will be found the exact state of me j f and put it in his breastpocket where it would be always about him in case of accident then ringing for tea he went out to have it under the old oaktree  all are under sentence of death jolyon whose sentence was but a little more precise and pressing had become so used to it that he thought habitually like other people of other things he thought of his son now  jon was nineteen that day and jon had come of late to a decision educated neither at eton like his father nor at harrow like his dead halfbrother but at one of those establishments which designed to avoid the evil and contain the good of the public school system may or may not contain the evil and avoid the good jon had left in april perfectly ignorant of what he wanted to become the war which had promised to go on for ever had ended just as he was about to join the army six months before his time it had taken him ever since to get used to the idea that he could now choose for himself he had held with his father several discussions from which under a cheery show of being ready for anythingexcept of course the church army law stage stock exchange medicine business and engineeringjolyon had gathered rather clearly that jon wanted to go in for nothing he himself had felt exactly like that at the same age with him that pleasant vacuity had soon been ended by an early marriage and its unhappy consequences forced to become an underwriter at lloyds he had regained prosperity before his artistic talent had outcropped but havingas the simple saylearned his boy to draw pigs and other animals he knew that jon would never be a painter and inclined to the conclusion that his aversion from everything else meant that he was going to be a writer holding however the view that experience was necessary even for that profession there seemed to jolyon nothing in the meantime for jon but university travel and perhaps the eating of dinners for the bar after that one would see or more probably one would not in face of these proffered allurements however jon had remained undecided  such discussions with his son had confirmed in jolyon a doubt whether the world had really changed people said that it was a new age with the profundity of one not too long for any age jolyon perceived that under slightly different surfaces the era was precisely what it had been mankind was still divided into two species the few who had speculation in their souls and the many who had none with a belt of hybrids like himself in the middle jon appeared to have speculation it seemed to his father a bad lookout  with something deeper therefore than his usual smile he had heard the boy say a fortnight ago i should like to try farming dad if it wont cost you too much it seems to be about the only sort of life that doesnt hurt anybody except art and of course thats out of the question for me  jolyon subdued his smile and answered  all right you shall skip back to where we were under the first jolyon in 1760 itll prove the cycle theory and incidentally no doubt you may grow a better turnip than he did  a little dashed jon had answered  but dont you think its a good scheme dad  twill serve my dear and if you should really take to it youll do more good than most men which is little enough  to himself however he had said but he wont take to it i give him four years still its healthy and harmless  after turning the matter over and consulting with irene he wrote to his daughter mrs val dartie asking if they knew of a farmer near them on the downs who would take jon as an apprentice hollys answer had been enthusiastic there was an excellent man quite close she and val would love jon to live with them  the boy was due to go tomorrow  sipping weak tea with lemon in it jolyon gazed through the leaves of the old oaktree at that view which had appeared to him desirable for thirtytwo years the tree beneath which he sat seemed not a day older so young the little leaves of brownish gold so old the whiteygreygreen of its thick rough trunk a tree of memories which would live on hundreds of years yet unless some barbarian cut it downwould see old england out at the pace things were going he remembered a night three years before when looking from his window with his arm close round irene he had watched a german aeroplane hovering it seemed right over the old tree next day they had found a bomb hole in a field on gages farm that was before he knew that he was under sentence of death he could almost have wished the bomb had finished him it would have saved a lot of hanging about many hours of cold fear in the pit of his stomach he had counted on living to the normal forsyte age of eightyfive or more when irene would be seventy as it was she would miss him still there was jon more important in her life than himself jon who adored his mother  under that tree where old jolyonwaiting for irene to come to him across the lawnhad breathed his last jolyon wondered whimsically whether having put everything in such perfect order he had not better close his own eyes and drift away there was something undignified in parasitically clinging on to the effortless close of a life wherein he regretted two things onlythe long division between his father and himself when he was young and the lateness of his union with irene  from where he sat he could see a cluster of appletrees in blossom nothing in nature moved him so much as fruittrees in blossom and his heart ached suddenly because he might never see them flower again spring decidedly no man ought to have to die while his heart was still young enough to love beauty blackbirds sang recklessly in the shrubbery swallows were flying high the leaves above him glistened and over the fields was every imaginable tint of early foliage burnished by the level sunlight away to where the distant smokebush blue was trailed along the horizon irenes flowers in their narrow beds had startling individuality that evening little deep assertions of gay life only chinese and japanese painters and perhaps leonardo had known how to get that startling little ego into each painted flower and bird and beastthe ego yet the sense of species the universality of life as well they were the fellows ive made nothing that will live thought jolyon ive been an amateura mere lover not a creator still i shall leave jon behind me when i go what luck that the boy had not been caught by that ghastly war he might so easily have been killed like poor jolly twenty years ago out in the transvaal jon would do something some dayif the age didnt spoil himan imaginative chap his whim to take up farming was but a bit of sentiment and about as likely to last and just then he saw them coming up the field irene and the boy walking from the station with their arms linked and getting up he strolled down through the new rose garden to meet them  irene came into his room that night and sat down by the window she sat there without speaking till he said  what is it my love  we had an encounter today  with whom  soames  soames he had kept that name out of his thoughts these last two years conscious that it was bad for him and now his heart moved in a disconcerting manner as if it had sideslipped within his chest  irene went on quietly  he and his daughter were in the gallery and afterward at the confectioners where we had tea  jolyon went over and put his hand on her shoulder  how did he look  grey but otherwise much the same  and the daughter  pretty at least jon thought so  jolyons heart sideslipped again his wifes face had a strained and puzzled look  you didnt he began  no but jon knows their name the girl dropped her handkerchief and he picked it up  jolyon sat down on his bed an evil chance  june was with you did she put her foot into it  no but it was all very queer and strained and jon could see it was  jolyon drew a long breath and said  ive often wondered whether weve been right to keep it from him hell find out some day  the later the better jolyon the young have such cheap hard judgment when you were nineteen what would you have thought of your mother if she had done what i have  yes there it was jon worshipped his mother and knew nothing of the tragedies the inexorable necessities of life nothing of the prisoned grief in an unhappy marriage nothing of jealousy or passionknew nothing at all as yet  what have you told him he said at last  that they were relations but we didnt know them that you had never cared much for your family or they for you i expect he will be asking you  jolyon smiled this promises to take the place of airraids he said after all one misses them  irene looked up at him  weve known it would come some day  he answered her with sudden energy  i could never stand seeing jon blame you he shant do that even in thought he has imagination and hell understand if its put to him properly i think i had better tell him before he gets to know otherwise  not yet jolyon  that was like hershe had no foresight and never went to meet trouble stillwho knewshe might be right it was ill going against a mothers instinct it might be well to let the boy go on if possible till experience had given him some touchstone by which he could judge the values of that old tragedy till love jealousy longing had deepened his charity all the same one must take precautionsevery precaution possible and long after irene had left him he lay awake turning over those precautions he must write to holly telling her that jon knew nothing as yet of family history holly was discreet she would make sure of her husband she would see to it jon could take the letter with him when he went tomorrow  and so the day on which he had put the polish on his material estate died out with the chiming of the stable clock and another began for jolyon in the shadow of a spiritual disorder which could not be so rounded off and polished  but jon whose room had once been his day nursery lay awake too the prey of a sensation disputed by those who have never known it love at first sight he had felt it beginning in him with the glint of those dark eyes gazing into his athwart the junoa conviction that this was his dream so that what followed had seemed to him at once natural and miraculous fleur her name alone was almost enough for one who was terribly susceptible to the charm of words in a homoeopathic age when boys and girls were coeducated and mixed up in early life till sex was almost abolished jon was singularly oldfashioned his modern school took boys only and his holidays had been spent at robin hill with boy friends or his parents alone he had never therefore been inoculated against the germs of love by small doses of the poison and now in the dark his temperature was mounting fast he lay awake featuring fleuras they called itrecalling her words especially that au revoir so soft and sprightly  he was still so wide awake at dawn that he got up slipped on tennis shoes trousers and a sweater and in silence crept downstairs and out through the study window it was just light there was a smell of grass fleur he thought fleur it was mysteriously white out of doors with nothing awake except the birds just beginning to chirp ill go down into the coppice he thought he ran down through the fields reached the pond just as the sun rose and passed into the coppice bluebells carpeted the ground there among the larchtrees there was mysterythe air as it were composed of that romantic quality jon sniffed its freshness and stared at the bluebells in the sharpening light fleur it rhymed with her and she lived at mapledurama jolly name too on the river somewhere he could find it in the atlas presently he would write to her but would she answer oh she must she had said au revoir not goodbye what luck that she had dropped her handkerchief he would never have known her but for that and the more he thought of that handkerchief the more amazing his luck seemed fleur it certainly rhymed with her rhythm thronged his head words jostled to be joined together he was on the verge of a poem  jon remained in this condition for more than half an hour then returned to the house and getting a ladder climbed in at his bedroom window out of sheer exhilaration then remembering that the study window was open he went down and shut it first removing the ladder so as to obliterate all traces of his feeling the thing was too deep to be revealed to mortal soulevento his mother     ivthe mausoleum  there are houses whose souls have passed into the limbo of time leaving their bodies in the limbo of london such was not quite the condition of timothys on the bayswater road for timothys soul still had one foot in timothy forsytes body and smither kept the atmosphere unchanging of camphor and port wine and house whose windows are only opened to air it twice a day  to forsyte imagination that house was now a sort of chinese pillbox a series of layers in the last of which was timothy one did not reach him or so it was reported by members of the family who out of oldtime habit or absentmindedness would drive up once in a blue moon and ask after their surviving uncle such were francie now quite emancipated from god she frankly avowed atheism euphemia emancipated from old nicholas and winifred dartie from her man of the world but after all everybody was emancipated now or said they wereperhaps not quite the same thing  when soames therefore took it on his way to paddington station on the morning after that encounter it was hardly with the expectation of seeing timothy in the flesh his heart made a faint demonstration within him while he stood in full south sunlight on the newly whitened doorstep of that little house where four forsytes had once lived and now but one dwelt on like a winter fly the house into which soames had come and out of which he had gone times without number divested of or burdened with fardels of family gossip the house of the old people of another century another age  the sight of smitherstill corseted up to the armpits because the new fashion which came in as they were going out about 1903 had never been considered nice by aunts juley and hesterbrought a pale friendliness to soames lips smither still faithfully arranged to old pattern in every detail an invaluable servantnone such leftsmiling back at him with the words why its mr soames after all this time and how are you sir mr timothy will be so pleased to know youve been  how is he  oh he keeps fairly bobbish for his age sir but of course hes a wonderful man as i said to mrs dartie when she was here last it would please miss forsyte and mrs juley and miss hester to see how he relishes a baked apple still but hes quite deaf and a mercy i always think for what we should have done with him in the airraids i dont know  ah said soames what did you do with him  we just left him in his bed and had the bell run down into the cellar so that cook and i could hear him if he rang it would never have done to let him know there was a war on as i said to cook if mr timothy rings they may do what they likeim going up my dear mistresses would have a fit if they could see him ringing and nobody going to him but he slept through them all beautiful and the one in the daytime he was having his bath it was a mercy because he might have noticed the people in the street all looking uphe often looks out of the window  quite murmured soames smither was getting garrulous i just want to look round and see if theres anything to be done  yes sir i dont think theres anything except a smell of mice in the diningroom that we dont know how to get rid of its funny they should be there and not a crumb since mr timothy took to not coming down just before the war but theyre nasty little things you never know where theyll take you next  does he leave his bed  oh yes sir he takes nice exercise between his bed and the window in the morning not to risk a change of air and hes quite comfortable in himself has his will out every day regular its a great consolation to himthat  well smither i want to see him if i can in case he has anything to say to me  smither coloured up above her corsets  it will be an occasion she said shall i take you round the house sir while i send cook to break it to him  no you go to him said soames i can go round the house by myself  one could not confess to sentiment before another and soames felt that he was going to be sentimental nosing round those rooms so saturated with the past when smither creaking with excitement had left him soames entered the diningroom and sniffed in his opinion it wasnt mice but incipient woodrot and he examined the panelling whether it was worth a coat of paint at timothys age he was not sure the room had always been the most modern in the house and only a faint smile curled soames lips and nostrils walls of a rich green surmounted the oak dado a heavy metal chandelier hung by a chain from a ceiling divided by imitation beams the pictures had been bought by timothy a bargain one day at jobsons sixty years agothree snyder still lifes two faintly coloured drawings of a boy and a girl rather charming which bore the initials j rtimothy had always believed they might turn out to be joshua reynolds but soames who admired them had discovered that they were only john robinson and a doubtful morland of a white pony being shod deepred plush curtains ten highbacked dark mahogany chairs with deepred plush seats a turkey carpet and a mahogany diningtable as large as the room was small such was an apartment which soames could remember unchanged in soul or body since he was four years old he looked especially at the two drawings and thought i shall buy those at the sale  from the diningroom he passed into timothys study he did not remember ever having been in that room it was lined from floor to ceiling with volumes and he looked at them with curiosity one wall seemed devoted to educational books which timothys firm had published two generations backsometimes as many as twenty copies of one book soames read their titles and shuddered the middle wall had precisely the same books as used to be in the library at his own fathers in park lane from which he deduced the fancy that james and his youngest brother had gone out together one day and bought a brace of small libraries the third wall he approached with more excitement here surely timothys own taste would be found it was the books were dummies the fourth wall was all heavily curtained window and turned toward it was a large chair with a mahogany readingstand attached on which a yellowish and folded copy of the times dated july 6 1914 the day timothy first failed to come down as if in preparation for the war seemed waiting for him still in a corner stood a large globe of that world never visited by timothy deeply convinced of the unreality of everything but england and permanently upset by the sea on which he had been very sick one sunday afternoon in 1836 out of a pleasure boat off the pier at brighton with juley and hester swithin and hatty chessman all due to swithin who was always taking things into his head and who thank goodness had been sick too soames knew all about it having heard the tale fifty times at least from one or other of them he went up to the globe and gave it a spin it emitted a faint creak and moved about an inch bringing into his purview a daddylonglegs which had died on it in latitude 44  mausoleum he thought george was right and he went out and up the stairs on the halflanding he stopped before the case of stuffed hummingbirds which had delighted his childhood they looked not a day older suspended on wires above pampasgrass if the case were opened the birds would not begin to hum but the whole thing would crumble he suspected it wouldnt be worth putting that into the sale and suddenly he was caught by a memory of aunt anndear old aunt annholding him by the hand in front of that case and saying look soamey arent they bright and pretty dear little hummingbirds soames remembered his own answer they dont hum auntie he must have been six in a black velveteen suit with a lightblue collarhe remembered that suit well aunt ann with her ringlets and her spidery kind hands and her grave old aquiline smilea fine old lady aunt ann he moved on up to the drawingroom door there on each side of it were the groups of miniatures those he would certainly buy in the miniatures of his four aunts one of his uncle swithin adolescent and one of his uncle nicholas as a boy they had all been painted by a young lady friend of the family at a time 1830 about when miniatures were considered very genteel and lasting too painted as they were on ivory many a time had he heard the tale of that young lady very talented my dear she had quite a weakness for swithin and very soon after she went into a consumption and died so like keatswe often spoke of it  well there they were ann juley hester susanquite a small child swithin with skyblue eyes pink cheeks yellow curls white waistcoatlarge as life and nicholas like cupid with an eye on heaven now he came to think of it uncle nick had always been rather like thata wonderful man to the last yes she must have had talent and miniatures always had a certain backwatered cachet of their own little subject to the currents of competition on aesthetic change soames opened the drawingroom door the room was dusted the furniture uncovered the curtains drawn back precisely as if his aunts still dwelt there patiently waiting and a thought came to him when timothy diedwhy not would it not be almost a duty to preserve this houselike carlylesand put up a tablet and show it specimen of midvictorian abodeentrance one shilling with catalogue after all it was the completest thing and perhaps the deadest in the london of today perfect in its special taste and culture if that is he took down and carried over to his own collection the four barbizon pictures he had given them the still skyblue walls tile green curtains patterned with red flowers and ferns the crewelworked firescreen before the castiron grate the mahogany cupboard with glass windows full of little knickknacks the beaded footstools keats shelley southey cowper coleridge byrons corsair but nothing else and the victorian poets in a bookshelf row the marqueterie cabinet lined with dim red plush full of family relics hesters first fan the buckles of their mothers fathers shoes three bottled scorpions and one very yellow elephants tusk sent home from india by greatuncle edgar forsyte who had been in jute a yellow bit of paper propped up with spidery writing on it recording god knew what and the pictures crowding on the wallsall watercolours save those four barbizons looking like the foreigners they were and doubtful customers at thatpictures bright and illustrative telling the bees hey for the ferry and two in the style of frith all thimblerig and crinolines given them by swithin oh many many pictures at which soames had gazed a thousand times in supercilious fascination a marvellous collection of bright smooth gilt frames  and the boudoirgrand piano beautifully dusted hermetically sealed as ever and aunt juleys album of pressed seaweed on it and the giltlegged chairs stronger than they looked and on one side of the fireplace the sofa of crimson silk where aunt ann and after her aunt juley had been wont to sit facing the light and bolt upright and on the other side of the fire the one really easy chair back to the light for aunt hester soames screwed up his eyes he seemed to see them sitting there ah and the atmosphereeven now of too many stuffs and washed lace curtains lavender in bags and dried bees wings no he thought theres nothing like it left it ought to be preserved and by george they might laugh at it but for a standard of gentle life never departed from for fastidiousness of skin and eye and nose and feeling it beat today hollowtoday with its tubes and cars its perpetual smoking its crosslegged barenecked girls visible up to the knees and down to the waist if you took the trouble agreeable to the satyr within each forsyte but hardly his idea of a lady with their feet too screwed round the legs of their chairs while they ate and their so longs and their old beans and their laughtergirls who gave him the shudders whenever he thought of fleur in contact with them and the hardeyed capable older women who managed life and gave him the shudders too no his old aunts if they never opened their minds their eyes or very much their windows at least had manners and a standard and reverence for past and future  with rather a choky feeling he closed the door and went tiptoeing upstairs he looked in at a place on the way hm in perfect order of the eighties with a sort of yellow oilskin paper on the walls at the top of the stairs he hesitated between four doors which of them was timothys and he listened a sound as of a child slowly dragging a hobbyhorse about came to his ears that must be timothy he tapped and a door was opened by smither very red in the face  mr timothy was taking his walk and she had not been able to get him to attend if mr soames would come into the backroom he could see him through the door  soames went into the backroom and stood watching  the last of the old forsytes was on his feet moving with the most impressive slowness and an air of perfect concentration on his own affairs backward and forward between the foot of his bed and the window a distance of some twelve feet the lower part of his square face no longer cleanshaven was covered with snowy beard clipped as short as it could be and his chin looked as broad as his brow where the hair was also quite white while nose and cheeks and brow were a good yellow one hand held a stout stick and the other grasped the skirt of his jaeger dressinggown from under which could be seen his bedsocked ankles and feet thrust into jaeger slippers the expression on his face was that of a crossed child intent on something that he has not got each time he turned he stumped the stick and then dragged it as if to show that he could do without it  he still looks strong said soames under his breath  oh yes sir you should see him take his bathits wonderful he does enjoy it so  those quite loud words gave soames an insight timothy had resumed his babyhood  does he take any interest in things generally he said also loud  oh yes sir his food and his will its quite a sight to see him turn it over and over not to read it of course and every now and then he asks the price of consols and i write it on a slate for himvery large of course i always write the same what they were when he last took notice in 1914 we got the doctor to forbid him to read the paper when the war broke out oh he did take on about that at first but he soon came round because he knew it tired him and hes a wonder to conserve energy as he used to call it when my dear mistresses were alive bless their hearts how he did go on at them about that they were always so active if you remember mr soames  what would happen if i were to go in asked soames would he remember me i made his will you know after miss hester died in 1907  oh that sir replied smither doubtfully i couldnt take on me to say i think he might he really is a wonderful man for his age  soames moved into the doorway and waiting for timothy to turn said in a loud voice uncle timothy  timothy trailed back halfway and halted  eh he said  soames cried soames at the top of his voice holding out his hand soames forsyte  no said timothy and stumping his stick loudly on the floor he continued his walk  it doesnt seem to work said soames  no sir replied smither rather crestfallen you see he hasnt finished his walk it always was one thing at a time with him i expect hell ask me this afternoon if you came about the gas and a pretty job i shall have to make him understand  do you think he ought to have a man about him  smither held up her hands a man oh no cook and me can manage perfectly a strange man about would send him crazy in no time and my mistresses wouldnt like the idea of a man in the house besides were soproud of him  i suppose the doctor comes  every morning he makes special terms for such a quantity and mr timothys so used he doesnt take a bit of notice except to put out his tongue  well said soames turning away its rather sad and painful to me  oh sir returned smither anxiously you mustnt think that now that he cant worry about things he quite enjoys his life really he does as i say to cook mr timothy is more of a man than he ever was you see when hes not walkin or takin his bath hes eatin and when hes not eatin hes sleepin and there it is there isnt an ache or a care about him anywhere  well said soames theres something in that ill go down by the way let me see his will  i should have to take my time about that sir he keeps it under his pillow and hed see me while hes active  i only want to know if its the one i made said soames you take a look at its date some time and let me know  yes sir but im sure its the same because me and cook witnessed you remember and theres our names on it still and weve only done it once  quite said soames he did remember smither and jane had been proper witnesses having been left nothing in the will that they might have no interest in timothys death it had beenhe fully admittedan almost improper precaution but timothy had wished it and after all aunt hester had provided for them amply  very well he said goodbye smither look after him and if he should say anything at any time put it down and let me know  oh yes mr soames ill be sure to do that its been such a pleasant change to see you cook will be quite excited when i tell her  soames shook her hand and went downstairs he stood for fully two minutes by the hatstand whereon he had hung his hat so many times so it all passes he was thinking passes and begins again poor old chap and he listened if perchance the sound of timothy trailing his hobbyhorse might come down the well of the stairs or some ghost of an old face show over the bannisters and an old voice say why its dear soames and we were only saying that we hadnt seen him for a week  nothingnothing just the scent of camphor and dustmotes in a sunbeam through the fanlight over the door the little old house a mausoleum and turning on his heel he went out and caught his train     vthe native heath            his foots upon his native heath            his namesval dartie   with some such feeling did val dartie in the fortieth year of his age set out that same thursday morning very early from the old manorhouse he had taken on the north side of the sussex downs his destination was newmarket and he had not been there since the autumn of 1899 when he stole over from oxford for the cambridgeshire he paused at the door to give his wife a kiss and put a flask of port into his pocket  dont overtire your leg val and dont bet too much  with the pressure of her chest against his own and her eyes looking into his val felt both leg and pocket safe he should be moderate holly was always rightshe had a natural aptitude it did not seem so remarkable to him perhaps as it might to others thathalf dartie as he washe should have been perfectly faithful to his young first cousin during the twenty years since he married her romantically out in the boer war and faithful without any feeling of sacrifice or boredomshe was so quick so slyly always a little in front of his mood being first cousins they had decided rather needlessly to have no children and though a little sallower she had kept her looks her slimness and the colour of her dark hair val particularly admired the life of her own she carried on besides carrying on his and riding better every year she kept up her music she read an awful lotnovels poetry all sorts of stuff out on their farm in cape colony she had looked after all the nigger babies and women in a miraculous manner she was in fact clever yet made no fuss about it and had no side though not remarkable for humility val had come to have the feeling that she was his superior and he did not grudge ita great tribute it might be noted that he never looked at holly without her knowing of it but that she looked at him sometimes unawares  he had kissed her in the porch because he should not be doing so on the platform though she was going to the station with him to drive the car back tanned and wrinkled by colonial weather and the wiles inseparable from horses and handicapped by the leg which weakened in the boer war had probably saved his life in the war just past val was still much as he had been in the days of his courtship his smile as wide and charming his eyelashes if anything thicker and darker his eyes screwed up under them as bright a grey his freckles rather deeper his hair a little grizzled at the sides he gave the impression of one who has lived actively with horses in a sunny climate  twisting the car sharp round at the gate he said  when is young jon coming  today  is there anything you want for him i could bring it down on saturday  no but you might come by the same train as fleuroneforty  val gave the ford full rein he still drove like a man in a new country on bad roads who refuses to compromise and expects heaven at every hole  thats a young woman who knows her way about he said i say has it struck you  yes said holly  uncle soames and your dadbit awkward isnt it  she wont know and he wont know and nothing must be said of course its only for five days val  stable secret righto if holly thought it safe it was glancing slyly round at him she said did you notice how beautifully she asked herself  no  well she did what do you think of her val  pretty and clever but she might run out at any corner if she got her monkey up i should say  im wondering holly murmured whether she is the modern young woman one feels at sea coming home into all this  you you get the hang of things so quick  holly slid her hand into his coatpocket  you keep one in the know said val encouraged what do you think of that belgian fellow profond  i think hes rather a good devil  val grinned  he seems to me a queer fish for a friend of our family in fact our family is in pretty queer waters with uncle soames marrying a frenchwoman and your dad marrying soamess first our grandfathers would have had fits  so would anybodys my dear  this car val said suddenly wants rousing she doesnt get her hind legs under her uphill i shall have to give her her head on the slope if im to catch that train  there was that about horses which had prevented him from ever really sympathising with a car and the running of the ford under his guidance compared with its running under that of holly was always noticeable he caught the train  take care going home shell throw you down if she can goodbye darling  goodbye called holly and kissed her hand  in the train after quarter of an hours indecision between thoughts of holly his morning paper the look of the bright day and his dim memory of newmarket val plunged into the recesses of a small square book all names pedigrees taproots and notes about the make and shape of horses the forsyte in him was bent on the acquisition of a certain strain of blood and he was subduing resolutely as yet the dartie hankering for a nutter on getting back to england after the profitable sale of his south african farm and stud and observing that the sun seldom shone val had said to himself ive absolutely got to have an interest in life or this country will give me the blues huntings not enough ill breed and ill train with just that extra pinch of shrewdness and decision imparted by long residence in a new country val had seen the weak point of modern breeding they were all hypnotised by fashion and high price he should buy for looks and let names go hang and here he was already hypnotised by the prestige of a certain strain of blood halfconsciously he thought theres something in this damned climate which makes one go round in a ring all the same i must have a strain of mayfly blood  in this mood he reached the mecca of his hopes it was one of those quiet meetings favourable to such as wish to look into horses rather than into the mouths of bookmakers and val clung to the paddock his twenty years of colonial life divesting him of the dandyism in which he had been bred had left him the essential neatness of the horseman and given him a queer and rather blighting eye over what he called the silly hawhaw of some englishmen the flapping cockatoory of some englishwomenholly had none of that and holly was his model observant quick resourceful val went straight to the heart of a transaction a horse a drink and he was on his way to the heart of a mayfly filly when a slow voice said at his elbow  mr val dartie hows mrs val dartie shes well i hope and he saw beside him the belgian he had met at his sister imogens  prosper profondi met you at lunch said the voice  how are you murmured val  im very well replied monsieur profond smiling with a certain inimitable slowness a good devil holly had called him well he looked a little like a devil with his dark clipped pointed beard a sleepy one though and goodhumoured with fine eyes unexpectedly intelligent  heres a gentleman wants to know youcousin of yoursmr george forsyde  val saw a large form and a face cleanshaven bulllike a little lowering with sardonic humour bubbling behind a full grey eye he remembered it dimly from old days when he would dine with his father at the iseeum club  i used to go racing with your father george was saying hows the stud like to buy one of my screws  val grinned to hide the sudden feeling that the bottom had fallen out of breeding they believed in nothing over here not even in horses george forsyte prosper profond the devil himself was not more disillusioned than those two  didnt know you were a racing man he said to monsieur profond  im not i dont care for it im a yachtin man i dont care for yachtin either but i like to see my friends ive got some lunch mr val dartie just a small lunch if youd like to ave some not muchjust a small onein my car  thanks said val very good of you ill come along in about quarter of an hour  over there mr forsydes comin and monsieur profond poinded with a yellowgloved finger small car with a small lunch he moved on groomed sleepy and remote george forsyte following neat huge and with his jesting air  val remained gazing at the mayfly filly george forsyte of course was an old chap but this profond might be about his own age val felt extremely young as if the mayfly filly were a toy at which those two had laughed the animal had lost reality  that small marehe seemed to hear the voice of monsieur profondwhat do you see in herwe must all die  and george forsyte crony of his father racing still the mayfly strainwas it any better than any other he might just as well have a flutter with his money instead  no by gum he muttered suddenly if its no good breeding horses its no good doing anything what did i come for ill buy her  he stood back and watched the ebb of the paddock visitors toward the stand natty old chips shrewd portly fellows jews trainers looking as if they had never been guilty of seeing a horse in their lives tall flapping languid women or brisk loudvoiced women young men with an air as if trying to take it seriouslytwo or three of them with only one arm  life over heres a game thought val muffin bell rings horses run money changes hands ring again run again money changes back  but alarmed at his own philosophy he went to the paddock gate to watch the mayfly filly canter down she moved well and he made his way over to the small car the small lunch was the sort a man dreams of but seldom gets and when it was concluded monsieur profond walked back with him to the paddock  your wifes a nice woman was his surprising remark  nicest woman i know returned val dryly  yes said monsieur profond she has a nice face i admire nice women  val looked at him suspiciously but something kindly and direct in the heavy diabolism of his companion disarmed him for the moment  any time you like to come on my yacht ill give her a small cruise  thanks said val in arms again she hates the sea  so do i said monsieur profond  then why do you yacht  the belgians eyes smiled oh i dont know ive done everything its the last thing im doin  it must be dd expensive i should want more reason than that  monsieur prosper profond raised his eyebrows and puffed out a heavy lower lip  im an easygoin man he said  were you in the war asked val  yees ive done that too i was gassed it was a small bit unpleasant he smiled with a deep and sleepy air of prosperity as if he had caught it from his name  whether his saying small when he ought to have said little was genuine mistake or affectation val could not decide the fellow was evidently capable of anything  among the ring of buyers round the mayfly filly who had won her race monsieur profond said  you goin to bid  val nodded with this sleepy satan at his elbow he felt in need of faith though placed above the ultimate blows of providence by the forethought of a grandfather who had tied him up a thousand a year to which was added the thousand a year tied up for holly by her grandfather val was not flush of capital that he could touch having spent most of what he had realised from his south african farm on his establishment in sussex and very soon he was thinking dash it shes going beyond me his limitsix hundredwas exceeded he dropped out of the bidding the mayfly filly passed under the hammer at seven hundred and fifty guineas he was turning away vexed when the slow voice of monsieur profond said in his ear  well ive bought that small filly but i dont want her you take her and give her to your wife  val looked at the fellow with renewed suspicion but the good humour in his eyes was such that he really could not take offence  i made a small lot of money in the war began monsieur profond in answer to that look i ad armament shares i like to give it away im always makin money i want very small lot myself i like my friends to ave it  ill buy her of you at the price you gave said val with sudden resolution  no said monsieur profond you take her i don want her  hang it one doesnt  why not smiled monsieur profond im a friend of your family  seven hundred and fifty guineas is not a box of cigars said val impatiently  all right you keep her for me till i want her and do what you like with her  so long as shes yours said val i dont mind that  thats all right murmured monsieur profond and moved away  val watched he might be a good devil but then again he might not he saw him rejoin george forsyte and thereafter saw him no more  he spent those nights after racing at his mothers house in green street  winifred dartie at sixtytwo was marvellously preserved considering the threeandthirty years during which she had put up with montague dartie till almost happily released by a french staircase it was to her a vehement satisfaction to have her favourite son back from south africa after all this time to feel him so little changed and to have taken a fancy to his wife winifred who in the late seventies before her marriage had been in the vanguard of freedom pleasure and fashion confessed her youth outclassed by the donzellas of the day they seemed for instance to regard marriage as an incident and winifred sometimes regretted that she had not done the same a second third fourth incident might have secured her a partner of less dazzling inebriety though after all he had left her val imogen maud benedict almost a colonel and unharmed by the warnone of whom had been divorced as yet the steadiness of her children often amazed one who remembered their father but as she was fond of believing they were really all forsytes favouring herself with the exception perhaps of imogen her brothers little girl fleur frankly puzzled winifred the child was as restless as any of these modern young womenshes a small flame in a draught prosper profond had said one day after dinnerbut she did not flap or talk at the top of her voice the steady forsyteism in winifreds own character instinctively resented the feeling in the air the modern girls habits and her motto alls much of a muchness spend tomorrow we shall be poor she found it a saving grace in fleur that having set her heart on a thing she had no change of heart until she got itthoughwhat happened after fleur was of course too young to have made evident the child was a very pretty little thing too and quite a credit to take about with her mothers french taste and gift for wearing clothes everybody turned to look at fleurgreat consideration to winifred a lover of the style and distinction which had so cruelly deceived her in the case of montague dartie  in discussing her with val at breakfast on saturday morning winifred dwelt on the family skeleton  that little affair of your fatherinlaw and your aunt irene valits old as the hills of course fleur need know nothing about itmaking a fuss your uncle soames is very particular about that so youll be careful  yes but its dashed awkwardhollys young halfbrother is coming to live with us while he learns farming hes there already  oh said winifred that is a gaff what is he like  only saw him onceat robin hill when we were home in 1909 he was naked and painted blue and yellow in stripesa jolly little chap  winifred thought that rather nice and added comfortably well hollys sensible shell know how to deal with it i shant tell your uncle itll only bother him its a great comfort to have you back my dear boy now that im getting on  getting on why youre as young as ever that chap profond mother is he all right  prosper profond oh the most amusing man i know  val grunted and recounted the story of the mayfly filly  thats so like him murmured winifred he does all sorts of things  well said val shrewdly our family havent been too lucky with that kind of cattle theyre too lighthearted for us  it was true and winifreds blue study lasted a full minute before she answered  oh well hes a foreigner val one must make allowances  all right ill use his filly and make it up to him somehow  and soon after he gave her his blessing received a kiss and left her for his bookmakers the iseeum club and victoria station     vijon  mrs val dartie after twenty years of south africa had fallen deeply in love fortunately with something of her own for the object of her passion was the prospect in front of her windows the cool clear light on the green downs it was england again at last england more beautiful than she had dreamed chance had in fact guided the val darties to a spot where the south downs had real charm when the sun shone holly had enough of her fathers eye to apprehend the rare quality of their outlines and chalky radiance to go up there by the ravinelike lane and wander along toward chanctonbury or amberley was still a delight which she hardly attempted to share with val whose admiration of nature was confused by a forsytes instinct for getting something out of it such as the condition of the turf for his horses exercise  driving the ford home with a certain humouring smoothness she promised herself that the first use she would make of jon would be to take him up there and show him the view under this mayday sky  she was looking forward to her young halfbrother with a motherliness not exhausted by val a threeday visit to robin hill soon after their arrival home had yielded no sight of himhe was still at school so that her recollection like vals was of a little sunnyhaired boy striped blue and yellow down by the pond  those three days at robin hill had been exciting sad embarrassing memories of her dead brother memories of vals courtship the ageing of her father not seen for twenty years something funereal in his ironic gentleness which did not escape one who had much subtle instinct above all the presence of her stepmother whom she could still vaguely remember as the lady in grey of days when she was little and grandfather alive and mademoiselle beauce so cross because that intruder gave her music lessonsall these confused and tantalised a spirit which had longed to find robin hill untroubled but holly was adept at keeping things to herself and all had seemed to go quite well  her father had kissed her when she left him with lips which she was sure had trembled  well my dear he said the war hasnt changed robin hill has it if only you could have brought jolly back with you i say can you stand this spiritualistic racket when the oaktree dies it dies im afraid  from the warmth of her embrace he probably divined that he had let the cat out of the bag for he rode off at once on irony  spiritualismqueer word when the more they manifest the more they prove that theyve got hold of matter  how said holly  why look at their photographs of auric presences you must have something material for light and shade to fall on before you can take a photograph no itll end in our calling all matter spirit or all spirit matteri dont know which  but dont you believe in survival dad  jolyon had looked at her and the sad whimsicality of his face impressed her deeply  well my dear i should like to get something out of death ive been looking into it a bit but for the life of me i cant find anything that telepathy subconsciousness and emanation from the storehouse of this world cant account for just as well wish i could wishes father thought but they dont breed evidence holly had pressed her lips again to his forehead with the feeling that it confirmed his theory that all matter was becoming spirithis brow felt somehow so insubstantial  but the most poignant memory of that little visit had been watching unobserved her stepmother reading to herself a letter from jon it wasshe decidedthe prettiest sight she had ever seen irene lost as it were in the letter of her boy stood at a window where the light fell on her face and her fine grey hair her lips were moving smiling her dark eyes laughing dancing and the hand which did not hold the letter was pressed against her breast holly withdrew as from a vision of perfect love convinced that jon must be nice  when she saw him coming out of the station with a kitbag in either hand she was confirmed in her predisposition he was a little like jolly that longlost idol of her childhood but eagerlooking and less formal with deeper eyes and brightercoloured hair for he wore no hat altogether a very interesting little brother  his tentative politeness charmed one who was accustomed to assurance in the youthful manner he was disturbed because she was to drive him home instead of his driving her shouldnt he have a shot they hadnt a car at robin hill since the war of course and he had only driven once and landed up a bank so she oughtnt to mind his trying his laugh soft and infectious was very attractive though that word she had heard was now quite oldfashioned when they reached the house he pulled out a crumpled letter which she read while he was washinga quite short letter which must have cost her father many a pang to write   my dear  you and val will not forget i trust that jon knows nothing of family history his mother and i think he is too young at present the boy is very dear and the apple of her eye verbum sapientibus  your loving father  j f   that was all but it renewed in holly an uneasy regret that fleur was coming  after tea she fulfilled that promise to herself and took jon up the hill they had a long talk sitting above an old chalkpit grown over with brambles and goosepenny milkwort and liverwort starred the green slope the larks sang and thrushes in the brake and now and then a gull flighting inland would wheel very white against the paling sky where the vague moon was coming up delicious fragrance came to them as if little invisible creatures were running and treading scent out of the blades of grass  jon who had fallen silent said rather suddenly  i say this is wonderful theres no fat on it at all gulls flight and sheepbells  gulls flight and sheepbells youre a poet my dear  jon sighed  oh golly no go  try i used to at your age  did you mother says try too but im so rotten have you any of yours for me to see  my dear holly murmured ive been married nineteen years i only wrote verses when i wanted to be  oh said jon and turned over on his face the one cheek she could see was a charming colour was jon touched in the wind then as val would have called it already but if so all the better he would take no notice of young fleur besides on monday he would begin his farming and she smiled was it burns who followed the plough or only piers plowman nearly every young man and most young women seemed to be poets now judging from the number of their books she had read out in south africa importing them from hatchus and bumphards and quite goodoh quite much better than she had been herself but then poetry had only really come in since her daywith motorcars another long talk after dinner over a wood fire in the low hall and there seemed little left to know about jon except anything of real importance holly parted from him at his bedroom door having seen twice over that he had everything with the conviction that she would love him and val would like him he was eager but did not gush he was a splendid listener sympathetic reticent about himself he evidently loved their father and adored his mother he liked riding rowing and fencing better than games he saved moths from candles and couldnt bear spiders but put them out of doors in screws of paper sooner than kill them in a word he was amiable she went to sleep thinking that he would suffer horribly if anybody hurt him but who would hurt him  jon on the other hand sat awake at his window with a bit of paper and a pencil writing his first real poem by the light of a candle because there was not enough moon to see by only enough to make the night seem fluttery and as if engraved on silver just the night for fleur to walk and turn her eyes and lead onover the hills and far away and jon deeply furrowed in his ingenuous brow made marks on the paper and rubbed them out and wrote them in again and did all that was necessary for the completion of a work of art and he had a feeling such as the winds of spring must have trying their first songs among the coming blossom jon was one of those boys not many in whom a hometrained love of beauty had survived school life he had had to keep it to himself of course so that not even the drawingmaster knew of it but it was there fastidious and clear within him and his poem seemed to him as lame and stilted as the night was winged but he kept it all the same it was a beast but better than nothing as an expression of the inexpressible and he thought with a sort of discomfiture i shant be able to show it to mother he slept terribly well when he did sleep overwhelmed by novelty     viifleur  to avoid the awkwardness of questions which could not be answered all that had been told jon was  theres a girl coming down with val for the weekend  for the same reason all that had been told fleur was weve got a youngster staying with us  the two yearlings as val called them in his thoughts met therefore in a manner which for unpreparedness left nothing to be desired they were thus introduced by holly  this is jon my little brother fleurs a cousin of ours jon  jon who was coming in through a french window out of strong sunlight was so confounded by the providential nature of this miracle that he had time to hear fleur say calmly oh how do you do as if he had never seen her and to understand dimly from the quickest imaginable little movement of her head that he never had seen her he bowed therefore over her hand in an intoxicated manner and became more silent than the grave he knew better than to speak once in his early life surprised reading by a nightlight he had said fatuously i was just turning over the leaves mum and his mother had replied jon never tell stories because of your face nobody will ever believe them  the saying had permanently undermined the confidence necessary to the success of spoken untruth he listened therefore to fleurs swift and rapt allusions to the jolliness of everything plied her with scones and jam and got away as soon as might be they say that in delirium tremens you see a fixed object preferably dark which suddenly changes shape and position jon saw the fixed object it had dark eyes and passably dark hair and changed its position but never its shape the knowledge that between him and that object there was already a secret understanding however impossible to understand thrilled him so that he waited feverishly and began to copy out his poemwhich of course he would never dare toshow hertill the sound of horses hoofs roused him and leaning from his window he saw her riding forth with val it was clear that she wasted no time but the sight filled him with grief he wasted his if he had not bolted in his fearful ecstasy he might have been asked to go too and from his window he sat and watched them disappear appear again in the chine of the road vanish and emerge once more for a minute clear on the outline of the down silly brute he thought i always miss my chances  why couldnt he be selfconfident and ready and leaning his chin on his hands he imagined the ride he might have had with her a weekend was but a weekend and he had missed three hours of it did he know any one except himself who would have been such a flat he did not  he dressed for dinner early and was first down he would miss no more but he missed fleur who came down last he sat opposite her at dinner and it was terribleimpossible to say anything for fear of saying the wrong thing impossible to keep his eyes fixed on her in the only natural way in sum impossible to treat normally one with whom in fancy he had already been over the hills and far away conscious too all the time that he must seem to her to all of them a dumb gawk yes it was terrible and she was talking so wellswooping with swift wing this way and that wonderful how she had learned an art which he found so disgustingly difficult she must think him hopeless indeed  his sisters eyes fixed on him with a certain astonishment obliged him at last to look at fleur but instantly her eyes very wide and eager seeming to say oh for goodness sake obliged him to look at val where a grin obliged him to look at his cutletthat at least had no eyes and no grin and he ate it hastily  jon is going to be a farmer he heard holly say a farmer and a poet  he glanced up reproachfully caught the comic lift of her eyebrow just like their fathers laughed and felt better  val recounted the incident of monsieur prosper profond nothing could have been more favourable for in relating it he regarded holly who in turn regarded him while fleur seemed to be regarding with a slight frown some thought of her own and jon was really free to look at her at last she had on a white frock very simple and well made her arms were bare and her hair had a white rose in it in just that swift moment of free vision after such intense discomfort jon saw her sublimated as one sees in the dark a slender white fruittree caught her like a verse of poetry flashed before the eyes of the mind or a tune which floats out in the distance and dies he wondered giddily how old she wasshe seemed so much more selfpossessed and experienced than himself why mustnt he say they had met he remembered suddenly his mothers face puzzled hurtlooking when she answered yes theyre relations but we dont know them impossible that his mother who loved beauty should not admire fleur if she did know her  alone with val after dinner he sipped port deferentially and answered the advances of this newfound brotherinlaw as to riding always the first consideration with val he could have the young chestnut saddle and unsaddle it himself and generally look after it when he brought it in jon said he was accustomed to all that at home and saw that he had gone up one in his hosts estimation  fleur said val cant ride much yet but shes keen of course her father doesnt know a horse from a cartwheel does your dad ride  he used to but now hesyou know hes he stopped so hating the word old his father was old and yet not old nonever  quite muttered val i used to know your brother up at oxford ages ago the one who died in the boer war we had a fight in new college gardens that was a queer business he added musing a good deal came out of it  jons eyes opened wide all was pushing him toward historical research when his sisters voice said gently from the doorway  come along you two and he rose his heart pushing him toward something far more modern  fleur having declared that it was simply too wonderful to stay indoors they all went out moonlight was frosting the dew and an old sundial threw a long shadow two box hedges at right angles dark and square barred off the orchard fleur turned through that angled opening  come on she called jon glanced at the others and followed she was running among the trees like a ghost all was lovely and foamlike above her and there was a scent of old trunks and of nettles she vanished he thought he had lost her then almost ran into her standing quite still  isnt it jolly she cried and jon answered  rather  she reached up twisted off a blossom and twirling it in her fingers said  i suppose i can call you jon  i should think so just  all right but you know theres a feud between our families  jon stammered feud why  its ever so romantic and silly thats why i pretended we hadnt met shall we get up early tomorrow morning and go for a walk before breakfast and have it out i hate being slow about things dont you  jon murmured a rapturous assent  six oclock then i think your mothers beautiful  jon said fervently yes she is  i love all kinds of beauty went on fleur when its exciting i dont like greek things a bit  what not euripides  euripides oh no i cant bear greek plays theyre so long i think beautys always swift i like to look at one picture for instance and then run off i cant bear a lot of things together look she held up her blossom in the moonlight thats better than all the orchard i think  and suddenly with her other hand she caught jons  of all things in the world dont you think cautions the most awful smell the moonlight  she thrust the blossom against his face jon agreed giddily that of all things in the world caution was the worst and bending over kissed the hand which held his  thats nice and oldfashioned said fleur calmly youre frightfully silent jon still i like silence when its swift she let go his hand did you think i dropped my handkerchief on purpose  no cried jon intensely shocked  well i did of course lets get back or theyll think were doing this on purpose too and again she ran like a ghost among the trees jon followed with love in his heart spring in his heart and over all the moonlit white unearthly blossom they came out where they had gone in fleur walking demurely  its quite wonderful in there she said dreamily to holly  jon preserved silence hoping against hope that she might be thinking it swift  she bade him a casual and demure goodnight which made him think he had been dreaming  in her bedroom fleur had flung off her gown and wrapped in a shapeless garment with the white flower still in her hair she looked like a mousme sitting crosslegged on her bed writing by candlelight   dearest cherry  i believe im in love ive got it in the neck only the feeling is really lower down hes a second cousinsuch a child about six months older and ten years younger than i am boys always fall in love with their seniors and girls with their juniors or with old men of forty dont laugh but his eyes are the truest things i ever saw and hes quite divinely silent we had a most romantic first meeting in london under the vospovitch juno and now hes sleeping in the next room and the moonlights on the blossom and tomorrow morning before anybodys awake were going to walk off into down fairyland theres a feud between our families which makes it really exciting yes and i may have to use subterfuge and come on you for invitationsif so youll know why my father doesnt want us to know each other but i cant help that lifes too short hes got the most beautiful mother with lovely silvery hair and a young face with dark eyes im staying with his sisterwho married my cousin its all mixed up but i mean to pump her tomorrow weve often talked about love being a spoilsport well thats all tosh its the beginning of sport and the sooner you feel it my dear the better for you  jon not simplified spelling but short for jolyon which is a name in my family they say is the sort that lights up and goes out about five feet ten still growing and i believe hes going to be a poet if you laugh at me ive done with you forever i perceive all sorts of difficulties but you know when i really want a thing i get it one of the chief effects of love is that you see the air sort of inhabited like seeing a face in the moon and you feelyou feel dancey and soft at the same time with a funny sensationlike a continual first sniff of orangeblossomjust above your stays this is my first and i feel as if it were going to be my last which is absurd of course by all the laws of nature and morality if you mock me i will smite you and if you tell anybody i will never forgive you so much so that i almost dont think ill send this letter anyway ill sleep over it so goodnight my cherryoh  your  fleur     viiiidyll on grass  when those two young forsytes emerged from the chine lane and set their faces east toward the sun there was not a cloud in heaven and the downs were dewy they had come at a good bat up the slope and were a little out of breath if they had anything to say they did not say it but marched in the early awkwardness of unbreakfasted morning under the songs of the larks the stealing out had been fun but with the freedom of the tops the sense of conspiracy ceased and gave place to dumbness  weve made one blooming error said fleur when they had gone half a mile im hungry  jon produced a stick of chocolate they shared it and their tongues were loosened they discussed the nature of their homes and previous existences which had a kind of fascinating unreality up on that lonely height there remained but one thing solid in jons pasthis mother but one thing solid in fleursher father and of these figures as though seen in the distance with disapproving faces they spoke little  the down dipped and rose again toward chanctonbury ring a sparkle of far sea came into view a sparrowhawk hovered in the suns eye so that the bloodnourished brown of his wings gleamed nearly red jon had a passion for birds and an aptitude for sitting very still to watch them keensighted and with a memory for what interested him on birds he was almost worth listening to but in chanctonbury ring there were noneits great beech temple was empty of life and almost chilly at this early hour they came out willingly again into the sun on the far side it was fleurs turn now she spoke of dogs and the way people treated them it was wicked to keep them on chains she would like to flog people who did that jon was astonished to find her so humanitarian she knew a dog it seemed which some farmer near her home kept chained up at the end of his chicken run in all weathers till it had almost lost its voice from barking  and the misery is she said vehemently that if the poor thing didnt bark at every one who passes it wouldnt be kept there i do think men are cunning brutes ive let it go twice on the sly its nearly bitten me both times and then it goes simply mad with joy but it always runs back home at last and they chain it up again if i had my way id chain that man up jon saw her teeth and her eyes gleam id brand him on his forehead with the word brute that would teach him  jon agreed that it would be a good remedy  its their sense of property he said which makes people chain things the last generation thought of nothing but property and thats why there was the war  oh said fleur i never thought of that your people and mine quarrelled about property and anyway weve all got itat least i suppose your people have  oh yes luckily i dont suppose i shall be any good at making money  if you were i dont believe i should like you  jon slipped his hand tremulously under her arm fleur looked straight before her and chanted  jon jon the farmers son stole a pig and away he run  jons arm crept round her waist  this is rather sudden said fleur calmly do you often do it  jon dropped his arm but when she laughed his arm stole back again and fleur began to sing  o who will oer the downs so free o who will with me ride o who will up and follow me  sing jon  jon sang the larks joined in sheepbells and an early morning church far away over in steyning they went on from tune to tune till fleur said  my god i am hungry now  oh i am sorry  she looked round into his face  jon youre rather a darling  and she pressed his hand against her waist jon almost reeled from happiness a yellowandwhite dog coursing a hare startled them apart they watched the two vanish down the slope till fleur said with a sigh hell never catch it thank goodness whats the time mines stopped i never wound it  jon looked at his watch by jove he said mines stopped too  they walked on again but only hand in hand  if the grass is dry said fleur lets sit down for half a minute  jon took off his coat and they shared it  smell actually wild thyme  with his arm round her waist again they sat some minutes in silence  we are goats cried fleur jumping up we shall be most fearfully late and look so silly and put them on their guard look here jon we only came out to get an appetite for breakfast and lost our way see  yes said jon  its serious therell be a stopper put on us are you a good liar  i believe not very but i can try  fleur frowned  you know she said i realize that they dont mean us to be friends  why not  i told you why  but thats silly  yes but you dont know my father  i suppose hes fearfully fond of you  you see im an only child and so are youof your mother isnt it a bore theres so much expected of one by the time theyve done expecting ones as good as dead  yes muttered jon lifes beastly short one wants to live forever and know everything  and love everybody  no cried jon i only want to love onceyou  indeed youre coming on oh look theres the chalkpit we cant be very far now lets run  jon followed wondering fearfully if he had offended her  the chalkpit was full of sunshine and the murmuration of bees fleur flung back her hair  well she said in case of accidents you may give me one kiss jon and she pushed her cheek forward with ecstasy he kissed that hot soft cheek  now remember we lost our way and leave it to me as much as you can im going to be rather beastly to you its safer try and be beastly to me  jon shook his head thats impossible  just to please me till five oclock at all events  anybody will be able to see through it said jon gloomily  well do your best look there they are wave your hat oh you havent got one well ill cooee get a little away from me and look sulky  five minutes later entering the house and doing his utmost to look sulky jon heard her clear voice in the diningroom  oh im simply ravenous hes going to be a farmerand he loses his way the boys an idiot     ix goya  lunch was over and soames mounted to the picturegallery in his house near mapleduram he had what annette called a grief fleur was not yet home she had been expected on wednesday had wired that it would be friday and again on friday that it would be sunday afternoon and here were her aunt and her cousins the cardigans and this fellow profond and everything flat as a pancake for the want of her he stood before his gauguinsorest point of his collection he had bought the ugly great thing with two early matisses before the war because there was such a fuss about those postimpressionist chaps he was wondering whether profond would take them off his handsthe fellow seemed not to know what to do with his moneywhen he heard his sisters voice say i think thats a horrid thing soames and saw that winifred had followed him up  oh you do he said dryly i gave five hundred for it  fancy women arent made like that even if they are black  soames uttered a glum laugh you didnt come up to tell me that  no do you know that jolyons boy is staying with val and his wife  soames spun round  what  yes drawled winifred hes gone to live with them there while he learns farming  soames had turned away but her voice pursued him as he walked up and down i warned val that neither of them was to be spoken to about old matters  why didnt you tell me before  winifred shrugged her substantial shoulders  fleur does what she likes youve always spoiled her besides my dear boy whats the harm  the harm muttered soames why she he checked himself the juno the handkerchief fleurs eyes her questions and now this delay in her returnthe symptoms seemed to him so sinister that faithful to his nature he could not part with them  i think you take too much care said winifred if i were you i should tell her of that old matter its no good thinking that girls in these days are as they used to be where they pick up their knowledge i cant tell but they seem to know everything  over soames face closely composed passed a sort of spasm and winifred added hastily  if you dont like to speak of it i could for you  soames shook his head unless there was absolute necessity the thought that his adored daughter should learn of that old scandal hurt his pride too much  no he said not yet never if i can help it  nonsense my dear think what people are  twenty years is a long time muttered soames outside our family whos likely to remember  winifred was silenced she inclined more and more to that peace and quietness of which montague dartie had deprived her in her youth and since pictures always depressed her she soon went down again  soames passed into the corner where side by side hung his real goya and the copy of the fresco la vendimia his acquisition of the real goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested interests and passions which mesh the brightwinged fly of human life the real goyas noble owners ancestor had come into possession of it during some spanish warit was in a word loot the noble owner had remained in ignorance of its value until in the nineties an enterprising critic discovered that a spanish painter named goya was a genius it was only a fair goya but almost unique in england and the noble owner became a marked man having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which independent of mere sensuous enjoyment is founded on the sounder principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested in life he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed to his reputation while he was alive and to leave it to the nation after he was dead fortunately for soames the house of lords was violently attacked in 1909 and the noble owner became alarmed and angry if he said to himself they think they can have it both ways they are very much mistaken so long as they leave me in quiet enjoyment the nation can have some of my pictures at my death but if the nation is going to bait me and rob me like this im damned if i wont sell the lot they cant have my private property and my public spiritboth he brooded in this fashion for several months till one morning after reading the speech of a certain statesman he telegraphed to his agent to come down and bring bodkin on going over the collection bodkin than whose opinion on market values none was more sought pronounced that with a free hand to sell to america germany and other places where there was an interest in art a lot more money could be made than by selling in england the noble owners public spirithe saidwas well known but the pictures were unique the noble owner put this opinion in his pipe and smoked it for a year at the end of that time he read another speech by the same statesman and telegraphed to his agents give bodkin a free hand it was at this juncture that bodkin conceived the idea which saved the goya and two other unique pictures for the native country of the noble owner with one hand bodkin proffered the pictures to the foreign market with the other he formed a list of private british collectors having obtained what he considered the highest possible bids from across the seas he submitted pictures and bids to the private british collectors and invited them of their public spirit to outbid in three instances including the goya out of twentyone he was successful and why one of the private collectors made buttonshe had made so many that he desired that his wife should be called lady buttons he therefore bought a unique picture at great cost and gave it to the nation it was part his friends said of his general game the second of the private collectors was an americophobe and bought an unique picture to spite the damned yanks the third of the private collectors was soames whomore sober than either of the othersbought after a visit to madrid because he was certain that goya was still on the up grade goya was not booming at the moment but he would come again and looking at that portrait hogarthian manetesque in its directness but with its own queer sharp beauty of paint he was perfectly satisfied still that he had made no error heavy though the price had beenheaviest he had ever paid and next to it was hanging the copy of la vendimia there she wasthe little wretchlooking back at him in her dreamy mood the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she looked like that  he was still gazing when the scent of a cigar impinged on his nostrils and a voice said  well mr forsyde what you goin to do with this small lot  that belgian chap whose motheras if flemish blood were not enoughhad been armenian subduing a natural irritation he said  are you a judge of pictures  well ive got a few myself  any postimpressionists  yees i rather like them  what do you think of this said soames pointing to the gauguin  monsieur profond protruded his lower lip and short pointed beard  rather fine i think he said do you want to sell it  soames checked his instinctive not particularlyhe would not chaffer with this alien  yes he said  what do you want for it  what i gave  all right said monsieur profond ill be glad to take that small picture postimpressioniststheyre awful dead but theyre amusin i don care for pictures much but ive got some just a small lot  what do you care for  monsieur profond shrugged his shoulders  lifes awful like a lot of monkeys scramblin for empty nuts  youre young said soames if the fellow must make a generalization he neednt suggest that the forms of property lacked solidity  i don worry replied monsieur profond smiling were born and we die half the worlds starvin i feed a small lot of babies out in my mothers country but whats the use might as well throw my money in the river  soames looked at him and turned back toward his goya he didnt know what the fellow wanted  what shall i make my cheque for pursued monsieur profond  five hundred said soames shortly but i dont want you to take it if you dont care for it more than that  thats all right said monsieur profond ill be appy to ave that picture  he wrote a cheque with a fountainpen heavily chased with gold soames watched the process uneasily how on earth had the fellow known that he wanted to sell that picture monsieur profond held out the cheque  the english are awful funny about pictures he said so are the french so are my people theyre all awful funny  i dont understand you said soames stiffly  its like hats said monsieur profond enigmatically small or large turnin up or downjust the fashion awful funny and smiling he drifted out of the gallery again blue and solid like the smoke of his excellent cigar  soames had taken the cheque feeling as if the intrinsic value of ownership had been called in question hes a cosmopolitan he thought watching profond emerge from under the verandah with annette and saunter down the lawn toward the river what his wife saw in the fellow he didnt know unless it was that he could speak her language and there passed in soames what monsieur profond would have called a small doubt whether annette was not too handsome to be walking with any one so cosmopolitan even at that distance he could see the blue fumes from profonds cigar wreath out in the quiet sunlight and his grey buckskin shoes and his grey hatthe fellow was a dandy and he could see the quick turn of his wifes head so very straight on her desirable neck and shoulders that turn of her neck always seemed to him a little too showy and in the queen of all i survey mannernot quite distinguished he watched them walk along the path at the bottom of the garden a young man in flannels joined them down therea sunday caller no doubt from up the river he went back to his goya he was still staring at that replica of fleur and worrying over winifreds news when his wifes voice said  mr michael mont soames you invited him to see your pictures  there was the cheerful young man of the gallery off cork street  turned up you see sir i live only four miles from pangbourne jolly day isnt it  confronted with the results of his expansiveness soames scrutinized his visitor the young mans mouth was excessively large and curlyhe seemed always grinning why didnt he grow the rest of those idiotic little moustaches which made him look like a musichall buffoon what on earth were young men about deliberately lowering their class with these toothbrushes or little slug whiskers ugh affected young idiots in other respects he was presentable and his flannels very clean  happy to see you he said  the young man who had been turning his head from side to side became transfixed i say he said some picture  soames saw with mixed sensations that he had addressed the remark to the goya copy  yes he said dryly thats not a goya its a copy i had it painted because it reminded me of my daughter  by jove i thought i knew the face sir is she here  the frankness of his interest almost disarmed soames  shell be in after tea he said shall we go round the pictures  and soames began that round which never tired him he had not anticipated much intelligence from one who had mistaken a copy for an original but as they passed from section to section period to period he was startled by the young mans frank and relevant remarks natively shrewd himself and even sensuous beneath his mask soames had not spent thirtyeight years over his one hobby without knowing something more about pictures than their market values he was as it were the missing link between the artist and the commercial public art for arts sake and all that of course was cant but aesthetics and good taste were necessary the appreciation of enough persons of good taste was what gave a work of art its permanent market value or in other words made it a work of art there was no real cleavage and he was sufficiently accustomed to sheeplike and unseeing visitors to be intrigued by one who did not hesitate to say of mauve good old haystacks or of james maris didnt he just paint and paper em mathew was the real swell sir you could dig into his surfaces it was after the young man had whistled before a whistler with the words dyou think he ever really saw a naked woman sir that soames remarked  what are you mr mont if i may ask  i sir i was going to be a painter but the war knocked that then in the trenches you know i used to dream of the stock exchange snug and warm and just noisy enough but the peace knocked that shares seem off dont they ive only been demobbed about a year what do you recommend sir  have you got money  well answered the young man ive got a father i kept him alive during the war so hes bound to keep me alive now though of course theres the question whether he ought to be allowed to hang on to his property what do you think about that sir  soames pale and defensive smiled  the old man has fits when i tell him he may have to work yet hes got land you know its a fatal disease  this is my real goya said soames dryly  by george he was a swell i saw a goya in munich once that bowled me middle stump a most evillooking old woman in the most gorgeous lace he made no compromise with the public taste that old boy was some explosive he must have smashed up a lot of convention in his day couldnt he just paint he makes velasquez stiff dont you think  i have no velasquez said soames  the young man stared no he said only nations or profiteers can afford him i suppose i say why shouldnt all the bankrupt nations sell their velasquez and titians and other swells to the profiteers by force and then pass a law that any one who holds a picture by an old mastersee schedulemust hang it in a public gallery there seems something in that  shall we go down to tea said soames  the young mans ears seemed to droop on his skull hes not dense thought soames following him off the premises  goya with his satiric and surpassing precision his original line and the daring of his light and shade could have reproduced to admiration the group assembled round annettes teatray in the inglenook below he alone perhaps of painters would have done justice to the sunlight filtering through a screen of creeper to the lovely pallor of brass the old cut glasses the thin slices of lemon in pale amber tea justice to annette in her black lacey dress there was something of the fair spaniard in her beauty though it lacked the spirituality of that rare type to winifreds greyhaired corseted solidity to soames of a certain grey and flatcheeked distinction to the vivacious michael mont pointed in ear and eye to imogen dark luscious of glance growing a little stout to prosper profond with his expression as who should say well mr goya whats the use of paintin this small party finally to jack cardigan with his shining stare and tanned sanguinity betraying the moving principle im english and i live to be fit  curious by the way that imogen who as a girl had declared solemnly one day at timothys that she would never marry a good manthey were so dullshould have married jack cardigan in whom health had so destroyed all traces of original sin that she might have retired to rest with ten thousand other englishmen without knowing the difference from the one she had chosen to repose beside oh she would say of him in her amusing way jack keeps himself so fearfully fit hes never had a days illness in his life he went right through the war without a fingerache you really cant imagine how fit he is indeed he was so fit that he couldnt see when she was flirting which was such a comfort in a way all the same she was quite fond of him so far as one could be of a sportsmachine and of the two little cardigans made after his pattern her eyes just then were comparing him maliciously with prosper profond there was no small sport or game which monsieur profond had not played at too it seemed from skittles to tarponfishing and worn out every one imogen would sometimes wish that they had worn out jack who continued to play at them and talk of them with the simple zeal of a schoolgirl learning hockey at the age of greatuncle timothy she well knew that jack would be playing carpet golf in her bedroom and wiping somebodys eye  he was telling them now how he had pipped the proa charmin fellow playin a very good game at the last hole this morning and how he had pulled down to caversham since lunch and trying to incite prosper profond to play him a set of tennis after teado him goodkeep him fit  but whats the use of keepin fit said monsieur profond  yes sir murmured michael mont what do you keep fit for  jack cried imogen enchanted what do you keep fit for  jack cardigan stared with all his health the questions were like the buzz of a mosquito and he put up his hand to wipe them away during the war of course he had kept fit to kill germans now that it was over he either did not know or shrank in delicacy from explanation of his moving principle  but hes right said monsieur profond unexpectedly theres nothin left but keepin fit  the saying too deep for sunday afternoon would have passed unanswered but for the mercurial nature of young mont  good he cried thats the great discovery of the war we all thought we were progressingnow we know were only changing  for the worse said monsieur profond genially  how you are cheerful prosper murmured annette  you come and play tennis said jack cardigan youve got the hump well soon take that down dyou play mr mont  i hit the ball about sir  at this juncture soames rose ruffled in that deep instinct of preparation for the future which guided his existence  when fleur comes he heard jack cardigan say  ah and why didnt she come he passed through drawingroom hall and porch out on to the drive and stood there listening for the car all was still and sundayfied the lilacs in full flower scented the air there were white clouds like the feathers of ducks gilded by the sunlight memory of the day when fleur was born and he had waited in such agony with her life and her mothers balanced in his hands came to him sharply he had saved her then to be the flower of his life and now was she going to give him troublepaingive him trouble he did not like the look of things a blackbird broke in on his reverie with an evening songa great big fellow up in that acaciatree soames had taken quite an interest in his birds of late years he and fleur would walk round and watch them her eyes were sharp as needles and she knew every nest he saw her dog a retriever lying on the drive in a patch of sunlight and called to him hallo old fellowwaiting for her too the dog came slowly with a grudging tail and soames mechanically laid a pat on his head the dog the bird the lilac all were part of fleur for him no more no less too fond of her he thought too fond he was like a man uninsured with his ships at sea uninsured againas in that other time so long ago when he would wander dumb and jealous in the wilderness of london longing for that womanhis first wifethe mother of this infernal boy ah there was the car at last it drew up it had luggage but no fleur  miss fleur is walking up sir by the towingpath  walking all those miles soames stared the mans face had the beginning of a smile on it what was he grinning at and very quickly he turned saying all right sims and went into the house he mounted to the picturegallery once more he had from there a view of the river bank and stood with his eyes fixed on it oblivious of the fact that it would be an hour at least before her figure showed there walking up and that fellows grin the boy he turned abruptly from the window he couldnt spy on her if she wanted to keep things from himshe must he could not spy on her his heart felt empty and bitterness mounted from it into his very mouth the staccato shouts of jack cardigan pursuing the ball the laugh of young mont rose in the stillness and came in he hoped they were making that chap profond run and the girl in la vendimia stood with her arm akimbo and her dreamy eyes looking past him ive done all i could for you he thought since you were no higher than my knee you arent going totohurt me are you  but the goya copy answered not brilliant in colour just beginning to tone down theres no real life in it thought soames why doesnt she come     xtrio  among those four forsytes of the third and as one might say fourth generation at wansdon under the downs a weekend prolonged unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to snappingpoint never had fleur been so fine holly so watchful val so stablesecretive jon so silent and disturbed what he learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on the point of a penknife and puffed off he whose nature was essentially averse from intrigue and whose adoration of fleur disposed him to think that any need for concealing it was skittles chafed and fretted yet obeyed taking what relief he could in the few moments when they were alone on thursday while they were standing in the bay window of the drawingroom dressed for dinner she said to him  jon im going home on sunday by the 340 from paddington if you were to go home on saturday you could come up on sunday and take me down and just get back here by the last train after you were going home anyway werent you  jon nodded  anything to be with you he said only why need i pretend  fleur slipped her little finger into his palm  you have no instinct jon you must leave things to me its serious about our people weve simply got to be secret at present if we want to be together the door was opened and she added loudly you are a duffer jon  something turned over within jon he could not bear this subterfuge about a feeling so natural so overwhelming and so sweet  on friday night about eleven he had packed his bag and was leaning out of his window half miserable and half lost in a dream of paddington station when he heard a tiny sound as of a fingernail tapping on his door he rushed to it and listened again the sound it was a nail he opened oh what a lovely thing came in  i wanted to show you my fancy dress it said and struck an attitude at the foot of his bed  jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door the apparition wore white muslin on its head a fichu round its bare neck over a winecoloured dress fulled out below its slender waist  it held one arm akimbo and the other raised rightangled holding a fan which touched its head  this ought to be a basket of grapes it whispered but i havent got it here its my goya dress and this is the attitude in the picture do you like it  its a dream  the apparition pirouetted touch it and see  jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently  grape colour came the whisper all grapesla vendimiathe vintage  jons fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist he looked up with adoring eyes  oh jon it whispered bent kissed his forehead pirouetted again and gliding out was gone  jon stayed on his knees and his head fell forward against the bed how long he stayed like that he did not know the little noisesof the tapping nail the feet the skirts rustlingas in a dreamwent on about him and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air and his forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows like the imprint of a flower love filled his soul that love of boy for girl which knows so little hopes so much would not brush the down off for the world and must become in time a fragrant memorya searing passiona humdrum mateshipor once in many times vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes  enough has been said about jon forsyte here and in another place to show what long marches lay between him and his greatgreatgrandfather the first jolyon in dorset down by the sea jon was sensitive as a girl more sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day imaginative as one of his halfsister junes lame duck painters affectionate as a son of his father and his mother naturally would be and yet in his inner tissue there was something of the old founder of his family a secret tenacity of soul a dread of showing his feelings a determination not to know when he was beaten sensitive imaginative affectionate boys get a bad time at school but jon had instinctively kept his nature dark and been but normally unhappy there only with his mother had he up till then been absolutely frank and natural and when he went home to robin hill that saturday his heart was heavy because fleur had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept anything must not even tell her that they had met again unless he found that she knew already so intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in london and the first thing his mother said to him was  so youve had our little friend of the confectioners there jon what is she like on second thoughts  with relief and a high colour jon answered  oh awfully jolly mum  her arm pressed his  jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify fleurs fears and to release his soul he turned to look at her but something in her smiling facesomething which only he perhaps would have caughtstopped the words bubbling up in him could fear go with a smile if so there was fear in her face and out of jon tumbled quite other words about farming holly and the downs talking fast he waited for her to come back to fleur but she did not nor did his father mention her though of course he too must know what deprivation and killing of reality was in his silence about fleurwhen he was so full of her when his mother was so full of jon and his father so full of his mother and so the trio spent the evening of that saturday  after dinner his mother played she seemed to play all the things he liked best and he sat with one knee clasped and his hair standing up where his fingers had run through it he gazed at his mother while she played but he saw fleurfleur in the moonlit orchard fleur in the sunlit gravelpit fleur in that fancy dress swaying whispering stooping kissing his forehead once while he listened he forgot himself and glanced at his father in that other easy chair what was dad looking like that for the expression on his face was so sad and puzzling it filled him with a sort of remorse so that he got up and went and sat on the arm of his fathers chair from there he could not see his face and again he saw fleurin his mothers hands slim and white on the keys in the profile of her face and her powdery hair and down the long room in the open window where the may night walked outside  when he went up to bed his mother came into his room she stood at the window and said  those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done wonderfully i always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon i wish you had known your grandfather jon  were you married to father when he was alive asked jon suddenly  no dear he died in 92very oldeightyfive i think  is father like him  a little but more subtle and not quite so solid  i know from grandfathers portrait who painted that  one of junes lame ducks but its quite good  jon slipped his hand through his mothers arm tell me about the family quarrel mum  he felt her arm quivering no dear thats for your father some day if he thinks fit  then it was serious said jon with a catch in his breath  yes and there was a silence during which neither knew whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most  some people said irene softly think the moon on her back is evil to me shes always lovely look at those cypress shadows jon father says we may go to italy you and i for two months would you like  jon took his hand from under her arm his sensation was so sharp and so confused italy with his mother a fortnight ago it would have been perfection now it filled him with dismay he felt that the sudden suggestion had to do with fleur he stammered out  oh yes onlyi dont know ought inow ive just begun id like to think it over  her voice answered cool and gentle  yes dear think it over but better now than when youve begun farming seriously italy with you it would be nice  jon put his arm round her waist still slim and firm as a girls  do you think you ought to leave father he said feebly feeling very mean  father suggested it he thinks you ought to see italy at least before you settle down to anything  the sense of meanness died in jon he knew yeshe knewthat his father and his mother were not speaking frankly no more than he himself they wanted to keep him from fleur his heart hardened and as if she felt that process going on his mother said  goodnight darling have a good sleep and think it over but it would be lovely  she pressed him to her so quickly that he did not see her face jon stood feeling exactly as he used to when he was a naughty little boy sore because he was not loving and because he was justified in his own eyes  but irene after she had stood a moment in her own room passed through the dressingroom between it and her husbands  well  he will think it over jolyon  watching her lips that wore a little drawn smile jolyon said quietly  you had better let me tell him and have done with it after all jon has the instincts of a gentleman he has only to understand  only he cant understand thats impossible  i believe i could have at his age  irene caught his hand you were always more of a realist than jon and never so innocent  thats true said jolyon its queer isnt it you and i would tell our stories to the world without a particle of shame but our own boy stumps us  weve never cared whether the world approves or not  jon would not disapprove of us  oh jolyon yes hes in love i feel hes in love and hed say my mother once married without love how could she have itll seem to him a crime and so it was  jolyon took her hand and said with a wry smile  ah why on earth are we born young now if only we were born old and grew younger year by year we should understand how things happen and drop all our cursed intolerance but you know if the boy is really in love he wont forget even if he goes to italy were a tenacious breed and hell know by instinct why hes being sent nothing will really cure him but the shock of being told  let me try anyway  jolyon stood a moment without speaking between this devil and this deep seathe pain of a dreaded disclosure and the grief of losing his wife for two monthshe secretly hoped for the devil yet if she wished for the deep sea he must put up with it after all it would be training for that departure from which there would be no return and taking her in his arms he kissed her eyes and said  as you will my love     xiduet  that small emotion love grows amazingly when threatened with extinction jon reached paddington station half an hour before his time and a full week after as it seemed to him he stood at the appointed bookstall amid a crowd of sunday travellers in a harris tweed suit exhaling as it were the emotion of his thumping heart he read the names of the novels on the bookstall and bought one at last to avoid being regarded with suspicion by the bookstall clerk it was called the heart of the trail which must mean something though it did not seem to he also bought the ladys mirror and the landsman every minute was an hour long and full of horrid imaginings after nineteen had passed he saw her with a bag and a porter wheeling her luggage she came swiftly she came cool she greeted him as if he were a brother  first class she said to the porter corner seats opposite  jon admired her frightful selfpossession  cant we get a carriage to ourselves he whispered  no good its a stopping train after maidenhead perhaps look natural jon  jon screwed his features into a scowl they got inwith two other beastsoh heaven he tipped the porter unnaturally in his confusion the brute deserved nothing for putting them in there and looking as if he knew all about it into the bargain  fleur hid herself behind the ladys mirror jon imitated her behind the landsman the train started fleur let the ladys mirror fall and leaned forward  well she said  its seemed about fifteen days  she nodded and jons face lighted up at once  look natural murmured fleur and went off into a bubble of laughter it hurt him how could he look natural with italy hanging over him he had meant to break it to her gently but now he blurted it out  they want me to go to italy with mother for two months  fleur drooped her eyelids turned a little pale and bit her lips oh she said it was all but it was much  that oh was like the quick drawback of the wrist in fencing ready for riposte it came  you must go  go said jon in a strangled voice  of course  buttwo monthsits ghastly  no said fleur six weeks youll have forgotten me by then well meet in the national gallery the day after you get back  jon laughed  but suppose youve forgotten me he muttered into the noise of the train  fleur shook her head  some other beast murmured jon  her foot touched his  no other beast she said lifting the ladys mirror  the train stopped two passengers got out and one got in  i shall die thought jon if were not alone at all  the train went on and again fleur leaned forward  i never let go she said do you  jon shook his head vehemently  never he said will you write to me  no but you canto my club  she had a club she was wonderful  did you pump holly he muttered  yes but i got nothing i didnt dare pump hard  what can it be cried jon  i shall find out all right  a long silence followed till fleur said this is maidenhead stand by jon  the train stopped the remaining passenger got out fleur drew down her blind  quick she cried hang out look as much of a beast as you can  jon blew his nose and scowled never in all his life had he scowled like that an old lady recoiled a young one tried the handle it turned but the door would not open the train moved the young lady darted to another carriage  what luck cried jon it jammed  yes said fleur i was holding it  the train moved out and jon fell on his knees  look out for the corridor she whispered andquick  her lips met his and though their kiss only lasted perhaps ten seconds jons soul left his body and went so far beyond that when he was again sitting opposite that demure figure he was pale as death he heard her sigh and the sound seemed to him the most precious he had ever heardan exquisite declaration that he meant something to her  six weeks isnt really long she said and you can easily make it six if you keep your head out there and never seem to think of me  jon gasped  this is just whats really wanted jon to convince them dont you see if were just as bad when you come back theyll stop being ridiculous about it only im sorry its not spain theres a girl in a goya picture at madrid whos like me father says only she isntweve got a copy of her  it was to jon like a ray of sunshine piercing through a fog ill make it spain he said mother wont mind shes never been there and my father thinks a lot of goya  oh yes hes a painterisnt he  only watercolour said jon with honesty  when we come to reading jon get out first and go down to caversham lock and wait for me ill send the car home and well walk by the towingpath  jon seized her hand in gratitude and they sat silent with the world well lost and one eye on the corridor but the train seemed to run twice as fast now and its sound was almost lost in that of jons sighing  were getting near said fleur the towingpaths awfully exposed one more oh jon dont forget me  jon answered with his kiss and very soon a flushed distractedlooking youth could have been seenas they sayleaping from the train and hurrying along the platform searching his pockets for his ticket  when at last she rejoined him on the towingpath a little beyond caversham lock he had made an effort and regained some measure of equanimity if they had to part he would not make a scene a breeze by the bright river threw the white side of the willow leaves up into the sunlight and followed those two with its faint rustle  i told our chauffeur that i was traingiddy said fleur did you look pretty natural as you went out  i dont know what is natural  its natural to you to look seriously happy when i first saw you i thought you werent a bit like other people  exactly what i thought when i saw you i knew at once i should never love anybody else  fleur laughed  were absurdly young and loves young dream is out of date jon besides its awfully wasteful think of all the fun you might have you havent begun even its a shame really and theres me i wonder  confusion came on jons spirit how could she say such things just as they were going to part  if you feel like that he said i cant go i shall tell mother that i ought to try and work theres always the condition of the world  the condition of the world  jon thrust his hands deep into his pockets  but there is he said think of the people starving  fleur shook her head no no i never never will make myself miserable for nothing  nothing but theres an awful state of things and of course one ought to help  oh yes i know all that but you cant help people jon theyre hopeless when you pull them out they only get into another hole look at them still fighting and plotting and struggling though theyre dying in heaps all the time idiots  arent you sorry for them  oh sorryyes but im not going to make myself unhappy about it thats no good  and they were silent disturbed by this first glimpse of each others natures  i think people are brutes and idiots said fleur stubbornly  i think theyre poor wretches said jon it was as if they had quarrelledand at this supreme and awful moment with parting visible out there in that last gap of the willows  well go and help your poor wretches and dont think of me  jon stood still sweat broke out on his forehead and his limbs trembled fleur too had stopped and was frowning at the river  i must believe in things said jon with a sort of agony were all meant to enjoy life  fleur laughed yes and thats what you wont do if you dont take care but perhaps your idea of enjoyment is to make yourself wretched there are lots of people like that of course  she was pale her eyes had darkened her lips had thinned was it fleur thus staring at the water jon had an unreal feeling as if he were passing through the scene in a book where the lover has to choose between love and duty but just then she looked round at him never was anything so intoxicating as that vivacious look it acted on him exactly as the tug of a chain acts on a dogbrought him up to her with his tail wagging and his tongue out  dont lets be silly she said times too short look jon you can just see where ive got to cross the river there round the bend where the woods begin  jon saw a gable a chimney or two a patch of wall through the treesand felt his heart sink  i mustnt dawdle any more its no good going beyond the next hedge it gets all open lets get on to it and say goodbye  they went side by side hand in hand silently toward the hedge where the mayflower both pink and white was in full bloom  my clubs the talisman stratton street piccadilly letters there will be quite safe and im almost always up once a week  jon nodded his face had become extremely set his eyes stared straight before him  todays the twentythird of may said fleur on the ninth of july i shall be in front of the bacchus and ariadne at three oclock will you  i will  if you feel as bad as i its all right let those people pass  a man and woman airing their children went by strung out in sunday fashion  the last of them passed the wicket gate  domesticity said fleur and blotted herself against the hawthorn hedge the blossom sprayed out above her head and one pink cluster brushed her cheek jon put up his hand jealously to keep it off  goodbye jon for a second they stood with hands hard clasped then their lips met for the third time and when they parted fleur broke away and fled through the wicket gate jon stood where she had left him with his forehead against that pink cluster gone for an eternityfor seven weeks all but two days and here he was wasting the last sight of her he rushed to the gate she was walking swiftly on the heels of the straggling children she turned her head he saw her hand make a little flitting gesture then she sped on and the trailing family blotted her out from his view  the words of a comic song          paddington groanworst ever known          he gave a sepulchral paddington groan  came into his head and he sped incontinently back to reading station all the way up to london and down to wansdon he sat with the heart of the trail open on his knee knitting in his head a poem so full of feeling that it would not rhyme     xiicaprice  fleur sped on she had need of rapid motion she was late and wanted all her wits about her when she got in she passed the islands the station and hotel and was about to take the ferry when she saw a skiff with a young man standing up in it and holding to the bushes  miss forsyte he said let me put you across ive come on purpose  she looked at him in blank amazement  its all right ive been having tea with your people i thought id save you the last bit its on my way im just off back to pangbourne my names mont i saw you at the picturegalleryyou rememberwhen your father invited me to see his pictures  oh said fleur yesthe handkerchief  to this young man she owed jon and taking his hand she stepped down into the skiff still emotional and a little out of breath she sat silent not so the young man she had never heard any one say so much in so short a time he told her his age twentyfour his weight ten stone eleven his place of residence not far away described his sensations under fire and what it felt like to be gassed criticized the juno mentioned his own conception of that goddess commented on the goya copy said fleur was not too awfully like it sketched in rapidly the condition of england spoke of monsieur profondor whatever his name wasas an awful sport thought her father had some ripping pictures and some rather dugup hoped he might row down again and take her on the river because he was quite trustworthy inquired her opinion of tchekov gave her his own wished they could go to the russian ballet together some timeconsidered the name fleur forsyte simply topping cursed his people for giving him the name of michael on the top of mont outlined his father and said that if she wanted a good book she should read job his father was rather like job while job still had land  but job didnt have land fleur murmured he only had flocks and herds and moved on  ah answered michael mont i wish my govnor would move on not that i want his land lands an awful bore in these days dont you think  we never have it in my family said fleur we have everything else i believe one of my greatuncles once had a sentimental farm in dorset because we came from there originally but it cost him more than it made him happy  did he sell it  no he kept it  why  because nobody would buy it  good for the old boy  no it wasnt good for him father says it soured him his name was swithin  what a corking name  do you know that were getting farther off not nearer this river flows  splendid cried mont dipping his sculls vaguely its good to meet a girl whos got wit  but better to meet a young man whos got it in the plural  young mont raised a hand to tear his hair  look out cried fleur your scull  all right its thick enough to bear a scratch  do you mind sculling said fleur severely i want to get in  ah said mont but when you get in you see i shant see you any more today fini as the french girl said when she jumped on her bed after saying her prayers dont you bless the day that gave you a french mother and a name like yours  i like my name but father gave it me mother wanted me called marguerite  which is absurd do you mind calling me m m and letting me call you f f its in the spirit of the age  i dont mind anything so long as i get in  mont caught a little crab and answered that was a nasty one  please row  i am and he did for several strokes looking at her with rueful eagerness of course you know he ejaculated pausing that i came to see you not your fathers pictures  fleur rose  if you dont row i shall get out and swim  really and truly then i could come in after you  mr mont im late and tired please put me on shore at once  when she stepped out on to the garden landingstage he rose and grasping his hair with both hands looked at her  fleur smiled  dont cried the irrepressible mont i know youre going to say out damned hair  fleur whisked round threw him a wave of her hand goodbye mr mm she called and was gone among the rosetrees she looked at her wristwatch and the windows of the house it struck her as curiously uninhabited past six the pigeons were just gathering to roost and sunlight slanted on the dovecot on their snowy feathers and beyond in a shower on the top boughs of the woods the click of billiardballs came from the inglenookjack cardigan no doubt a faint rustling too from an eucalyptustree startling southerner in this old english garden she reached the verandah and was passing in but stopped at the sound of voices from the drawingroom to her left mother monsieur profond from behind the verandah screen which fenced the inglenook she heard these words  i dont annette  did father know that he called her mother annette always on the side of her fatheras children are ever on one side or the other in houses where relations are a little strainedshe stood uncertain her mother was speaking in her low pleasing slightly metallic voiceone word she caught demain and profonds answer all right fleur frowned a little sound came out into the stillness then profonds voice im takin a small stroll  fleur darted through the window into the morningroom there he came from the drawingroom crossing the verandah down the lawn and the click of billiardballs which in listening for other sounds she had ceased to hear began again she shook herself passed into the hall and opened the drawingroom door her mother was sitting on the sofa between the windows her knees crossed her head resting on a cushion her lips half parted her eyes half closed she looked extraordinarily handsome  ah here you are fleur your father is beginning to fuss  where is he  in the picturegallery go up  what are you going to do tomorrow mother  tomorrow i go up to london with your aunt  i thought you might be will you get me a quite plain parasol  what colour  green theyre all going back i suppose  yes all you will console your father kiss me then  fleur crossed the room stooped received a kiss on her forehead and went out past the impress of a form on the sofacushions in the other corner she ran upstairs  fleur was by no means the oldfashioned daughter who demands the regulation of her parents lives in accordance with the standard imposed upon herself she claimed to regulate her own life not those of others besides an unerring instinct for what was likely to advantage her own case was already at work in a disturbed domestic atmosphere the heart she had set on jon would have a better chance none the less was she offended as a flower by a crisping wind if that man had really been kissing her mother it wasserious and her father ought to know demain all right and her mother going up to town she turned into her bedroom and hung out of the window to cool her face which had suddenly grown very hot jon must be at the station by now what did her father know about jon probably everythingpretty nearly  she changed her dress so as to look as if she had been in some time and ran up to the gallery  soames was standing stubbornly still before his alfred stevensthe picture he loved best he did not turn at the sound of the door but she knew he had heard and she knew he was hurt she came up softly behind him put her arms round his neck and poked her face over his shoulder till her cheek lay against his it was an advance which had never yet failed but it failed her now and she augured the worst well he said stonily so youve come  is that all murmured fleur from a bad parent and she rubbed her cheek against his  soames shook his head so far as that was possible  why do you keep me on tenterhooks like this putting me off and off  darling it was very harmless  harmless much you know whats harmless and what isnt  fleur dropped her arms  well then dear suppose you tell me and be quite frank about it  and she went over to the windowseat  her father had turned from his picture and was staring at his feet he looked very grey he has nice small feet she thought catching his eye at once averted from her  youre my only comfort said soames suddenly and you go on like this  fleurs heart began to beat  like what dear  again soames gave her a look which but for the affection in it might have been called furtive  you know what i told you he said i dont choose to have anything to do with that branch of our family  yes ducky but i dont know why i shouldnt  soames turned on his heel  im not going into the reasons he said you ought to trust me fleur  the way he spoke those words affected fleur but she thought of jon and was silent tapping her foot against the wainscot unconsciously she had assumed a modern attitude with one leg twisted in and out of the other with her chin on one bent wrist her other arm across her chest and its hand hugging her elbow there was not a line of her that was not involuted and yetin spite of allshe retained a certain grace  you knew my wishes soames went on and yet you stayed on there four days and i suppose that boy came with you today  fleur kept her eyes on him  i dont ask you anything said soames i make no inquisition where youre concerned  fleur suddenly stood up leaning out at the window with her chin on her hands the sun had sunk behind trees the pigeons were perched quite still on the edge of the dovecot the click of the billiardballs mounted and a faint radiance shone out below where jack cardigan had turned the light up  will it make you any happier she said suddenly if i promise you not to see him for saythe next six weeks she was not prepared for a sort of tremble in the blankness of his voice  six weeks six yearssixty years more like dont delude yourself fleur dont delude yourself  fleur turned in alarm  father what is it  soames came close enough to see her face  dont tell me he said that youre foolish enough to have any feeling beyond caprice that would be too much and he laughed  fleur who had never heard him laugh like that thought then it is deep oh what is it and putting her hand through his arm she said lightly  no of course caprice only i like my caprices and i dont like yours dear  mine said soames bitterly and turned away  the light outside had chilled and threw a chalky whiteness on the river the trees had lost all gaiety of colour she felt a sudden hunger for jons face for his hands and the feel of his lips again on hers and pressing her arms tight across her breast she forced out a little light laugh  o la la what a small fuss as profond would say father i dont like that man  she saw him stop and take something out of his breast pocket  you dont he said why  nothing murmured fleur just caprice  no said soames not caprice and he tore what was in his hands across youre right i dont like him either  look said fleur softly there he goes i hate his shoes they dont make any noise  down in the failing light prosper profond moved his hands in his side pockets whistling softly in his beard he stopped and glanced up at the sky as if saying i dont think much of that small moon  fleur drew back isnt he a great cat she whispered and the sharp click of the billiardballs rose as if jack cardigan had capped the cat the moon caprice and tragedy with in off the red  monsieur profond had resumed his stroll to a teasing little tune in his beard what was it oh yes from rigoletto donna a mobile just what he would think she squeezed her fathers arm  prowling she muttered as he turned the corner of the house it was past that disillusioned moment which divides the day and nightstill and lingering and warm with hawthorn scent and lilac scent clinging on the riverside air a blackbird suddenly burst out jon would be in london by now in the park perhaps crossing the serpentine thinking of her a little sound beside her made her turn her eyes her father was again tearing the paper in his hands fleur saw it was a cheque  i shant sell him my gauguin he said i dont know what your aunt and imogen see in him  or mother  your mother said soames  poor father she thought he never looks happynot really happy i dont want to make him worse but of course i shall have to when jon comes back oh well sufficient unto the night  im going to dress she said  in her room she had a fancy to put on her freak dress it was of gold tissue with little trousers of the same tightly drawn in at the ankles a pages cape slung from the shoulders little gold shoes and a goldwinged mercury helmet and all over her were tiny gold bells especially on the helmet so that if she shook her head she pealed when she was dressed she felt quite sick because jon could not see her it even seemed a pity that the sprightly young man michael mont would not have a view but the gong had sounded and she went down  she made a sensation in the drawingroom winifred thought it most amusing imogen was enraptured jack cardigan called it stunning ripping topping and corking  monsieur profond smiling with his eyes said thats a nice small dress her mother very handsome in black sat looking at her and said nothing it remained for her father to apply the test of common sense what did you put on that thing for youre not going to dance  fleur spun round and the bells pealed  caprice  soames stared at her and turning away gave his arm to winifred jack cardigan took her mother prosper profond took imogen fleur went in by herself with her bells jingling  the small moon had soon dropped down and may night had fallen soft and warm enwrapping with its grapebloom colour and its scents the billion caprices intrigues passions longings and regrets of men and women happy was jack cardigan who snored into imogens white shoulder fit as a flea or timothy in his mausoleum too old for anything but babys slumber for so many lay awake or dreamed teased by the crisscross of the world  the dew fell and the flowers closed cattle grazed on in the river meadows feeling with their tongues for the grass they could not see and the sheep on the downs lay quiet as stones pheasants in the tall trees of the pangbourne woods larks on their grassy nests above the gravelpit at wansdon swallows in the eaves at robin hill and the sparrows of mayfair all made a dreamless night of it soothed by the lack of wind the mayfly filly hardly accustomed to her new quarters scraped at her straw a little and the few nightflitting thingsbats moths owlswere vigorous in the warm darkness but the peace of night lay in the brain of all daytime nature colourless and still men and women alone riding the hobbyhorses of anxiety or love burned their wavering tapers of dream and thought into the lonely hours  fleur leaning out of her window heard the hall clocks muffled chime of twelve the tiny splash of a fish the sudden shaking of an aspens leaves in the puffs of breeze that rose along the river the distant rumble of a night train and time and again the sounds which none can put a name to in the darkness soft obscure expressions of uncatalogued emotions from man and beast bird and machine or maybe from departed forsytes darties cardigans taking night strolls back into a world which had once suited their embodied spirits but fleur heeded not these sounds her spirit far from disembodied fled with swift wing from railwaycarriage to flowery hedge straining after jon tenacious of his forbidden image and the sound of his voice which was taboo and she crinkled her nose retrieving from the perfume of the riverside night that moment when his hand slipped between the mayflowers and her cheek long she leaned out in her freak dress keen to burn her wings at lifes candle while the moths brushed her cheeks on their pilgrimage to the lamp on her dressingtable ignorant that in a forsytes house there is no open flame but at last even she felt sleepy and forgetting her bells drew quickly in  through the open window of his room alongside annettes soames wakeful too heard their thin faint tinkle as it might be shaken from stars or the dewdrops falling from a flower if one could hear such sounds  caprice he thought i cant tell shes wilful what shall i do fleur  and long into the small night he brooded     part ii     imother and son  to say that jon forsyte accompanied his mother to spain unwillingly would scarcely have been adequate he went as a wellnatured dog goes for a walk with its mistress leaving a choice muttonbone on the lawn he went looking back at it forsytes deprived of their muttonbones are wont to sulk but jon had little sulkiness in his composition he adored his mother and it was his first travel spain had become italy by his simply saying id rather go to spain mum youve been to italy so many times id like it new to both of us  the fellow was subtle besides being naive he never forgot that he was going to shorten the proposed two months into six weeks and must therefore show no sign of wishing to do so for one with so enticing a muttonbone and so fixed an idea he made a good enough travelling companion indifferent to where or when he arrived superior to food and thoroughly appreciative of a country strange to the most travelled englishman fleurs wisdom in refusing to write to him was profound for he reached each new place entirely without hope or fever and could concentrate immediate attention on the donkeys and tumbling bells the priests patios beggars children crowing cocks sombreros cactushedges old high white villages goats olivetrees greening plains singing birds in tiny cages watersellers sunsets melons mules great churches pictures and swimming greybrown mountains of a fascinating land  it was already hot and they enjoyed an absence of their compatriots jon who so far as he knew had no blood in him which was not english was often innately unhappy in the presence of his own countrymen he felt they had no nonsense about them and took a more practical view of things than himself he confided to his mother that he must be an unsociable beastit was jolly to be away from everybody who could talk about the things people did talk about to which irene had replied simply  yes jon i know  in this isolation he had unparalleled opportunities of appreciating what few sons can apprehend the wholeheartedness of a mothers love knowledge of something kept from her made him no doubt unduly sensitive and a southern people stimulated his admiration for her type of beauty which he had been accustomed to hear called spanish but which he now perceived to be no such thing her beauty was neither english french spanish nor italianit was special he appreciated too as never before his mothers subtlety of instinct he could not tell for instance whether she had noticed his absorption in that goya picture la vendimia or whether she knew that he had slipped back there after lunch and again next morning to stand before it full half an hour a second and third time it was not fleur of course but like enough to give him heartacheso dear to loversremembering her standing at the foot of his bed with her hand held above her head to keep a postcard reproduction of this picture in his pocket and slip it out to look at became for jon one of those bad habits which soon or late disclose themselves to eyes sharpened by love fear or jealousy and his mothers were sharpened by all three in granada he was fairly caught sitting on a sunwarmed stone bench in a little battlemented garden on the alhambra hill whence he ought to have been looking at the view his mother he had thought was examining the potted stocks between the polled acacias when her voice said  is that your favourite goya jon  he checked too late a movement such as he might have made at school to conceal some surreptitious document and answered yes  it certainly is most charming but i think i prefer the quitasol your father would go crazy about goya i dont believe he saw them when he was in spain in 92  in 92nine years before he had been born what had been the previous existences of his father and his mother if they had a right to share in his future surely he had a right to share in their pasts he looked up at her but something in her facea look of life hardlived the mysterious impress of emotions experience and sufferingseemed with its incalculable depth its purchased sanctity to make curiosity impertinent his mother must have had a wonderfully interesting life she was so beautiful and sosobut he could not frame what he felt about her he got up and stood gazing down at the town at the plain all green with crops and the ring of mountains glamorous in sinking sunlight her life was like the past of this old moorish city full deep remotehis own life as yet such a baby of a thing hopelessly ignorant and innocent they said that in those mountains to the west which rose sheer from the bluegreen plain as if out of a sea phoenicians had dwelta dark strange secret race above the land his mothers life was as unknown to him as secret as that phoenician past was to the town down there whose cocks crowed and whose children played and clamoured so gaily day in day out he felt aggrieved that she should know all about him and he nothing about her except that she loved him and his father and was beautiful his callow ignorancehe had not even had the advantage of the war like nearly everybody elsemade him small in his own eyes  that night from the balcony of his bedroom he gazed down on the roof of the townas if inlaid with honeycomb of jet ivory and gold and long after he lay awake listening to the cry of the sentry as the hours struck and forming in his head these lines       voice in the night crying down in the old sleeping       spanish city darkened under her white stars       what says the voiceits clearlingering anguish       just the watchman telling his dateless tale of safety       just a roadman flinging to the moon his song       no  tis one deprived whose lovers heart is weeping       just his cry how long  the word deprived seemed to him cold and unsatisfactory but bereaved was too final and no other word of two syllables shortlong came to him which would enable him to keep whose lovers heart is weeping it was past two by the time he had finished it and past three before he went to sleep having said it over to himself at least twentyfour times next day he wrote it out and enclosed it in one of those letters to fleur which he always finished before he went down so as to have his mind free and companionable  about noon that same day on the tiled terrace of their hotel he felt a sudden dull pain in the back of his head a queer sensation in the eyes and sickness the sun had touched him too affectionately the next three days were passed in semidarkness and a dulled aching indifference to all except the feel of ice on his forehead and his mothers smile she never moved from his room never relaxed her noiseless vigilance which seemed to jon angelic but there were moments when he was extremely sorry for himself and wished terribly that fleur could see him several times he took a poignant imaginary leave of her and of the earth tears oozing out of his eyes he even prepared the message he would send to her by his motherwho would regret to her dying day that she had ever sought to separate themhis poor mother he was not slow however in perceiving that he had now his excuse for going home  toward halfpast six each evening came a gasgacha of bellsa cascade of tumbling chimes mounting from the city below and falling back chime on chime after listening to them on the fourth day he said suddenly  id like to be back in england mum the suns too hot  very well darling as soon as youre fit to travel and at once he felt better andmeaner  they had been out five weeks when they turned toward home jons head was restored to its pristine clarity but he was confined to a hat lined by his mother with many layers of orange and green silk and he still walked from choice in the shade as the long struggle of discretion between them drew to its close he wondered more and more whether she could see his eagerness to get back to that which she had brought him away from condemned by spanish providence to spend a day in madrid between their trains it was but natural to go again to the prado jon was elaborately casual this time before his goya girl now that he was going back to her he could afford a lesser scrutiny it was his mother who lingered before the picture saying  the face and the figure of the girl are exquisite  jon heard her uneasily did she understand but he felt once more that he was no match for her in selfcontrol and subtlety she could in some supersensitive way of which he had not the secret feel the pulse of his thoughts she knew by instinct what he hoped and feared and wished it made him terribly uncomfortable and guilty having beyond most boys a conscience he wished she would be frank with him he almost hoped for an open struggle but none came and steadily silently they travelled north thus did he first learn how much better than men women play a waiting game in paris they had again to pause for a day jon was grieved because it lasted two owing to certain matters in connection with a dressmaker as if his mother who looked beautiful in anything had any need of dresses the happiest moment of his travel was that when he stepped on to the folkestone boat  standing by the bulwark rail with her arm in his she said  im afraid you havent enjoyed it much jon but youve been very sweet to me  jon squeezed her arm  oh yes ive enjoyed it awfullyexcept for my head lately  and now that the end had come he really had feeling a sort of glamour over the past weeksa kind of painful pleasure such as he had tried to screw into those lines about the voice in the night crying a feeling such as he had known as a small boy listening avidly to chopin yet wanting to cry and he wondered why it was that he couldnt say to her quite simply what she had said to him  you were very sweet to me oddone never could be nice and natural like that he substituted the words i expect we shall be sick  they were and reached london somewhat attenuated having been away six weeks and two days without a single allusion to the subject which had hardly ever ceased to occupy their minds     iifathers and daughters  deprived of his wife and son by the spanish adventure jolyon found the solitude at robin hill intolerable a philosopher when he has all that he wants is different from a philosopher when he has not accustomed however to the idea if not to the reality of resignation he would perhaps have faced it out but for his daughter june he was a lame duck now and on her conscience having achievedmomentarilythe rescue of an etcher in low circumstances which she happened to have in hand she appeared at robin hill a fortnight after irene and jon had gone june was living now in a tiny house with a big studio at chiswick a forsyte of the best period so far as the lack of responsibility was concerned she had overcome the difficulty of a reduced income in a manner satisfactory to herself and her father the rent of the gallery off cork street which he had bought for her and her increased income tax happening to balance it had been quite simpleshe no longer paid him the rent the gallery might be expected now at any time after eighteen years of barren usufruct to pay its way so that she was sure her father would not feel it through this device she still had twelve hundred a year and by reducing what she ate and in place of two belgians in a poor way employing one austrian in a poorer practically the same surplus for the relief of genius after three days at robin hill she carried her father back with her to town in those three days she had stumbled on the secret he had kept for two years and had instantly decided to cure him she knew in fact the very man he had done wonders with paul postthat painter a little in advance of futurism and she was impatient with her father because his eyebrows would go up and because he had heard of neither of course if he hadnt faith he would never get well it was absurd not to have faith in the man who had healed paul post so that he had only just relapsed from having overworked or overlived himself again the great thing about this healer was that he relied on nature he had made a special study of the symptoms of naturewhen his patient failed in any natural symptom he supplied the poison which caused itand there you were she was extremely hopeful her father had clearly not been living a natural life at robin hill and she intended to provide the symptoms he wasshe feltout of touch with the times which was not natural his heart wanted stimulating in the little chiswick house she and the austriana grateful soul so devoted to june for rescuing her that she was in danger of decease from overworkstimulated jolyon in all sorts of ways preparing him for his cure but they could not keep his eyebrows down as for example when the austrian woke him at eight oclock just as he was going to sleep or june took the times away from him because it was unnatural to read that stuff when he ought to be taking an interest in life he never failed indeed to be astonished at her resource especially in the evenings for his benefit as she declared though he suspected that she also got something out of it she assembled the age so far as it was satellite to genius and with some solemnity it would move up and down the studio before him in the foxtrot and that more mental form of dancingthe onestepwhich so pulled against the music that jolyons eyebrows would be almost lost in his hair from wonder at the strain it must impose on the dancers willpower aware that hung on the line in the water colour society he was a back number to those with any pretension to be called artists he would sit in the darkest corner he could find and wonder about rhythm on which so long ago he had been raised and when june brought some girl or young man up to him he would rise humbly to their level so far as that was possible and think dear me this is very dull for them having his fathers perennial sympathy with youth he used to get very tired from entering into their points of view but it was all stimulating and he never failed in admiration of his daughters indomitable spirit even genius itself attended these gatherings now and then with its nose on one side and june always introduced it to her father this she felt was exceptionally good for him for genius was a natural symptom he had never hadfond as she was of him  certain as a man can be that she was his own daughter he often wondered whence she got herselfher redgold hair now greyed into a special colour her direct spirited face so different from his own rather folded and subtilised countenance her little lithe figure when he and most of the forsytes were tall and he would dwell on the origin of species and debate whether she might be danish or celtic celtic he thought from her pugnacity and her taste in fillets and djibbahs it was not too much to say that he preferred her to the age with which she was surrounded youthful though for the greater part it was she took however too much interest in his teeth for he still had some of those natural symptoms her dentist at once found staphylococcus aureus present in pure culture which might cause boils of course and wanted to take out all the teeth he had and supply him with two complete sets of unnatural symptoms jolyons native tenacity was roused and in the studio that evening he developed his objections he had never had any boils and his own teeth would last his time of coursejune admittedthey would last his time if he didnt have them out but if he had more teeth he would have a better heart and his time would be longer his recalcitranceshe saidwas a symptom of his whole attitude he was taking it lying down he ought to be fighting when was he going to see the man who had cured paul post jolyon was very sorry but the fact was he was not going to see him june chafed pondridgeshe saidthe healer was such a fine man and he had such difficulty in making two ends meet and getting his theories recognised it was just such indifference and prejudice as her father manifested which was keeping him back it would be so splendid for both of them  i perceive said jolyon that you are trying to kill two birds with one stone  to cure you mean cried june  my dear its the same thing  june protested it was unfair to say that without a trial  jolyon thought he might not have the chance of saying it after  dad cried june youre hopeless  that said jolyon is a fact but i wish to remain hopeless as long as possible i shall let sleeping dogs lie my child they are quiet at present  thats not giving science a chance cried june youve no idea how devoted pondridge is he puts his science before everything  just replied jolyon puffing the mild cigarette to which he was reduced as mr paul post puts his art eh art for arts sakescience for the sake of science i know those enthusiastic egomaniac gentry they vivisect you without blinking im enough of a forsyte to give them the goby june  dad said june if you only knew how oldfashioned that sounds nobody can afford to be halfhearted nowadays  im afraid murmured jolyon with his smile thats the only natural symptom with which mr pondridge need not supply me we are born to be extreme or to be moderate my dear though if youll forgive my saying so half the people nowadays who believe theyre extreme are really very moderate im getting on as well as i can expect and i must leave it at that  june was silent having experienced in her time the inexorable character of her fathers amiable obstinacy so far as his own freedom of action was concerned  how he came to let her know why irene had taken jon to spain puzzled jolyon for he had little confidence in her discretion after she had brooded on the news it brought a rather sharp discussion during which he perceived to the full the fundamental opposition between her active temperament and his wifes passivity he even gathered that a little soreness still remained from that generationold struggle between them over the body of philip bosinney in which the passive had so signally triumphed over the active principle  according to june it was foolish and even cowardly to hide the past from jon sheer opportunism she called it  which jolyon put in mildly is the working principle of real life my dear  oh cried june you dont really defend her for not telling jon dad if it were left to you you would  i might but simply because i know he must find out which will be worse than if we told him  then why dont you tell him its just sleeping dogs again  my dear said jolyon i wouldnt for the world go against irenes instinct hes her boy  yours too cried june  what is a mans instinct compared with a mothers  well i think its very weak of you  i dare say said jolyon i dare say  and that was all she got from him but the matter rankled in her brain she could not bear sleeping dogs and there stirred in her a tortuous impulse to push the matter toward decision jon ought to be told so that either his feeling might be nipped in the bud or flowering in spite of the past come to fruition and she determined to see fleur and judge for herself when june determined on anything delicacy became a somewhat minor consideration after all she was soames cousin and they were both interested in pictures she would go and tell him that he ought to buy a paul post or perhaps a piece of sculpture by boris strumolowski and of course she would say nothing to her father she went on the following sunday looking so determined that she had some difficulty in getting a cab at reading station the river country was lovely in those days of her own month and june ached at its loveliness she who had passed through this life without knowing what union was had a love of natural beauty which was almost madness and when she came to that choice spot where soames had pitched his tent she dismissed her cab because business over she wanted to revel in the bright water and the woods she appeared at his front door therefore as a mere pedestrian and sent in her card it was in junes character to know that when her nerves were fluttering she was doing something worth while if ones nerves did not flutter she was taking the line of least resistance and knew that nobleness was not obliging her she was conducted to a drawingroom which though not in her style showed every mark of fastidious elegance thinking too much tastetoo many knickknacks she saw in an old lacquerframed mirror the figure of a girl coming in from the verandah clothed in white and holding some white roses in her hand she had reflected in that silverygrey pool of glass a visionlike appearance as if a pretty ghost had come out of the green garden  how do you do said june turning round im a cousin of your fathers  oh yes i saw you in that confectioners  with my young stepbrother is your father in  he will be directly hes only gone for a little walk  june slightly narrowed her blue eyes and lifted her decided chin  your names fleur isnt it ive heard of you from holly what do you think of jon  the girl lifted the roses in her hand looked at them and answered calmly  hes quite a nice boy  not a bit like holly or me is he  not a bit  shes cool thought june  and suddenly the girl said i wish youd tell me why our families dont get on  confronted with the question she had advised her father to answer june was silent whether because this girl was trying to get something out of her or simply because what one would do theoretically is not always what one will do when it comes to the point  you know said the girl the surest way to make people find out the worst is to keep them ignorant my fathers told me it was a quarrel about property but i dont believe it weve both got heaps they wouldnt have been so bourgeois as all that  june flushed the word applied to her grandfather and father offended her  my grandfather she said was very generous and my father is too neither of them was in the least bourgeois  well what was it then repeated the girl conscious that this young forsyte meant having what she wanted june at once determined to prevent her and to get something for herself instead  why do you want to know  the girl smelled at her roses i only want to know because they wont tell me  well it was about property but theres more than one kind  that makes it worse now i really must know  junes small and resolute face quivered she was wearing a round cap and her hair had fluffed out under it she looked quite young at that moment rejuvenated by encounter  you know she said i saw you drop your handkerchief is there anything between you and jon because if so youd better drop that too  the girl grew paler but she smiled  if there were that isnt the way to make me  at the gallantry of that reply june held out her hand  i like you but i dont like your father i never have we may as well be frank  did you come down to tell him that  june laughed no i came down to see you  how delightful of you  this girl could fence  im two and a half times your age said june but i quite sympathize its horrid not to have ones own way  the girl smiled again i really think you might tell me  how the child stuck to her point  its not my secret but ill see what i can do because i think both you and jon ought to be told and now ill say goodbye  wont you wait and see father  june shook her head how can i get over to the other side  ill row you across  look said june impulsively next time youre in london come and see me this is where i live i generally have young people in the evening but i shouldnt tell your father that youre coming  the girl nodded  watching her scull the skiff across june thought shes awfully pretty and well made i never thought soames would have a daughter as pretty as this she and jon would make a lovely couple  the instinct to couple starved within herself was always at work in june she stood watching fleur row back the girl took her hand off a scull to wave farewell and june walked languidly on between the meadows and the river with an ache in her heart youth to youth like the dragonflies chasing each other and love like the sun warming them through and through her youth so long agowhen phil and sheand since nothingno one had been quite what she had wanted and so she had missed it all but what a coil was round those two young things if they really were in love as holly would have itas her father and irene and soames himself seemed to dread what a coil and what a barrier and the itch for the future the contempt as it were for what was overpast which forms the active principle moved in the heart of one who ever believed that what one wanted was more important than what other people did not want from the bank awhile in the warm summer stillness she watched the waterlily plants and willow leaves the fishes rising sniffed the scent of grass and meadowsweet wondering how she could force everybody to be happy jon and fleur two little lame duckscharming callow yellow little ducks a great pity surely something could be done one must not take such situations lying down she walked on and reached a station hot and cross  that evening faithful to the impulse toward direct action which made many people avoid her she said to her father  dad ive been down to see young fleur i think shes very attractive its no good hiding our heads under our wings is it  the startled jolyon set down his barleywater and began crumbling his bread  its what you appear to be doing he said do you realise whose daughter she is  cant the dead past bury its dead  jolyon rose  certain things can never be buried  i disagree said june its that which stands in the way of all happiness and progress you dont understand the age dad its got no use for outgrown things why do you think it matters so terribly that jon should know about his mother who pays any attention to that sort of thing now the marriage laws are just as they were when soames and irene couldnt get a divorce and you had to come in weve moved and they havent so nobody cares marriage without a decent chance of relief is only a sort of slaveowning people oughtnt to own each other everybody sees that now if irene broke such laws what does it matter  its not for me to disagree there said jolyon but thats all quite beside the mark this is a matter of human feeling  of course it is cried june the human feeling of those two young things  my dear said jolyon with gentle exasperation youre talking nonsense  im not if they prove to be really fond of each other why should they be made unhappy because of the past  you havent lived that past i havethrough the feelings of my wife through my own nerves and my imagination as only one who is devoted can  june too rose and began to wander restlessly  if she said suddenly she were the daughter of philip bosinney i could understand you better irene loved him she never loved soames  jolyon uttered a deep soundthe sort of noise an italian peasant woman utters to her mule his heart had begun beating furiously but he paid no attention to it quite carried away by his feelings  that shows how little you understand neither i nor jon if i know him would mind a lovepast its the brutality of a union without love this girl is the daughter of the man who once owned jons mother as a negroslave was owned you cant lay that ghost dont try to june its asking us to see jon joined to the flesh and blood of the man who possessed jons mother against her will its no good mincing words i want it clear once for all and now i mustnt talk any more or i shall have to sit up with this all night and putting his hand over his heart jolyon turned his back on his daughter and stood looking at the river thames  june who by nature never saw a hornets nest until she had put her head into it was seriously alarmed she came and slipped her arm through his not convinced that he was right and she herself wrong because that was not natural to her she was yet profoundly impressed by the obvious fact that the subject was very bad for him she rubbed her cheek against his shoulder and said nothing  after taking her elderly cousin across fleur did not land at once but pulled in among the reeds into the sunshine the peaceful beauty of the afternoon seduced for a little one not much given to the vague and poetic in the field beyond the bank where her skiff lay up a machine drawn by a grey horse was turning an early field of hay she watched the grass cascading over and behind the light wheels with fascinationit looked so cool and fresh the click and swish blended with the rustle of the willows and the poplars and the cooing of a woodpigeon in a true river song alongside in the deep green water weeds like yellow snakes were writhing and nosing with the current pied cattle on the farther side stood in the shade lazily swishing their tails it was an afternoon to dream and she took out jons lettersnot flowery effusions but haunted in their recital of things seen and done by a longing very agreeable to her and all ending your devoted j fleur was not sentimental her desires were ever concrete and concentrated but what poetry there was in the daughter of soames and annette had certainly in those weeks of waiting gathered round her memories of jon they all belonged to grass and blossom flowers and running water she enjoyed him in the scents absorbed by her crinkling nose the stars could persuade her that she was standing beside him in the centre of the map of spain and of an early morning the dewy cobwebs the hazy sparkle and promise of the day down in the garden were jon personified to her  two white swans came majestically by while she was reading his letters followed by their brood of six young swans in a line with just so much water between each tail and head a flotilla of grey destroyers fleur thrust her letters back got out her sculls and pulled up to the landingstage crossing the lawn she wondered whether she should tell her father of junes visit if he learned of it from the butler he might think it odd if she did not it gave her too another chance to startle out of him the reason of the feud she went therefore up the road to meet him  soames had gone to look at a patch of ground on which the local authorities were proposing to erect a sanatorium for people with weak lungs faithful to his native individualism he took no part in local affairs content to pay the rates which were always going up he could not however remain indifferent to this new and dangerous scheme the site was not half a mile from his own house he was quite of opinion that the country should stamp out tuberculosis but this was not the place it should be done farther away he took indeed an attitude common to all true forsytes that disability of any sort in other people was not his affair and the state should do its business without prejudicing in any way the natural advantages which he had acquired or inherited francie the most freespirited forsyte of his generation except perhaps that fellow jolyon had once asked him in her malicious way did you ever see the name forsyte in a subscription list soames that was as it might be but a sanatorium would depreciate the neighbourhood and he should certainly sign the petition which was being got up against it returning with this decision fresh within him he saw fleur coming  she was showing him more affection of late and the quiet time down here with her in this summer weather had been making him feel quite young annette was always running up to town for one thing or another so that he had fleur to himself almost as much as he could wish to be sure young mont had formed a habit of appearing on his motorcycle almost every other day thank goodness the young fellow had shaved off his halftoothbrushes and no longer looked like a mountebank with a girl friend of fleurs who was staying in the house and a neighbouring youth or so they made two couples after dinner in the hall to the music of the electric pianola which performed foxtrots unassisted with a surprised shine on its expressive surface annette even now and then passed gracefully up and down in the arms of one or other of the young men and soames coming to the drawingroom door would lift his nose a little sideways and watch them waiting to catch a smile from fleur then move back to his chair by the drawingroom hearth to peruse the times or some other collectors price list to his everanxious eyes fleur showed no signs of remembering that caprice of hers  when she reached him on the dusty road he slipped his hand within her arm  who do you think has been to see you dad she couldnt wait guess  i never guess said soames uneasily who  your cousin june forsyte  quite unconsciously soames gripped her arm what did she want  i dont know but it was rather breaking through the feud wasnt it  feud what feud  the one that exists in your imagination dear  soames dropped her arm was she mocking or trying to draw him on  i suppose she wanted me to buy a picture he said at last  i dont think so perhaps it was just family affection  shes only a first cousin once removed muttered soames  and the daughter of your enemy  what dyou mean by that  i beg your pardon dear i thought he was  enemy repeated soames its ancient history i dont know where you get your notions  from june forsyte  it had come to her as an inspiration that if he thought she knew or were on the edge of knowledge he would tell her  soames was startled but she had underrated his caution and tenacity  if you know he said coldly why do you plague me  fleur saw that she had overreached herself  i dont want to plague you darling as you say why want to know more why want to know anything of that small mysteryje men fiche as profond says  that chap said soames profoundly  that chap indeed played a considerable if invisible part this summerfor he had not turned up again ever since the sunday when fleur had drawn attention to him prowling on the lawn soames had thought of him a good deal and always in connection with annette for no reason except that she was looking handsomer than for some time past his possessive instinct subtle less formal more elastic since the war kept all misgiving underground as one looks on some american river quiet and pleasant knowing that an alligator perhaps is lying in the mud with his snout just raised and indistinguishable from a snag of woodso soames looked on the river of his own existence subconscious of monsieur profond refusing to see more than the suspicion of his snout he had at this epoch in his life practically all he wanted and was as nearly happy as his nature would permit his senses were at rest his affections found all the vent they needed in his daughter his collection was well known his money well invested his health excellent save for a touch of liver now and again he had not yet begun to worry seriously about what would happen after death inclining to think that nothing would happen he resembled one of his own giltedged securities and to knock the gilt off by seeing anything he could avoid seeing would be he felt instinctively perverse and retrogressive those two crumpled roseleaves fleurs caprice and monsieur profonds snout would level away if he lay on them industriously  that evening chance which visits the lives of even the bestinvested forsytes put a clue into fleurs hands her father came down to dinner without a handkerchief and had occasion to blow his nose  ill get you one dear she had said and ran upstairs in the sachet where she sought for itan old sachet of very faded silkthere were two compartments one held handkerchiefs the other was buttoned and contained something flat and hard by some childish impulse fleur unbuttoned it there was a frame and in it a photograph of herself as a little girl she gazed at it fascinated as one is by ones own presentment it slipped under her fidgeting thumb and she saw that another photograph was behind she pressed her own down further and perceived a face which she seemed to know of a young woman very goodlooking in a very old style of evening dress slipping her own photograph up over it again she took out a handkerchief and went down only on the stairs did she identify that face surelysurely jons mother the conviction came as a shock and she stood still in a flurry of thought why of course jons father had married the woman her father had wanted to marry had cheated him out of her perhaps then afraid of showing by her manner that she had lighted on his secret she refused to think further and shaking out the silk handkerchief entered the diningroom  i chose the softest father  hm said soames i only use those after a cold never mind  that evening passed for fleur in putting two and two together recalling the look on her fathers face in the confectioners shopa look strange and coldly intimate a queer look he must have loved that woman very much to have kept her photograph all this time in spite of having lost her unsparing and matteroffact her mind darted to his relations with her own mother had he ever really loved her she thought not jon was the son of the woman he had really loved surely then he ought not to mind his daughter loving him it only wanted getting used to and a sigh of sheer relief was caught in the folds of her nightgown slipping over her head     iiimeetings  youth only recognises age by fits and starts jon for one had never really seen his fathers age till he came back from spain the face of the fourth jolyon worn by waiting gave him quite a shockit looked so wan and old his fathers mask had been forced awry by the emotion of the meeting so that the boy suddenly realised how much he must have felt their absence he summoned to his aid the thought well i didnt want to go it was out of date for youth to defer to age but jon was by no means typically modern his father had always been so jolly to him and to feel that one meant to begin again at once the conduct which his father had suffered six weeks loneliness to cure was not agreeable  at the question well old man how did the great goya strike you his conscience pricked him badly the great goya only existed because he had created a face which resembled fleurs  on the night of their return he went to bed full of compunction but awoke full of anticipation it was only the fifth of july and no meeting was fixed with fleur until the ninth he was to have three days at home before going back to farm somehow he must contrive to see her  in the lives of men an inexorable rhythm caused by the need for trousers not even the fondest parents can deny on the second day therefore jon went to town and having satisfied his conscience by ordering what was indispensable in conduit street turned his face toward piccadilly stratton street where her club was adjoined devonshire house it would be the merest chance that she should be at her club but he dawdled down bond street with a beating heart noticing the superiority of all other young men to himself they wore their clothes with such an air they had assurance they were old he was suddenly overwhelmed by the conviction that fleur must have forgotten him absorbed in his own feeling for her all these weeks he had mislaid that possibility the corners of his mouth drooped his hands felt clammy fleur with the pick of youth at the beck of her smilefleur incomparable it was an evil moment jon however had a great idea that one must be able to face anything and he braced himself with that dour reflection in front of a bricabrac shop at this highwater mark of what was once the london season there was nothing to mark it out from any other except a grey top hat or two and the sun jon moved on and turning the corner into piccadilly ran into val dartie moving toward the iseeum club to which he had just been elected  hallo young man where are you off to  jon gushed ive just been to my tailors  val looked him up and down thats good im going in here to order some cigarettes then come and have some lunch  jon thanked him he might get news of her from val  the condition of england that nightmare of its press and public men was seen in different perspective within the tobacconists which they now entered  yes sir precisely the cigarette i used to supply your father with bless me mr montague dartie was a customer here fromlet me seethe year melton won the derby one of my very best customers he was a faint smile illumined the tobacconists face manys the tip hes given me to be sure i suppose he took a couple of hundred of these every week year in year out and never changed his cigarette very affable gentleman brought me a lot of custom i was sorry he met with that accident one misses an old customer like him  val smiled his fathers decease had closed an account which had been running longer probably than any other and in a ring of smoke puffed out from that timehonoured cigarette he seemed to see again his fathers face dark goodlooking moustachioed a little puffy in the only halo it had earned his father had his fame here anywaya man who smoked two hundred cigarettes a week who could give tips and run accounts for ever to his tobacconist a hero even that was some distinction to inherit  i pay cash he said how much  to his son sir and cashten and six i shall never forget mr montague dartie ive known him stand talkin to me half an hour we dont get many like him now with everybody in such a hurry the war was bad for manners sirit was bad for manners you were in it i see  no said val tapping his knee i got this in the war before saved my life i expect do you want any cigarettes jon  rather ashamed jon murmured i dont smoke you know and saw the tobacconists lips twisted as if uncertain whether to say good god or nows your chance sir  thats right said val keep off it while you can youll want it when you take a knock this is really the same tobacco then  identical sir a little dearer thats all wonderful staying powerthe british empire i always say  send me down a hundred a week to this address and invoice it monthly come on jon  jon entered the iseeum with curiosity except to lunch now and then at the hotchpotch with his father he had never been in a london club the iseeum comfortable and unpretentious did not move could not so long as george forsyte sat on its committee where his culinary acumen was almost the controlling force the club had made a stand against the newly rich and it had taken all george forsytes prestige and praise of him as a good sportsman to bring in prosper profond  the two were lunching together when the halfbrothersinlaw entered the diningroom and attracted by georges forefinger sat down at their table val with his shrewd eyes and charming smile jon with solemn lips and an attractive shyness in his glance there was an air of privilege around that corner table as though past masters were eating there jon was fascinated by the hypnotic atmosphere the waiter lean in the chaps pervaded with such freemasonical deference he seemed to hang on george forsytes lips to watch the gloat in his eye with a kind of sympathy to follow the movements of the heavy clubmarked silver fondly his liveried arm and confidential voice alarmed jon they came so secretly over his shoulder  except for georges your grandfather tipped me once he was a deuced good judge of a cigar neither he nor the other past master took any notice of him and he was grateful for this the talk was all about the breeding points and prices of horses and he listened to it vaguely at first wondering how it was possible to retain so much knowledge in a head he could not take his eyes off the dark past masterwhat he said was so deliberate and discouragingsuch heavy queer smiledout words jon was thinking of butterflies when he heard him say  i want to see mr soames forsyde take an interest in orses  old soames hes too dry a file  with all his might jon tried not to grow red while the dark past master went on  his daughters an attractive small girl mr soames forsyde is a bit oldfashioned i want to see him have a pleasure some day george forsyte grinned  dont you worry hes not so miserable as he looks hell never show hes enjoying anythingthey might try and take it from him old soames once bit twice shy  well jon said val hastily if youve finished well go and have coffee  who were those jon asked on the stairs i didnt quite  old george forsyte is a first cousin of your fathers and of my uncle soames hes always been here the other chap profond is a queer fish i think hes hanging round soames wife if you ask me  jon looked at him startled but thats awful he said i meanfor fleur  dont suppose fleur cares very much shes very uptodate  her mother  youre very green jon  jon grew red mothers he stammered angrily are different  youre right said val suddenly but things arent what they were when i was your age theres a tomorrow we die feeling thats what old george meant about my uncle soames he doesnt mean to die tomorrow  jon said quickly whats the matter between him and my father  stable secret jon take my advice and bottle up youll do no good by knowing have a liqueur  jon shook his head  i hate the way people keep things from one he muttered and then sneer at one for being green  well you can ask holly if she wont tell you youll believe its for your own good i suppose  jon got up i must go now thanks awfully for the lunch  val smiled up at him halfsorry and yet amused the boy looked so upset  all right see you on friday  i dont know murmured jon  and he did not this conspiracy of silence made him desperate it was humiliating to be treated like a child he retraced his moody steps to stratton street but he would go to her club now and find out the worst to his enquiry the reply was that miss forsyte was not in the club she might be in perhaps later she was often in on mondaythey could not say jon said he would call again and crossing into the green park flung himself down under a tree the sun was bright and a breeze fluttered the leaves of the young limetree beneath which he lay but his heart ached such darkness seemed gathered round his happiness he heard big ben chime three above the traffic the sound moved something in him and taking out a piece of paper he began to scribble on it with a pencil he had jotted a stanza and was searching the grass for another verse when something hard touched his shouldera green parasol there above him stood fleur  they told me youd been and were coming back so i thought you might be out here and you areits rather wonderful  oh fleur i thought youd have forgotten me  when i told you that i shouldnt  jon seized her arm  its too much luck lets get away from this side he almost dragged her on through that too thoughtfully regulated park to find some cover where they could sit and hold each others hands  hasnt anybody cut in he said gazing round at her lashes in suspense above her cheeks  there is a young idiot but he doesnt count  jon felt a twitch of compassion for theyoung idiot  you know ive had sunstroke i didnt tell you  really was it interesting  no mother was an angel has anything happened to you  nothing except that i think ive found out whats wrong between our families jon  his heart began beating very fast  i believe my father wanted to marry your mother and your father got her instead  oh  i came on a photo of her it was in a frame behind a photo of me of course if he was very fond of her that would have made him pretty mad wouldnt it  jon thought for a minute not if she loved my father best  but suppose they were engaged  if we were engaged and you found you loved somebody better i might go cracked but i shouldnt grudge it you  i should you mustnt ever do that with me jon  my god not much  i dont believe that hes ever really cared for my mother  jon was silent vals wordsthe two past masters in the club  you see we dont know went on fleur it may have been a great shock she may have behaved badly to him people do  my mother wouldnt  fleur shrugged her shoulders i dont think we know much about our fathers and mothers we just see them in the light of the way they treat us but theyve treated other people you know before we were bornplenty i expect you see theyre both old look at your father with three separate families  isnt there any place cried jon in all this beastly london where we can be alone  only a taxi  lets get one then  when they were installed fleur asked suddenly are you going back to robin hill i should like to see where you live jon im staying with my aunt for the night but i could get back in time for dinner i wouldnt come to the house of course  jon gazed at her enraptured  splendid i can show it you from the copse we shant meet anybody theres a train at four  the god of property and his forsytes great and small leisured official commercial or professional like the working classes still worked their seven hours a day so that those two of the fourth generation travelled down to robin hill in an empty firstclass carriage dusty and sunwarmed of that too early train they travelled in blissful silence holding each others hands  at the station they saw no one except porters and a villager or two unknown to jon and walked out up the lane which smelled of dust and honeysuckle  for jonsure of her now and without separation before himit was a miraculous dawdle more wonderful than those on the downs or along the river thames it was loveinamistone of those illumined pages of life where every word and smile and every light touch they gave each other were as little gold and red and blue butterflies and flowers and birds scrolled in among the texta happy communing without afterthought which lasted thirtyseven minutes they reached the coppice at the milking hour jon would not take her as far as the farmyard only to where she could see the field leading up to the gardens and the house beyond they turned in among the larches and suddenly at the winding of the path came on irene sitting on an old log seat  there are various kinds of shocks to the vertebrae to the nerves to moral sensibility and more potent and permanent to personal dignity this last was the shock jon received coming thus on his mother he became suddenly conscious that he was doing an indelicate thing to have brought fleur down openlyyes but to sneak her in like this consumed with shame he put on a front as brazen as his nature would permit  fleur was smiling a little defiantly his mothers startled face was changing quickly to the impersonal and gracious it was she who uttered the first words  im very glad to see you it was nice of jon to think of bringing you down to us  we werent coming to the house jon blurted out i just wanted fleur to see where i lived  his mother said quietly  wont you come up and have tea  feeling that he had but aggravated his breach of breeding he heard fleur answer  thanks very much i have to get back to dinner i met jon by accident and we thought it would be rather jolly just to see his home  how selfpossessed she was  of course but you must have tea well send you down to the station my husband will enjoy seeing you  the expression of his mothers eyes resting on him for a moment cast jon down level with the grounda true worm then she led on and fleur followed her he felt like a child trailing after those two who were talking so easily about spain and wansdon and the house up there beyond the trees and the grassy slope he watched the fencing of their eyes taking each other inthe two beings he loved most in the world  he could see his father sitting under the oaktree and suffered in advance all the loss of caste he must go through in the eyes of that tranquil figure with his knees crossed thin old and elegant already he could feel the faint irony which would come into his voice and smile  this is fleur forsyte jolyon jon brought her down to see the house lets have tea at onceshe has to catch a train jon tell them dear and telephone to the dragon for a car  to leave her alone with them was strange and yet as no doubt his mother had foreseen the least of evils at the moment so he ran up into the house now he would not see fleur alone againnot for a minute and they had arranged no further meeting when he returned under cover of the maids and teapots there was not a trace of awkwardness beneath the tree it was all within himself but not the less for that they were talking of the gallery off cork street  we back numbers his father was saying are awfully anxious to find out why we cant appreciate the new stuff you and jon must tell us  its supposed to be satiric isnt it said fleur  he saw his fathers smile  satiric oh i think its more than that what do you say jon  i dont know at all stammered jon his fathers face had a sudden grimness  the young are tired of us our gods and our ideals off with their heads they saysmash their idols and lets get back tonothing and by jove theyve done it jons a poet hell be going in too and stamping on whats left of us property beauty sentimentall smoke we mustnt own anything nowadays not even our feelings they stand in the way ofnothing  jon listened bewildered almost outraged by his fathers words behind which he felt a meaning that he could not reach he didnt want to stamp on anything  nothings the god of today continued jolyon were back where the russians were sixty years ago when they started nihilism  no dad cried jon suddenly we only want to live and we dont know how because of the pastthats all  by george said jolyon thats profound jon is it your own the past old ownerships old passions and their aftermath lets have cigarettes  conscious that his mother had lifted her hand to her lips quickly as if to hush something jon handed the cigarettes he lighted his fathers and fleurs then one for himself had he taken the knock that val had spoken of the smoke was blue when he had not puffed grey when he had he liked the sensation in his nose and the sense of equality it gave him he was glad no one said so youve begun he felt less young  fleur looked at her watch and rose his mother went with her into the house jon stayed with his father puffing at the cigarette  see her into the car old man said jolyon and when shes gone ask your mother to come back to me  jon went he waited in the hall he saw her into the car there was no chance for any word hardly for a pressure of the hand he waited all that evening for something to be said to him nothing was said nothing might have happened he went up to bed and in the mirror on his dressingtable met himself he did not speak nor did the image but both looked as if they thought the more     ivin green street  uncertain whether the impression that prosper profond was dangerous should be traced to his attempt to give val the mayfly filly to a remark of fleurs hes like the hosts of midianhe prowls and prowls around to his preposterous inquiry of jack cardigan whats the use of keepin fit or more simply to the fact that he was a foreigner or alien as it was now called certain that annette was looking particularly handsome and that soameshad sold him a gauguin and then torn up the cheque so that monsieur profond himself had said i didnt get that small picture i bought from mr forsyde  however suspiciously regarded he still frequented winifreds evergreen little house in green street with a goodnatured obtuseness which no one mistook for naivete a word hardly applicable to monsieur prosper profond winifred still found him amusing and would write him little notes saying come and have a jolly with usit was breath of life to her to keep up with the phrases of the day  the mystery with which all felt him to be surrounded was due to his having done seen heard and known everything and found nothing in itwhich was unnatural the english type of disillusionment was familiar enough to winifred who had always moved in fashionable circles it gave a certain cachet or distinction so that one got something out of it but to see nothing in anything not as a pose but because there was nothing in anything was not english and that which was not english one could not help secretly feeling dangerous if not precisely bad form it was like having the mood which the war had left seateddark heavy smiling indifferentin your empire chair it was like listening to that mood talking through thick pink lips above a little diabolic beard it was as jack cardigan expressed itfor the english character at largea bit too thickfor if nothing was really worth getting excited about there were always games and one could make it so even winifred ever a forsyte at heart felt that there was nothing to be had out of such a mood of disillusionment so that it really ought not to be there monsieur profond in fact made the mood too plain in a country which decently veiled such realities  when fleur after her hurried return from robin hill came down to dinner that evening the mood was standing at the window of winifreds little drawingroom looking out into green street with an air of seeing nothing in it and fleur gazed promptly into the fireplace with an air of seeing a fire which was not there  monsieur profond came from the window he was in full fig with a white waistcoat and a white flower in his buttonhole  well miss forsyde he said im awful pleased to see you mr forsyde well i was sayin today i want to see him have some pleasure he worries  you think so said fleur shortly  worries repeated monsieur profond burring the rs  fleur spun round shall i tell you she said what would give him pleasure but the words to hear that you had cleared out died at the expression on his face all his fine white teeth were showing  i was hearin at the club today about his old trouble fleur opened her eyes what do you mean  monsieur profond moved his sleek head as if to minimize his statement  before you were born he said that small business  though conscious that he had cleverly diverted her from his own share in her fathers worry fleur was unable to withstand a rush of nervous curiosity tell me what you heard  why murmured monsieur profond you know all that  i expect i do but i should like to know that you havent heard it all wrong  his first wife murmured monsieur profond  choking back the words he was never married before she said well what about her  mr george forsyde was tellin me about your fathers first wife marryin his cousin jolyon afterward it was a small bit unpleasant i should think i saw their boynice boy  fleur looked up monsieur profond was swimming heavily diabolical before her thatthe reason with the most heroic effort of her life so far she managed to arrest that swimming figure she could not tell whether he had noticed and just then winifred came in  oh here you both are already imogen and i have had the most amusing afternoon at the babies bazaar  what babies said fleur mechanically  the save the babies i got such a bargain my dear a piece of old armenian workfrom before the flood i want your opinion on it prosper  auntie whispered fleur suddenly  at the tone in the girls voice winifred closed in on her  whats the matter arent you well  monsieur profond had withdrawn into the window where he was practically out of hearing  auntie hehe told me that father has been married before is it true that he divorced her and she married jon forsytes father  never in all the life of the mother of four little darties had winifred felt more seriously embarrassed her nieces face was so pale her eyes so dark her voice so whispery and strained  your father didnt wish you to hear she said with all the aplomb she could muster these things will happen ive often told him he ought to let you know  oh said fleur and that was all but it made winifred pat her shouldera firm little shoulder nice and white she never could help an appraising eye and touch in the matter of her niece who would have to be married of coursethough not to that boy jon  weve forgotten all about it years and years ago she said comfortably come and have dinner  no auntie i dont feel very well may i go upstairs  my dear murmured winifred concerned youre not taking this to heart why you havent properly come out yet that boys a child  what boy ive only got a headache but i cant stand that man tonight  well well said winifred go and lie down ill send you some bromide and i shall talk to prosper profond what business had he to gossip though i must say i think its much better you should know  fleur smiled yes she said and slipped from the room  she went up with her head whirling a dry sensation in her throat a guttered frightened feeling in her breast never in her life as yet had she suffered from even momentary fear that she would not get what she had set her heart on the sensations of the afternoon had been full and poignant and this gruesome discovery coming on the top of them had really made her head ache no wonder her father had hidden that photograph so secretly behind her ownashamed of having kept it but could he hate jons mother and yet keep her photograph she pressed her hands over her forehead trying to see things clearly had they told jonhad her visit to robin hill forced them to tell him everything now turned on that she knew they all knew exceptperhapsjon  she walked up and down biting her lip and thinking desperately hard jon loved his mother if they had told him what would he do she could not tell but if they had not told him should she notcould she not get him for herselfget married to him before he knew she searched her memories of robin hill his mothers face so passivewith its dark eyes and as if powdered hair its reserve its smilebaffled her and his fatherskindly sunken ironic instinctively she felt they would shrink from telling jon even now shrink from hurting himfor of course it would hurt him awfully to know  her aunt must be made not to tell her father that she knew so long as neither she herself nor jon were supposed to know there was still a chancefreedom to cover ones tracks and get what her heart was set on but she was almost overwhelmed by her isolation every ones hand was against herevery ones it was as jon had saidhe and she just wanted to live and the past was in their way a past they hadnt shared in and didnt understand oh what a shame and suddenly she thought of june would she help them for somehow june had left on her the impression that she would be sympathetic with their love impatient of obstacle then instinctively she thought i wont give anything away though even to her i darent i mean to have jon against them all  soup was brought up to her and one of winifreds pet headache cachets she swallowed both then winifred herself appeared fleur opened her campaign with the words  you know auntie i do wish people wouldnt think im in love with that boy why ive hardly seen him  winifred though experienced was not fine she accepted the remark with considerable relief of course it was not pleasant for the girl to hear of the family scandal and she set herself to minimise the matter a task for which she was eminently qualified raised fashionably under a comfortable mother and a father whose nerves might not be shaken and for many years the wife of montague dartie her description was a masterpiece of understatement fleurs fathers first wife had been very foolish there had been a young man who had got run over and she had left fleurs father then years after when it might all have comeright again she had taken up with their cousin jolyon and of course her father had been obliged to have a divorce nobody remembered anything of it now except just the family and perhaps it had all turned out for the best her father had fleur and jolyon and irene had been quite happy they said and their boy was a nice boy val having holly too is a sort of plaster dont you know with these soothing words winifred patted her nieces shoulder thought shes a nice plump little thing and went back to prosper profond who in spite of his indiscretion was very amusing this evening  for some minutes after her aunt had gone fleur remained under influence of bromide material and spiritual but then reality came back her aunt had left out all that matteredall the feeling the hate the love the unforgivingness of passionate hearts she who knew so little of life and had touched only the fringe of love was yet aware by instinct that words have as little relation to fact and feeling as coin to the bread it buys poor father she thought poor me poor jon but i dont care i mean to have him from the window of her darkened room she saw that man issue from the door below and prowl away if he and her motherhow would that affect her chance surely it must make her father cling to her more closely so that he would consent in the end to anything she wanted or become reconciled the sooner to what she did without his knowledge  she took some earth from the flowerbox in the window and with all her might flung it after that disappearing figure it fell short but the action did her good  and a little puff of air came up from green street smelling of petrol not sweet     vpurely forsyte affairs  soames coming up to the city with the intention of calling in at green street at the end of his day and taking fleur back home with him suffered from rumination sleeping partner that he was he seldom visited the city now but he still had a room of his own at cuthcott kingson and forsytes and one special clerk and a half assigned to the management of purely forsyte affairs they were somewhat in flux just nowan auspicious moment for the disposal of house property and soames was unloading the estates of his father and uncle roger and to some extent of his uncle nicholas his shrewd and matterofcourse probity in all money concerns had made him something of an autocrat in connection with these trusts if soames thought this or thought that one had better save oneself the bother of thinking too he guaranteed as it were irresponsibility to numerous forsytes of the third and fourth generations his fellow trustees such as his cousins roger or nicholas his cousinsinlaw tweetyman and spender or his sister cicelys husband all trusted him he signed first and where he signed first they signed after and nobody was a penny the worse just now they were all a good many pennies the better and soames was beginning to see the close of certain trusts except for distribution of the income from securities as giltedged as was compatible with the period  passing the more feverish parts of the city toward the most perfect backwater in london he ruminated money was extraordinarily tight and morality extraordinarily loose the war had done it banks were not lending people breaking contracts all over the place there was a feeling in the air and a look on faces that he did not like the country seemed in for a spell of gambling and bankruptcies there was satisfaction in the thought that neither he nor his trusts had an investment which could be affected by anything less maniacal than national repudiation or a levy on capital if soames had faith it was in what he called english common senseor the power to have things if not one way then another he mightlike his father james before himsay he didnt know what things were coming to but he never in his heart believed they were if it rested with him they wouldntand after all he was only an englishman like any other so quietly tenacious of what he had that he knew he would never really part with it without something more or less equivalent in exchange his mind was essentially equilibristic in material matters and his way of putting the national situation difficult to refute in a world composed of human beings take his own case for example he was well off did that do anybody harm he did not eat ten meals a day he ate no more than perhaps not so much as a poor man he spent no money on vice breathed no more air used no more water to speak of than the mechanic or the porter he certainly had pretty things about him but they had given employment in the making and somebody must use them he bought pictures but art must be encouraged he was in fact an accidental channel through which money flowed employing labour what was there objectionable in that in his charge money was in quicker and more useful flux than it would be in charge of the state and a lot of slowfly moneysucking officials and as to what he saved each yearit was just as much in flux as what he didnt save going into water board or council stocks or something sound and useful the state paid him no salary for being trustee of his own or other peoples money he did all that for nothing therein lay the whole case against nationalisationowners of private property were unpaid and yet had every incentive to quicken up the flux under nationalisationjust the opposite in a country smarting from officialism he felt that he had a strong case  it particularly annoyed him entering that backwater of perfect peace to think that a lot of unscrupulous trusts and combinations had been cornering the market in goods of all kinds and keeping prices at an artificial height such abusers of the individualistic system were the ruffians who caused all the trouble and it was some satisfaction to see them getting into a stew at last lest the whole thing might come down with a runand land them in the soup  the offices of cuthcott kingson and forsyte occupied the ground and first floors of a house on the righthand side and ascending to his room soames thought time we had a coat of paint  his old clerk gradman was seated where he always was at a huge bureau with countless pigeonholes halftheclerk stood beside him with a brokers note recording investment of the proceeds from sale of the bryanston square house in roger forsytes estate soames took it and said  vancouver city stock hm its down today  with a sort of grating ingratiation old gradman answered him  yees but everythings down mr soames and halftheclerk withdrew  soames skewered the document on to a number of other papers and hung up his hat  i want to look at my will and marriage settlement gradman  old gradman moving to the limit of his swivel chair drew out two drafts from the bottom lefthand drawer recovering his body he raised his grizzlehaired face very red from stooping  copies sir  soames took them it struck him suddenly how like gradman was to the stout brindled yard dog they had been wont to keep on his chain at the shelter till one day fleur had come and insisted it should be let loose so that it had at once bitten the cook and been destroyed if you let gradman off his chain would he bite the cook  checking this frivolous fancy soames unfolded his marriage settlement he had not looked at it for over eighteen years not since he remade his will when his father died and fleur was born he wanted to see whether the words during coverture were in yes they wereodd expression when you thought of it and derived perhaps from horsebreeding interest on fifteen thousand pounds which he paid her without deducting income tax so long as she remained his wife and afterward during widowhood dum castaoldfashioned and rather pointed words put in to insure the conduct of fleurs mother his will made it up to an annuity of a thousand under the same conditions all right he returned the copies to gradman who took them without looking up swung the chair restored the papers to their drawer and went on casting up  gradman i dont like the condition of the country there are a lot of people about without any common sense i want to find a way by which i can safeguard miss fleur against anything which might arise  gradman wrote the figure 2 on his blottingpaper  yees he said theres a nahsty spirit  the ordinary restraint against anticipation doesnt meet the case  nao said gradman  suppose those labour fellows come in or worse its these people with fixed ideas who are the danger look at ireland  ah said gradman  suppose i were to make a settlement on her at once with myself as beneficiary for life they couldnt take anything but the interest from me unless of course they alter the law  gradman moved his head and smiled  ah he said they wouldnt do thaat  i dont know muttered soames i dont trust them  itll take two years sir to be valid against death duties  soames sniffed two years he was only sixtyfive  thats not the point draw a form of settlement that passes all my property to miss fleurs children in equal shares with antecedent lifeinterests first to myself and then to her without power of anticipation and add a clause that in the event of anything happening to divert her lifeinterest that interest passes to the trustees to apply for her benefit in their absolute discretion  gradman grated rather extreme at your age sir you lose control  thats my business said soames sharply  gradman wrote on a piece of paper lifeinterestanticipationdivert interestabsolute discretion and said  what trustees theres young mr kingson hes a nice steady young fellow  yes he might do for one i must have three there isnt a forsyte now who appeals to me  not young mr nicholas hes at the bar weve given im briefs  hell never set the thames on fire said soames  a smile oozed out on gradmans face greasy from countless muttonchops the smile of a man who sits all day  you cant expect it at his age mr soames  why what is he forty  yees quite a young fellow  well put him in but i want somebody wholl take a personal interest theres no one that i can see  what about mr valerius now hes come home  val dartie with that father  weell murmured gradman hes been dead seven yearsthe statute runs against him  no said soames i dont like the connection he rose gradman said suddenly  if they were makin a levy on capital they could come on the trustees sir so there youd be just the same id think it over if i were you  thats true said soames i will what have you done about that dilapidation notice in vere street  i avent served it yet the partys very old she wont want to go out at her age  i dont know this spirit of unrest touches every one  still im lookin at things broadly sir shes eightyone  better serve it said soames and see what she says oh and mr timothy is everything in order in case of  ive got the inventory of his estate all ready had the furniture and pictures valued so that we know what reserves to put on i shall be sorry when he goes though dear me it is a time since i first saw mr timothy  we cant live for ever said soames taking down his hat  nao said gradman but itll be a pitythe last of the old family shall i take up the matter of that nuisance in old compton street those organstheyre nahsty things  do i must call for miss fleur and catch the four oclock goodday gradman  goodday mr soames i hope miss fleur  well enough but gads about too much  yees grated gradman shes young  soames went out musing old gradman if he were younger id put him in the trust theres nobody i can depend on to take a real interest  leaving the bilious and mathematical exactitude the preposterous peace of that backwater he thought suddenly during coverture why cant they exclude fellows like profond instead of a lot of hardworking germans and was surprised at the depth of uneasiness which could provoke so unpatriotic a thought but there it was one never got a moment of real peace there was always something at the back of everything and he made his way toward green street  two hours later by his watch thomas gradman stirring in his swivel chair closed the last drawer of his bureau and putting into his waistcoat pocket a bunch of keys so fat that they gave him a protuberance on the liver side brushed his old top hat round with his sleeve took his umbrella and descended thick short and buttoned closely into his old frock coat he walked toward covent garden market he never missed that daily promenade to the tube for highgate and seldom some critical transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit generations might be born and hats might change wars be fought and forsytes fade away but thomas gradman faithful and grey would take his daily walk and buy his daily vegetable times were not what they were and his son had lost a leg and they never gave him those nice little plaited baskets to carry the stuff in now and these tubes were convenient thingsstill he mustnt complain his health was good considering his time of life and after fiftyfour years in the law he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of late because it was mostly collectors commission on the rents and with all this conversion of forsyte property going on it looked like drying up and the price of living still so high but it was no good worryingthe good god made us allas he was in the habit of saying still house property in londonhe didnt know what mr roger or mr james would say if they could see it being sold like thisseemed to show a lack of faith but mr soameshe worried life and lives in being and twentyone years afterbeyond that you couldnt go still he kept his health wonderfullyand miss fleur was a pretty little thingshe was shed marry but lots of people had no children nowadayshe had had his first child at twentytwo and mr jolyon married while he was at cambridge had his child the same yeargracious peter that was back in 69 a long time before old mr jolyonfine judge of propertyhad taken his will away from mr jamesdear yes those were the days when they were buyin property right and left and none of this khaki and fallin over one another to get out of things and cucumbers at twopence and a melonthe old melons that made your mouth water fifty years since he went into mr james office and mr james had said to him now gradman youre only a shaveryou pay attention and youll make your five hundred a year before youve done and he had and feared god and served the forsytes and kept a vegetable diet at night and buying a copy of john bullnot that he approved of it an extravagant affairhe entered the tube elevator with his mere brownpaper parcel and was borne down into the bowels of the earth     visoames private life  on his way to green street it occurred to soames that he ought to go into dumetrius in suffolk street about the possibility of the bolderby old crome almost worth while to have fought the war to have the bolderby old crome as it were in flux old bolderby had died his son and grandson had been killeda cousin was coming into the estate who meant to sell it some said because of the condition of england others said because he had asthma  if dumetrius once got hold of it the price would become prohibitive it was necessary for soames to find out whether dumetrius had got it before he tried to get it himself he therefore confined himself to discussing with dumetrius whether monticellis would come again now that it was the fashion for a picture to be anything except a picture and the future of johns with a sideslip into buxton knights it was only when leaving that he added so theyre not selling the bolderby old crome after all in sheer pride of racial superiority as he had calculated would be the case dumetrius replied  oh i shall get it mr forsyte sir  the flutter of his eyelid fortified soames in a resolution to write direct to the new bolderby suggesting that the only dignified way of dealing with an old crome was to avoid dealers he therefore said well goodday and went leaving dumetrius the wiser  at green street he found that fleur was out and would be all the evening she was staying one more night in london he cabbed on dejectedly and caught his train  he reached his house about six oclock the air was heavy midges biting thunder about taking his letters he went up to his dressingroom to cleanse himself of london  an uninteresting post a receipt a bill for purchases on behalf of fleur a circular about an exhibition of etchings a letter beginning   sir  i feel it my duty   that would be an appeal or something unpleasant he looked at once for the signature there was none incredulously he turned the page over and examined each corner not being a public man soames had never yet had an anonymous letter and his first impulse was to tear it up as a dangerous thing his second to read it as a thing still more dangerous   sir  i feel it my duty to inform you that having no interest in the matter your lady is carrying on with a foreigner   reaching that word soames stopped mechanically and examined the postmark so far as he could pierce the impenetrable disguise in which the post office had wrapped it there was something with a sea at the end and a t in it chelsea no battersea perhaps he read on  these foreigners are all the same sack the lot this one meets your lady twice a week i know it of my own knowledgeand to see an englishman put on goes against the grain you watch it and see if what i say isnt true i shouldnt meddle if it wasnt a dirty foreigner thats in it  yours obedient   the sensation with which soames dropped the letter was similar to that he would have had entering his bedroom and finding it full of blackbeetles the meanness of anonymity gave a shuddering obscenity to the moment and the worst of it was that this shadow had been at the back of his mind ever since the sunday evening when fleur had pointed down at prosper profond strolling on the lawn and said prowling cat had he not in connection therewith this very day perused his will and marriage settlement and now this anonymous ruffian with nothing to gain apparently save the venting of his spite against foreigners had wrenched it out of the obscurity in which he had hoped and wished it would remain to have such knowledge forced on him at his time of life about fleurs mother he picked the letter up from the carpet tore it across and then when it hung together by just the fold at the back stopped tearing and reread it he was taking at that moment one of the decisive resolutions of his life he would not be forced into another scandal no however he decided to deal with this matterand it required the most farsighted and careful consideration he would do nothing that might injure fleur that resolution taken his mind answered the helm again and he made his ablutions his hands trembled as he dried them scandal he would not have but something must be done to stop this sort of thing he went into his wifes room and stood looking around him the idea of searching for anything which would incriminate and entitle him to hold a menace over her did not even come to him there would be nothingshe was much too practical the idea of having her watched had been dismissed before it cametoo well he remembered his previous experience of that no he had nothing but this tornup letter from some anonymous ruffian whose impudent intrusion into his private life he so violently resented it was repugnant to him to make use of it but he might have to what a mercy fleur was not at home tonight a tap on the door broke up his painful cogitations  mr michael mont sir is in the drawingroom will you see him  no said soames yes ill come down  anything that would take his mind off for a few minutes  michael mont in flannels stood on the verandah smoking a cigarette he threw it away as soames came up and ran his hand through his hair  soames feeling toward this young man was singular he was no doubt a rackety irresponsible young fellow according to old standards yet somehow likeable with his extraordinarily cheerful way of blurting out his opinions  come in he said have you had tea  mont came in  i thought fleur would have been back sir but im glad she isnt the fact is iim fearfully gone on her so fearfully gone that i thought youd better know its oldfashioned of course coming to fathers first but i thought youd forgive that i went to my own dad and he says if i settle down hell see me through he rather cottons to the idea in fact i told him about your goya  oh said soames inexpressibly dry he rather cottons  yes sir do you  soames smiled faintly  you see resumed mont twiddling his straw hat while his hair ears eyebrows all seemed to stand up from excitement when youve been through the war you cant help being in a hurry  to get married and unmarried afterward said soames slowly  not from fleur sir imagine if you were me  soames cleared his throat that way of putting it was forcible enough  fleurs too young he said  oh no sir were awfully old nowadays my dad seems to me a perfect babe his thinking apparatus hasnt turned a hair but hes a baronight of course that keeps him back  baronight repeated soames what may that be  bart sir i shall be a bart some day but i shall live it down you know  go away and live this down said soames  young mont said imploringly oh no sir i simply must hang around or i shouldnt have a dogs chance youll let fleur do what she likes i suppose anyway madame passes me  indeed said soames frigidly  you dont really bar me do you and the young man looked so doleful that soames smiled  you may think youre very old he said but you strike me as extremely young to rattle ahead of everything is not a proof of maturity  all right sir i give you our age but to show you i mean businessive got a job  glad to hear it  joined a publisher my governor is putting up the stakes  soames put his hand over his mouthhe had so very nearly said god help the publisher his grey eyes scrutinised the agitated young man  i dont dislike you mr mont but fleur is everything to me everythingdo you understand  yes sir i know but so she is to me  thats as may be im glad youve told me however and now i think theres nothing more to be said  i know it rests with her sir  it will rest with her a long time i hope  you arent cheering said mont suddenly  no said soames my experience of life has not made me anxious to couple people in a hurry goodnight mr mont i shant tell fleur what youve said  oh murmured mont blankly i really could knock my brains out for want of her she knows that perfectly well  i dare say and soames held out his hand a distracted squeeze a heavy sigh and soon after sounds from the young mans motorcycle called up visions of flying dust and broken bones  the younger generation he thought heavily and went out on to the lawn the gardeners had been mowing and there was still the smell of freshcut grassthe thundery air kept all scents close to earth the sky was of a purplish huethe poplars black two or three boats passed on the river scuttling as it were for shelter before the storm three days fine weather thought soames and then a storm where was annette with that chap for all he knewshe was a young woman impressed with the queer charity of that thought he entered the summerhouse and sat down the fact wasand he admitted itfleur was so much to him that his wife was very littlevery little frenchhad never been much more than a mistress and he was getting indifferent to that side of things it was odd how with all this ingrained care for moderation and secure investment soames ever put his emotional eggs into one basket first irenenow fleur he was dimly conscious of it sitting there conscious of its odd dangerousness it had brought him to wreck and scandal once but nownow it should save him he cared so much for fleur that he would have no further scandal if only he could get at that anonymous letterwriter he would teach him not to meddle and stir up mud at the bottom of water which he wished should remain stagnant a distant flash a low rumble and large drops of rain spattered on the thatch above him he remained indifferent tracing a pattern with his finger on the dusty surface of a little rustic table fleurs future i want fair sailing for her he thought nothing else matters at my time of life a lonely businesslife what you had you never could keep to yourself as you warned one off you let another in one could make sure of nothing he reached up and pulled a red rambler rose from a cluster which blocked the window flowers grew and droppednature was a queer thing the thunder rumbled and crashed travelling east along a river the paling flashes flicked his eyes the poplar tops showed sharp and dense against the sky a heavy shower rustled and rattled and veiled in the little house wherein he sat indifferent thinking  when the storm was over he left his retreat and went down the wet path to the river bank  two swans had come sheltering in among the reeds he knew the birds well and stood watching the dignity in the curve of those white necks and formidable snakelike heads not dignifiedwhat i have to do he thought and yet it must be tackled lest worse befell annette must be back by now from wherever she had gone for it was nearly dinnertime and as the moment for seeing her approached the difficulty of knowing what to say and how to say it had increased a new and scaring thought occurred to him suppose she wanted her liberty to marry this fellow well if she did she couldnt have it he had not married her for that the image of prosper profond dawdled before him reassuringly not a marrying man no no anger replaced that momentary scare he had better not come my way he thought the mongrel represented but what did prosper profond represent nothing that mattered surely and yet something real enough in the worldunmorality let off its chain disillusionment on the prowl that expression annette had caught from him je men fiche a fatalistic chap a continentala cosmopolitana product of the age if there were condemnation more complete soames felt that he did not know it  the swans had turned their heads and were looking past him into some distance of their own one of them uttered a little hiss wagged its tail turned as if answering to a rudder and swam away the other followed their white bodies their stately necks passed out of his sight and he went toward the house  annette was in the drawingroom dressed for dinner and he thought as he went upstairs handsome is as handsome does handsome except for remarks about the curtains in the drawingroom and the storm there was practically no conversation during a meal distinguished by exactitude of quantity and perfection of quality soames drank nothing he followed her into the drawingroom afterward and found her smoking a cigarette on the sofa between the two french windows she was leaning back almost upright in a low black frock with her knees crossed and her blue eyes halfclosed greyblue smoke issued from her red rather full lips a fillet bound her chestnut hair she wore the thinnest silk stockings and shoes with very high heels showing off her instep a fine piece in any room soames who held that torn letter in a hand thrust deep into the sidepocket of his dinnerjacket said  im going to shut the window the damps lifting in  he did so and stood looking at a david cox adorning the creampanelled wall close by  what was she thinking of he had never understood a woman in his lifeexcept fleurand fleur not always his heart beat fast but if he meant to do it now was the moment turning from the david cox he took out the torn letter  ive had this  her eyes widened stared at him and hardened  soames handed her the letter  its torn but you can read it and he turned back to the david coxa seapiece of good tonebut without movement enough i wonder what that chaps doing at this moment he thought ill astonish him yet out of the corner of his eye he saw annette holding the letter rigidly her eyes moved from side to side under her darkened lashes and frowning darkened eyes she dropped the letter gave a little shiver smiled and said  dirrty  i quite agree said soames degrading is it true  a tooth fastened on her red lower lip and what if it were  she was brazen  is that all you have to say  no  well speak out  what is the good of talking  soames said icily so you admit it  i admit nothing you are a fool to ask a man like you should not ask it is dangerous  soames made a tour of the room to subdue his rising anger  do you remember he said halting in front of her what you were when i married you working at accounts in a restaurant  do you remember that i was not half your age  soames broke off the hard encounter of their eyes and went back to the david cox  i am not going to bandy words i require you to give up thisfriendship i think of the matter entirely as it affects fleur  ahfleur  yes said soames stubbornly fleur she is your child as well as mine  it is kind to admit that  are you going to do what i say  i refuse to tell you  then i must make you  annette smiled  no soames she said you are helpless do not say things that you will regret  anger swelled the veins on his forehead he opened his mouth to vent that emotion and could not annette went on  there shall be no more such letters i promise you that is enough  soames writhed he had a sense of being treated like a child by this woman who had deserved he did not know what  when two people have married and lived like us soames they had better be quiet about each other there are things one does not drag up into the light for people to laugh at you will be quiet then not for my sake for your own you are getting old i am not yet you have made me verry practical  soames who had passed through all the sensations of being choked repeated dully  i require you to give up this friendship  and if i do not  thenthen i will cut you out of my will  somehow it did not seem to meet the case annette laughed  you will live a long time soames  youyou are a bad woman said soames suddenly  annette shrugged her shoulders  i do not think so living with you has killed things in me it is true but i am not a bad woman i am sensiblethat is all and so will you be when you have thought it over  i shall see this man said soames sullenly and warn him off  mon cher you are funny you do not want me you have as much of me as you want and you wish the rest of me to be dead i admit nothing but i am not going to be dead soames at my age so you had better be quiet i tell you i myself will make no scandal none now i am not saying any more whatever you do  she reached out took a french novel off a little table and opened it soames watched her silenced by the tumult of his feelings the thought of that man was almost making him want her and this was a revelation of their relationship startling to one little given to introspective philosophy without saying another word he went out and up to the picturegallery this came of marrying a frenchwoman and yet without her there would have been no fleur she had served her purpose  shes right he thought i can do nothing i dont even know that theres anything in it the instinct of selfpreservation warned him to batten down his hatches to smother the fire with want of air unless one believed there was something in a thing there wasnt  that night he went into her room she received him in the most matteroffact way as if there had been no scene between them and he returned to his own room with a curious sense of peace if one didnt choose to see one neednt and he did not choosein future he did not choose there was nothing to be gained by itnothing opening the drawer he took from the sachet a handkerchief and the framed photograph of fleur when he had looked at it a little he slipped it down and there was that other onethat old one of irene an owl hooted while he stood in his window gazing at it the owl hooted the red climbing roses seemed to deepen in colour there came a scent of limeblossom god that had been a different thing passionmemory dust     viijune takes a hand  one who was a sculptor a slav a sometime resident in new york an egoist and impecunious was to be found of an evening in june forsytes studio on the bank of the thames at chiswick on the evening of july 6 boris strumolowskiseveral of whose works were on show there because they were as yet too advanced to be on show anywhere elsehad begun well with that aloof and rather christlike silence which admirably suited his youthful round broad cheekboned countenance framed in bright hair banged like a girls june had known him three weeks and he still seemed to her the principal embodiment of genius and hope of the future a sort of star of the east which had strayed into an unappreciative west until that evening he had conversationally confined himself to recording his impressions of the united states whose dust he had just shaken from off his feeta country in his opinion so barbarous in every way that he had sold practically nothing there and become an object of suspicion to the police a country as he said without a race of its own without liberty equality or fraternity without principles traditions taste withoutin a worda soul he had left it for his own good and come to the only other country where he could live well june had dwelt unhappily on him in her lonely moments standing before his creationsfrightening but powerful and symbolic once they had been explained that he haloed by bright hair like an early italian painting and absorbed in his genius to the exclusion of all elsethe only sign of course by which real genius could be toldshould still be a lame duck agitated her warm heart almost to the exclusion of paul post and she had begun to take steps to clear her gallery in order to fill it with strumolowski masterpieces she had at once encountered trouble paul post had kicked vospovitch had stung with all the emphasis of a genius which she did not as yet deny them they had demanded another six weeks at least of her gallery the american stream still flowing in would soon be flowing out the american stream was their right their only hope their salvationsince nobody in this beastly country cared for art june had yielded to the demonstration after all boris would not mind their having the full benefit of an american stream which he himself so violently despised  this evening she had put that to boris with nobody else present except hannah hobdey the mediaeval blackandwhitist and jimmy portugal editor of the neoartist she had put it to him with that sudden confidence which continual contact with the neoartistic world had never been able to dry up in her warm and generous nature he had not broken his christlike silence however for more than two minutes before she began to move her blue eyes from side to side as a cat moves its tail thishe saidwas characteristic of england the most selfish country in the world the country which sucked the blood of other countries destroyed the brains and hearts of irishmen hindus egyptians boers and burmese all the best races in the world bullying hypocritical england this was what he had expected coming to such a country where the climate was all fog and the people all tradesmen perfectly blind to art and sunk in profiteering and the grossest materialism conscious that hannah hobdey was murmuring hear hear and jimmy portugal sniggering june grew crimson and suddenly rapped out  then why did you ever come we didnt ask you  the remark was so singularly at variance with all she had led him to expect from her that strumolowski stretched out his hand and took a cigarette  england never wants an idealist he said  but in june something primitively english was thoroughly upset old jolyons sense of justice had risen as it were from bed you come and sponge on us she said and then abuse us if you think thats playing the game i dont  she now discovered that which others had discovered before herthe thickness of hide beneath which the sensibility of genius is sometimes veiled strumolowskis young and ingenuous face became the incarnation of a sneer  sponge one does not sponge one takes what is owinga tenth part of what is owing you will repent to say that miss forsyte  oh no said june i shant  ah we know very well we artistsyou take us to get what you can out of us i want nothing from youand he blew out a cloud of junes smoke  decision rose in an icy puff from the turmoil of insulted shame within her very well then you can take your things away  and almost in the same moment she thought poor boy hes only got a garret and probably not a taxi fare in front of these people too its positively disgusting  young strumolowski shook his head violently his hair thick smooth close as a golden plate did not fall off  i can live on nothing he said shrilly i have often had to for the sake of my art it is you bourgeois who force us to spend money  the words hit june like a pebble in the ribs after all she had done for art all her identification with its troubles and lame ducks she was struggling for adequate words when the door was opened and her austrian murmured  a young lady gnadiges fraulein  where  in the little mealroom  with a glance at boris strumolowski at hannah hobdey at jimmy portugal june said nothing and went out devoid of equanimity entering the little mealroom she perceived the young lady to be fleurlooking very pretty if pale at this disenchanted moment a little lame duck of her own breed was welcome to june so homoeopathic by instinct  the girl must have come of course because of jon or if not at least to get something out of her and june felt just then that to assist somebody was the only bearable thing  so youve remembered to come she said  yes what a jolly little duck of a house but please dont let me bother you if youve got people  not at all said june i want to let them stew in their own juice for a bit have you come about jon  you said you thought we ought to be told well ive found out  oh said june blankly not nice is it  they were standing one on each side of the little bare table at which june took her meals a vase on it was full of iceland poppies the girl raised her hand and touched them with a gloved finger to her newfangled dress frilly about the hips and tight below the knees june took a sudden likinga charming colour flaxblue  she makes a picture thought june her little room with its whitewashed walls its floor and hearth of old pink brick its black paint and latticed window athwart which the last of the sunlight was shining had never looked so charming set off by this young figure with the creamy slightly frowning face she remembered with sudden vividness how nice she herself had looked in those old days when her heart was set on philip bosinney that dead lover who had broken from her to destroy for ever irenes allegiance to this girls father did fleur know of that too  well she said what are you going to do  it was some seconds before fleur answered  i dont want jon to suffer i must see him once more to put an end to it  youre going to put an end to it  what else is there to do  the girl seemed to june suddenly intolerably spiritless  i suppose youre right she muttered i know my father thinks so buti should never have done it myself i cant take things lying down  how poised and watchful that girl looked how unemotional her voice sounded  people will assume that im in love  well arent you  fleur shrugged her shoulders i might have known it thought june shes soames daughterfish and yethe  what do you want me to do then she said with a sort of disgust  could i see jon here tomorrow on his way down to hollys hed come if you sent him a line tonight and perhaps afterward youd let them know quietly at robin hill that its all over and that they neednt tell jon about his mother  all right said june abruptly ill write now and you can post it halfpast two tomorrow i shant be in myself  she sat down at the tiny bureau which filled one corner when she looked round with the finished note fleur was still touching the poppies with her gloved finger  june licked a stamp well here it is if youre not in love of course theres no more to be said jons lucky  fleur took the note thanks awfully  coldblooded little baggage thought june jon son of her father to love and not to be loved by the daughter ofsoames it was humiliating  is that all  fleur nodded her frills shook and trembled as she swayed toward the door  goodbye  goodbye little piece of fashion muttered june closing the door that family and she marched back toward her studio boris strumolowski had regained his christlike silence and jimmy portugal was damning everybody except the group in whose behalf he ran the neoartist among the condemned were eric cobbley and several other lameduck genii who at one time or another had held first place in the repertoire of junes aid and adoration she experienced a sense of futility and disgust and went to the window to let the riverwind blow those squeaky words away  but when at length jimmy portugal had finished and gone with hannah hobdey she sat down and mothered young strumolowski for half an hour promising him a month at least of the american stream so that he went away with his halo in perfect order in spite of all june thought boris is wonderful     viiithe bit between the teeth  to know that your hand is against every ones isfor some naturesto experience a sense of moral release fleur felt no remorse when she left junes house reading condemnatory resentment in her little kinswomans blue eyesshe was glad that she had fooled her despising june because that elderly idealist had not seen what she was after  end it forsooth she would soon show them all that she was only just beginning and she smiled to herself on the top of the bus which carried her back to mayfair but the smile died squeezed out by spasms of anticipation and anxiety would she be able to manage jon she had taken the bit between her teeth but could she make him take it too she knew the truth and the real danger of delayhe knew neither therein lay all the difference in the world  suppose i tell him she thought wouldnt it really be safer this hideous luck had no right to spoil their love he must see that they could not let it people always accepted an accomplished fact in time from that piece of philosophyprofound enough at her ageshe passed to another consideration less philosophic if she persuaded jon to a quick and secret marriage and he found out afterward that she had known the truth what then jon hated subterfuge again then would it not be better to tell him but the memory of his mothers face kept intruding on that impulse fleur was afraid his mother had power over him more power perhaps than she herself who could tell it was too great a risk deepsunk in these instinctive calculations she was carried on past green street as far as the ritz hotel she got down there and walked back on the green park side the storm had washed every tree they still dripped heavy drops fell on to her frills and to avoid them she crossed over under the eyes of the iseeum club chancing to look up she saw monsieur profond with a tall stout man in the bay window turning into green street she heard her name called and saw that prowler coming up he took off his hata glossy bowler such as she particularly detested  good evenin miss forsyde isnt there a small thing i can do for you  yes pass by on the other side  i say why do you dislike me  do i  it looks like it  well then because you make me feel life isnt worth living  monsieur profond smiled  look here miss forsyde dont worry itll be all right nothing lasts  things do last cried fleur with me anyhowespecially likes and dislikes  well that makes me a bit unappy  i should have thought nothing could ever make you happy or unhappy  i dont like to annoy other people im goin on my yacht  fleur looked at him startled  where  small voyage to the south seas or somewhere said monsieur profond  fleur suffered relief and a sense of insult clearly he meant to convey that he was breaking with her mother how dared he have anything to break and yet how dared he break it  goodnight miss forsyde remember me to mrs dartie im not so bad really goodnight fleur left him standing there with his hat raised stealing a look round she saw him strollimmaculate and heavyback toward his club  he cant even love with conviction she thought what will mother do  her dreams that night were endless and uneasy she rose heavy and unrested and went at once to the study of whitakers almanac a forsyte is instinctively aware that facts are the real crux of any situation she might conquer jons prejudice but without exact machinery to complete their desperate resolve nothing would happen from the invaluable tome she learned that they must each be twentyone or some ones consent would be necessary which of course was unobtainable then she became lost in directions concerning licenses certificates notices districts coming finally to the word perjury but that was nonsense who would really mind their giving wrong ages in order to be married for love she ate hardly any breakfast and went back to whitaker the more she studied the less sure she became till idly turning the pages she came to scotland people could be married there without any of this nonsense she had only to go and stay there twentyone days then jon could come and in front of two people they could declare themselves married and what was morethey would be it was far the best way and at once she ran over her schoolfellows there was mary lambe who lived in edinburgh and was quite a sport  she had a brother too she could stay with mary lambe who with her brother would serve for witnesses she well knew that some girls would think all this unnecessary and that all she and jon need do was to go away together for a weekend and then say to their people we are married by nature we must now be married by law but fleur was forsyte enough to feel such a proceeding dubious and to dread her fathers face when he heard of it besides she did not believe that jon would do it he had an opinion of her such as she could not bear to diminish no mary lambe was preferable and it was just the time of year to go to scotland more at ease now she packed avoided her aunt and took a bus to chiswick she was too early and went on to kew gardens she found no peace among its flowerbeds labelled trees and broad green spaces and having lunched off anchovypaste sandwiches and coffee returned to chiswick and rang junes bell the austrian admitted her to the little mealroom now that she knew what she and jon were up against her longing for him had increased tenfold as if he were a toy with sharp edges or dangerous paint such as they had tried to take from her as a child if she could not have her way and get jon for good and all she felt like dying of privation by hook or crook she must and would get him a round dim mirror of very old glass hung over the pink brick hearth she stood looking at herself reflected in it pale and rather dark under the eyes little shudders kept passing through her nerves then she heard the bell ring and stealing to the window saw him standing on the doorstep smoothing his hair and lips as if he too were trying to subdue the fluttering of his nerves  she was sitting on one of the two rushseated chairs with her back to the door when he came in and she said at once  sit down jon i want to talk seriously  jon sat on the table by her side and without looking at him she went on  if you dont want to lose me we must get married  jon gasped  why is there anything new  no but i felt it at robin hill and among my people  but stammered jon at robin hillit was all smoothand theyve said nothing to me  but they mean to stop us your mothers face was enough and my fathers  have you seen him since  fleur nodded what mattered a few supplementary lies  but said jon eagerly i cant see how they can feel like that after all these years  fleur looked up at him  perhaps you dont love me enough not love you enough why  then make sure of me  without telling them  not till after  jon was silent how much older he looked than on that day barely two months ago when she first saw himquite two years older  it would hurt mother awfully he said  fleur drew her hand away  youve got to choose  jon slid off the table on to his knees  but why not tell them they cant really stop us fleur  they can i tell you they can  how  were utterly dependentby putting money pressure and all sorts of other pressure im not patient jon  but its deceiving them  fleur got up  you cant really love me or you wouldnt hesitate he either fears his fate too much  lifting his hands to her waist jon forced her to sit down again she hurried on  ive planned it all out weve only to go to scotland when were married theyll soon come round people always come round to facts dont you see jon  but to hurt them so awfully  so he would rather hurt her than those people of his all right then let me go  jon got up and put his back against the door  i expect youre right he said slowly but i want to think it over  she could see that he was seething with feelings he wanted to express but she did not mean to help him she hated herself at this moment and almost hated him why had she to do all the work to secure their love it wasnt fair and then she saw his eyes adoring and distressed  dont look like that i only dont want to lose you jon  you cant lose me so long as you want me  oh yes i can  jon put his hands on her shoulders  fleur do you know anything you havent told me  it was the pointblank question she had dreaded she looked straight at him and answered no she had burnt her boats but what did it matter if she got him he would forgive her and throwing her arms round his neck she kissed him on the lips she was winning she felt it in the beating of his heart against her in the closing of his eyes i want to make sure i want to make sure she whispered promise  jon did not answer his face had the stillness of extreme trouble at last he said  its like hitting them i must think a little fleur i really must  fleur slipped out of his arms  oh very well and suddenly she burst into tears of disappointment shame and overstrain followed five minutes of acute misery jons remorse and tenderness knew no bounds but he did not promise despite her will to cry very well then if you dont love me enoughgoodbye she dared not from birth accustomed to her own way this check from one so young so tender so devoted baffled and surprised her she wanted to push him away from her to try what anger and coldness would do and again she dared not the knowledge that she was scheming to rush him blindfold into the irrevocable weakened everythingweakened the sincerity of pique and the sincerity of passion even her kisses had not the lure she wished for them that stormy little meeting ended inconclusively  will you some tea gnadiges fraulein  pushing jon from her she cried out  nono thank you im just going  and before he could prevent her she was gone  she went stealthily mopping her gushed stained cheeks frightened angry very miserable she had stirred jon up so fearfully yet nothing definite was promised or arranged but the more uncertain and hazardous the future the more the will to have worked its tentacles into the flesh of her heartlike some burrowing tick  no one was at green street winifred had gone with imogen to see a play which some said was allegorical and others very exciting dont you know it was because of what others said that winifred and imogen had gone fleur went on to paddington through the carriage the air from the brickkilns of west drayton and the late hayfields fanned her still gushed cheeks flowers had seemed to be had for the picking now they were all thorned and prickled but the golden flower within the crown of spikes seemed to her tenacious spirit all the fairer and more desirable     ixthe fat in the fire  on reaching home fleur found an atmosphere so peculiar that it penetrated even the perplexed aura of her own private life her mother was inaccessibly entrenched in a brown study her father contemplating fate in the vinery neither of them had a word to throw to a dog is it because of me thought fleur or because of profond to her mother she said  whats the matter with father  her mother answered with a shrug of her shoulders  to her father  whats the matter with mother  her father answered  matter what should be the matter and gave her a sharp look  by the way murmured fleur monsieur profond is going a small voyage on his yacht to the south seas  soames examined a branch on which no grapes were growing  this vines a failure he said ive had young mont here he asked me something about you  oh how do you like him father  hehes a productlike all these young people  what were you at his age dear  soames smiled grimly  we went to work and didnt play aboutflying and motoring and making love  didnt you ever make love  she avoided looking at him while she said that but she saw him well enough his pale face had reddened his eyebrows where darkness was still mingled with the grey had come close together  i had no time or inclination to philander  perhaps you had a grand passion  soames looked at her intently  yesif you want to knowand much good it did me he moved away along by the hotwater pipes fleur tiptoed silently after him  tell me about it father  soames became very still  what should you want to know about such things at your age  is she alive  he nodded  and married  yes  its jon forsytes mother isnt it and she was your wife first  it was said in a flash of intuition surely his opposition came from his anxiety that she should not know of that old wound to his pride but she was startled to see some one so old and calm wince as if struck to hear so sharp a note of pain in his voice  who told you that if your aunt i cant bear the affair talked of  but darling said fleur softly its so long ago  long ago or not i  fleur stood stroking his arm  ive tried to forget he said suddenly i dont wish to be reminded and then as if venting some long and secret irritation he added in these days people dont understand grand passion indeed no one knows what it is  i do said fleur almost in a whisper  soames who had turned his back on her spun round  what are you talking ofa child like you  perhaps ive inherited it father  what  for her son you see  he was pale as a sheet and she knew that she was as bad they stood staring at each other in the steamy heat redolent of the mushy scent of earth of potted geranium and of vines coming along fast  this is crazy said soames at last between dry lips  scarcely moving her own she murmured  dont be angry father i cant help it  but she could see he wasnt angry only scared deeply scared  i thought that foolishness he stammered was all forgotten  oh no its ten times what it was  soames kicked at the hotwater pipe the hapless movement touched her who had no fear of her fathernone  dearest she said what must be must you know  must repeated soames you dont know what youre talking of has that boy been told  the blood rushed into her cheeks  not yet  he had turned from her again and with one shoulder a little raised stood staring fixedly at a joint in the pipes  its most distasteful to me he said suddenly nothing could be more so son of that fellow itsitsperverse  she had noted almost unconsciously that he did not say son of that woman and again her intuition began working  did the ghost of that grand passion linger in some corner of his heart  she slipped her hand under his arm  jons father is quite ill and old i saw him  you  yes i went there with jon i saw them both  well and what did they say to you  nothing they were very polite  they would be he resumed his contemplation of the pipejoint and then said suddenly  i must think this overill speak to you again tonight  she knew this was final for the moment and stole away leaving him still looking at the pipejoint she wandered into the fruitgarden among the raspberry and currant bushes without impetus to pick and eat two months agoshe was lighthearted even two days agolighthearted before prosper profond told her now she felt tangled in a webof passions vested rights oppressions and revolts the ties of love and hate at this dark moment of discouragement there seemed even to her holdfast nature no way out how deal with ithow sway and bend things to her will and get her hearts desire and suddenly round the corner of the high box hedge she came plump on her mother walking swiftly with an open letter in her hand her bosom was heaving her eyes dilated her cheeks flushed instantly fleur thought the yacht poor mother  annette gave her a wide startled look and said  jai la migraine  im awfully sorry mother  oh yes you and your fathersorry  but motheri am i know what it feels like  annettes startled eyes grew wide till the whites showed above them  poor innocent she said  her motherso selfpossessed and commonsensicalto look and speak like this it was all frightening her father her mother herself and only two months back they had seemed to have everything they wanted in this world  annette crumpled the letter in her hand fleur knew that she must ignore the sight  cant i do anything for your head mother  annette shook that head and walked on swaying her hips  its cruel thought fleur and i was glad that man what do men come prowling for disturbing everything i suppose hes tired of her what business has he to be tired of my mother what business and at that thought so natural and so peculiar she uttered a little choked laugh  she ought of course to be delighted but what was there to be delighted at her father didnt really care her mother did perhaps she entered the orchard and sat down under a cherrytree a breeze sighed in the higher boughs the sky seen through their green was very blue and very white in cloudthose heavy white clouds almost always present in river landscape bees sheltering out of the wind hummed softly and over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruittrees planted by her father fiveandtwenty years ago birds were almost silent the cuckoos had ceased to sing but woodpigeons were cooing the breath and drone and cooing of high summer were not for long a sedative to her excited nerves crouched over her knees she began to scheme her father must be made to back her up why should he mind so long as she was happy she had not lived for nearly nineteen years without knowing that her future was all he really cared about she had then only to convince him that her future could not be happy without jon he thought it a mad fancy how foolish the old were thinking they could tell what the young felt had not he confessed that hewhen younghad loved with a grand passion he ought to understand he piles up his money for me she thought but whats the use if im not going to be happy money and all it bought did not bring happiness love only brought that the oxeyed daisies in this orchard which gave it such a moony look sometimes grew wild and happy and had their hour they oughtnt to have called me fleur she mused if they didnt mean me to have my hour and be happy while it lasts nothing real stood in the way like poverty or diseasesentiment only a ghost from the unhappy past jon was right they wouldnt let you live these old people they made mistakes committed crimes and wanted their children to go on paying the breeze died away midges began to bite she got up plucked a piece of honeysuckle and went in  it was hot that night both she and her mother had put on thin pale low frocks the dinner flowers were pale fleur was struck with the pale look of everything her fathers face her mothers shoulders the pale panelled walls the pale grey velvety carpet the lampshade even the soup was pale there was not one spot of colour in the room not even wine in the pale glasses for no one drank it what was not pale was blackher fathers clothes the butlers clothes her retriever stretched out exhausted in the window the curtains black with a cream pattern a moth came in and that was pale and silent was that halfmourning dinner in the heat  her father called her back as she was following her mother out  she sat down beside him at the table and unpinning the pale honeysuckle put it to her nose  ive been thinking he said  yes dear  its extremely painful for me to talk but theres no help for it i dont know if you understand how much you are to me ive never spoken of it i didnt think it necessary butbut youre everything your mother he paused staring at his fingerbowl of venetian glass  yes  ive only you to look to ive never hadnever wanted anything else since you were born  i know fleur murmured  soames moistened his lips  you may think this a matter i can smooth over and arrange for you youre mistaken im helpless  fleur did not speak  quite apart from my own feelings went on soames with more resolution those two are not amenable to anything i can say theythey hate me as people always hate those whom they have injured but hejon  hes their flesh and blood her only child probably he means to her what you mean to me its a deadlock  no cried fleur no father  soames leaned back the image of pale patience as if resolved on the betrayal of no emotion  listen he said youre putting the feelings of two monthstwo monthsagainst the feelings of thirtyfive years what chance do you think you have two monthsyour very first love affair a matter of half a dozen meetings a few walks and talks a few kissesagainst against what you cant imagine what no one could who hasnt been through it come be reasonable fleur its midsummer madness  fleur tore the honeysuckle into little slow bits  the madness is in letting the past spoil it all  what do we care about the past its our lives not yours  soames raised his hand to his forehead where suddenly she saw moisture shining  whose child are you he said whose child is he the present is linked with the past the future with both theres no getting away from that  she had never heard philosophy pass those lips before impressed even in her agitation she leaned her elbows on the table her chin on her hands  but father consider it practically we want each other theres ever so much money and nothing whatever in the way but sentiment lets bury the past father  his answer was a sigh  besides said fleur gently you cant prevent us  i dont suppose said soames that if left to myself i should try to prevent you i must put up with things i know to keep your affection but its not i who control this matter thats what i want you to realise before its too late if you go on thinking you can get your way and encourage this feeling the blow will be much heavier when you find you cant  oh cried fleur help me father you can help me you know  soames made a startled movement of negation i he said bitterly help i am the impedimentthe just cause and impedimentisnt that the jargon you have my blood in your veins  he rose  well the fats in the fire if you persist in your wilfulness youll have yourself to blame come dont be foolish my childmy only child  fleur laid her forehead against his shoulder  all was in such turmoil within her but no good to show it no good at all she broke away from him and went out into the twilight distraught but unconvinced all was indeterminate and vague within her like the shapes and shadows in the garden excepther will to have a poplar pierced up into the darkblue sky and touched a white star there the dew wetted her shoes and chilled her bare shoulders she went down to the river bank and stood gazing at a moonstreak on the darkening water suddenly she smelled tobacco smoke and a white figure emerged as if created by the moon it was young mont in flannels standing in his boat she heard the tiny hiss of his cigarette extinguished in the water  fleur came his voice dont be hard on a poor devil ive been waiting hours  for what  come in my boat  not i  why not  im not a waternymph  havent you any romance in you dont be modern fleur  he appeared on the path within a yard of her  go away  fleur i love you fleur  fleur uttered a short laugh  come again she said when i havent got my wish  what is your wish  ask another  fleur said mont and his voice sounded strange dont mock me even vivisected dogs are worth decent treatment before theyre cut up for good  fleur shook her head but her lips were trembling  well you shouldnt make me jump give me a cigarette  mont gave her one lighted it and another for himself  i dont want to talk rot he said but please imagine all the rot that all the lovers that ever were have talked and all my special rot thrown in  thank you i have imagined it goodnight they stood for a moment facing each other in the shadow of an acaciatree with very moonlit blossoms and the smoke from their cigarettes mingled in the air between them  also ran michael mont he said fleur turned abruptly toward the house on the lawn she stopped to look back michael mont was whirling his arms above him she could see them dashing at his head then waving at the moonlit blossoms of the acacia his voice just reached her jollyjolly fleur shook herself she couldnt help him she had too much trouble of her own on the verandah she stopped very suddenly again her mother was sitting in the drawingroom at her writing bureau quite alone there was nothing remarkable in the expression of her face except its utter immobility but she looked desolate fleur went upstairs at the door of her room she paused she could hear her father walking up and down up and down the picturegallery  yes she thought jolly oh jon     xdecision  when fleur left him jon stared at the austrian she was a thin woman with a dark face and the concerned expression of one who has watched every little good that life once had slip from her one by one no tea she said  susceptible to the disappointment in her voice jon murmured  no really thanks  a lil cupit ready a lil cup and cigarette  fleur was gone hours of remorse and indecision lay before him and with a heavy sense of disproportion he smiled and said  wellthank you  she brought in a little pot of tea with two little cups and a silver box of cigarettes on a little tray  sugar miss forsyte has much sugarshe buy my sugar my friends sugar also miss forsyte is a veree kind lady i am happy to serve her you her brother  yes said jon beginning to puff the second cigarette of his life  very young brother said the austrian with a little anxious smile which reminded him of the wag of a dogs tail  may i give you some he said and wont you sit down please  the austrian shook her head  your father a very nice old manthe most nice old man i ever see miss forsyte tell me all about him is he better  her words fell on jon like a reproach oh yes i think hes all right  i like to see him again said the austrian putting a hand on her heart he have veree kind heart  yes said jon and again her words seemed to him a reproach  he never give no trouble to no one and smile so gentle  yes doesnt he  he look at miss forsyte so funny sometimes i tell him all my story he so sympatisch your mothershe nice and well  yes very  he have her photograph on his dressingtable veree beautiful  jon gulped down his tea this woman with her concerned face and her reminding words was like the first and second murderers  thank you he said i must go now maymay i leave this with you  he put a tenshilling note on the tray with a doubting hand and gained the door he heard the austrian gasp and hurried out he had just time to catch his train and all the way to victoria looked at every face that passed as lovers will hoping against hope on reaching worthing he put his luggage into the local train and set out across the downs for wansdon trying to walk off his aching irresolution so long as he went full bat he could enjoy the beauty of those green slopes stopping now and again to sprawl on the grass admire the perfection of a wild rose or listen to a larks song but the war of motives within him was but postponedthe longing for fleur and the hatred of deception he came to the old chalkpit above wansdon with his mind no more made up than when he started to see both sides of a question vigorously was at once jons strength and weakness he tramped in just as the first dinnerbell rang his things had already been brought up he had a hurried bath and came down to find holly aloneval had gone to town and would not be back till the last train  since vals advice to him to ask his sister what was the matter between the two families so much had happenedfleurs disclosure in the green park her visit to robin hill todays meetingthat there seemed nothing to ask he talked of spain his sunstroke vals horses their fathers health holly startled him by saying that she thought their father not at all well she had been twice to robin hill for the weekend he had seemed fearfully languid sometimes even in pain but had always refused to talk about himself  hes awfully dear and unselfishdont you think jon  feeling far from dear and unselfish himself jon answered rather  i think hes been a simply perfect father so long as i can remember  yes answered jon very subdued  hes never interfered and hes always seemed to understand i shall never forget his letting me go to south africa in the boer war when i was in love with val  that was before he married mother wasnt it said jon suddenly  yes why  oh nothing only wasnt she engaged to fleurs father first  holly put down the spoon she was using and raised her eyes her stare was circumspect what did the boy know enough to make it better to tell him she could not decide he looked strained and worried altogether older but that might be the sunstroke  there was something she said of course we were out there and got no news of anything she could not take the risk  it was not her secret besides she was in the dark about his feelings now before spain she had made sure he was in love but boys were boys that was seven weeks ago and all spain between  she saw that he knew she was putting him off and added  have you heard anything of fleur  yes  his face told her then more than the most elaborate explanations so he had not forgotten  she said very quietly fleur is awfully attractive jon but you knowval and i dont really like her very much  why  we think shes got rather a having nature  having i dont know what you mean sheshe he pushed his dessert plate away got up and went to the window  holly too got up and put her arm round his waist  dont be angry jon dear we cant all see people in the same light can we you know i believe each of us only has about one or two people who can see the best thats in us and bring it out for you i think its your mother i once saw her looking at a letter of yours it was wonderful to see her face i think shes the most beautiful woman i ever sawage doesnt seem to touch her  jons face softened then again became tense everybodyeverybody was against him and fleur it all strengthened the appeal of her words make sure of memarry me jon  here where he had passed that wonderful week with herthe tug of her enchantment the ache in his heart increased with every minute that she was not there to make the room the garden the very air magical would he ever be able to live down here not seeing her and he closed up utterly going early to bed it would not make him healthy wealthy and wise but it closeted him with memory of fleur in her fancy frock he heard vals arrivalthe ford discharging cargo then the stillness of the summer night stole backwith only the bleating of very distant sheep and a nightjars harsh purring he leaned far out cold moonwarm airthe downs like silver small wings a stream bubbling the rambler roses godhow empty all of it without her in the bible it was written thou shalt leave father and mother and cleave tofleur  let him have pluck and go and tell them they couldnt stop him marrying herthey wouldnt want to stop him when they knew how he felt yes he would go bold and openfleur was wrong  the nightjar ceased the sheep were silent the only sound in the darkness was the bubbling of the stream and jon in his bed slept freed from the worst of lifes evilsindecision     xitimothy prophesies  on the day of the cancelled meeting at the national gallery began the second anniversary of the resurrection of englands pride and gloryor more shortly the top hat lordsthat festival which the war had driven from the fieldraised its light and dark blue flags for the second time displaying almost every feature of a glorious past here in the luncheon interval were all species of female and one species of male hat protecting the multiple types of face associated with the classes the observing forsyte might discern in the free or unconsidered seats a certain number of the squashhatted but they hardly ventured on the grass the old schoolor schoolscould still rejoice that the proletariat was not yet paying the necessary halfcrown here was still a close borough the only one left on a large scalefor the papers were about to estimate the attendance at ten thousand and the ten thousand all animated by one hope were asking each other one question where are you lunching something wonderfully uplifting and reassuring in that query and the sight of so many people like themselves voicing it what reserve power in the british realmenough pigeons lobsters lamb salmon mayonnaise strawberries and bottles of champagne to feed the lot no miracle in prospectno case of seven loaves and a few fishesfaith rested on surer foundations six thousand top hats four thousand parasols would be doffed and furled ten thousand mouths all speaking the same english would be filled there was life in the old dog yet tradition and again tradition how strong and how elastic wars might rage taxation prey trades unions take toll and europe perish of starvation but the ten thousand would be fed and within their ring fence stroll upon green turf wear their top hats and meetthemselves the heart was sound the pulse still regular eton eton harrooow  among the many forsytes present on a huntingground theirs by personal prescriptive right or proxy was soames with his wife and daughter he had not been at either school he took no interest in cricket but he wanted fleur to show her frock and he wanted to wear his top hat parade it again in peace and plenty among his peers he walked sedately with fleur between him and annette no women equalled them so far as he could see they could walk and hold themselves up there was substance in their good looks the modern woman had no build no chest no anything he remembered suddenly with what intoxication of pride he had walked round with irene in the first years of his first marriage and how they used to lunch on the drag which his mother would make his father have because it was so chicall drags and carriages in those days not these lumbering great stands and how consistently montague dartie had drunk too much he supposed that people drank too much still but there was not the scope for it there used to be he remembered george forsytewhose brothers roger and eustace had been at harrow and etontowering up on the top of the drag waving a lightblue flag with one hand and a darkblue flag with the other and shouting etroowharrton just when everybody was silent like the buffoon he had always been and eustace got up to the nines below too dandified to wear any colour or take any notice hm old days and irene in grey silk shot with palest green he looked sideways at fleurs face rather colourlessno light no eagerness that love affair was preying on hera bad business he looked beyond at his wifes face rather more touched up than usual a little disdainfulnot that she had any business to disdain so far as he could see she was taking profonds defection with curious quietude or was his small voyage just a blind if so he should refuse to see it having promenaded round the pitch and in front of the pavilion they sought winifreds table in the bedouin club tent this cluba new cock and henhad been founded in the interests of travel and of a gentleman with an old scottish name whose father had somewhat strangely been called levi winifred had joined not because she had travelled but because instinct told her that a club with such a name and such a founder was bound to go far if one didnt join at once one might never have the chance its tent with a text from the koran on an orange ground and a small green camel embroidered over the entrance was the most striking on the ground outside it they found jack cardigan in a dark blue tie he had once played for harrow batting with a malacca cane to show how that fellow ought to have hit that ball he piloted them in assembled in winifreds corner were imogen benedict with his young wife val dartie without holly maud and her husband and after soames and his two were seated one empty place  im expecting prosper said winifred but hes so busy with his yacht  soames stole a glance no movement in his wifes face whether that fellow were coming or not she evidently knew all about it it did not escape him that fleur too looked at her mother if annette didnt respect his feelings she might think of fleurs the conversation very desultory was syncopated by jack cardigan talking about midoff he cited all the great midoffs from the beginning of time as if they had been a definite racial entity in the composition of the british people soames had finished his lobster and was beginning on pigeonpie when he heard the words im a small bit late mrs dartie and saw that there was no longer any empty place that fellow was sitting between annette and imogen soames ate steadily on with an occasional word to maud and winifred conversation buzzed around him he heard the voice of profond say  i think youre mistaken mrs forsyde illill bet miss forsyde agrees with me  in what came fleurs clear voice across the table  i was sayin young gurls are much the same as they always weretheres very small difference  do you know so much about them  that sharp reply caught the ears of all and soames moved uneasily on his thin green chair  well i dont know i think they want their own small way and i think they always did  indeed  oh butprosper winifred interjected comfortably the girls in the streetsthe girls whove been in munitions the little flappers in the shops their manners now really quite hit you in the eye  at the word hit jack cardigan stopped his disquisition and in the silence monsieur profond said  it was inside before now its outside thats all  but their morals cried imogen  just as moral as they ever were mrs cardigan but theyve got more opportunity  the saying so cryptically cynical received a little laugh from imogen a slight opening of jack cardigans mouth and a creak from soames chair  winifred said thats too bad prosper  what do you say mrs forsyde dont you think human natures always the same  soames subdued a sudden longing to get up and kick the fellow he heard his wife reply  human nature is not the same in england as anywhere else that was her confounded mockery  well i dont know much about this small countryno thank god thought soamesbut i should say the pot was boilin under the lid everywhere we all want pleasure and we always did  damn the fellow his cynicism waswas outrageous  when lunch was over they broke up into couples for the digestive promenade too proud to notice soames knew perfectly that annette and that fellow had gone prowling round together fleur was with val she had chosen him no doubt because he knew that boy he himself had winifred for partner they walked in the bright circling stream a little flushed and sated for some minutes till winifred sighed  i wish we were back forty years old boy  before the eyes of her spirit an interminable procession of her own lords frocks was passing paid for with the money of her father to save a recurrent crisis its been very amusing after all sometimes i even wish monty was back what do you think of people nowadays soames  precious little style the thing began to go to pieces with bicycles and motorcars the war has finished it  i wonder whats coming said winifred in a voice dreamy from pigeonpie im not at all sure we shant go back to crinolines and pegtops look at that dress  soames shook his head  theres money but no faith in things we dont lay by for the future these youngstersits all a short life and a merry one with them  theres a hat said winifred i dont knowwhen you come to think of the people killed and all that in the war its rather wonderful i think theres no other countryprosper says the rest are all bankrupt except america and of course her men always took their style in dress from us  is that chap said soames really going to the south seas  oh one never knows where prospers going  hes a sign of the times muttered soames if you like  winifreds hand gripped his arm  dont turn your head she said in a low voice but look to your right in the front row of the stand  soames looked as best he could under that limitation a man in a grey top hat greybearded with thin brown folded cheeks and a certain elegance of posture sat there with a woman in a lawncoloured frock whose dark eyes were fixed on himself soames looked quickly at his feet how funnily feet moved one after the other like that winifreds voice said in his ear  jolyon looks very ill but he always had style she doesnt changeexcept her hair  why did you tell fleur about that business  i didnt she picked it up i always knew she would  well its a mess shes set her heart upon their boy  the little wretch murmured winifred she tried to take me in about that what shall you do soames  be guided by events  they moved on silent in the almost solid crowd  really said winifred suddenly it almost seems like fate only thats so oldfashioned look there are george and eustace  george forsytes lofty bulk had halted before them  hallo soames he said just met profond and your wife youll catch em if you put on pace did you ever go to see old timothy  soames nodded and the streams forced them apart  i always liked old george said winifred hes so droll  i never did said soames wheres your seat i shall go to mine fleur may be back there  having seen winifred to her seat he regained his own conscious of small white distant figures running the click of the bat the cheers and countercheers no fleur and no annette you could expect nothing of women nowadays they had the vote they were emancipated and much good it was doing them so winifred would go back would she and put up with dartie all over again to have the past once moreto be sitting here as he had sat in 83 and 84 before he was certain that his marriage with irene had gone all wrong before her antagonism had become so glaring that with the best will in the world he could not overlook it the sight of her with that fellow had brought all memory back even now he could not understand why she had been so impracticable she could love other men she had it in her to himself the one person she ought to have loved she had chosen to refuse her heart it seemed to him fantastically as he looked back that all this modern relaxation of marriagethough its forms and laws were the same as when he married herthat all this modern looseness had come out of her revolt it seemed to him fantastically that she had started it till all decent ownership of anything had gone or was on the point of going all came from her and nowa pretty state of things homes how could you have them without mutual ownership not that he had ever had a real home but had that been his fault he had done his best and his rewards werethose two sitting in that stand and this affair of fleurs  and overcome by loneliness he thought shant wait any longer they must find their own way back to the hotelif they mean to come hailing a cab outside the ground he said  drive me to the bayswater road his old aunts had never failed him to them he had meant an everwelcome visitor though they were gone there still was timothy  smither was standing in the open doorway  mr soames i was just taking the air cook will be so pleased  how is mr timothy  not himself at all these last few days sir hes been talking a great deal only this morning he was saying my brother james hes getting old his mind wanders mr soames and then he will talk of them he troubles about their investments the other day he said theres my brother jolyon wont look at consolshe seemed quite down about it come in mr soames come in its such a pleasant change  well said soames just for a few minutes  no murmured smither in the hall where the air had the singular freshness of the outside day we havent been very satisfied with him not all this week hes always been one to leave a titbit to the end but ever since monday hes been eating it first if you notice a dog mr soames at its dinner it eats the meat first weve always thought it such a good sign of mr timothy at his age to leave it to the last but now he seems to have lost all his selfcontrol and of course it makes him leave the rest the doctor doesnt make anything of it butsmither shook her headhe seems to think hes got to eat it first in case he shouldnt get to it that and his talking makes us anxious  has he said anything important  i shouldnt like to say that mr soames but hes turned against his will he gets quite pettishand after having had it out every morning for years it does seem funny he said the other day they want my money it gave me such a turn because as i said to him nobody wants his money im sure and it does seem a pity he should be thinking about money at his time of life i took my courage in my ands you know mr timothy i said my dear mistressthats miss forsyte mr soames miss ann that trained meshe never thought about money i said it was all character with her he looked at me i cant tell you how funny and he said quite dry nobody wants my character think of his saying a thing like that but sometimes hell say something as sharp and sensible as anything  soames who had been staring at an old print by the hatrack thinking thats got value murmured ill go up and see him smither  cooks with him answered smither above her corsets she will be pleased to see you  he mounted slowly with the thought shant care to live to be that age  on the second floor he paused and tapped the door was opened and he saw the round homely face of a woman about sixty  mr soames she said why mr soames  soames nodded all right cook and entered  timothy was propped up in bed with his hands joined before his chest and his eyes fixed on the ceiling where a fly was standing upside down soames stood at the foot of the bed facing him  uncle timothy he said raising his voice uncle timothy  timothys eyes left the fly and levelled themselves on his visitor soames could see his pale tongue passing over his darkish lips  uncle timothy he said again is there anything i can do for you is there anything youd like to say  ha said timothy  ive come to look you up and see that everythings all right  timothy nodded he seemed trying to get used to the apparition before him  have you got everything you want  no said timothy  can i get you anything  no said timothy  im soames you know your nephew soames forsyte your brother james son  timothy nodded  i shall be delighted to do anything i can for you  timothy beckoned soames went close to him  you said timothy in a voice which seemed to have outlived tone you tell them all from meyou tell them all and his finger tapped on soames arm to hold onhold onconsols are goin up and he nodded thrice  all right said soames i will  yes said timothy and fixing his eyes again on the ceiling he added that fly  strangely moved soames looked at the cooks pleasant fattish face all little puckers from staring at fires  thatll do him a world of good sir she said  a mutter came from timothy but he was clearly speaking to himself and soames went out with the cook  i wish i could make you a pink cream mr soames like in old days you did so relish them goodbye sir it has been a pleasure  take care of him cook he is old  and shaking her crumpled hand he went downstairs smither was still taking the air in the doorway  what do you think of him mr soames  hm soames murmured hes lost touch  yes said smither i was afraid youd think that coming fresh out of the world to see him like  smither said soames were all indebted to you  oh no mr soames dont say that its a pleasurehes such a wonderful man  well goodbye said soames and got into his taxi  going up he thought going up  reaching the hotel at knightsbridge he went to their sittingroom and rang for tea neither of them were in and again that sense of loneliness came over him these hotels what monstrous great places they were now he could remember when there was nothing bigger than longs or browns morleys or the tavistock and the heads that were shaken over the langham and the grand hotels and clubsclubs and hotels no end to them now and soames who had just been watching at lords a miracle of tradition and continuity fell into reverie over the changes in that london where he had been born fiveandsixty years before whether consols were going up or not london had become a terrific property no such property in the world unless it were new york there was a lot of hysteria in the papers nowadays but any one who like himself could remember london sixty years ago and see it now realised the fecundity and elasticity of wealth they had only to keep their heads and go at it steadily why he remembered cobblestones and stinking straw on the floor of your cab and old timothywhat could he not have told them if he had kept his memory things were unsettled people in a funk or in a hurry but here were london and the thames and out there the british empire and the ends of the earth consols are goin up he should nt be a bit surprised it was the breed that counted and all that was bulldogged in soames stared for a moment out of his grey eyes till diverted by the print of a victorian picture on the walls the hotel had bought three dozen of that little lot the old hunting or rakes progress prints in the old inns were worth looking atbut this sentimental stuffwell victorianism had gone tell them to hold on old timothy had said but to what were they to hold on in this modern welter of the democratic principle why even privacy was threatened and at the thought that privacy might perish soames pushed back his teacup and went to the window fancy owning no more of nature than the crowd out there owned of the flowers and trees and waters of hyde park no no private possession underlay everything worth having the world had slipped its sanity a bit as dogs now and again at full moon slipped theirs and went off for a nights rabbiting but the world like the dog knew where its bread was buttered and its bed warm and would come back sure enough to the only home worth havingto private ownership the world was in its second childhood for the moment like old timothyeating its titbit first  he heard a sound behind him and saw that his wife and daughter had come in  so youre back he said  fleur did not answer she stood for a moment looking at him and her mother then passed into her bedroom annette poured herself out a cup of tea  i am going to paris to my mother soames  oh to your mother  yes  for how long  i do not know  and when are you going  on monday  was she really going to her mother odd how indifferent he felt odd how clearly she had perceived the indifference he would feel so long as there was no scandal and suddenly between her and himself he saw distinctly the face he had seen that afternoonirenes  will you want money  thank you i have enough  very well let us know when you are coming back  annette put down the cake she was fingering and looking up through darkened lashes said  shall i give maman any message  my regards  annette stretched herself her hands on her waist and said in french  what luck that you have never loved me soames then rising she too left the room soames was glad she had spoken it in frenchit seemed to require no dealing with again that other facepale darkeyed beautiful still and there stirred far down within him the ghost of warmth as from sparks lingering beneath a mound of flaky ash and fleur infatuated with her boy queer chance yet was there such a thing as chance a man went down a street a brick fell on his head ah that was chance no doubt but this inherited his girl had said sheshe was holding on     part iii     iold jolyon walks  twofold impulse had made jolyon say to his wife at breakfast lets go up to lords  wantedsomething to abate the anxiety in which those two had lived during the sixty hours since jon had brought fleur down wantedtoo that which might assuage the pangs of memory in one who knew he might lose them any day  fiftyeight years ago jolyon had become an eton boy for old jolyons whim had been that he should be canonised at the greatest possible expense year after year he had gone to lords from stanhope gate with a father whose youth in the eighteentwenties had been passed without polish in the game of cricket old jolyon would speak quite openly of swipes full tosses half and threequarter balls and young jolyon with the guileless snobbery of youth had trembled lest his sire should be overheard only in this supreme matter of cricket he had been nervous for his fatherin crimean whiskers thenhad ever impressed him as the beau ideal though never canonised himself old jolyons natural fastidiousness and balance had saved him from the errors of the vulgar how delicious after bowling in a top hat and a sweltering heat to go home with his father in a hansom cab bathe dress and forth to the disunion club to dine off white bait cutlets and a tart and gotwo swells old and young in lavender kid glovesto the opera or play and on sunday when the match was over and his top hat duly broken down with his father in a special hansom to the crown and sceptre and the terrace above the riverthe golden sixties when the world was simple dandies glamorous democracy not born and the books of whyte melville coming thick and fast  a generation later with his own boy jolly harrowbuttonholed with cornflowersby old jolyons whim his grandson had been canonised at a trifle less expenseagain jolyon had experienced the heat and counterpassions of the day and come back to the cool and the strawberry beds of robin hill and billiards after dinner his boy making the most heartbreaking flukes and trying to seem languid and grownup those two days each year he and his son had been alone together in the world one on each sideand democracy just born  and so he had unearthed a grey top hat borrowed a tiny bit of lightblue ribbon from irene and gingerly keeping cool by car and train and taxi had reached lords ground there beside her in a lawncoloured frock with narrow black edges he had watched the game and felt the old thrill stir within him  when soames passed the day was spoiled irenes face was distorted by compression of the lips no good to go on sitting here with soames or perhaps his daughter recurring in front of them like decimals and he said  well dear if youve had enoughlets go  that evening jolyon felt exhausted not wanting her to see him thus he waited till she had begun to play and stole off to the little study he opened the long window for air and the door that he might still hear her music drifting in and settled in his fathers old armchair closed his eyes with his head against the worn brown leather like that passage of the cesar franck sonataso had been his life with her a divine third movement and now this business of jonsthis bad business drifted to the edge of consciousness he hardly knew if it were in sleep that he smelled the scent of a cigar and seemed to see his father in the blackness before his closed eyes that shape formed went and formed again as if in the very chair where he himself was sitting he saw his father blackcoated with knees crossed glasses balanced between thumb and finger saw the big white moustaches and the deep eyes looking up below a dome of forehead and seeming to search his own seeming to speak are you facing it jo its for you to decide shes only a woman ah how well he knew his father in that phrase how all the victorian age came up with it and his answer no ive funked itfunked hurting her and jon and myself ive got a heart ive funked it but the old eyes so much older so much younger than his own kept at it its your wife your son your past tackle it my boy was it a message from walking spirit or but the instinct of his sire living on within him and again came that scent of cigar smokefrom the old saturated leather well he would tackle it write to jon and put the whole thing down in black and white and suddenly he breathed with difficulty with a sense of suffocation as if his heart were swollen he got up and went out into the air the stars were very bright he passed along the terrace round the corner of the house till through the window of the musicroom he could see irene at the piano with lamplight falling on her powdery hair withdrawn into herself she seemed her dark eyes staring straight before her her hands idle jolyon saw her raise those hands and clasp them over her breast its jon with her he thought all jon im dying out of herits natural  and careful not to be seen he stole back  next day after a bad night he sat down to his task he wrote with difficulty and many erasures   my dearest boy  you are old enough to understand how very difficult it is for elders to give themselves away to their young especially whenlike your mother and myself though i shall never think of her as anything but youngtheir hearts are altogether set on him to whom they must confess i cannot say we are conscious of having sinned exactlypeople in real life very seldom are i believebut most persons would say we had and at all events our conduct righteous or not has found us out the truth is my dear we both have pasts which it is now my task to make known to you because they so grievously and deeply affect your future many very many years ago as far back indeed as 1883 when she was only twenty your mother had the great and lasting misfortune to make an unhappy marriageno not with me jon without money of her own and with only a stepmotherclosely related to jezebelshe was very unhappy in her home life it was fleurs father that she married my cousin soames forsyte he had pursued her very tenaciously and to do him justice was deeply in love with her within a week she knew the fearful mistake she had made it was not his fault it was her error of judgmenther misfortune  so far jolyon had kept some semblance of irony but now his subject carried him away  jon i want to explain to you if i canand its very hardhow it is that an unhappy marriage such as this can so easily come about you will of course say if she didnt really love him how could she ever have married him you would be right if it were not for one or two rather terrible considerations from this initial mistake of hers all the subsequent trouble sorrow and tragedy have come and so i must make it clear to you if i can you see jon in those days and even to this dayindeed i dont see for all the talk of enlightenment how it can well be otherwisemost girls are married ignorant of the sexual side of life even if they know what it means they have not experienced it thats the crux it is this actual lack of experience whatever verbal knowledge they have which makes all the difference and all the trouble in a vast number of marriagesand your mothers was onegirls are not and cannot be certain whether they love the man they marry or not they do not know until after that act of union which makes the reality of marriage now in many perhaps in most doubtful cases this act cements and strengthens the attachment but in other cases and your mothers was one it is a revelation of mistake a destruction of such attraction as there was there is nothing more tragic in a womans life than such a revelation growing daily nightly clearer coarsegrained and unthinking people are apt to laugh at such a mistake and say what a fuss about nothing narrow and selfrighteous people only capable of judging the lives of others by their own are apt to condemn those who make this tragic error to condemn them for life to the dungeons they have made for themselves you know the expression she has made her bed she must lie on it it is a hardmouthed saying quite unworthy of a gentleman or lady in the best sense of those words and i can use no stronger condemnation i have not been what is called a moral man but i wish to use no words to you my dear which will make you think lightly of ties or contracts into which you enter heaven forbid but with the experience of a life behind me i do say that those who condemn the victims of these tragic mistakes condemn them and hold out no hands to help them are inhuman or rather they would be if they had the understanding to know what they are doing but they havent let them go they are as much anathema to me as i no doubt am to them i have had to say all this because i am going to put you into a position to judge your mother and you are very young without experience of what life is to go on with the story after three years of effort to subdue her shrinkingi was going to say her loathing and its not too strong a word for shrinking soon becomes loathing under such circumstancesthree years of what to a sensitive beautyloving nature like your mothers jon was torment she met a young man who fell in love with her he was the architect of this very house that we live in now he was building it for her and fleurs father to live in a new prison to hold her in place of the one she inhabited with him in london perhaps that fact played some part in what came of it but in any case she too fell in love with him i know its not necessary to explain to you that one does not precisely choose with whom one will fall in love it comes very well it came i can imaginethough she never said much to me about itthe struggle that then took place in her because jon she was brought up strictly and was not light in her ideasnot at all however this was an overwhelming feeling and it came to pass that they loved in deed as well as in thought then came a fearful tragedy i must tell you of it because if i dont you will never understand the real situation that you have now to face the man whom she had marriedsoames forsyte the father of fleur one night at the height of her passion for this young man forcibly reasserted his rights over her the next day she met her lover and told him of it whether he committed suicide or whether he was accidentally run over in his distraction we never knew but so it was think of your mother as she was that evening when she heard of his death i happened to see her your grandfather sent me to help her if i could i only just saw her before the door was shut against me by her husband but i have never forgotten her face i can see it now i was not in love with her then not for twelve years after but i have never forgotten my dear boyit is not easy to write like this but you see i must your mother is wrapped up in you utterly devotedly i dont wish to write harshly of soames forsyte i dont think harshly of him i have long been sorry for him perhaps i was sorry even then as the world judges she was in error he within his rights he loved herin his way she was his property that is the view he holds of lifeof human feelings and heartsproperty its not his faultso was he born to me it is a view that has always been abhorrentso was i born knowing you as i do i feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent to you let me go on with the story your mother fled from his house that night for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any sort until in 1899 her husbandyou see he was still her husband for he did not attempt to divorce her and she of course had no right to divorce himbecame conscious it seems of the want of children and commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child i was her trustee then under your grandfathers will and i watched this going on while watching i became attached to her devotedly attached his pressure increased till one day she came to me here and practically put herself under my protection her husband who was kept informed of all her movements attempted to force us apart by bringing a divorce suit or possibly he really meant it i dont know but anyway our names were publicly joined that decided us and we became united in fact she was divorced married me and you were born we have lived in perfect happiness at least i have and i believe your mother also soames soon after the divorce married fleurs mother and she was born that is the story jon i have told it you because by the affection which we see you have formed for this mans daughter you are blindly moving toward what must utterly destroy your mothers happiness if not your own i dont wish to speak of myself because at my age theres no use supposing i shall cumber the ground much longer besides what i should suffer would be mainly on her account and on yours but what i want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten they are alive in her today only yesterday at lords we happened to see soames forsyte her face if you had seen it would have convinced you the idea that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her jon i have nothing to say against fleur save that she is his daughter but your children if you married her would be the grandchildren of soames as much as of your mother of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave think what that would mean by such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out you are just on the threshold of life you have only known this girl two months and however deeply you think you love her i appeal to you to break it off at once dont give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during the rest of her life young though she will always seem to me she is fiftyseven except for us two she has no one in the world she will soon have only you pluck up your spirit jon and break away dont put this cloud and barrier between you dont break her heart bless you my dear boy and again forgive me for all the pain this letter must bring youwe tried to spare it you but spainit seemswas no good  ever your devoted father  jolyon forsyte   having finished his confession jolyon sat with a thin cheek on his hand rereading there were things in it which hurt him so much when he thought of jon reading them that he nearly tore the letter up to speak of such things at all to a boyhis own boyto speak of them in relation to his own wife and the boys own mother seemed dreadful to the reticence of his forsyte soul and yet without speaking of them how make jon understand the reality the deep cleavage the ineffaceable scar without them how justify this stiffing of the boys love he might just as well not write at all  he folded the confession and put it in his pocket it wasthank heavensaturday he had till sunday evening to think it over for even if posted now it could not reach jon till monday he felt a curious relief at this delay and at the fact that whether sent or not it was written  in the rose garden which had taken the place of the old fernery he could see irene snipping and pruning with a little basket on her arm she was never idle it seemed to him and he envied her now that he himself was idle nearly all his time he went down to her she held up a stained glove and smiled a piece of lace tied under her chin concealed her hair and her oval face with its still dark brows looked very young  the greenfly are awful this year and yet its cold you look tired jolyon  jolyon took the confession from his pocket ive been writing this i think you ought to see it  to jon her whole face had changed in that instant becoming almost haggard  yes the murders out  he gave it to her and walked away among the roses presently seeing that she had finished reading and was standing quite still with the sheets of the letter against her skirt he came back to her  well  its wonderfully put i dont see how it could be put better thank you dear  is there anything you would like left out  she shook her head  no he must know all if hes to understand  thats what i thought buti hate it  he had the feeling that he hated it more than sheto him sex was so much easier to mention between man and woman than between man and man and she had always been more natural and frank not deeply secretive like his forsyte self  i wonder if he will understand even now jolyon hes so young and he shrinks from the physical  he gets that shrinking from my father he was as fastidious as a girl in all such matters would it be better to rewrite the whole thing and just say you hated soames  irene shook her head  hates only a word it conveys nothing no better as it is  very well it shall go tomorrow  she raised her face to his and in sight of the big houses many creepered windows he kissed her     iiconfession  late that same afternoon jolyon had a nap in the old armchair face down on his knee was la rotisserie de la refine pedauque and just before he fell asleep he had been thinking as a people shall we ever really like the french will they ever really like us he himself had always liked the french feeling at home with their wit their taste their cooking irene and he had paid many visits to france before the war when jon had been at his private school his romance with her had begun in parishis last and most enduring romance but the frenchno englishman could like them who could not see them in some sort with the detached aesthetic eye and with that melancholy conclusion he had nodded off  when he woke he saw jon standing between him and the window the boy had evidently come in from the garden and was waiting for him to wake jolyon smiled still half asleep how nice the chap lookedsensitive affectionate straight then his heart gave a nasty jump and a quaking sensation overcame him jon that confession he controlled himself with an effort why jon where did you spring from  jon bent over and kissed his forehead  only then he noticed the look on the boys face  i came home to tell you something dad  with all his might jolyon tried to get the better of the jumping gurgling sensations within his chest  well sit down old man have you seen your mother  no the boys flushed look gave place to pallor he sat down on the arm of the old chair as in old days jolyon himself used to sit beside his own father installed in its recesses right up to the time of the rupture in their relations he had been wont to perch therehad he now reached such a moment with his own son all his life he had hated scenes like poison avoided rows gone on his own way quietly and let others go on theirs but nowit seemedat the very end of things he had a scene before him more painful than any he had avoided he drew a visor down over his emotion and waited for his son to speak  father said jon slowly fleur and i are engaged  exactly thought jolyon breathing with difficulty  i know that you and mother dont like the idea fleur says that mother was engaged to her father before you married her of course i dont know what happened but it must be ages ago im devoted to her dad and she says she is to me  jolyon uttered a queer sound half laugh half groan  you are nineteen jon and i am seventytwo how are we to understand each other in a matter like this eh  you love mother dad you must know what we feel it isnt fair to us to let old things spoil our happiness is it  brought face to face with his confession jolyon resolved to do without it if by any means he could he laid his hand on the boys arm  look jon i might put you off with talk about your both being too young and not knowing your own minds and all that but you wouldnt listen besides it doesnt meet the caseyouth unfortunately cures itself you talk lightly about old things like that knowing nothingas you say trulyof what happened now have i ever given you reason to doubt my love for you or my word  at a less anxious moment he might have been amused by the conflict his words arousedthe boys eager clasp to reassure him on these points the dread on his face of what that reassurance would bring forth but he could only feel grateful for the squeeze  very well you can believe what i tell you if you dont give up this love affair you will make mother wretched to the end of her days believe me my dear the past whatever it was cant be buriedit cant indeed  jon got off the arm of the chair  the girlthought jolyonthere she goesstarting up before himlife itselfeager pretty loving  i cant father how can ijust because you say that of course i cant  jon if you knew the story you would give this up without hesitation you would have to cant you believe me  how can you tell what i should think father i love her better than anything in the world  jolyons face twitched and he said with painful slowness  better than your mother jon  from the boys face and his clenched fists jolyon realised the stress and struggle he was going through  i dont know he burst out i dont know but to give fleur up for nothingfor something i dont understand for something that i dont believe can really matter half so much will make memake me  make you feel us unjust put a barrieryes but thats better than going on with this  i cant fleur loves me and i love her you want me to trust you why dont you trust me father we wouldnt want to know anythingwe wouldnt let it make any difference itll only make us both love you and mother all the more  jolyon put his hand into his breast pocket but brought it out again empty and sat clucking his tongue against his teeth  think what your mothers been to you jon she has nothing but you i shant last much longer  why not it isnt fair towhy not  well said jolyon rather coldly because the doctors tell me i shant thats all  oh dad cried jon and burst into tears  this downbreak of his son whom he had not seen cry since he was ten moved jolyon terribly he recognised to the full how fearfully soft the boys heart was how much he would suffer in this business and in life generally and he reached out his hand helplesslynot wishing indeed not daring to get up  dear man he said dontor youll make me  jon smothered down his paroxysm and stood with face averted very still  what now thought jolyon what can i say to move him  by the way dont speak of that to mother he said she has enough to frighten her with this affair of yours i know how you feel but jon you know her and me well enough to be sure we wouldnt wish to spoil your happiness lightly why my dear boy we dont care for anything but your happinessat least with me its just yours and mothers and with her just yours its all the future for you both thats at stake  jon turned his face was deadly pale his eyes deep in his head seemed to burn  what is it what is it dont keep me like this  jolyon who knew that he was beaten thrust his hand again into his breast pocket and sat for a full minute breathing with difficulty his eyes closed the thought passed through his mind ive had a good long inningssome pretty bitter momentsthis is the worst then he brought his hand out with the letter and said with a sort of fatigue well jon if you hadnt come today i was going to send you this i wanted to spare youi wanted to spare your mother and myself but i see its no good read it and i think ill go into the garden he reached forward to get up  jon who had taken the letter said quickly no ill go and was gone  jolyon sank back in his chair a bluebottle chose that moment to come buzzing round him with a sort of fury the sound was homely better than nothing where had the boy gone to read his letter the wretched letterthe wretched story a cruel businesscruel to herto soamesto those two childrento himself his heart thumped and pained him lifeits lovesits workits beautyits aching andits end a good time a fine time in spite of all untilyou regretted that you had ever been born lifeit wore you down yet did not make you want to diethat was the cunning evil mistake to have a heart again the bluebottle came buzzingbringing in all the heat and hum and scent of summeryes even the scentas of ripe fruits dried grasses sappy shrubs and the vanilla breath of cows and out there somewhere in the fragrance jon would be reading that letter turning and twisting its pages in his trouble his bewilderment and troublebreaking his heart about it the thought made jolyon acutely miserable jon was such a tenderhearted chap affectionate to his bones and conscientious tooit was so unfair so damned unfair he remembered irene saying to him once never was any one born more loving and lovable than jon poor little jon his world gone up the spout all of a summer afternoon youth took things so hard and stirred tormented by that vision of youth taking things hard jolyon got out of his chair and went to the window the boy was nowhere visible and he passed out if one could take any help to him nowone must  he traversed the shrubbery glanced into the walled gardenno jon nor where the peaches and the apricots were beginning to swell and colour he passed the cupressus trees dark and spiral into the meadow where had the boy got to had he rushed down to the coppicehis old huntingground jolyon crossed the rows of hay they would cock it on monday and be carrying the day after if rain held off often they had crossed this field togetherhand in hand when jon was a little chap dash it the golden age was over by the time one was ten he came to the pond where flies and gnats were dancing over a bright reedy surface and on into the coppice it was cool there fragrant of larches still no jon he called no answer on the log seat he sat down nervous anxious forgetting his own physical sensations he had been wrong to let the boy get away with that letter he ought to have kept him under his eye from the start greatly troubled he got up to retrace his steps at the farmbuildings he called again and looked into the dark cowhouse there in the cool and the scent of vanilla and ammonia away from flies the three alderneys were chewing the quiet cud just milked waiting for evening to be turned out again into the lower field one turned a lazy head a lustrous eye jolyon could see the slobber on its grey lower lip he saw everything with passionate clearness in the agitation of his nervesall that in his time he had adored and tried to paintwonder of light and shade and colour no wonder the legend put christ into a mangerwhat more devotional than the eyes and moonwhite horns of a chewing cow in the warm dusk he called again no answer and he hurried away out of the coppice past the pond up the hill oddly ironicalnow he came to think of itif jon had taken the gruel of his discovery down in the coppice where his mother and bosinney in those old days had made the plunge of acknowledging their love where he himself on the log seat the sunday morning he came back from paris had realised to the full that irene had become the world to him that would have been the place for irony to tear the veil from before the eyes of irenes boy but he was not here where had he got to one must find the poor chap  a gleam of sun had come sharpening to his hurrying senses all the beauty of the afternoon of the tall trees and lengthening shadows of the blue and the white clouds the scent of the hay and the cooing of the pigeons and the flower shapes standing tall he came to the rosery and the beauty of the roses in that sudden sunlight seemed to him unearthly rose you spaniard wonderful three words there she had stood by that bush of dark red roses had stood to read and decide that jon must know it all he knew all now had she chosen wrong he bent and sniffed a rose its petals brushed his nose and trembling lips nothing so soft as a roseleafs velvet except her neckirene on across the lawn he went up the slope to the oaktree its top alone was glistening for the sudden sun was away over the house the lower shade was thick blessedly coolhe was greatly overheated he paused a minute with his hand on the rope of the swingjolly hollyjon the old swing and suddenly he felt horriblydeadly ill ive over done it he thought by jove ive overdone itafter all he staggered up toward the terrace dragged himself up the steps and fell against the wall of the house he leaned there gasping his face buried in the honeysuckle that he and she had taken such trouble with that it might sweeten the air which drifted in its fragrance mingled with awful pain my love he thought the boy and with a great effort he tottered in through the long window and sank into old jolyons chair the book was there a pencil in it he caught it up scribbled a word on the open page his hand dropped so it was like thiswas it  there was a great wrench and darkness     iiiirene  when jon rushed away with the letter in his hand he ran along the terrace and round the corner of the house in fear and confusion leaning against the creepered wall he tore open the letter it was longvery long this added to his fear and he began reading when he came to the words it was fleurs father that she married everything seemed to spin before him he was close to a window and entering by it he passed through musicroom and hall up to his bedroom dipping his face in cold water he sat on his bed and went on reading dropping each finished page on the bed beside him his fathers writing was easy to readhe knew it so well though he had never had a letter from him one quarter so long he read with a dull feelingimagination only half at work he best grasped on that first reading the pain his father must have had in writing such a letter he let the last sheet fall and in a sort of mental moral helplessness began to read the first again it all seemed to him disgustingdead and disgusting then suddenly a hot wave of horrified emotion tingled through him he buried his face in his hands his mother fleurs father he took up the letter again and read on mechanically and again came the feeling that it was all dead and disgusting his own love so different this letter said his motherand her father an awful letter  property could there be men who looked on women as their property faces seen in street and countryside came thronging up before himred stockfish faces hard dull faces prim dry faces violent faces hundreds thousands of them how could he know what men who had such faces thought and did he held his head in his hands and groaned his mother he caught up the letter and read on again horror and aversionalive in her today your children grandchildren of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave he got up from his bed this cruel shadowy past lurking there to murder his love and fleurs was true or his father could never have written it why didnt they tell me the first thing he thought the day i first saw fleur they knew id seen her they were afraid andnowivegot it overcome by misery too acute for thought or reason he crept into a dusky corner of the room and sat down on the floor he sat there like some unhappy little animal there was comfort in dusk and the flooras if he were back in those days when he played his battles sprawling all over it he sat there huddled his hair ruffled his hands clasped round his knees for how long he did not know he was wrenched from his blank wretchedness by the sound of the door opening from his mothers room the blinds were down over the windows of his room shut up in his absence and from where he sat he could only hear a rustle her footsteps crossing till beyond the bed he saw her standing before his dressingtable she had something in her hand he hardly breathed hoping she would not see him and go away he saw her touch things on the table as if they had some virtue in them then face the windowgrey from head to foot like a ghost the least turn of her head and she must see him her lips moved oh jon she was speaking to herself the tone of her voice troubled jons heart he saw in her hand a little photograph she held it toward the light looking at itvery small he knew itone of himself as a tiny boy which she always kept in her bag his heart beat fast and suddenly as if she had heard it she turned her eyes and saw him at the gasp she gave and the movement of her hands pressing the photograph against her breast he said  yes its me  she moved over to the bed and sat down on it quite close to him her hands still clasping her breast her feet among the sheets of the letter which had slipped to the floor she saw them and her hands grasped the edge of the bed she sat very upright her dark eyes fixed on him at last she spoke  well jon you know i see  yes  youve seen father  yes  there was a long silence till she said  oh my darling  its all right the emotions in him were so violent and so mixed that he dared not moveresentment despair and yet a strange yearning for the comfort of her hand on his forehead  what are you going to do  i dont know  there was another long silence then she got up she stood a moment very still made a little movement with her hand and said my darling boy my most darling boy dont think of methink of yourself and passing round the foot of the bed went back into her room  jon turnedcurled into a sort of ball as might a hedgehoginto the corner made by the two walls  he must have been twenty minutes there before a cry roused him it came from the terrace below he got up scared again came the cry jon his mother was calling he ran out and down the stairs through the empty diningroom into the study she was kneeling before the old armchair and his father was lying back quite white his head on his breast one of his hands resting on an open book with a pencil clutched in itmore strangely still than anything he had ever seen she looked round wildly and said  oh jonhes deadhes dead  jon flung himself down and reaching over the arm of the chair where he had lately been sitting put his lips to the forehead icy cold how couldhow could dad be dead when only an hour ago his mothers arms were round the knees pressing her breast against them whywhy wasnt i with him he heard her whisper then he saw the tottering word irene pencilled on the open page and broke down himself it was his first sight of human death and its unutterable stillness blotted from him all other emotion all else then was but preliminary to this all love and life and joy anxiety and sorrow all movement light and beauty but a beginning to this terrible white stillness it made a dreadful mark on him all seemed suddenly little futile short he mastered himself at last got up and raised her  mother dont crymother  some hours later when all was done that had to be and his mother was lying down he saw his father alone on the bed covered with a white sheet he stood for a long time gazing at that face which had never looked angryalways whimsical and kind to be kind and keep your end uptheres nothing else in it he had once heard his father say how wonderfully dad had acted up to that philosophy he understood now that his father had known for a long time past that this would come suddenlyknown and not said a word he gazed with an awed and passionate reverence the loneliness of itjust to spare his mother and himself his own trouble seemed small while he was looking at that face the word scribbled on the page the farewell word now his mother had no one but himself he went up close to the dead facenot changed at all and yet completely changed he had heard his father say once that he did not believe in consciousness surviving death or that if it did it might be just survival till the natural age limit of the body had been reachedthe natural term of its inherent vitality so that if the body were broken by accident excess violent disease consciousness might still persist till in the course of nature uninterfered with it would naturally have faded out it had struck him because he had never heard any one else suggest it when the heart failed like thissurely it was not quite natural perhaps his fathers consciousness was in the room with him above the bed hung a picture of his fathers father perhaps his consciousness too was still alive and his brothershis halfbrother who had died in the transvaal were they all gathered round this bed jon kissed the forehead and stole back to his own room the door between it and his mothers was ajar she had evidently been ineverything was ready for him even some biscuits and hot milk and the letter no longer on the floor he ate and drank watching the last light fade he did not try to see into the futurejust stared at the dark branches of the oaktree level with his window and felt as if life had stopped once in the night turning in his heavy sleep he was conscious of something white and still beside his bed and started up  his mothers voice said  its only i jon dear her hand pressed his forehead gently back her white figure disappeared  alone he fell heavily asleep again and dreamed he saw his mothers name crawling on his bed     ivsoames cogitates  the announcement in the times of his cousin jolyons death affected soames quite simply so that chap was gone there had never been a time in their two lives when love had not been lost between them that quickblooded sentiment hatred had run its course long since in soames heart and he had refused to allow any recrudescence but he considered this early decease a piece of poetic justice for twenty years the fellow had enjoyed the reversion of his wife and house andhe was dead the obituary notice which appeared a little later paid jolyonhe thoughttoo much attention it spoke of that diligent and agreeable painter whose work we have come to look on as typical of the best latevictorian watercolour art soames who had almost mechanically preferred mole morpin and caswell baye and had always sniffed quite audibly when he came to one of his cousins on the line turned the times with a crackle  he had to go up to town that morning on forsyte affairs and was fully conscious of gradmans glance sidelong over his spectacles the old clerk had about him an aura of regretful congratulation he smelled as it were of old days one could almost hear him thinking mr jolyon yeesjust my age and gonedear dear i dare say she feels it she was a nicelookin woman flesh is flesh theyve given im a notice in the papers fancy his atmosphere in fact caused soames to handle certain leases and conversions with exceptional swiftness  about that settlement on miss fleur mr soames  ive thought better of that answered soames shortly  ah im glad of that i thought you were a little hasty the times do change  how this death would affect fleur had begun to trouble soames he was not certain that she knew of itshe seldom looked at the paper never at the births marriages and deaths  he pressed matters on and made his way to green street for lunch winifred was almost doleful jack cardigan had broken a splashboard so far as one could make out and would not be fit for some time she could not get used to the idea  did profond ever get off he said suddenly  he got off replied winifred but wherei dont know  yes there it wasimpossible to tell anything not that he wanted to know letters from annette were coming from dieppe where she and her mother were staying  you saw that fellows death i suppose  yes said winifred im sorry forfor his children he was very amiable soames uttered a rather queer sound a suspicion of the old deep truththat men were judged in this world rather by what they were than by what they didcrept and knocked resentfully at the back doors of his mind  i know there was a superstition to that effect he muttered  one must do him justice now hes dead  i should like to have done him justice before said soames but i never had the chance have you got a baronetage here  yes in that bottom row  soames took out a fat red book and ran over the leaves  montsir lawrence 9th bt cr 1620 e s of geoffrey 8th bt and lavinia daur of sir charles muskham bt of muskham hall

bores me answered winifred and i found the railway strike quite exciting  winifred had always been noted for sangfroid  soames took his leave all the way down to reading he debated whether he should tell fleur of that boys fathers death it did not alter the situation except that he would be independent now and only have his mothers opposition to encounter he would come into a lot of money no doubt and perhaps the housethe house built for irene and himselfthe house whose architect had wrought his domestic ruin his daughtermistress of that house that would be poetic justice soames uttered a little mirthless laugh he had designed that house to reestablish his failing union meant it for the seat of his descendants if he could have induced irene to give him one her son and fleur their children would be in some sort offspring of the union between himself and her  the theatricality in that thought was repulsive to his sober sense and yetit would be the easiest and wealthiest way out of the impasse now that jolyon was gone the juncture of two forsyte fortunes had a kind of conservative charm and sheirenewould be linked to him once more nonsense absurd he put the notion from his head  on arriving home he heard the click of billiardballs and through the window saw young mont sprawling over the table fleur with her cue akimbo was watching with a smile how pretty she looked no wonder that young fellow was out of his mind about her a titleland there was little enough in land these days perhaps less in a title the old forsytes had always had a kind of contempt for titles rather remote and artificial thingsnot worth the money they cost and having to do with the court they had all had that feeling in differing measuresoames remembered swithin indeed in his most expansive days had once attended a levee he had come away saying he shouldnt go againall that small fry it was suspected that he had looked too big in kneebreeches soames remembered how his own mother had wished to be presented because of the fashionable nature of the performance and how his father had put his foot down with unwonted decision what did she want with that peacockingwasting time and money there was nothing in it  the instinct which had made and kept the english commons the chief power in the state a feeling that their own world was good enough and a little better than any other because it was their world had kept the old forsytes singularly free of flummery as nicholas had been wont to call it when he had the gout soames generation more selfconscious and ironical had been saved by a sense of swithin in kneebreeches while the third and the fourth generation as it seemed to him laughed at everything  however there was no harm in the young fellows being heir to a title and estatea thing one couldnt help he entered quietly as mont missed his shot he noted the young mans eyes fixed on fleur bending over in her turn and the adoration in them almost touched him  she paused with the cue poised on the bridge of her slim hand and shook her crop of short dark chestnut hair  i shall never do it  nothing venture  all right the cue struck the ball rolled there  bad luck never mind  then they saw him and soames said  ill mark for you  he sat down on the raised seat beneath the marker trim and tired furtively studying those two young faces when the game was over mont came up to him  ive started in sir rum game business isnt it i suppose you saw a lot of human nature as a solicitor  i did  shall i tell you what ive noticed people are quite on the wrong tack in offering less than they can afford to give they ought to offer more and work backward  soames raised his eyebrows  suppose the more is accepted  that doesnt matter a little bit said mont its much more paying to abate a price than to increase it for instance say we offer an author good termshe naturally takes them then we go into it find we cant publish at a decent profit and tell him so hes got confidence in us because weve been generous to him and he comes down like a lamb and bears us no malice but if we offer him poor terms at the start he doesnt take them so we have to advance them to get him and he thinks us damned screws into the bargain  try buying pictures on that system said soames an offer accepted is a contracthavent you learned that  young mont turned his head to where fleur was standing in the window  no he said i wish i had then theres another thing always let a man off a bargain if he wants to be let off  as advertisement said soames dryly  of course it is but i meant on principle  does your firm work on those lines  not yet said mont but itll come  and they will go  no really sir im making any number of observations and they all confirm my theory human nature is consistently underrated in business people do themselves out of an awful lot of pleasure and profit by that of course you must be perfectly genuine and open but thats easy if you feel it the more human and generous you are the better chance youve got in business  soames rose  are you a partner  not for six months yet  the rest of the firm had better make haste and retire  mont laughed  youll see he said theres going to be a big change the possessive principle has got its shutters up  what said soames  the house is to let goodbye sir im off now  soames watched his daughter give her hand saw her wince at the squeeze it received and distinctly heard the young mans sigh as he passed out then she came from the window trailing her finger along the mahogany edge of the billiardtable watching her soames knew that she was going to ask him something her finger felt round the last pocket and she looked up  have you done anything to stop jon writing to me father  soames shook his head  you havent seen then he said his father died just a week ago today  oh  in her startled frowning face he saw the instant struggle to apprehend what this would mean  poor jon why didnt you tell me father  i never know said soames slowly you dont confide in me  i would if youd help me dear  perhaps i shall  fleur clasped her hands oh darlingwhen one wants a thing fearfully one doesnt think of other people dont be angry with me  soames put out his hand as if pushing away an aspersion  im cogitating he said what on earth had made him use a word like that has young mont been bothering you again  fleur smiled oh michael hes always bothering but hes such a good sorti dont mind him  well said soames im tired i shall go and have a nap before dinner  he went up to his picturegallery lay down on the couch there and closed his eyes a terrible responsibility this girl of hiswhose mother wasah what was she a terrible responsibility help herhow could he help her he could not alter the fact that he was her father or that irene what was it young mont had saidsome nonsense about the possessive instinctshutters upto let silly  the sultry air charged with a scent of meadowsweet of river and roses closed on his senses drowsing them     vthe fixed idea  the fixed idea which has outrun more constables than any other form of human disorder has never more speed and stamina than when it takes the avid guise of love to hedges and ditches and doors to humans without ideas fixed or otherwise to perambulators and the contents sucking their fixed ideas even to the other sufferers from this fast maladythe fixed idea of love pays no attention it runs with eyes turned inward to its own light oblivious of all other stars those with the fixed ideas that human happiness depends on their art on vivisecting dogs on hating foreigners on paying supertax on remaining ministers on making wheels go round on preventing their neighbours from being divorced on conscientious objection greek roots church dogma paradox and superiority to everybody else with other forms of egomaniaall are unstable compared with him or her whose fixed idea is the possession of some her or him and though fleur those chilly summer days pursued the scattered life of a little forsyte whose frocks are paid for and whose business is pleasure she wasas winifred would have said in the latest fashion of speechhonest to god indifferent to it all she wished and wished for the moon which sailed in cold skies above the river or the green park when she went to town she even kept jons letters covered with pink silk on her heart than which in days when corsets were so low sentiment so despised and chests so out of fashion there could perhaps have been no greater proof of the fixity of her idea  after hearing of his fathers death she wrote to jon and received his answer three days later on her return from a river picnic it was his first letter since their meeting at junes she opened it with misgiving and read it with dismay  since i saw you ive heard everything about the past i wont tell it youi think you knew when we met at junes she says you did if you did fleur you ought to have told me i expect you only heard your fathers side of it i have heard my mothers its dreadful now that shes so sad i cant do anything to hurt her more of course i long for you all day but i dont believe now that we shall ever come togethertheres something too strong pulling us apart  so her deception had found her out but jonshe felthad forgiven that it was what he said of his mother which caused the guttering in her heart and the weak sensation in her legs  her first impulse was to replyher second not to reply these impulses were constantly renewed in the days which followed while desperation grew within her she was not her fathers child for nothing the tenacity which had at once made and undone soames was her backbone too frilled and embroidered by french grace and quickness instinctively she conjugated the verb to have always with the pronoun i she concealed however all signs of her growing desperation and pursued such river pleasures as the winds and rain of a disagreeable july permitted as if she had no care in the world nor did any sucking baronet ever neglect the business of a publisher more consistently than her attendant spirit michael mont  to soames she was a puzzle he was almost deceived by this careless gaiety almostbecause he did not fail to mark her eyes often fixed on nothing and the film of light shining from her bedroom window late at night what was she thinking and brooding over into small hours when she ought to have been asleep but he dared not ask what was in her mind and since that one little talk in the billiardroom she said nothing to him  in this taciturn condition of affairs it chanced that winifred invited them to lunch and to go afterward to a most amusing little play the beggars opera and would they bring a man to make four soames whose attitude toward theatres was to go to nothing accepted because fleurs attitude was to go to everything they motored up taking michael mont who being in his seventh heaven was found by winifred very amusing the beggars opera puzzled soames the people were very unpleasant the whole thing very cynical winifred was intriguedby the dresses the music too did not displease her at the opera the night before she had arrived too early for the russian ballet and found the stage occupied by singers for a whole hour pale or apoplectic from terror lest by some dreadful inadvertence they might drop into a tune michael mont was enraptured with the whole thing and all three wondered what fleur was thinking of it but fleur was not thinking of it her fixed idea stood on the stage and sang with polly peachum mimed with filch danced with jenny diver postured with lucy lockit kissed trolled and cuddled with macheath her lips might smile her hands applaud but the comic old masterpiece made no more impression on her than if it had been pathetic like a modern revue when they embarked in the car to return she ached because jon was not sitting next her instead of michael mont when at some jolt the young mans arm touched hers as if by accident she only thought if that were jons arm when his cheerful voice tempered by her proximity murmured above the sound of the cars progress she smiled and answered thinking if that were jons voice and when once he said fleur you look a perfect angel in that dress she answered oh do you like it thinking if only jon could see it  during this drive she took a resolution she would go to robin hill and see himalone she would take the car without word beforehand to him or to her father it was nine days since his letter and she could wait no longer on monday she would go the decision made her well disposed toward young mont with something to look forward to she could afford to tolerate and respond he might stay to dinner propose to her as usual dance with her press her hand sighdo what he liked he was only a nuisance when he interfered with her fixed idea she was even sorry for him so far as it was possible to be sorry for anybody but herself just now at dinner he seemed to talk more wildly than usual about what he called the death of the close boroughshe paid little attention but her father seemed paying a good deal with the smile on his face which meant opposition if not anger  the younger generation doesnt think as you do sir does it fleur  fleur shrugged her shouldersthe younger generation was just jon and she did not know what he was thinking  young people will think as i do when theyre my age mr mont human nature doesnt change  i admit that sir but the forms of thought change with the times the pursuit of selfinterest is a form of thought thats going out  indeed to mind ones own business is not a form of thought mr mont its an instinct  yes when jon was the business  but what is ones business sir thats the point everybodys business is going to be ones business isnt it fleur  fleur only smiled  if not added young mont therell be blood  people have talked like that from time immemorial  but youll admit sir that the sense of property is dying out  i should say increasing among those who have none  well look at me im heir to an entailed estate i dont want the thing id cut the entail tomorrow  youre not married and you dont know what youre talking about  fleur saw the young mans eyes turn rather piteously upon her  do you really mean that marriage he began  society is built on marriage came from between her fathers close lips marriage and its consequences do you want to do away with it  young mont made a distracted gesture silence brooded over the dinner table covered with spoons bearing the forsyte cresta pheasant properunder the electric light in an alabaster globe and outside the river evening darkened charged with heavy moisture and sweet scents  monday thought fleur monday     videsperate  the weeks which followed the death of his father were sad and empty to the only jolyon forsyte left the necessary forms and ceremoniesthe reading of the will valuation of the estate distribution of the legacieswere enacted over the head as it were of one not yet of age jolyon was cremated by his special wish no one attended that ceremony or wore black for him the succession of his property controlled to some extent by old jolyons will left his widow in possession of robin hill with two thousand five hundred pounds a year for life apart from this the two wills worked together in some complicated way to insure that each of jolyons three children should have an equal share in their grandfathers and fathers property in the future as in the present save only that jon by virtue of his sex would have control of his capital when he was twentyone while june and holly would only have the spirit of theirs in order that their children might have the body after them if they had no children it would all come to jon if he outlived them and since june was fifty and holly nearly forty it was considered in lincolns inn fields that but for the cruelty of income tax young jon would be as warm a man as his grandfather when he died all this was nothing to jon and little enough to his mother it was june who did everything needful for one who had left his affairs in perfect order when she had gone and those two were alone again in the great house alone with death drawing them together and love driving them apart jon passed very painful days secretly disgusted and disappointed with himself his mother would look at him with such a patient sadness which yet had in it an instinctive pride as if she were reserving her defence if she smiled he was angry that his answering smile should be so grudging and unnatural he did not judge or condemn her that was all too remoteindeed the idea of doing so had never come to him no he was grudging and unnatural because he couldnt have what he wanted because of her there was one alleviationmuch to do in connection with his fathers career which could not be safely entrusted to june though she had offered to undertake it both jon and his mother had felt that if she took his portfolios unexhibited drawings and unfinished matter away with her the work would encounter such icy blasts from paul post and other frequenters of her studio that it would soon be frozen out even of her warm heart on its oldfashioned plane and of its kind the work was good and they could not bear the thought of its subjection to ridicule a oneman exhibition of his work was the least testimony they could pay to one they had loved and on preparation for this they spent many hours together jon came to have a curiously increased respect for his father the quiet tenacity with which he had converted a mediocre talent into something really individual was disclosed by these researches there was a great mass of work with a rare continuity of growth in depth and reach of vision nothing certainly went very deep or reached very highbut such as the work was it was thorough conscientious and complete and remembering his fathers utter absence of side or selfassertion the chaffing humility with which he had always spoken of his own efforts ever calling himself an amateur jon could not help feeling that he had never really known his father to take himself seriously yet never  that he did so seemed to have been his ruling principle there was something in this which appealed to the boy and made him heartily endorse his mothers comment he had true refinement he couldnt help thinking of others whatever he did and when he took a resolution which went counter he did it with the minimum of defiancenot like the age is it twice in his life he had to go against everything and yet it never made him bitter jon saw tears running down her face which she at once turned away from him she was so quiet about her loss that sometimes he had thought she didnt feel it much now as he looked at her he felt how far he fell short of the reserve power and dignity in both his father and his mother and stealing up to her he put his arm round her waist she kissed him swiftly but with a sort of passion and went out of the room  the studio where they had been sorting and labelling had once been hollys schoolroom devoted to her silkworms dried lavender music and other forms of instruction now at the end of july despite its northern and eastern aspects a warm and slumberous air came in between the longfaded lilac linen curtains to redeem a little the departed glory as of a field that is golden and gone clinging to a room which its master has left irene had placed on the paintstained table a bowl of red roses this and jolyons favourite cat who still clung to the deserted habitat were the pleasant spots in that dishevelled sad workroom jon at the north window sniffing air mysteriously scented with warm strawberries heard a car drive up the lawyers again about some nonsense why did that scent so make one ache and where did it come fromthere were no strawberry beds on this side of the house instinctively he took a crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket and wrote down some broken words a warmth began spreading in his chest he rubbed the palms of his hands together presently he had jotted this  if i could make a little song a little song to soothe my heart id make it all of little things the plash of water rub of wings the puffingoff of dandies crown the hiss of raindrop spilling down the purr of cat the trill of bird and evry whispering ive heard from willy wind in leaves and grass and all the distant drones that pass a song as tender and as light as flower or butterfly in flight and when i saw it opening id let it fly and sing  he was still muttering it over to himself at the window when he heard his name called and turning round saw fleur at that amazing apparition he made at first no movement and no sound while her clear vivid glance ravished his heart then he went forward to the table saying how nice of you to come and saw her flinch as if he had thrown something at her  i asked for you she said and they showed me up here but i can go away again  jon clutched the paintstained table her face and figure in its frilly frock photographed itself with such startling vividness upon his eyes that if she had sunk through the floor he must still have seen her  i know i told you a lie jon but i told it out of love  yes oh yes thats nothing  i didnt answer your letter what was the usethere wasnt anything to answer i wanted to see you instead she held out both her hands and jon grasped them across the table he tried to say something but all his attention was given to trying not to hurt her hands his own felt so hard and hers so soft she said almost defiantly  that old storywas it so very dreadful  yes in his voice too there was a note of defiance  she dragged her hands away i didnt think in these days boys were tied to their mothers apronstrings  jons chin went up as if he had been struck  oh i didnt mean it jon what a horrible thing to say swiftly she came close to him jon dear i didnt mean it  all right  she had put her two hands on his shoulder and her forehead down on them the brim of her hat touched his neck and he felt it quivering but in a sort of paralysis he made no response she let go of his shoulder and drew away  well ill go if you dont want me but i never thought youd have given me up  i havent cried jon coming suddenly to life i cant ill try again  her eyes gleamed she swayed toward him joni love you dont give me up if you do i dont know whati feel so desperate what does it matterall that pastcompared with this  she clung to him he kissed her eyes her cheeks her lips but while he kissed her he saw the sheets of that letter fallen down on the floor of his bedroomhis fathers white dead facehis mother kneeling before it fleurs whispered make her promise oh jon try seemed childish in his ear he felt curiously old  i promise he muttered only you dont understand  she wants to spoil our lives just because  yes of what  again that challenge in his voice and she did not answer her arms tightened round him and he returned her kisses but even while he yielded the poison worked in him the poison of the letter fleur did not know she did not understandshe misjudged his mother she came from the enemys camp so lovely and he loved her soyet even in her embrace he could not help the memory of hollys words i think she has a having nature and his mothers my darling boy dont think of methink of yourself  when she was gone like a passionate dream leaving her image on his eyes her kisses on his lips such an ache in his heart jon leaned in the window listening to the car bearing her away still the scent as of warm strawberries still the little summer sounds that should make his song still all the promise of youth and happiness in sighing floating fluttering julyand his heart torn yearning strong in him hope high in him yet with its eyes cast down as if ashamed the miserable task before him if fleur was desperate so was hewatching the poplars swaying the white clouds passing the sunlight on the grass  he waited till evening till after their almost silent dinner till his mother had played to him and still he waited feeling that she knew what he was waiting to say she kissed him and went upstairs and still he lingered watching the moonlight and the moths and that unreality of colouring which steals along and stains a summer night and he would have given anything to be back again in the pastbarely three months back or away forward years in the future the present with this dark cruelty of a decision one way or the other seemed impossible he realised now so much more keenly what his mother felt than he had at first as if the story in that letter had been a poisonous germ producing a kind of fever of partisanship so that he really felt there were two camps his mothers and hisfleurs and her fathers it might be a dead thing that old tragic ownership and enmity but dead things were poisonous till time had cleaned them away even his love felt tainted less illusioned more of the earth and with a treacherous lurking doubt lest fleur like her father might want to own not articulate just a stealing haunt horribly unworthy which crept in and about the ardour of his memories touched with its tarnishing breath the vividness and grace of that charmed face and figurea doubt not real enough to convince him of its presence just real enough to deflower a perfect faith and perfect faith to jon not yet twenty was essential he still had youths eagerness to give with both hands to take with neitherto give lovingly to one who had his own impulsive generosity surely she had he got up from the windowseat and roamed in the big grey ghostly room whose walls were hung with silvered canvas this house his father said in that deathbed letterhad been built for his mother to live inwith fleurs father he put out his hand in the halfdark as if to grasp the shadowy hand of the dead he clenched trying to feel the thin vanished fingers of his father to squeeze them and reassure him that hehe was on his fathers side tears prisoned within him made his eyes feel dry and hot he went back to the window it was warmer not so eerie more comforting outside where the moon hung golden three days off full the freedom of the night was comforting if only fleur and he had met on some desert island without a pastand nature for their house jon had still his high regard for desert islands where breadfruit grew and the water was blue above the coral the night was deep was freethere was enticement in it a lure a promise a refuge from entanglement and love milksop tied to his mothers his cheeks burned he shut the window drew curtains over it switched off the lighted sconce and went upstairs  the door of his room was open the light turned up his mother still in her evening gown was standing at the window she turned and said  sit down jon lets talk she sat down on the windowseat jon on his bed she had her profile turned to him and the beauty and grace of her figure the delicate line of the brow the nose the neck the strange and as it were remote refinement of her moved him his mother never belonged to her surroundings she came into them from somewhereas it were what was she going to say to him who had in his heart such things to say to her  i know fleur came today im not surprised it was as though she had added she is her fathers daughter and jons heart hardened irene went on quietly  i have fathers letter i picked it up that night and kept it would you like it back dear  jon shook his head  i had read it of course before he gave it to you it didnt quite do justice to my criminality  mother burst from jons lips  he put it very sweetly but i know that in marrying fleurs father without love i did a dreadful thing an unhappy marriage jon can play such havoc with other lives besides ones own you are fearfully young my darling and fearfully loving do you think you can possibly be happy with this girl  staring at her dark eyes darker now from pain jon answered  yes oh yesif you could be  irene smiled  admiration of beauty and longing for possession are not love if yours were another case like mine jonwhere the deepest things are stifled the flesh joined and the spirit at war  why should it mother you think she must be like her father but shes not ive seen him  again the smile came on irenes lips and in jon something wavered there was such irony and experience in that smile  you are a giver jon she is a taker  that unworthy doubt that haunting uncertainty again he said with vehemence  she isntshe isnt its only because i cant bear to make you unhappy mother now that father he thrust his fists against his forehead  irene got up  i told you that night dear not to mind me i meant it think of yourself and your own happiness i can stand whats leftive brought it on myself  again the word mother burst from jons lips  she came over to him and put her hands over his  do you feel your head darling  jon shook it what he felt was in his chesta sort of tearing asunder of the tissue there by the two loves  i shall always love you the same jon whatever you do you wont lose anything she smoothed his hair gently and walked away  he heard the door shut and rolling over on the bed lay stifling his breath with an awful heldup feeling within him     viiembassy  enquiring for her at tea time soames learned that fleur had been out in the car since two three hours where had she gone up to london without a word to him he had never become quite reconciled with cars he had embraced them in principlelike the born empiricist or forsyte that he wasadopting each symptom of progress as it came along with well we couldnt do without them now but in fact he found them tearing great smelly things obliged by annette to have onea rollhard with pearlgrey cushions electric light little mirrors trays for the ashes of cigarettes flower vasesall smelling of petrol and stephanotishe regarded it much as he used to regard his brotherinlaw montague dartie the thing typified all that was fast insecure and subcutaneously oily in modern life as modern life became faster looser younger soames was becoming older slower tighter more and more in thought and language like his father james before him he was almost aware of it himself pace and progress pleased him less and less there was an ostentation too about a car which he considered provocative in the prevailing mood of labour on one occasion that fellow sims had driven over the only vested interest of a working man soames had not forgotten the behaviour of its master when not many people would have stopped to put up with it he had been sorry for the dog and quite prepared to take its part against the car if that ruffian hadnt been so outrageous with four hours fast becoming five and still no fleur all the old carwise feelings he had experienced in person and by proxy balled within him and sinking sensations troubled the pit of his stomach at seven he telephoned to winifred by trunk call no fleur had not been to green street then where was she visions of his beloved daughter rolled up in her pretty frills all blood and duststained in some hideous catastrophe began to haunt him he went to her room and spied among her things she had taken nothingno dressingcase no jewellery and this a relief in one sense increased his fears of an accident terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing especially when he couldnt bear fuss or publicity of any kind what should he do if she were not back by nightfall  at a quarter to eight he heard the car a great weight lifted from off his heart he hurried down she was getting outpale and tiredlooking but nothing wrong he met her in the hall  youve frightened me where have you been  to robin hill im sorry dear i had to go ill tell you afterward and with a flying kiss she ran upstairs  soames waited in the drawingroom to robin hill what did that portend  it was not a subject they could discuss at dinnerconsecrated to the susceptibilities of the butler the agony of nerves soames had been through the relief he felt at her safety softened his power to condemn what she had done or resist what she was going to do he waited in a relaxed stupor for her revelation life was a queer business there he was at sixtyfive and no more in command of things than if he had not spent forty years in building up securityalways something one couldnt get on terms with in the pocket of his dinnerjacket was a letter from annette she was coming back in a fortnight he knew nothing of what she had been doing out there and he was glad that he did not her absence had been a relief out of sight was out of mind and now she was coming back another worry and the bolderby old crome was gonedumetrius had got itall because that anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts he furtively remarked the strained look on his daughters face as if she too were gazing at a picture that she couldnt buy he almost wished the war back worries didnt seem then quite so worrying from the caress in her voice the look on her face he became certain that she wanted something from him uncertain whether it would be wise of him to give it her he pushed his savoury away uneaten and even joined her in a cigarette  after dinner she set the electric pianoplayer going and he augured the worst when she sat down on a cushion footstool at his knee and put her hand on his  darling be nice to me i had to see jonhe wrote to me hes going to try what he can do with his mother but ive been thinking its really in your hands father if youd persuade her that it doesnt mean renewing the past in any way that i shall stay yours and jon will stay hers that you need never see him or her and she need never see you or me only you could persuade her dear because only you could promise one cant promise for other people surely it wouldnt be too awkward for you to see her just this once now that jons father is dead  too awkward soames repeated the whole things preposterous  you know said fleur without looking up you wouldnt mind seeing her really  soames was silent her words had expressed a truth too deep for him to admit she slipped her fingers between his ownhot slim eager they clung there this child of his would corkscrew her way into a brick wall  what am i to do if you wont father she said very softly  ill do anything for your happiness said soanies but this isnt for your happiness  oh it is it is  itll only stir things up he said grimly  but they are stirred up the thing is to quiet them to make her feel that this is just our lives and has nothing to do with yours or hers you can do it father i know you can  you know a great deal then was soames glum answer  if you will jon and i will wait a yeartwo years if you like  it seems to me murmured soames that you care nothing about what i feel  fleur pressed his hand against her cheek  i do darling but you wouldnt like me to be awfully miserable  how she wheedled to get her ends and trying with all his might to think she really cared for himhe was not surenot sure all she cared for was this boy why should he help her to get this boy who was killing her affection for himself why should he by the laws of the forsytes it was foolish there was nothing to be had out of itnothing to give her to that boy to pass her into the enemys camp under the influence of the woman who had injured him so deeply slowlyinevitablyhe would lose this flower of his life and suddenly he was conscious that his hand was wet his heart gave a little painful jump he couldnt bear her to cry he put his other hand quickly over hers and a tear dropped on that too he couldnt go on like this well well he said ill think it over and do what i can come come if she must have it for her happinessshe must he couldnt refuse to help her and lest she should begin to thank him he got out of his chair and went up to the pianoplayermaking that noise it ran down as he reached it with a faint buzz that musical box of his nursery days the harmonious blacksmith glorious portthe thing had always made him miserable when his mother set it going on sunday afternoons here it was againthe same thing only larger more expensive and now it played the wild wild women and the policemans holiday and he was no longer in black velvet with a sky blue collar profonds right he thought theres nothing in it were all progressing to the grave and with that surprising mental comment he walked out  he did not see fleur again that night but at breakfast her eyes followed him about with an appeal he could not escapenot that he intended to try no he had made up his mind to the nerveracking business he would go to robin hillto that house of memories pleasant memorythe last of going down to keep that boys father and irene apart by threatening divorce he had often thought since that it had clinched their union and now he was going to clinch the union of that boy with his girl i dont know what ive done he thought to have such things thrust on me he went up by train and down by train and from the station walked by the long rising lane still very much as he remembered it over thirty years ago funnyso near london some one evidently was holding on to the land there this speculation soothed him moving between the high hedges slowly so as not to get overheated though the day was chill enough after all was said and done there was something real about land it didnt shift land and good pictures the values might fluctuate a bit but on the whole they were always going upworth holding on to in a world where there was such a lot of unreality cheap building changing fashions such a here today and gone tomorrow spirit the french were right perhaps with their peasant proprietorship though he had no opinion of the french ones bit of land something solid in it he had heard peasant proprietors described as a pigheaded lot had heard young mont call his father a pigheaded morning posterdisrespectful young devil well there were worse things than being pigheaded or reading the morning post there was profond and his tribe and all these labour chaps and loudmouthed politicians and wild wild women a lot of worse things and suddenly soames became conscious of feeling weak and hot and shaky sheer nerves at the meeting before him as aunt juley might have saidquoting superior dossethis nerves were in a proper fautigue he could see the house now among its trees the house he had watched being built intending it for himself and this woman who by such strange fate had lived in it with another after all he began to think of dumetrius local loans and other forms of investment he could not afford to meet her with his nerves all shaking he who represented the day of judgment for her on earth as it was in heaven he legal ownership personified meeting lawless beauty incarnate his dignity demanded impassivity during this embassy designed to link their offspring who if she had behaved herself would have been brother and sister that wretched tune the wild wild women kept running in his head perversely for tunes did not run there as a rule passing the poplars in front of the house he thought how theyve grown i had them planted a maid answered his ring  will you saymr forsyte on a very special matter  if she realised who he was quite probably she would not see him by george he thought hardening as the tug came its a topsyturvy affair  the maid came back would the gentleman state his business please  say it concerns mr jon said soames  and once more he was alone in that hall with the pool of greywhite marble designed by her first lover ah she had been a bad lothad loved two men and not himself he must remember that when he came face to face with her once more and suddenly he saw her in the opening chink between the long heavy purple curtains swaying as if in hesitation the old perfect poise and line the old startled darkeyed gravity the old calm defensive voice will you come in please  he passed through that opening as in the picturegallery and the confectioners shop she seemed to him still beautiful and this was the first timethe very firstsince he married her sevenandthirty years ago that he was speaking to her without the legal right to call her his she was not wearing blackone of that fellows radical notions he supposed  i apologise for coming he said glumly but this business must be settled one way or the other  wont you sit down  no thank you  anger at his false position impatience of ceremony between them mastered him and words came tumbling out  its an infernal mischance ive done my best to discourage it i consider my daughter crazy but ive got into the habit of indulging her thats why im here i suppose youre fond of your son  devotedly  well  it rests with him  he had a sense of being met and baffled alwaysalways she had baffled him even in those old first married days  its a mad notion he said  it is  if you had only wellthey might have been he did not finish that sentence brother and sister and all this saved but he saw her shudder as if he had and stung by the sight he crossed over to the window out there the trees had not grownthey couldnt they were old  so far as im concerned he said you may make your mind easy i desire to see neither you nor your son if this marriage comes about young people in these days areare unaccountable but i cant bear to see my daughter unhappy what am i to say to her when i go back  please say to her as i said to you that it rests with jon  you dont oppose it  with all my heart not with my lips  soames stood biting his finger  i remember an evening he said suddenly and was silent what was therewhat was there in this woman that would not fit into the four corners of his hate or condemnation where is heyour son  up in his fathers studio i think  perhaps youd have him down  he watched her ring the bell he watched the maid come in  please tell mr jon that i want him  if it rests with him said soames hurriedly when the maid was gone i suppose i may take it for granted that this unnatural marriage will take place in that case therell be formalities whom do i deal withherrings  irene nodded  you dont propose to live with them  irene shook her head  what happens to this house  it will be as jon wishes  this house said soames suddenly i had hopes when i began it if they live in ittheir children they say theres such a thing as nemesis do you believe in it  yes  oh you do  he had come back from the window and was standing close to her who in the curve of her grand piano was as it were embayed  im not likely to see you again he said slowly will you shake handshis lip quivered the words came out jerkilyand let the past die he held out his hand her pale face grew paler her eyes so dark rested immovably on his her hands remained clasped in front of her he heard a sound and turned that boy was standing in the opening of the curtains very queer he looked hardly recognisable as the young fellow he had seen in the gallery off cork streetvery queer much older no youth in the face at allhaggard rigid his hair ruffled his eyes deep in his head soames made an effort and said with a lift of his lip not quite a smile nor quite a sneer  well young man im here for my daughter it rests with you it seemsthis matter your mother leaves it in your hands  the boy continued staring at his mothers face and made no answer  for my daughters sake ive brought myself to come said soames what am i to say to her when i go back  still looking at his mother the boy said quietly  tell fleur that its no good please i must do as my father wished before he died  jon  its all right mother  in a kind of stupefaction soames looked from one to the other then taking up hat and umbrella which he had put down on a chair he walked toward the curtains the boy stood aside for him to go by he passed through and heard the grate of the rings as the curtains were drawn behind him the sound liberated something in his chest  so thats that he thought and passed out of the front door     viiithe dark tune  as soames walked away from the house at robin hill the sun broke through the grey of that chill afternoon in smoky radiance so absorbed in landscape painting that he seldom looked seriously for effects of nature out of doorshe was struck by that moody effulgenceit mourned with a triumph suited to his own feeling victory in defeat his embassy had come to naught but he was rid of those people had regained his daughter at the expense ofher happiness what would fleur say to him would she believe he had done his best and under that sunlight faring on the elms hazels hollies of the lane and those unexploited fields soames felt dread she would be terribly upset he must appeal to her pride that boy had given her up declared part and lot with the woman who so long ago had given her father up soames clenched his hands given him up and why what had been wrong with him and once more he felt the malaise of one who contemplates himself as seen by anotherlike a dog who chances on his refection in a mirror and is intrigued and anxious at the unseizable thing  not in a hurry to get home he dined in town at the connoisseurs while eating a pear it suddenly occurred to him that if he had not gone down to robin hill the boy might not have so decided he remembered the expression on his face while his mother was refusing the hand he had held out a strange an awkward thought had fleur cooked her own goose by trying to make too sure  he reached home at halfpast nine while the car was passing in at one drive gate he heard the grinding sputter of a motorcycle passing out by the other young mont no doubt so fleur had not been lonely but he went in with a sinking heart in the creampanelled drawingroom she was sitting with her elbows on her knees and her chin on her clasped hands in front of a white camellia plant which filled the fireplace that glance at her before she saw him renewed his dread what was she seeing among those white camellias  well father  soames shook his head his tongue failed him this was murderous work he saw her eyes dilate her lips quivering  what what quick father  my dear said soames ii did my best but and again he shook his head  fleur ran to him and put a hand on each of his shoulders  she  no muttered soames he i was to tell you that it was no use he must do what his father wished before he died he caught her by the waist come child dont let them hurt you theyre not worth your little finger  fleur tore herself from his grasp  you didnt youcouldnt have tried youyou betrayed me father  bitterly wounded soames gazed at her passionate figure writhing there in front of him  you didnt tryyou didnti was a fool i wont believe he couldhe ever could only yesterday he oh why did i ask you  yes said soames quietly why did you i swallowed my feelings i did my best for you against my judgmentand this is my reward goodnight  with every nerve in his body twitching he went toward the door  fleur darted after him  he gives me up you mean that father  soames turned and forced himself to answer  yes  oh cried fleur what did youwhat could you have done in those old days  the breathless sense of really monstrous injustice cut the power of speech in soames throat what had he done what had they done to him  and with quite unconscious dignity he put his hand on his breast and looked at her  its a shame cried fleur passionately  soames went out he mounted slow and icy to his picture gallery and paced among his treasures outrageous oh outrageous she was spoiled ah and who had spoiled her he stood still before the goya copy accustomed to her own way in everything flower of his life and now that she couldnt have it he turned to the window for some air daylight was dying the moon rising gold behind the poplars what sound was that why that piano thing a dark tune with a thrum and a throb she had set it goingwhat comfort could she get from that his eyes caught movement down there beyond the lawn under the trellis of rambler roses and young acaciatrees where the moonlight fell there she was roaming up and down his heart gave a little sickening jump what would she do under this blow how could he tell what did he know of herhe had only loved her all his lifelooked on her as the apple of his eye he knew nothinghad no notion there she wasand that dark tuneand the river gleaming in the moonlight  i must go out he thought  he hastened down to the drawingroom lighted just as he had left it with the piano thrumming out that waltz or foxtrot or whatever they called it in these days and passed through on to the verandah  where could he watch without her seeing him and he stole down through the fruit garden to the boathouse he was between her and the river now and his heart felt lighter she was his daughter and annettesshe wouldnt do anything foolish but there it washe didnt know from the boat house window he could see the last acacia and the spin of her skirt when she turned in her restless march that tune had run down at lastthank goodness he crossed the floor and looked through the farther window at the water slowflowing past the lilies it made little bubbles against them bright where a moonstreak fell he remembered suddenly that early morning when he had slept on the houseboat after his father died and she had just been bornnearly nineteen years ago even now he recalled the unaccustomed world when he woke up the strange feeling it had given him that day the second passion of his life beganfor this girl of his roaming under the acacias what a comfort she had been to him and all the soreness and sense of outrage left him if he could make her happy again he didnt care an owl flew queeking queeking a bat flitted by the moonlight brightened and broadened on the water how long was she going to roam about like this he went back to the window and suddenly saw her coming down to the bank she stood quite close on the landingstage and soames watched clenching his hands should he speak to her his excitement was intense the stillness of her figure its youth its absorption in despair in longing initself he would always remember it moonlit like that and the faint sweet reek of the river and the shivering of the willow leaves she had everything in the world that he could give her except the one thing that she could not have because of him the perversity of things hurt him at that moment as might a fishbone in his throat  then with an infinite relief he saw her turn back toward the house what could he give her to make amends pearls travel horses other young menanything she wantedthat he might lose the memory of her young figure lonely by the water there she had set that tune going again whyit was a mania dark thrumming faint travelling from the house it was as though she had said if i cant have something to keep me going i shall die of this soames dimly understood well if it helped her let her keep it thrumming on all night and mousing back through the fruit garden he regained the verandah though he meant to go in and speak to her now he still hesitated not knowing what to say trying hard to recall how it felt to be thwarted in love he ought to know ought to rememberand he could not goneall real recollection except that it had hurt him horribly in this blankness he stood passing his handkerchief over hands and lips which were very dry by craning his head he could just see fleur standing with her back to that piano still grinding out its tune her arms tight crossed on her breast a lighted cigarette between her lips whose smoke half veiled her face the expression on it was strange to soames the eyes shone and stared and every feature was alive with a sort of wretched scorn and anger once or twice he had seen annette look like thatthe face was too vivid too naked not his daughters at that moment and he dared not go in realising the futility of any attempt at consolation he sat down in the shadow of the inglenook  monstrous trick that fate had played him nemesis that old unhappy marriage and in gods namewhy how was he to know when he wanted irene so violently and she consented to be his that she would never love him the tune died and was renewed and died again and still soames sat in the shadow waiting for he knew not what the fag of fleurs cigarette flung through the window fell on the grass he watched it glowing burning itself out the moon had freed herself above the poplars and poured her unreality on the garden comfortless light mysterious withdrawnlike the beauty of that woman who had never loved himdappling the nemesias and the stocks with a vesture not of earth flowers and his flower so unhappy ah why could one not put happiness into local loans gild its edges insure it against going down  light had ceased to flow out now from the drawingroom window all was silent and dark in there had she gone up he rose and tiptoeing peered in it seemed so he entered the verandah kept the moonlight out and at first he could see nothing but the outlines of furniture blacker than the darkness he groped toward the farther window to shut it his foot struck a chair and he heard a gasp there she was curled and crushed into the corner of the sofa his hand hovered did she want his consolation he stood gazing at that ball of crushed frills and hair and graceful youth trying to burrow its way out of sorrow how leave her there at last he touched her hair and said  come darling better go to bed ill make it up to you somehow how fatuous but what could he have said     ixunder the oaktree  when their visitor had disappeared jon and his mother stood without speaking till he said suddenly  i ought to have seen him out  but soames was already walking down the drive and jon went upstairs to his fathers studio not trusting himself to go back  the expression on his mothers face confronting the man she had once been married to had sealed a resolution growing within him ever since she left him the night before it had put the finishing touch of reality to marry fleur would be to hit his mother in the face to betray his dead father it was no good jon had the least resentful of natures he bore his parents no grudge in this hour of his distress for one so young there was a rather strange power in him of seeing things in some sort of proportion it was worse for fleur worse for his mother even than it was for him harder than to give up was to be given up or to be the cause of some one you loved giving up for you he must not would not behave grudgingly while he stood watching the tardy sunlight he had again that sudden vision of the world which had come to him the night before sea on sea country on country millions on millions of people all with their own lives energies joys griefs and sufferingall with things they had to give up and separate struggles for existence even though he might be willing to give up all else for the one thing he couldnt have he would be a fool to think his feelings mattered much in so vast a world and to behave like a crybaby or a cad he pictured the people who had nothingthe millions who had given up life in the war the millions whom the war had left with life and little else the hungry children he had read of the shattered men people in prison every kind of unfortunate andthey did not help him much if one had to miss a meal what comfort in the knowledge that many others had to miss it too there was more distraction in the thought of getting away out into this vast world of which he knew nothing yet he could not go on staying here walled in and sheltered with everything so slick and comfortable and nothing to do but brood and think what might have been he could not go back to wansdon and the memories of fleur if he saw her again he could not trust himself and if he stayed here or went back there he would surely see her while they were within reach of each other that must happen to go far away and quickly was the only thing to do but however much he loved his mother he did not want to go away with her then feeling that was brutal he made up his mind desperately to propose that they should go to italy for two hours in that melancholy room he tried to master himself then dressed solemnly for dinner  his mother had done the same they ate little at some length and talked of his fathers catalogue the show was arranged for october and beyond clerical detail there was nothing more to do  after dinner she put on a cloak and they went out walked a little talked a little till they were standing silent at last beneath the oaktree ruled by the thought if i show anything i show all jon put his arm through hers and said quite casually  mother lets go to italy  irene pressed his arm and said as casually  it would be very nice but ive been thinking you ought to see and do more than you would if i were with you  but then youd be alone  i was once alone for more than twelve years besides i should like to be here for the opening of fathers show  jons grip tightened round her arm he was not deceived  you couldnt stay here all by yourself its too big  not here perhaps in london and i might go to paris after the show opens you ought to have a year at least jon and see the world  yes id like to see the world and rough it but i dont want to leave you all alone  my dear i owe you that at least if its for your good itll be for mine why not start tomorrow youve got your passport  yes if im going it had better be at once onlymotherifif i wanted to stay out somewhereamerica or anywhere would you mind coming presently  wherever and whenever you send for me but dont send until you really want me  jon drew a deep breath  i feel englands choky  they stood a few minutes longer under the oaktreelooking out to where the grand stand at epsom was veiled in evening the branches kept the moonlight from them so that it only fell everywhere elseover the fields and far away and on the windows of the creepered house behind which soon would be to let     xfleurs wedding  the october paragraphs describing the wedding of fleur forsyte to michael mont hardly conveyed the symbolic significance of this event in the union of the greatgranddaughter of superior dosset with the heir of a ninth baronet was the outward and visible sign of that merger of class in class which buttresses the political stability of a realm the time had come when the forsytes might resign their natural resentment against a flummery not theirs by birth and accept it as the still more natural due of their possessive instincts besides they had to mount to make room for all those so much more newly rich in that quiet but tasteful ceremony in hanover square and afterward among the furniture in green street it had been impossible for those not in the know to distinguish the forsyte troop from the mont contingentso far away was superior dosset now was there in the crease of his trousers the expression of his moustache his accent or the shine on his tophat a pin to choose between soames and the ninth baronet himself was not fleur as selfpossessed quick glancing pretty and hard as the likeliest muskham mont or charwell filly present if anything the forsytes had it in dress and looks and manners they had become upper class and now their name would be formally recorded in the stud book their money joined to land whether this was a little late in the day and those rewards of the possessive instinct lands and money destined for the meltingpotwas still a question so moot that it was not mooted after all timothy had said consols were goin up timothy the last the missing link timothy in extremis on the bayswater roadso francie had reported it was whispered too that this young mont was a sort of socialiststrangely wise of him and in the nature of insurance considering the days they lived in there was no uneasiness on that score the landed classes produced that sort of amiable foolishness at times turned to safe uses and confined to theory as george remarked to his sister francie theyll soon be having puppiesthatll give him pause  the church with white flowers and something blue in the middle of the east window looked extremely chaste as though endeavouring to counteract the somewhat lurid phraseology of a service calculated to keep the thoughts of all on puppies forsytes haymans tweetymans sat in the left aisle monts charwells muskhams in the right while a sprinkling of fleurs fellowsufferers at school and of monts fellowsufferers in the war gaped indiscriminately from either side and three maiden ladies who had dropped in on their way from skywards brought up the rear together with two mont retainers and fleurs old nurse in the unsettled state of the country as full a house as could be expected  mrs val dartie who sat with her husband in the third row squeezed his hand more than once during the performance to her who knew the plot of this tragicomedy its most dramatic moment was wellnigh painful i wonder if jon knows by instinct she thoughtjon out in british columbia she had received a letter from him only that morning which had made her smile and say  jons in british columbia val because he wants to be in california he thinks its too nice there  oh said val so hes beginning to see a joke again  hes bought some land and sent for his mother  what on earth will she do out there  all she cares about is jon do you still think it a happy release  vals shrewd eyes narrowed to grey pinpoints between their dark lashes  fleur wouldnt have suited him a bit shes not bred right  poor little fleur sighed holly ah it was strangethis marriage the young man mont had caught her on the rebound of course in the reckless mood of one whose ship has just gone down such a plunge could not but beas val put itan outside chance there was little to be told from the back view of her young cousins veil and hollys eyes reviewed the general aspect of this christian wedding she who had made a lovematch which had been successful had a horror of unhappy marriages this might not be one in the endbut it was clearly a tossup and to consecrate a tossup in this fashion with manufactured unction before a crowd of fashionable freethinkersfor who thought otherwise than freely or not at all when they were dolled upseemed to her as near a sin as one could find in an age which had abolished them her eyes wandered from the prelate in his robes a charwellthe forsytes had not as yet produced a prelate to val beside her thinkingshe was certainof the mayfly filly at fifteen to one for the cambridgeshire they passed on and caught the profile of the ninth baronet in counterfeitment of the kneeling process she could just see the neat ruck above his knees where he had pulled his trousers up and thought vals forgotten to pull up his her eyes passed to the pew in front of her where winifreds substantial form was gowned with passion and on again to soames and annette kneeling side by side a little smile came on her lipsprosper profond back from the south seas of the channel would be kneeling too about six rows behind yes this was a funny small business however it turned out still it was in a proper church and would be in the proper papers tomorrow morning  they had begun a hymn she could hear the ninth baronet across the aisle singing of the hosts of midian her little finger touched vals thumbthey were holding the same hymnbookand a tiny thrill passed through her preservedfrom twenty years ago he stooped and whispered  i say dyou remember the rat the rat at their wedding in cape colony which had cleaned its whiskers behind the table at the registrars and between her little and third forgers she squeezed his thumb hard  the hymn was over the prelate had begun to deliver his discourse he told them of the dangerous times they lived in and the awful conduct of the house of lords in connection with divorce they were all soldiershe saidin the trenches under the poisonous gas of the prince of darkness and must be manful the purpose of marriage was children not mere sinful happiness  an imp danced in hollys eyesvals eyelashes were meeting whatever happened he must not snore her finger and thumb closed on his thigh till he stirred uneasily  the discourse was over the danger past they were signing in the vestry and general relaxation had set in  a voice behind her said  will she stay the course  whos that she whispered  old george forsyte  holly demurely scrutinized one of whom she had often heard fresh from south africa and ignorant of her kith and kin she never saw one without an almost childish curiosity he was very big and very dapper his eyes gave her a funny feeling of having no particular clothes  theyre off she heard him say  they came stepping from the chancel holly looked first in young monts face his lips and ears were twitching his eyes shifting from his feet to the hand within his arm stared suddenly before them as if to face a firing party he gave holly the feeling that he was spiritually intoxicated but fleur ah that was different the girl was perfectly composed prettier than ever in her white robes and veil over her banged dark chestnut hair her eyelids hovered demure over her dark hazel eyes outwardly she seemed all there but inwardly where was she as those two passed fleur raised her eyelidsthe restless glint of those clear whites remained on hollys vision as might the flutter of caged birds wings  in green street winifred stood to receive just a little less composed than usual soames request for the use of her house had come on her at a deeply psychological moment under the influence of a remark of prosper profond she had begun to exchange her empire for expressionistic furniture there were the most amusing arrangements with violet green and orange blobs and scriggles to be had at mealards another month and the change would have been complete just now the very intriguing recruits she had enlisted did not march too well with the old guard it was as if her regiment were half in khaki half in scarlet and bearskins but her strong and comfortable character made the best of it in a drawingroom which typified perhaps more perfectly than she imagined the semibolshevized imperialism of her country after all this was a day of merger and you couldnt have too much of it her eyes travelled indulgently among her guests soames had gripped the back of a buhl chair young mont was behind that awfully amusing screen which no one as yet had been able to explain to her the ninth baronet had shied violently at a round scarlet table inlaid under glass with blue australian butteries wings and was clinging to her louisquinze cabinet francie forsyte had seized the new mantelboard finely carved with little purple grotesques on an ebony ground george over by the old spinet was holding a little skyblue book as if about to enter bets prosper profond was twiddling the knob of the open door black with peacockblue panels and annettes hands close by were grasping her own waist two muskhams clung to the balcony among the plants as if feeling ill lady mont thin and bravelooking had taken up her longhandled glasses and was gazing at the central light shade of ivory and orange dashed with deep magenta as if the heavens had opened everybody in fact seemed holding on to something only fleur still in her bridal dress was detached from all support flinging her words and glances to left and right  the room was full of the bubble and the squeak of conversation nobody could hear anything that anybody said which seemed of little consequence since no one waited for anything so slow as an answer modern conversation seemed to winifred so different from the days of her prime when a drawl was all the vogue still it was amusing which of course was all that mattered even the forsytes were talking with extreme rapidityfleur and christopher and imogen and young nicholass youngest patrick soames of course was silent but george by the spinet kept up a running commentary and francie by her mantelshelf winifred drew nearer to the ninth baronet he seemed to promise a certain repose his nose was fine and drooped a little his grey moustaches too and she said drawling through her smile  its rather nice isnt it  his reply shot out of his smile like a snipped bread pellet  dyou remember in frazer the tribe that buries the bride up to the waist  he spoke as fast as anybody he had dark lively little eyes too all crinkled round like a catholic priests winifred felt suddenly he might say things she would regret  theyre always so amusingweddings she murmured and moved on to soames he was curiously still and winifred saw at once what was dictating his immobility to his right was george forsyte to his left annette and prosper profond he could not move without either seeing those two together or the reflection of them in george forsytes japing eyes he was quite right not to be taking notice  they say timothys sinking he said glumly  where will you put him soames  highgate he counted on his fingers itll make twelve of them there including wives how do you think fleur looks  remarkably well  soames nodded he had never seen her look prettier yet he could not rid himself of the impression that this business was unnaturalremembering still that crushed figure burrowing into the corner of the sofa from that night to this day he had received from her no confidences he knew from his chauffeur that she had made one more attempt on robin hill and drawn blankan empty house no one at home he knew that she had received a letter but not what was in it except that it had made her hide herself and cry he had remarked that she looked at him sometimes when she thought he wasnt noticing as if she were wondering still what he had doneforsoothto make those people hate him so well there it was annette had come back and things had worn on through the summervery miserable till suddenly fleur had said she was going to marry young mont she had shown him a little more affection when she told him that and he had yieldedwhat was the good of opposing it god knew that he had never wished to thwart her in anything and the young man seemed quite delirious about her no doubt she was in a reckless mood and she was young absurdly young but if he opposed her he didnt know what she would do for all he could tell she might want to take up a profession become a doctor or solicitor some nonsense she had no aptitude for painting writing music in his view the legitimate occupations of unmarried women if they must do something in these days on the whole she was safer married for he could see too well how feverish and restless she was at home annette too had been in favour of itannette from behind the veil of his refusal to know what she was about if she was about anything annette had said let her marry this young man he is a nice boynot so hightyflighty as he seems where she got her expressions he didnt knowbut her opinion soothed his doubts his wife whatever her conduct had clear eyes and an almost depressing amount of common sense he had settled fifty thousand on fleur taking care that there was no cross settlement in case it didnt turn out well could it turn out well she had not got over that other boyhe knew they were to go to spain for the honeymoon he would be even lonelier when she was gone but later perhaps she would forget and turn to him again winifreds voice broke on his reverie  why of all wondersjune  there in a djibbahwhat things she worewith her hair straying from under a fillet soames saw his cousin and fleur going forward to greet her the two passed from their view out on to the stairway  really said winifred she does the most impossible things fancy her coming  what made you ask her muttered soames  because i thought she wouldnt accept of course  winifred had forgotten that behind conduct lies the main trend of character or in other words omitted to remember that fleur was now a lame duck  on receiving her invitation june had first thought i wouldnt go near them for the world and then one morning had awakened from a dream of fleur waving to her from a boat with a wild unhappy gesture and she had changed her mind  when fleur came forward and said to her do come up while im changing my dress she had followed up the stairs the girl led the way into imogens old bedroom set ready for her toilet  june sat down on the bed thin and upright like a little spirit in the sear and yellow fleur locked the door  the girl stood before her divested of her wedding dress what a pretty thing she was  i suppose you think me a fool she said with quivering lips when it was to have been jon but what does it matter michael wants me and i dont care itll get me away from home diving her hand into the frills on her breast she brought out a letter jon wrote me this  june read lake okanagen british columbia im not coming back to england bless you always jon  shes made safe you see said fleur  june handed back the letter  thats not fair to irene she said she always told jon he could do as he wished  fleur smiled bitterly tell me didnt she spoil your life too june looked up nobody can spoil a life my dear thats nonsense things happen but we bob up  with a sort of terror she saw the girl sink on her knees and bury her face in the djibbah a strangled sob mounted to junes ears  its all rightall right she murmured dont there there  but the point of the girls chin was pressed ever closer into her thigh and the sound was dreadful of her sobbing  well well it had to come she would feel better afterward june stroked the short hair of that shapely head and all the scattered mothersense in her focussed itself and passed through the tips of her fingers into the girls brain  dont sit down under it my dear she said at last we cant control life but we can fight it make the best of things ive had to i held on like you and i cried as youre crying now and look at me  fleur raised her head a sob merged suddenly into a little choked laugh in truth it was a thin and rather wild and wasted spirit she was looking at but it had brave eyes  all right she said im sorry i shall forget him i suppose if i fly fast and far enough  and scrambling to her feet she went over to the washstand  june watched her removing with cold water the traces of emotion save for a little becoming pinkness there was nothing left when she stood before the mirror june got off the bed and took a pincushion in her hand to put two pins into the wrong places was all the vent she found for sympathy  give me a kiss she said when fleur was ready and dug her chin into the girls warm cheek  i want a whiff said fleur dont wait  june left her sitting on the bed with a cigarette between her lips and her eyes half closed and went downstairs in the doorway of the drawingroom stood soames as if unquiet at his daughters tardiness june tossed her head and passed down on to the halflanding her cousin francie was standing there  look said june pointing with her chin at soames that mans fatal  how do you mean said francie fatal  june did not answer her i shant wait to see them off she said goodbye  goodbye said francie and her eyes of a celtic grey goggled that old feud really it was quite romantic  soames moving to the well of the staircase saw june go and drew a breath of satisfaction why didnt fleur come they would miss their train that train would bear her away from him yet he could not help fidgeting at the thought that they would lose it and then she did come running down in her tancoloured frock and black velvet cap and passed him into the drawingroom he saw her kiss her mother her aunt vals wife imogen and then come forth quick and pretty as ever how would she treat him at this last moment of her girlhood he couldnt hope for much  her lips pressed the middle of his cheek  daddy she said and was past and gone daddy she hadnt called him that for years he drew a long breath and followed slowly down there was all the folly with that confetti stuff and the rest of it to go through with yet but he would like just to catch her smile if she leaned out though they would hit her in the eye with the shoe if they didnt take care young monts voice said fervently in his ear  goodbye sir and thank you im so fearfully bucked  goodbye he said dont miss your train  he stood on the bottom step but three whence he could see above the headsthe silly hats and heads they were in the car now and there was that stuff showering and there went the shoe a flood of something welled up in soames andhe didnt knowhe couldnt see     xithe last of the old forsytes  when they came to prepare that terrific symbol timothy forsytethe one pure individualist left the only man who hadnt heard of the great warthey found him wonderfulnot even death had undermined his soundness  to smither and cook that preparation came like final evidence of what they had never believed possiblethe end of the old forsyte family on earth poor mr timothy must now take a harp and sing in the company of miss forsyte mrs julia miss hester with mr jolyon mr swithin mr james mr roger and mr nicholas of the party whether mrs hayman would be there was more doubtful seeing that she had been cremated secretly cook thought that mr timothy would be upsethe had always been so set against barrel organs how many times had she not said drat the thing there it is again smither youd better run up and see what you can do and in her heart she would so have enjoyed the tunes if she hadnt known that mr timothy would ring the bell in a minute and say here take him a halfpenny and tell him to move on often they had been obliged to add threepence of their own before the man would gotimothy had ever underrated the value of emotion luckily he had taken the organs for bluebottles in his last years which had been a comfort and they had been able to enjoy the tunes but a harp cook wondered it was a change and mr timothy had never liked change but she did not speak of this to smither who did so take a line of her own in regard to heaven that it quite put one about sometimes  she cried while timothy was being prepared and they all had sherry afterward out of the yearly christmas bottle which would not be needed now ah dear she had been there fiveandforty years and smither threeandforty and now they would be going to a tiny house in tooting to live on their savings and what miss hester had so kindly left themfor to take fresh service after the glorious pastno but they would like just to see mr soames again and mrs dartie and miss francie and miss euphemia and even if they had to take their own cab they felt they must go to the funeral for six years mr timothy had been their baby getting younger and younger every day till at last he had been too young to live  they spent the regulation hours of waiting in polishing and dusting in catching the one mouse left and asphyxiating the last beetle so as to leave it nice discussing with each other what they would buy at the sale miss anns workbox miss juleys that is mrs julias seaweed album the firescreen miss hester had crewelled and mr timothys hairlittle golden curls glued into a black frame oh they must have thoseonly the price of things had gone up so  it fell to soames to issue invitations for the funeral he had them drawn up by gradman in his officeonly blood relations and no flowers six carriages were ordered the will would be read afterward at the house  he arrived at eleven oclock to see that all was ready at a quarter past old gradman came in black gloves and crape on his hat he and soames stood in the drawingroom waiting at halfpast eleven the carriages drew up in a long row but no one else appeared gradman said  it surprises me mr soames i posted them myself  i dont know said soames hed lost touch with the family soames had often noticed in old days how much more neighbourly his family were to the dead than to the living but now the way they had flocked to fleurs wedding and abstained from timothys funeral seemed to show some vital change there might of course be another reason for soames felt that if he had not known the contents of timothys will he might have stayed away himself through delicacy timothy had left a lot of money with nobody in particular to leave it to they mightnt like to seem to expect something  at twelve oclock the procession left the door timothy alone in the first carriage under glass then soames alone then gradman alone then cook and smither together they started at a walk but were soon trotting under a bright sky at the entrance to highgate cemetery they were delayed by service in the chapel soames would have liked to stay outside in the sunshine he didnt believe a word of it on the other hand it was a form of insurance which could not safely be neglected in case there might be something in it after all  they walked up two and twohe and gradman cook and smitherto the family vault it was not very distinguished for the funeral of the last old forsyte  he took gradman into his carriage on the way back to the bayswater road with a certain glow in his heart he had a surprise in pickle for the old chap who had served the forsytes fourandfifty yearsa treat that was entirely his doing how well he remembered saying to timothy the dayafter aunt hesters funeral well uncle timothy theres gradman hes taken a lot of trouble for the family what do you say to leaving him five thousand and his surprise seeing the difficulty there had been in getting timothy to leave anything when timothy had nodded and now the old chap would be as pleased as punch for mrs gradman he knew had a weak heart and their son had lost a leg in the war it was extraordinarily gratifying to soames to have left him five thousand pounds of timothys money they sat down together in the little drawingroom whose wallslike a vision of heavenwere skyblue and gold with every pictureframe unnaturally bright and every speck of dust removed from every piece of furniture to read that little masterpiecethe will of timothy with his back to the light in aunt hesters chair soames faced gradman with his face to the light on aunt anns sofa and crossing his legs began  this is the last will and testament of me timothy forsyte of the bower bayswater road london i appoint my nephew soames forsyte of the shelter mapleduram and thomas gradman of 159 folly road highgate hereinafter called my trustees to be the trustees and executors of this my will to the said soames forsyte i leave the sum of one thousand pounds free of legacy duty and to the said thomas gradman i leave the sum of five thousand pounds free of legacy duty  soames paused old gradman was leaning forward convulsively gripping a stout black knee with each of his thick hands his mouth had fallen open so that the gold fillings of three teeth gleamed his eyes were blinking two tears rolled slowly out of them soames read hastily on  all the rest of my property of whatsoever description i bequeath to my trustees upon trust to convert and hold the same upon the following trusts namely to pay thereout all my debts funeral expenses and outgoings of any kind in connection with my will and to hold the residue thereof in trust for that male lineal descendant of my father jolyon forsyte by his marriage with ann pierce who after the decease of all lineal descendants whether male or female of my said father by his said marriage in being at the time of my death shall last attain the age of twentyone years absolutely it being my desire that my property shall be nursed to the extreme limit permitted by the laws of england for the benefit of such male lineal descendant as aforesaid  soames read the investment and attestation clauses and ceasing looked at gradman the old fellow was wiping his brow with a large handkerchief whose brilliant colour supplied a sudden festive tinge to the proceedings  my word mr soames he said and it was clear that the lawyer in him had utterly wiped out the man my word why there are two babies now and some quite young childrenif one of them lives to be eightyits not a great ageand add twentyonethats a hundred years and mr timothy worth a hundred and fifty thousand pound net if hes worth a penny compound interest at five per cent doubles you in fourteen years in fourteen years three hundred thousandsix hundred thousand in twentyeighttwelve hundred thousand in fortytwotwentyfour hundred thousand in fiftysixfour million eight hundred thousand in seventynine million six hundred thousand in eightyfourwhy in a hundred years itll be twenty million and we shant live to use it it is a will  soames said dryly anything may happen the state might take the lot theyre capable of anything in these days  and carry five said gradman to himself i forgotmr timothys in consols we shant get more than two per cent with this income tax to be on the safe side say eight millions still thats a pretty penny  soames rose and handed him the will youre going into the city take care of that and do whats necessary advertise but there are no debts whens the sale  tuesday week said gradman life or lives in bein and twentyone years afterwardits a long way off but im glad hes left it in the family  the salenot at jobsons in view of the victorian nature of the effectswas far more freely attended than the funeral though not by cook and smither for soames had taken it on himself to give them their hearts desires winifred was present euphemia and francie and eustace had come in his car the miniatures barbizons and j r drawings had been bought in by soames and relics of no marketable value were set aside in an offroom for members of the family who cared to have mementoes these were the only restrictions upon bidding characterised by an almost tragic languor not one piece of furniture no picture or porcelain figure appealed to modern taste the humming birds had fallen like autumn leaves when taken from where they had not hummed for sixty years it was painful to soames to see the chairs his aunts had sat on the little grand piano they had practically never played the books whose outsides they had gazed at the china they had dusted the curtains they had drawn the hearthrug which had warmed their feet above all the beds they had lain and died insold to little dealers and the housewives of fulham and yetwhat could one do buy them and stick them in a lumberroom no they had to go the way of all flesh and furniture and be worn out but when they put up aunt anns sofa and were going to knock it down for thirty shillings he cried out suddenly five pounds the sensation was considerable and the sofa his  when that little sale was over in the fusty saleroom and those victorian ashes scattered he went out into the misty october sunshine feeling as if cosiness had died out of the world and the board to let was up indeed revolutions on the horizon fleur in spain no comfort in annette no timothys on the bayswater road in the irritable desolation of his soul he went into the goupenor gallery that chap jolyons watercolours were on view there he went in to look down his nose at themit might give him some faint satisfaction the news had trickled through from june to vals wife from her to val from val to his mother from her to soames that the housethe fatal house at robin hillwas for sale and irene going to join her boy out in british columbia or some such place for one wild moment the thought had come to soames why shouldnt i buy it back i meant it for my no sooner come than gone too lugubrious a triumph with too many humiliating memories for himself and fleur she would never live there after what had happened no the place must go its way to some peer or profiteer it had been a bone of contention from the first the shell of the feud and with the woman gone it was an empty shell for sale or to let with his minds eye he could see that board raised high above the ivied wall which he had built  he passed through the first of the two rooms in the gallery there was certainly a body of work and now that the fellow was dead it did not seem so trivial the drawings were pleasing enough with quite a sense of atmosphere and something individual in the brush work his father and my father he and i his child and mine thought soames so it had gone on and all about that woman softened by the events of the past week affected by the melancholy beauty of the autumn day soames came nearer than he had ever been to realisation of that truthpassing the understanding of a forsyte purethat the body of beauty has a spiritual essence uncapturable save by a devotion which thinks not of self after all he was near that truth in his devotion to his daughter perhaps that made him understand a little how he had missed the prize and there among the drawings of his kinsman who had attained to that which he had found beyond his reach he thought of him and her with a tolerance which surprised him but he did not buy a drawing  just as he passed the seat of custom on his return to the outer air he met with a contingency which had not been entirely absent from his mind when he went into the galleryirene herself coming in so she had not gone yet and was still paying farewell visits to that fellows remains he subdued the little involuntary leap of his subconsciousness the mechanical reaction of his senses to the charm of this onceowned woman and passed her with averted eyes but when he had gone by he could not for the life of him help looking back this then was finalitythe heat and stress of his life the madness and the longing thereof the only defeat he had known would be over when she faded from his view this time even such memories had their own queer aching value  she too was looking back suddenly she lifted her gloved hand her lips smiled faintly her dark eyes seemed to speak it was the turn of soames to make no answer to that smile and that little farewell wave he went out into the fashionable street quivering from head to foot he knew what she had meant to say now that i am going for ever out of the reach of you and yoursforgive me i wish you well that was the meaning last sign of that terrible realitypassing morality duty common senseher aversion from him who had owned her body but had never touched her spirit or her heart it hurt yesmore than if she had kept her mask unmoved her hand unlifted  three days later in that fastyellowing october soames took a taxicab to highgate cemetery and mounted through its white forest to the forsyte vault close to the cedar above catacombs and columbaria tall ugly and individual it looked like an apex of the competitive system he could remember a discussion wherein swithin had advocated the addition to its face of the pheasant proper the proposal had been rejected in favour of a wreath in stone above the stark words the family vault of jolyon forsyte 1850 it was in good order all trace of the recent interment had been removed and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the sunshine the whole family lay there now except old jolyons wife who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in suffolk old jolyon himself lying at robin hill and susan hayman cremated so that none knew where she might be soames gazed at it with satisfactionmassive needing little attention and this was important for he was well aware that no one would attend to it when he himself was gone and he would have to be looking out for lodgings soon he might have twenty years before him but one never knew twenty years without an aunt or uncle with a wife of whom one had better not know anything with a daughter gone from home his mood inclined to melancholy and retrospection  this cemetery was full they saidof people with extraordinary names buried in extraordinary taste still they had a fine view up here right over london annette had once given him a story to read by that frenchman maupassant most lugubrious concern where all the skeletons emerged from their graves one night and all the pious inscriptions on the stones were altered to descriptions of their sins not a true story at all he didnt know about the french but there was not much real harm in english people except their teeth and their taste which was certainly deplorable the family vault of jolyon forsyte 1850 a lot of people had been buried here since thena lot of english life crumbled to mould and dust the boom of an airplane passing under the goldtinted clouds caused him to lift his eyes the deuce of a lot of expansion had gone on but it all came back to a cemeteryto a name and a date on a tomb and he thought with a curious pride that he and his family had done little or nothing to help this feverish expansion good solid middlemen they had gone to work with dignity to manage and possess superior dosset indeed had built in a dreadful and jolyon painted in a doubtful period but so far as he remembered not another of them all had soiled his hands by creating anythingunless you counted val dartie and his horsebreeding collectors solicitors barristers merchants publishers accountants directors land agents even soldiersthere they had been the country had expanded as it were in spite of them they had checked controlled defended and taken advantage of the process and when you considered how superior dosset had begun life with next to nothing and his lineal descendants already owned what old gradman estimated at between a million and a million and a half it was not so bad and yet he sometimes felt as if the family bolt was shot their possessive instinct dying out they seemed unable to make moneythis fourth generation they were going into art literature farming or the army or just living on what was left themthey had no push and no tenacity they would die out if they didnt take care  soames turned from the vault and faced toward the breeze the air up here would be delicious if only he could rid his nerves of the feeling that mortality was in it he gazed restlessly at the crosses and the urns the angels the immortelles the flowers gaudy or withering and suddenly he noticed a spot which seemed so different from anything else up there that he was obliged to walk the few necessary yards and look at it a sober corner with a massive queershaped cross of grey roughhewn granite guarded by four dark yewtrees the spot was free from the pressure of the other graves having a little boxhedged garden on the far side and in front a goldening birchtree this oasis in the desert of conventional graves appealed to the aesthetic sense of soames and he sat down there in the sunshine through those trembling gold birch leaves he gazed out at london and yielded to the waves of memory he thought of irene in montpellier square when her hair was rustygolden and her white shoulders hisirene the prize of his lovepassion resistant to his ownership he saw bosinneys body lying in that white mortuary and irene sitting on the sofa looking at space with the eyes of a dying bird again he thought of her by the little green niobe in the bois de boulogne once more rejecting him his fancy took him on beside his drifting river on the november day when fleur was to be born took him to the dead leaves floating on the greentinged water and the snakeheaded weed for ever swaying and nosing sinuous blind tethered and on again to the window opened to the cold starry night above hyde park with his father lying dead his fancy darted to that picture of the future town to that boys and fleurs first meeting to the bluish trail of prosper profonds cigar and fleur in the window pointing down to where the fellow prowled to the sight of irene and that dead fellow sitting side by side in the stand at lords to her and that boy at robin hill to the sofa where fleur lay crushed up in the corner to her lips pressed into his cheek and her farewell daddy and suddenly he saw again irenes greygloved hand waving its last gesture of release  he sat there a long time dreaming his career faithful to the scut of his possessive instinct warming himself even with its failures  to letthe forsyte age and way of life when a man owned his soul his investments and his woman without check or question and now the state had or would have his investments his woman had herself and god knew who had his soul to letthat sane and simple creed  the waters of change were foaming in carrying the promise of new forms only when their destructive flood should have passed its full he sat there subconscious of them but with his thoughts resolutely set on the pastas a man might ride into a wild night with his face to the tail of his galloping horse athwart the victorian dykes the waters were rolling on property manners and morals on melody and the old forms of artwaters bringing to his mouth a salt taste as of blood lapping to the foot of this highgate hill where victorianism lay buried and sitting there high up on its most individual spot soameslike a figure of investmentrefused their restless sounds instinctively he would not fight themthere was in him too much primeval wisdom of man the possessive animal they would quiet down when they had fulfilled their tidal fever of dispossessing and destroying when the creations and the properties of others were sufficiently broken and defectedthey would lapse and ebb and fresh forms would rise based on an instinct older than the fever of changethe instinct of home  je men fiche said prosper profond soames did not say je men ficheit was french and the fellow was a thorn in his sidebut deep down he knew that change was only the interval of death between two forms of life destruction necessary to make room for fresher property what though the board was up and cosiness to letsome one would come along and take it again some day  and only one thing really troubled him sitting therethe melancholy craving in his heartbecause the sun was like enchantment on his face and on the clouds and on the golden birch leaves and the winds rustle was so gentle and the yewtree green so dark and the sickle of a moon pale in the sky  he might wish and wish and never get itthe beauty and the loving in the world
