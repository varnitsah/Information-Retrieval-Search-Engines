overthrow of robespierre and the close of the reign of terror1 these events are known in the historic calendar as the revolution of thermidor in the year ii after the fall of the monarchy the convention decided that the year should begin with the autumnal equinox and that the enumeration should date from the birth of the republic the year i opens on september 22 1792 the year ii opens on the same day of 1793 the month of thermidor begins on july 19 the memorable ninth thermidor therefore corresponds to july 27 1794 this has commonly been taken as the date of the commencement of a counterrevolution and in one sense it was so comte however and others have preferred to fix the reaction at the execution of danton april 5 1794 or robespierres official proclamation of deism in the festival of the supreme being may 7 1794  footnote 1 la révolution de thermidor par ch dhéricault paris didier 1876  m dhéricault does not belong to the school of writers who treat the course of history as a great high road following a firmly traced line and set with plain and ineffaceable landmarks the french revolution has nearly always been handled in this way alike by those who think it fruitful in blessings and by their adversaries who pronounce it a curse inflicted by the wrath of heaven historians have looked at the revolution as a plain landsman looks at the sea to the landsman the ocean seems one huge immeasurable flood obeying a simple law of ebb and flow and offering to the navigator a single uniform force yet in truth we know that the oceanic movement is the product of many forces the seeming uniformity covers the energy of a hundred currents and countercurrents the seafloor is not even nor the same but is subject to untold conditions of elevation and subsidence the sea is not one mass but many masses moving along definite lines of their own it is the same with the great tides of history wise men shrink from summing them up in single propositions that the french revolution led to an immense augmentation of happiness both for the french and for mankind can only be denied by the pope that it secured its beneficent results untempered by any mixture of evil can only be maintained by men as mad as doctor pangloss the greek poetess corinna said to the youthful pindar when he had interwoven all the gods and goddesses in the theban mythology into a single hymn that we should sow with the hand and not with the sack corinnas monition to the singer is proper to the interpreter of historical truth he should cull with the hand and not sweep in with the scythe it is doubtless mere pedantry to abstain from the widest conception of the sum of a great movement a clear definite and stable idea of the meaning in the history of human progress of such vast groups of events as the reformation or the revolution is indispensable for any one to whom history is a serious study of society it is just as important however not to forget that they were really groups of events and not in either case a single uniform movement the worldepos is after all only a file of the morning paper in a state of glorification a sensible man learns in everyday life to abstain from praising and blaming character by wholesale he becomes content to say of this trait that it is good and of that act that it was bad so in history we become unwilling to join or to admire those who insist upon transferring their sentiment upon the whole to their judgment upon each part we seek to be allowed to retain a decided opinion as to the final value to mankind of a long series of transactions and yet not to commit ourselves to set the same estimate on each transaction in particular still less on each person associated with it why shall we not prize the general results of the reformation without being obliged to defend john of leyden and the munster anabaptists  m dhéricaults volume naturally suggests such reflections as these of all the men of the revolution robespierre has suffered most from the audacious idolatry of some writers and the splenetic impatience of others m louis blanc and m ernest hamel talk of him as an angel or a prophet and the ninth thermidor is a red day indeed in their martyrology michelet and m dhéricault treat him as a mixture of cagliostro and caligula both a charlatan and a miscreant we are reminded of the commencement of an address of the french senate to the first bonaparte sire they began the desire for perfection is one of the worst maladies that can afflict the human mind this bold aphorism touches one of the roots of the judgments we pass both upon men and events it is because people so irrationally think fit to insist upon perfection that robespierres admirers would fain deny that he ever had a fault and the tacit adoption of the same impracticable standard makes it easier for robespierres wholesale detractors to deny that he had a single virtue or performed a single service the point of view is essentially unfit for history the real subject of history is the improvement of social arrangements and no conspicuous actor in public affairs since the world began saw the true direction of improvement with an absolutely unerring eye from the beginning of his career to the end it is folly for the historian as it is for the statesman to strain after the imaginative unity of the dramatic creator social progress is an affair of many small pieces and slow accretions and the interest of historic study lies in tracing amid the immense turmoil of events and through the confusion of voices the devious course of the sacred torch as it shifts from bearer to bearer and it is not the bearers who are most interesting but the torch                                       in the old flemish town of arras known in the diplomatic history of the fifteenth century by a couple of important treaties and famous in the industrial history of the middle ages for its preeminence in the manufacture of the most splendid kind of tapestry hangings maximilian robespierre was born in may 1758 he was therefore no more than five and thirty years old when he came to his ghastly end in 1794 his father was a lawyer and though the surname of the family had the prefix of nobility they belonged to the middle class when this decorative prefix became dangerous maximilian derobespierre dropped it his great rival danton was less prudent or less fortunate and one of the charges made against him was that he had styled himself monsieur danton  robespierres youth was embittered by sharp misfortune his mother died when he was only seven years old and his father had so little courage under the blow that he threw up his practice deserted his children and died in purposeless wanderings through germany the burden that the weak and selfish throw down must be taken up by the brave friendly kinsfolk charged themselves with the maintenance of the four orphans maximilian was sent to the school of the town whence he proceeded with a sizarship to the college of louislegrand in paris he was an apt and studious pupil but austere and disposed to that sombre cast of spirits which is common enough where a lad of some sensibility and much selfesteem finds himself stamped with a badge of social inferiority robespierres worshippers love to dwell on his fondness for birds with the universal passion of mankind for legends of the saints they tell how the untimely death of a favourite pigeon afflicted him with anguish so poignant that even sixty long years after it made his sisters heart ache to look back upon the pain of that tragic moment always a sentimentalist robespierre was from boyhood a devout enthusiast for the great high priest of the sentimental tribe rousseau was then passing the last squalid days of his life among the meadows and woods at ermenonville robespierre who could not have been more than twenty at the time for rousseau died in the summer of 1778 is said to have gone on a reverential pilgrimage in search of an oracle from the lonely sage as boswell and as gibbon and a hundred others had gone before him rousseau was wont to use his real adorers as ill as he used his imaginary enemies robespierre may well have shared the discouragement of the enthusiastic father who informed rousseau that he was about to bring up his son on the principles of emilius then so much the worse cried the perverse philosopher both for you and your son if he had been endowed with second sight he would have thought at least as rude a presage due to this last and most illstarred of a whole generation of neophytes  in 1781 robespierre returned to arras and amid the welcome of his relatives and the good hopes of friends began the practice of an advocate for eight years he led an active and seemly life he was not wholly pure from that indiscretion of the young appetite about which the world is mute but whose better ordering and governance would give a diviner brightness to the earth still if he did not escape the ordeal of youth robespierre was frugal laborious and persevering his domestic amiability made him the delight of his sister and his zealous selfsacrifice for the education and advancement in life of his younger brother was afterwards repaid by augustin robespierres devotion through all the fierce and horrible hours of thermidor though cold in temperament extremely reserved in manners and fond of industrious seclusion robespierre did not disdain the social diversions of the town he was a member of a reunion of rosati who sang madrigals and admired one anothers bad verses those who love the ironical surprises of fate may picture the young man who was doomed to play so terrible a part in terrible affairs going through the harmless follies of a ceremonial reception by the rosati taking three deep breaths over a rose solemnly fastening the emblem to his coat emptying a glass of rosered wine at a draught to the good health of the company and finally reciting couplets that voltaire would have found almost as detestable as the law of prairial or the festival of the supreme being more laudable efforts of ambition were prize essays in which robespierre has the merit of taking the right side in important questions he protested against the inhumanity of laws that inflicted civil infamy upon the innocent family of a convicted criminal and he protested against the still more horrid cruelty which reduced unfortunate children born out of wedlock to something like the status of the mediæval serf robespierres compositions at this time do not rise above the ordinary level of declaiming mediocrity but they promised a manhood of benignity and enlightenment to compose prize essays on political reforms was better than to ignore or to oppose political reform but the course of events afterwards owed their least desirable bias to the fact that such compositions were the nearest approach to political training that so many of the revolutionary leaders underwent one is inclined to apply to practical politics arthur youngs sensible remark about the endeavour of the french to improve the quality of their wool a cultivator at the head of a sheepfarm of 3000 or 4000 acres would in a few years do more for their wools than all the academicians and philosophers will effect in ten centuries  in his profession he distinguished himself in one or two causes of local celebrity an innovating citizen had been ordered by the authorities to remove a lightningconductor from his house within three days as being a mischievous practical paradox as well as a danger and an annoyance to his neighbours robespierre pleaded the innovators case on appeal and won it he defended a poor woman who had been wrongfully accused by a monk belonging to the powerful corporation of a great neighbouring abbey the young advocate did not even shrink from manfully arguing a case against the august bishop of arras himself his independence did him no harm the bishop afterwards appointed him to the post of judge or legal assessor in the episcopal court this tribunal was a remnant of what had once been the sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the bishops of arras that a court with the power of life and death should thus exist by the side of a proper corporation of civil magistrates is an illustration of the inextricable labyrinth of the french law and its administration on the eve of the revolution robespierre did not hold his office long every one has heard the striking story how the young judge whose name was within half a dozen years to take a place in the popular mind of france and of europe with the bloodiest monsters of myth or history resigned his post in a fit of remorse after condemning a murderer to be executed he is a criminal no doubt robespierre kept groaning in reply to the consolations of his sister for women are more positive creatures than men a criminal no doubt but to put a man to death many a man thus begins the great voyage with queasy sensibilities and ends it a cannibal  among robespierres associates in the festive mummeries of the rosati was a young officer of engineers who was destined to be his colleague in the dread committee of public safety and to leave an important name in french history in the garrison of arras carnot was quarteredthat iron head whose genius for the administrative organisation of war achieved even greater things for the new republic than the genius of louvois had achieved for the old monarchy carnot surpassed not only louvois but perhaps all other names save one in modern military history by uniting to the most powerful gifts for organisation both the strategic talent that planned the momentous campaign of 1794 and the splendid personal energy and skill that prolonged the defence of antwerp against the allied army in 1814 partisans dream of the unrivalled future of peace glory and freedom that would have fallen to the lot of france if only the gods had brought about a hearty union between the military genius of carnot and the political genius of robespierre so no doubt after the restoration of charles ii in england there were good men who thought that all would have gone very differently if only the genius of the great creator of the ironsides had taken counsel with the genius of venner the fifthmonarchy man and feak the anabaptist prophet  the time was now come when such men as robespierre were to be tried with fire when they were to drink the cup of fury and the dregs of the cup of trembling sybils and prophets have already spoken their inexorable decree as goethe has said on the day that first gives the man to the world no time and no might can break the stamped mould of his character only as life wears on do all its aforeshapen lines come into light he is launched into a sea of external conditions that are as independent of his own will as the temperament with which he confronts them it is action that tries and variation of circumstance the leaden chains of use bind many an ugly unsuspected prisoner in the soul and when the habit of their lives has been sundered the most immaculate are capable of antics beyond prevision a great crisis of the world was prepared for robespierre and those others his allies or his destroyers who with him came like the lightning and went like the wind  at the end of 1788 the king of france found himself forced to summon the statesgeneral it was their first assembly since 1614 on the memorable fourth of may 1789 robespierre appeared at versailles as one of the representatives of the third estate of his native province of artois the excitement and enthusiasm of the elections to this renowned assembly the immense demands and boundless expectations that they disclosed would have warned a cool observer of events if in that heated air a cool observer could have been found that the hour had struck for the fulfilment of those grim apprehensions of revolution that had risen in the minds of many shrewd men good and bad in the course of the previous half century no great event in history ever comes wholly unforeseen the antecedent causes are so widereaching many and continuous that their direction is always sure to strike the eye of one or more observers in all its significance lewis the fifteenth whose invincible weariness and heavy disgust veiled a penetrating discernment measured accurately the scope of the conflict between the crown and the parlements but said he things as they are will last my time under the roof of his own palace at versailles in the apartment of madame de pompadours famous physician one of quesnais economic disciples had cried out the realm is in a sore way it will never be cured without a great internal commotion but woe to those who have to do with it into such work the french go with no slack hand rousseau in a passage in the confessions not only divines a speedy convulsion but with striking practical sagacity enumerates the political and social causes that were unavoidably drawing france to the edge of the abyss lord chesterfield so different a man from rousseau declared as early as 1752 that he saw in france every symptom that history had taught him to regard as the forerunner of deep change before the end of the century so his prediction ran both the trade of king and the trade of priest in france would be shorn of half their glory dargenson in the same year declared a revolution inevitable and with a curious precision of anticipation assured himself that if once the necessity arose of convoking the statesgeneral they would not assemble in vain quon y prenne garde ils seraient fort sérieux oliver goldsmith idly wandering through france towards 1755 discerned in the mutinous attitude of the judicial corporations that the genius of freedom was entering the kingdom in disguise and that a succession of three weak monarchs would end in the emancipation of the people of france the most touching of all these presentiments is to be found in a private letter of the great empress the mother of marie antoinette herself maria theresa describes the ruined state of the french monarchy and only prays that if it be doomed to ruin still more utter at least the blame may not fall upon her daughter the empress had not learnt that when the giants of social force are advancing from the sombre shadow of the past with the thunder and the hurricane in their hands our poor prayers are of no more avail than the unbodied visions of a dream  the old popular assembly of the realm was not resorted to before every means of dispensing with so drastic a remedy had been tried historians sometimes write as if turgot were the only able and reforming minister of the century god forbid that we should put any other minister on a level with that high and beneficent figure but turgot was not the first statesman both able and patriotic who had been disgraced for want of compliance with the conditions of success at court he was only the last of a series chauvelin a man of vigour and capacity was dismissed with ignominy in 1736 machault a reformer at once courageous and wise shared the same fate twenty years later and in his case revolution was as cruel and as heedless as reaction for at the age of ninetyone the old man was dragged blind and deaf before the revolutionary tribunal and thence despatched to the guillotine between chauvelin and machault the elder dargenson who was greater than either of them had been raised to power and then speedily hurled down from it 1747 for no better reason than that his manners were uncouth and that he would not waste his time in frivolities that were as the breath of life in the great gallery at versailles and on the smoothshaven lawns of fontainebleau  not only had wise counsellors been tried consultative assemblies had been tried also necker had been dismissed in 1781 after publishing the memorable report which first initiated the nation in the elements of financial knowledge the disorder waxed greater and the monarchy drew nearer to bankruptcy each year the only modern parallel to the state of things in france under lewis the sixteenth is to be sought in the state of things in egypt or in turkey lewis the fourteenth had left a debt of between two and three thousand millions of livres but this had been wiped out by the heroic operations of law operations by the way which have never yet been scientifically criticised but the debt soon grew again by foolish wars by the prodigality of the court and by the rapacity of the nobles it amounted in 1789 to something like two hundred and forty millions sterling and it is interesting to notice that this was exactly the sum of the public debt of great britain at the same time the years excess of expenditure over receipts in 1774 was about fifty millions of livres in 1787 it was one hundred and forty millions or according to a different computation even two hundred millions the material case was not at all desperate if only the court had been less infatuated and the spirit of the privileged orders had been less blind and less vile the fatality of the situation lay in the characters of a handful of men and women for france was abundant in resources and even at this moment was far from unprosperous in spite of the incredible trammels of law and custom an able financier with the support of a popular chamber and the assent of the sovereign could have had no difficulty in restoring the public credit but the conditions simple as they might seem to a patriot or to posterity were unattainable so long as power remained with a caste that were anything we please except patriots an assembly of notables was brought together but it was only the empty phantasm of national representation yet the situation was so serious that even this body of arbitrary origin as it was still was willing to accept vital reforms the privileged order who were then as their descendants are now the worst conservative party in europe immediately persuaded the magisterial corporation to resist the notables the judicial corporation or parlement of paris had been suppressed under lewis the fifteenth and unfortunately revived again at the accession of his grandson by the inconvenient constitution of the french government the assent of that body was indispensable to fiscal legislation on the ground that such legislation was part of the general police of the realm the kings minister now loménie de brienne devised a new judicial constitution but the churchmen the nobles and the lawyers all united in protestations against such a blow the common people are not always the best judges of a remedy for the evils under which they are the greatest sufferers and they broke out in disorder both in paris and the provinces they discerned an attack upon their local independence nobody would accept office in the new courts and the administration of justice was at a standstill a loan was thrown upon the market but the public could not be persuaded to take it up it was impossible to collect the taxes the interest on the national debt was unpaid and the fundholder was dismayed and exasperated by an announcement that only twofifths would be discharged in cash a very large part of the national debt was held in the form of annuities for lives and men who had invested their savings on the credit of the government saw themselves left without a provision the total number of fundholders cannot be ascertained with any precision but it must have been very considerable especially in paris and the other great cities add to these all the civil litigants in the kingdom who had portions of their property virtually sequestrated by the suspension of the courts into which the property had been taken the resentment of this immense body of defrauded public creditors and injured private suitors explains the alienation of the middle class from the monarchy in the convulsions of our own time the moneyed interests have been on one side and the population without money on the other but in the first and greatest convulsion those who had nothing to lose found their animosities shared by those who had had something to lose and had lost it  deliberative assemblies then had been tried and ministers had been tried both had failed and there was no other device left except one which was destructive to absolute monarchy lewis the sixteenth was in 1789 in much the same case as that of the king of england in 1640 charles had done his best to raise money without any parliament for twelve years he had lost patience with the short parliament finally he was driven without choice or alternative to face as he best could the stout resolution and the wise patriotism of the long parliament men sometimes wonder how it was that lewis when he came to find the national assembly unmanageable and discovering how rapidly he was drifting towards the thunders of the revolutionary cataract did not break up a chamber over which neither the court nor even a minister so popular as necker had the least control it is a question whether the sword would not have broken in his hand even supposing however that the army would have consented to a violent movement against the assembly the king would still have been left in the same desperate straits from which he had looked to the statesgeneral to extricate him he might perhaps have dispersed the assembly he could not disperse debt and deficit those monsters would have haunted him as implacably as ever there was no new formula of exorcism nor any untried enchantment the success of violent designs against the national assembly had success been possible could after all have been followed by no other consummation than the relapse of france into the raging anarchy of poland or the sullen decrepitude of turkey  this will seem to some persons no better than fatalism but in truth there are two popular ways of reading the history of events between 1789 and 1794 and each of them seems to us as bad as the other according to one whatever happened in the revolution was good and admirable because it happened according to the other something good and admirable was always attainable and if only bad men had not interposed always ready to happen of course the only sensible view is that many of the revolutionary solutions were detestable but no other solution was within reach this is undoubtedly the best of possible worlds if the best is not so good as we could wish that is the fault of the possibilities such a doctrine is neither fatalism nor optimism but an honest recognition of long chains of cause and effect in human affairs  the great gathering of chosen men was first called statesgeneral then it called itself national assembly it is commonly known in history as the constituent assembly the name is of ironical association for the constitution which it framed after much travail endured for no more than a few months its deliberations lasted from may 1789 until september 1791 among its members were three principal groups there was first a band of blind adherents of the old system of government with all or most of its abuses second there was a centre of timid and oneeyed men who were for transforming the old absolutist system into something that should resemble the constitution of our own country finally there was a left with some differences of shade but all agreeing in the necessity of a thorough remodelling of every institution and most of the usages of the country silence you thirty votes cried mirabeau one day when he was interrupted by the dissents of the mountain this was the original measure of the party that in the twinkling of an eye was to wield the destinies of france in our own time we have wondered at the rapidity with which a chamber that was one day on the point of bringing back the grandnephew of lewis the sixteenth found itself a little later voting that republic which has since been ratified by the nation and has at this moment the ardent good wishes of every enlightened politician in europe in the same way it is startling to think that within three years of the beheading of lewis the sixteenth there was probably not one serious republican in the representative assembly of france yet it is always so we might make just the same remark of the house of commons at westminster in 1640 and of the assembly of massachusetts or of new york as late as 1770 the final flash of a long unconscious train of thought or intent is ever a surprise and a shock it is a mistake to set these swift changes down to political levity they were due rather to quickness of political intuition it was the kings attempt at flight in the summer of 1791 that first created a republican party it was that unhappy exploit and no theoretical preferences that awoke france to the necessity of choosing between the sacrifice of monarchy and the restoration of territorial aristocracy  political intuition was never one of robespierres conspicuous gifts but he had a doctrine that for a certain time served the same purpose rousseau had kindled in him a fervid democratic enthusiasm and had penetrated his mind with the principle of the sovereignty of the people this famous dogma contained implicitly within it the more indisputable truth that a society ought to be regulated with a view to the happiness of the people such a principle made it easier for robespierre to interpret rightly the first phases of the revolutionary movement it helped him to discern that the concentrated physical force of the populace was the only sure protection against a civil war and if a civil war had broken out in 1789 instead of 1793 all the advantages of authority would have been against the popular party the first insurrection of paris is associated with the harangue of camille desmoulins at the palais royal with the fall of the bastille with the murder of the governor and a hundred other scenes of melodramatic horror and the bloodred picturesque the insurrection of the fourteenth of july 1789 taught robespierre a lesson of practical politics which exactly fitted in with his previous theories in his resentment against the oppressive disorder of monarchy and feudalism he had accepted the counter principle that the people can do no wrong and nobody of sense now doubts that in their first great act the people of paris did what was right six days after the fall of the bastille the centre were for issuing a proclamation denouncing popular violence and ordering rigorous vigilance robespierre was then so little known in the assembly that even his name was usually misspelt in the journals from his obscure bench on the mountain he cried out with bitter vehemence against the proposed proclamationrevolt but this revolt is liberty the battle is not at its end tomorrow it may be the shameful designs against us will be renewed and who will there then be to repulse them if beforehand we declare the very men to be rebels who have rushed to arms for our protection and safety this was the cardinal truth of the situation everybody knows mirabeaus saying about robespierrethat man will go far he believes every word that he says this is much but it is only half it is not only that the man of power believes what he says what he believes must fit in with the facts and with the demands of the time now robespierres firmness of conviction happened at this stage to be rightly matched by his clearness of sight  it is true that a passionate mob its unearthly admixture of laughter with fury of vacancy with deadly concentration is as terrible as some uncouth antediluvian or the unfamiliar monsters of the sea or one of the giant plants that make men shudder with mysterious fear the history of our own country in the eighteenth century tells of the riots against meetinghouses in doctor sacheverells time and the riots against papists and their abettors in lord george gordons time and churchandking riots in doctor priestleys time it would be too daring therefore to maintain that the rabble of the poor have any more unerring political judgment than the rabble of the opulent but in france in 1789 robespierre was justified in saying that revolt meant liberty if there had been no revolt in july the court party would have had time to mature their infatuated designs of violence against the assembly in october these designs had come to life again the royalists at versailles had exultant banquets at which in the presence of the queen they drank confusion to all patriots and trampled the new emblem of freedom passionately underfoot the news of this odious folly soon travelled to paris its significance was speedily understood by a populace whose wits were sharpened by famine thousands of fireeyed women and men tramped intrepidly out towards versailles if they had done less the assembly would have been dispersed or arbitrarily decimated even though such a measure would certainly have left the government in desperation  at that dreadful moment of the sixth of october amid the slaughter of guards and the frantic yells of hatred against the queen it is no wonder that some were found to urge the king to flee to metz if he had accepted the advice the course of the revolution would have been different but its march would have been just as irresistible for revolution lay in the force of a hundred combined circumstances lewis however rejected these counsels and suffered the mob to carry him in bewildering procession to his capital and his prison that great man who was watching french affairs with such consuming eagerness from distant beaconsfield in our english buckinghamshire instantly divined that this procession from versailles to the tuileries marked the fall of the monarchy a revolution in sentiment manners and moral opinions the most important of all revolutions in a word was in burkes judgment to be dated from the sixth of october 1789  the events of that day did indeed give its definite cast to the situation the moral authority of the sovereign came to an end along with the ancient and reverend mystery of the inviolability of his person the count dartois the kings second brother one of the most worthless of human beings as incurably addicted to sinister and suicidal counsels in 1789 as he was when he overthrew his own throne forty years later had run away from peril and from duty after the insurrection of july after the insurrection of october a troop of the nobles of the court followed him the personal cowardice of the emigrants was only matched by their political blindness many of the most unwise measures in the assembly were only passed by small majorities and the majorities would have been transformed into minorities if in the early days of the revolution these unworthy men had only stood firm at their posts selfish oligarchies have scarcely ever been wanting in courage the emigrant noblesse of france are almost the only instance of a great privileged and territorial caste that had as little bravery as they had patriotism the explanation is that they had been an oligarchy not of power or duty but of selfindulgence they were crushed by richelieu to secure the unity of the monarchy they now effaced themselves at the revolution and this secured that far greater object the unity of the nation  the disappearance of so many of the nobles from france was not the only abdication on the part of the conservative powers cowed and terrified by the events of october no less than three hundred members of the assembly sought to resign the average attendance even at the most important sittings was often incredibly small thus the chamber came to have little more moral authority in face of the people of paris than had the king himself the people of paris had themselves become in a day the masters of france  this immense change led gradually to a decisive alteration in the position of robespierre he found the situation of affairs at last falling into perfect harmony with his doctrine rousseau had taught him that the people ought to be sovereign and now the people were being recognised as sovereign de facto no less than de jure any limitations on the new divine right united the horror of blasphemy to the secular wickedness of political treason after the assembly had come to paris a famishing mob in a moment of mad fury murdered an unfortunate baker who was suspected of keeping back bread these paroxysms led to the enactment of a new martial law robespierre spoke vehemently against it such a law implied a wrongful distrust of the people then discussions followed as to the property qualification of an elector citizens were classed as active and passive only those were to have votes who paid direct taxes to the amount of three days wages in the year robespierre flung himself upon this too famous distinction with bitter tenacity if all men are equal he cried then all men ought to have votes if he who only pays the amount of one days work has fewer rights than another who pays the amount of three days why should not the man who pays ten days have more rights than the other who only pays the earnings of three days this kind of reasoning had little weight with the chamber but it made the reasoner very popular with the throng in the galleries even within the assembly influence gradually came to the man who had a parcel of immutable axioms and postulates and who was ready with a deduction and a phrase for each case as it arose he began to stand out like a needle of sharp rock amid the flitting shadows of uncertain purpose and the vapoury drift of wandering aims  robespierre had no social conception and he had nothing which can be described as a policy he was the prophet of a sect and had at this period none of the aims of the chief of a political party what he had was democratic doctrine and an intrepid logic and robespierres intrepid logic was the nearest approach to calm force and coherent character that the first three years of the revolution brought into prominence when the assembly met necker was the popular idol almost within a few weeks this wellmeaning but very incompetent divinity had slipped from his throne and lafayette had taken his place mirabeau came next the ardent and animated genius of his eloquence fitted him above all men to ride the whirlwind and direct the storm and on the memorable twentythird of june 89 he had shown the genuine audacity and resource of a revolutionary statesman when he stirred the chamber to defy the kings demand and hailed the royal usher with the resounding wordsyou sir have neither place nor right of speech go tell those who sent you that we are here by the will of the people and only bayonets shall drive us hence but mirabeau bore a tainted character and was always distrusted ah how the immorality of my youth he used to say in words that sum up the tragedy of many a puissant life how the immorality of my youth hinders the public good the event proved that the popular suspicion was just the patriot is now no longer merely suspected but known to have sullied his hands with the money of the court he did not sell himself it has been said he allowed himself to be paid the distinction was too subtle for men doing battle for their lives and for freedom and mirabeaus popularity waned towards the middle of 1790 the next favourite was barnave the generous and highminded spokesman of those sanguine spirits who to the very end hoped against hope to save both the throne and its occupant by the spring of 1791 barnave followed his predecessors into disfavour the assembly was engaged on the burning question of the government of the colonies were the negro slaves to be admitted to citizenship or was a legislature of planters to be entrusted with the task of social reformation our own generation has seen in the republic of the west what strife this political difficulty is capable of raising barnave pronounced against the negroes robespierre on the contrary declaimed against any limitation of the right of the negro as a compromise with the avarice pride and cruelty of a governing race and a guilty trafficking with the rights of man barnave from that day saw that his laurel crown had gone to robespierre  if the people called him noble that was now their hate him vile that was their garland they did not transfer their affections without sound reason barnaves sensibility was too easily touched there are many politicians in every epoch whose principles grow slack and flaccid at the approach of the golden sun of royalty barnave was one of those who was sent to bring back the fugitive king and queen from varennes and the journey by their side in the coach unstrung his spirit he became one of the courts clandestine advisers men of this weak susceptibility of imagination are not fit for times of revolution to be on the side of the court was to betray the cause of the nation we cannot take too much pains to realise that the voluntary conversion of lewis the sixteenth to a popular constitution and the abolition of feudalism was practically as impossible as the conversion of pope pius the ninth to the doctrine of a free church in a free state those who believe in the miracle of free will may think of this as they please sensible people who accept the scientific account of human character know that the sudden transformation of a man or a woman brought up to middle age as the heir to centuries of absolutist tradition into adherents of a government that agreed with the doctrines of locke and milton was only possible on condition of supernatural interference the kings good nature was no substitute for political capacity or insight an instructive measure of the degree in which he possessed these two qualities may be found in that deplorable diary of his where on such days as the fourteenth of july when the bastille fell and the sixth of october when he was carried in triumph from versailles to the tuileries he made the simple entry rien and he had no firmness it was as difficult to keep the king to a purpose la marck said to mirabeau as to keep together a number of welloiled ivory balls lewis moreover was guided by a more energetic and less compliant character than his own  marie antoinettes high mien in adversity and the contrast between the dazzling splendour of her first years and the scenes of outrage and bloody death that made the climax of her fate could not but strike the imaginations of men such contrasts are the very stuff of which tragedy the gorgeous muse with scepterd pall loves to weave her most imposing raiment but history must be just and the character of the queen had far more concern in the disaster of the first five years of the revolution than had the character of robespierre every new document that comes to light heaps up proof that if blind and obstinate choice of personal gratification before the common weal be enough to constitute a state criminal then the queen of france was one of the worst state criminals that ever afflicted a nation the popular hatred of marie antoinette sprang from a sound instinct we shall never know how much or how little truth there was in those frightful charges against her that may still be read in a thousand pamphlets these imputed depravities far surpass anything that john knox ever said against mary stuart or that juvenal has recorded against messalina and perhaps for the only parallel we must look to the hideous stories of the byzantine secretary against theodora the too famous empress of justinian and the persecutor of belisarius we have to remember that all the revolutionary portraits are distorted by furious passion and that marie antoinette may no more deserve to be compared to mary stuart than robespierre deserves to be compared to ezzelino or to alva the aristocrats were the libellers if libels they were it is at least certain that from the unlucky hour when the austrian archduchess crossed the french frontier a childish bride of fourteen down to the hour when the queen of france made the attempt to recross it in resentful flight one and twenty years afterwards marie antoinette was ignorant unteachable blind to events and deaf to good counsels a bitter grief to her heroic mother the evil genius of her husband the despair of her truest advisers and an exceedingly bad friend to the people of france when burke had that immortal vision of her at versaillesjust above the horizon decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in glittering like the morning star full of life and splendour and joywe know from the correspondence between maria theresa and her minister at versailles that what burke really saw was no divinity but a flighty and troublesome schoolgirl an accomplice in all the ignoble intrigues and a sharer of all the small busy passions that convulse the insects of a court the levity that came with her lorraine blood broke out in incredible dissipations in indiscreet visits to the masked balls at the opera in midnight parades and mystifications on the terrace at versailles in insensate gambling the court of france is turned into a gaminghell said the emperor joseph the queens own brother if they do not amend the revolution will be cruel these vices or follies were less mischievous than her intervention in affairs of state here her levity was as marked as in the paltry affairs of the boudoir and the antechamber and here to levity she added both dissimulation and vindictiveness it was the queens influence that procured the dismissal of the two virtuous ministers by whose aid the king was striving to arrest the decay of the government of his kingdom malesherbes was distasteful to her for no better reason than that she wanted his post for some favourites favourite against turgot she conspired with tenacious animosity because he had suppressed a sinecure which she designed for a court parasite and because he would not support her caprice on behalf of a worthless creature of her faction these two admirable men were disgraced on the same day the queen wrote to her mother that she had not meddled in the affair this was a falsehood for she had even sought to have turgot thrown into the bastille i am as one dashed to the ground cried the great voltaire now nearing his end never can we console ourselves for having seen the golden age dawn and vanish my eyes see only death in front of me now that turgot is gone the rest of my days must be all bitterness what hope could there be that the personage who had thus put out the light of hope for france in 1776 would welcome that greater flame which was kindled in the land in 1789  when people write hymns of pity for the queen we always recall the poor woman whom arthur young met as he was walking up a hill to ease his horse near marsletour though the unfortunate creature was only twentyeight she might have been taken for sixty or seventy her figure was so bent her face so furrowed and hardened by toil her husband she said had a morsel of land one cow and a poor little horse yet he had to pay fortytwo pounds of wheat and three chickens to one seigneur and one hundred and sixty pounds of oats one chicken and one franc to another besides very heavy tailles and other taxes and they had seven children she had heard that something was to be done by some great folks for such poor ones but she did not know who nor how but god send us better for the tailles and the dues grind us to the earth it was such hapless drudges as this who replenished the queens gaming tables at versailles thousands of them dragged on the burden of their harassed and desperate days less like men and women than beasts of the field wrung and tortured and mercilessly overladen in order that the queen might gratify her childish passion for diamonds or lavish money and estates on worthless female polignacs and lamballes or kill time at a cost of five hundred louis a night at lansquenet and the faro bank the queen it is true was in all this no worse than other dissipated women then and since she did not realise that it was the system to which she had stubbornly committed herself that drove the people of the fields to cut their crops green to be baked in the oven because their hunger could not wait or made them cower whole days in their beds because misery seemed to gnaw them there with a duller fang that she was unconscious of its effect makes no difference in the real drift of her policy makes no difference in the judgment that we ought to pass upon it nor in the gratitude that is owed to the stern men who rose up to consume her and her court with righteous flame the queen and the courtiers and the hardfaring woman of marsletour and that whole generation have long been dust and shadow they have vanished from the earth as if they were no more than the fireflies that the peasant of the italian poet saw dancing in the vineyard as he took his evening rest on the hillside they have all fled back into the impenetrable shade whence they came our minds are free and if social equity is not a chimera marie antoinette was the protagonist of the most barbarous and execrable of causes                                       let us return to the shaping of the constitution not forgetting that its stability was to depend upon the queen robespierre left some characteristic marks on the final arrangements he imposed upon the assembly a motion prohibiting any member of it from accepting office under the crown for a period of four years after the dissolution robespierre from this time forth constantly illustrated a very singular truth namely that the most ostentatious faith in humanity in general seems always to beget the sharpest distrust of all human beings in particular he proceeded further in the same direction it was robespierre who persuaded the chamber to pass a selfdenying ordinance all its members were declared ineligible for a seat in the legislature that was to replace them the members of the right on this occasion went with their bitter foes of the extreme left and to both parties have been imputed sinister and machiavellian motives the right aware that their own return to the new assembly was impossible were delighted to reduce the men with whom they had been carrying on incensed battle for two long years to their own obscurity and impotence robespierre on the other hand is accused of a jealous desire to exclude barnave from power he is accused also of a deliberate intention to weaken the new legislature in order to secure the preponderance of the parisian clubs there is no evidence that these malignant feelings were in robespierres mind the reasons he gave were exactly of the kind that we should have expected to weigh with a man of his stamp there is even a certain truth in them that is not inconsistent with the experience of a parliamentary country like our own to talk he said of the transmission of light and experience from one assembly to another was to distrust the public spirit the influence of opinion and the general good grows less as the influence of parliamentary orators grows greater he had no taste he proceeded with one of his chilly sneers for that new science which was styled the tactics of great assemblies it was too like intrigue nothing but truth and reason ought to reign in a legislature he did not like the idea of clever men becoming dominant by skilful tactics and then perpetuating their empire from one assembly to another he wound up his discourse with some theatrical talk about disinterestedness when he sat down he was greeted with enthusiastic acclamations such as a few months before used to greet the stormful mirabeau now wrapped in eternal sleep amid the stillness of the new pantheon the folly of robespierres inferences is obvious enough if only truth and reason ought to weigh in a legislature then it is all the more important not to exclude any body of men through whom truth and reason may possibly enter robespierre had striven hard to remove all restrictions from admission to the electoral franchise he did not see that to limit the choice of candidates was in itself the most grievous of all restrictions  the common view has been that the constitution of 1791 perished because its creators were thus disabled from defending the work of their hands this view led to a grave mistake four years later after robespierre had gone to his grave the convention framing the constitution of the year iii decided that twothirds of the existing assembly should keep their places and that only onethird should be popularly elected this led to the revolt of the thirteenth vendémiaire and afterwards to the coup détat of the eighteenth fructidor in that sense no doubt robespierres proposal was the indirect root of much mischief but it is childish to believe that if a hundred of the most prominent members of the constituent had found seats in the new assembly they would have saved the constitution their experience the loss of which it is the fashion to deplore could have had no application to the strange combinations of untoward circumstance that were now rising up with such deadly rapidity in every quarter of the horizon like vast sombre banks of impenetrable cloud prudence in new cases as has been somewhere said can do nothing on grounds of retrospect the work of the constituent was doomed by the very nature of things their assumption that the revolution was made while all france was still torn by fierce and unappeasable disputes as to seignorial rights was one of the most striking pieces of selfdeception in history it is told how in the eleventh century when the fervent hosts of the crusaders tramped across europe on their way to deliver the holy city from the hands of the unbelievers the wearied children as they espied each new town that lay in their interminable march cried out with joyful expectation is not this then jerusalem so france had set out on a portentous journey little knowing how far off was the end lightly taking each poor haltingplace for the deeply longedfor goal and waxing more fiercely disappointed as each new height that they gained only disclosed yet farther and more unattainable horizons alas said burke they little know how many a weary step is to be taken before they can form themselves into a mass which has a true political personality  an immense revolution had been effected but by what force were its fruits to be guarded each step in the revolution had raised a host of irreconcilable enemies the rights of property the old and jealous associations of local independence the traditions of personal dignity the relations of the civil to the spiritual powerthese were the momentous matters about which the lawmakers of the constituent had exercised themselves the parties of the chamber had for these two years past been laying mine and countermine among the very deepest foundations of society one by one each great corporation of the old order had been alienated from the new order it was inevitable that it should be so let us look at one or two examples of this the monarchy had imposed administrative centralisation upon france without securing national unity thus the great provinces that had been slowly added one after the other to the monarchy while becoming members of the same kingdom still retained different institutions and isolated usages the time was now come when france should be france and its inhabitants frenchmen and no longer bretons normans gascons provençals the assembly by a single decree 1790 redivided the country into eightythree departments it wiped out at a stroke the separate administrations the separate parlements the peculiar privileges and even the historic names of the old provinces we need not dwell on the significance of this change here but will only remark in passing that the stubborn disputes from the time of the regency downwards between the crown and the provincial parlements turned under other names and in other forms upon this very issue of the unification of the law the crown was with the progressive party but it lacked the strength and courage to set aside retrograde local sentiment as the constituent assembly was able to set it aside  then this prodigious change in the distribution of government was accompanied by no less prodigious a change in the source of power popular election replaced the old system of territorial privilege and aristocratic prerogative the effect of this vital innovation followed as it was a few months later by a decree abolishing titles and armorial bearings was to complete the estrangement of the old privileged classes from the revolutionary movement all that they had meant to concede was the payment of an equal land tax what was life worth to the noble if common people were to be allowed to wear arms and to command a company of foot or a troop of horse if he was no longer to have thousands of acres left waste for the chase if he was compelled to sue for a vote where he had only yesterday reigned as manorial lord if in short he was at a stroke to lose all those delights of insolence and vanity which had made not the decoration but the very substance of his days  nor were the nobles of the sword and the redheeled slipper the only outraged class the magistracy of the provincial parliaments were inflamed with resentment against changes that stripped them of the power of exciting against the new government the same factious and impracticable spirit with which they had on so many occasions embarrassed the old the clergy were thrown even still more violently into opposition the assembly sorely pressed for resources declared the property held by ecclesiastics amounting to a revenue of not less than eight million pounds sterling a year or double that amount in modern values to be the property of the nation talleyrand carried a measure decreeing the sale of the ecclesiastical domain the clergy were as intensely irritated as laymen would have been by a similar assertion of sovereign right and their irritation was made still more dangerous by the next set of measures against them  the assembly withdrew all recognition of catholicism as the religion of the state monastic vows were abolished and orders and congregations suppressed the ecclesiastical divisions were made to coincide with the civil divisions a bishop being allotted to each department what was a more important revolution than all bishops and incumbents were henceforth to be appointed by popular election the assembly who had always the institutions of our own country before them meant to introduce into france the system of the church of england which was even then an anachronism in the land of its birth much worse was such a system an anachronism after belief had been sapped by a voltaire and an encyclopædia the clergy both showed and excited a mutinous spirit the assembly by way of retort decreed that all ecclesiastics should take the oath of allegiance to the civil constitution of the clergy on pain of forfeiture of their benefices fivesixths of the clergy refused and the result was an outbreak of religious fury in the great towns of the south and elsewhere which recalled the violence of the sixteenth century and the reformation  thus when the constituent assembly ceased from its labours the popular party had to face the mocking and defiant privileged classes the magistracy whose craft and calling were gone and the clergy and as many of the flocks as shared the holy vindictiveness of their pastors immense material improvements had been made but who was to guard them against all these powerful and exasperated bands no chamber could execute so portentous an office least of all a chamber that was bound to work in accord with a king who at the very moment when he was swearing fidelity to the new order of things was sending entreaties to the king of prussia and to the emperor his brotherinlaw to overthrow the new order and bring back the old if the revolution had achieved priceless gains for france they could only be preserved on condition that public action was directed by those who valued these gains for themselves and for their children above all things elseabove the monarchy above the constitution above peace above their own sorry lives there was only one party who showed this passionate devotion this fanatical resolution not to suffer the work that had been done to be undone and never to allow france to sink back from exalted national life into the lethargy of national death that party was the jacobins and above all the austere and rigorous jacobins of paris on their ascendancy depended the triumph of the revolution and on the triumph of the revolution depended the salvation of france their ascendancy meant a jacobin dictatorship and against this as against dictatorship in all its forms many things have been said and truly said but the one most important thing that can be said about jacobin dictatorship is that in spite of all the dolorous mishaps and hateful misdeeds that marked its course it was still the only instrument capable of concentrating and utilising the dispersed social energy of the french people the crisis was not a crisis of logic but of force and the jacobins alone understood as the old covenanters had understood that problems of force are not solved by phrases but by mastery and the sword  the great popular club of paris was the centre of all those who looked at events in this spirit the legislative assembly the successor of the constituent met in the month of october 1791 like its predecessor the legislative contained a host of excellent and patriotic men and they at once applied themselves to the allimportant task which the constituent had left so deplorably incomplete of finally breaking down the old feudal rights the most important group in the new chamber were the deputies from the gironde events soon revealed violent dissents between the girondins and the jacobins but for some months after the meeting of the legislative girondins and jacobins represented together in unbroken unity the great popular party from this time until the fall of the monarchy the whole of this popular party in all its branches found their rallyingplace not in the assembly but in the jacobin club and the ascendancy of the jacobin club embodied the dictatorship of paris it was only from paris that the whole circle of events could be commanded when the peasants had got what they wanted that is to say the emancipation of the land they were ready to think that the revolution was in safety and at an end they were in no position to see the enmity of the exiles the dangerous selfishness of austria and prussia the disloyal machinations of the court the reactionary sentiment of la vendée the absolute unworkableness of the new constitution arthur young in the height of the agitations of the constituent assembly found himself at moulins the capital of the bourbonnais and on the great postroad to italy he went to the best coffeehouse in the town and found as many as twenty tables spread for company but as for a newspaper he says he might as well have asked for an elephant in the capital of a great province the seat of an intendant at a moment like that with a national assembly voting a revolution and not a newspaper to tell the people whether fayette mirabeau or lewis xvi were on the throne could such a people as this he cries ever have made a revolution or become free never in a thousand centuries the enlightened mob of paris have done the whole and that was the plain truth what was involved in such a truth we shall see presently  robespierre had now risen to be one of the foremost men in france to borrow the figure of an older chief of french faction from trifling among the violins in the orchestra he had ascended to the stage itself and had a right to perform leading parts disqualified for sitting in the assembly he wielded greater power than ever in the club the constituent had been full of his enemies alone with my own soul he once cried to the jacobins how could i have borne struggles that were beyond any human strength if i had not raised my spirit to god this isolation marked him with a kind of theocratic distinction these communings with the unseen powers gave a certain indefinable prerogative to a man even among the children of the century of voltaire condorcet the youngest of the intimates and disciples of voltaire of dalembert of turgot was the first to sound bitter warning that robespierre was at heart a priest the suggestion was more than a gibe robespierre had the typic sacerdotal temperament its sense of personal importance its thin unction its private leanings to the stake and the cord and he had one of those deplorable natures that seem as if they had never in their lives known the careless joys of a springtime by and by from mere priest he developed into the deadlier carnivore the inquisitor  the absence of advantages of bodily presence has never been fatal to the pretensions of the pontiff robespierre was only a couple of inches above five feet in height but the grand monarch himself was hardly more his eyes were small and weak and he usually wore spectacles his face was pitted by the marks of smallpox his complexion was dull and sometimes livid the tones of his voice were dry and shrill and he spoke with the vulgar accent of his province such is the accepted tradition and there is no reason to dissent from it it is fair however to remember that robespierres enemies had command of his historic reputation at its source and this is always a great advantage for faction if not for truth so robespierres voice and person may have been maligned just as aristophanes may have been a calumniator when he accused cleon of having an intolerably loud voice and smelling of the tanyard what is certain is that robespierre was a master of effective oratory adapted for a violent popular audience to impress to persuade and to command the convention would have yawned if it had not trembled under him but the jacobin club never found him tedious robespierres style had no richness either of feeling or of phrase no fervid originality no happy violences if we turn from a page of rousseau to a page of robespierre we feel that the disciple has none of the thrilling sonorousness of the master the glow and the ardour have become metallic the longdrawn plangency is parodied by shrill notes of splenetic complaint the rhythm has no broad wings the phrases have no quality of radiance the oratorical glimpses never lift the spirit into new worlds we are never conscious of those great pulses of strong emotion that shake and vibrate through the noblymeasured periods of cicero or bossuet or burke robespierre could not rival the vivid and highlycoloured declamation of vergniaud his speeches were never heated with the ardent passion that poured like a torrent of fire through some of the orations of isnard nor above all had he any mastery of that dialect of the titans by which danton convulsed an audience with fear with amazement or with the spirit of defiant endeavour the absence of these intenser qualities did not make robespierres speeches less effective for their own purpose on the contrary when the air has become torrid and passionate utterance is cheap then severity in form is very likely to pass for good sense in substance that robespierre had decent fluency copiousness and finish need hardly be said the french have an artistic sense they have never accepted our own whimsical doctrine that a mans politics must be sagacious if his speaking is only clumsy enough robespierre more than once showed himself ready with a forcible reply on critical occasions this only makes him an illustration the more of the good oratorical rule that he is most likely to come well out of the emergency of an improvisation who is usually most careful to prepare robespierre was as solicitous about the correctness of his speech as he was about the neatness of his clothes he no more grudged the pains given to the polishing of his discourses than he grudged the time given every day to the powdering of his hair  nothing was more remarkable than his dexterity in presenting his case james mill used to point out to his son among other skilful arts of demosthenes these two first that he said everything important to his purpose at the exact moment when he had brought the minds of his hearers into the state most fitted to receive it second that he insinuated gradually and indirectly into their minds ideas which would have roused opposition if they had been expressed more directly mr mill once called the attention of the present writer to exactly the same kind of rhetorical skill in the speeches of robespierre the reader may do well to turn for excellent specimens of this to the speech of january 11 1792 against the war or that of may 1794 against atheism the logic is stringent but the premises are arbitrary robespierre is as one who should iterate indisputable propositions of abstract geometry and mechanics while men are craving an architect who shall bridge the gulf of waters exuberance of high words no longer conceals the sterility of his ideas and the shallowness of his method we should say of his speeches as of so much of the speaking and writing of the time that it is transparent and smooth but there is none of that quality which the critics of painting call texture  his listeners however in the old refectory of the convent of the jacobins took little heed of these things the matter was too absorbing the issue too vital a hundred years before the hunted covenanters of the western lowlands with claverhouses dragoons a few miles off exulted in the endless exhortations and expositions of their hill preachers they relished nothing so keenly as three hours of mucklewrath followed by three hours more of peter poundtext we now find the jargon of the mucklewraths and the poundtexts of the solemn league and covenant dead as it is still not devoid of the picturesque and the impressive if we cannot say the same of the great preacher of the declaration of the rights of man the reason is partly that time has not yet softened the tones and partly that there is no one in all the world with whom it is so difficult to sympathise as with the narrower fanatics of our own particular faith  we have still to mark the trait that above everything else gave to robespierre the trust and confidence of paris as men listened to him they had full faith in the integrity of the speaker and robespierre in one way deserved this confidence he was eminently the possessor of a conscience when the strain of circumstance in the last few months of his life pressed him towards wrong at least before doing wrong he was forced to lie to his own conscience this is a kind of honesty as the world goes in the salon of 1791 an artist exhibited robespierres portrait simply inscribing it the incorruptible throngs passed before it every day and ratified the honourable designation by eager murmurs of approval the democratic journals were loud in panegyric on the unsleeping sentinel of liberty they loved to speak of him as the modern fabricius and delighted to recall the words of pyrrhus that it is easier to turn the sun from its course than to turn fabricius from the path of honour patriotic parents eagerly besought him to be sponsor for their children ladies of wealth including at least one countrywoman of our own vainly entreated him to accept their purses for women are quick to recognise the temperament of the priest and recognising they adore a rich widow of nantes besought him with pertinacious tenderness to accept not only her purse but her hand mirabeaus sister hailed him as an eagle floating through the blue heavens  robespierres life was frugal and simple as must always be seemly in the spokesman of the dumb multitude whose lives are very hard he had a single room in the house of duplay at the extreme west end of the long rue saint honoré half a mile from the jacobin club and less than that from the riding school of the tuileries where the constituent and legislative assemblies held session his room which served him for bedchamber as well as for the uses of the day was scantily furnished and he shared the homely fare of his host duplay was a carpenter a sworn follower of robespierre and the whole family cherished their guest as if he had been a son and a brother between him and the eldest daughter of the house there grew up a more tender sentiment and robespierre looked forward to the joys of the hearth so soon as his country should be delivered from the oppressors without and the traitors within  eagerly as robespierre delighted in his popularity he intended it to be a force and not a decoration an occasion of testing his influence arose in the winter of 1791 the situation had become more and more difficult the court was more disloyal and more perverse as its hopes that the nightmare would come to an end became fainter in the summer of 1791 the german emperor the king of prussia and minor champions of retrograde causes issued the famous declaration of pilnitz the menace of intervention was the one element needed to make the position of the monarchy desperate it roused france to fever heat for along with the foreign kings were the french princes of the blood and the french nobles in the spring of 1792 the assembly forced the king to declare war against austria robespierre in spite of the strong tide of warlike feeling led the jacobin opposition to the war this is one of the most sagacious acts of his career for the hazards of the conflict were terrible if the foreigners and the emigrant nobles were victorious all that the revolution had won would be instantly and irretrievably lost if on the other hand the french armies were victorious one of two disasters might follow either the troops might become a weapon in the hands of the court and the reactionary party for the suppression of all the progressive parties alike or else their general might make himself supreme robespierre divined what the girondins did not that narbonne and the court in accepting the cry for war were secretly designing first to crush the faction of emigrant nobles then to make the king popular at home and thus finally to construct a strong royalist army the constitutional party in the legislative assembly had the same ideas as narbonne the girondins sought war first from a genuine if not a profoundly wise enthusiasm for liberty which they would fain have spread all over the world and next because they thought that war would increase their popularity and give them decisive control of the situation  the first effect of the war declared in april 1792 was to shake down the throne operations had no sooner begun than the king became an object of bitter and amply warranted suspicion neither the leaders nor the people had forgotten his flight a year before to place himself at the head of the foreign invaders nor the letter that he had left behind him for the national assembly protesting against all that had been done they were again reminded of what short shrift they might expect if the kings friends should come back the duke of brunswick at the head of the foreign army set out on his march and issued his famous proclamation to the inhabitants of france he demanded immediate and unconditional submission he threatened with fire and sword every town village or hamlet that should dare to defend itself and finally he swore that if the smallest violence or insult were done to the king or his family the city of paris should be handed over to military execution and absolute destruction this insensate document bears marks in every line of the implacable hate and burning thirst for revenge that consumed the aristocratic refugees only civil war can awaken such rage as brunswicks manifesto betrayed it was drawn up by the french nobles at coblenz he merely signed it the reply to it was the memorable insurrection of the tenth of august 1792 the king was thrown into prison and the legislative assembly made way for the national convention  robespierres part in the great rising of august was only secondary only a few weeks before he had started a journal and written articles in a constitutional sense m dhéricault believes a story that robespierres aim in this had been to have himself accepted as tutor for the young dauphin it is impossible to prove a negative but we find great difficulty in believing that such a post could ever have been an object of robespierres ambition now and always he showed a rather singular preference for the substance of power over its glitter he was vain and an egoist but in spite of this and in spite of his passion for empty phrases he was not without a sense of reality  the insurrection of the 10th of august however was the idea not of robespierre but of a more commanding personage who now became one of the foremost of the jacobin chiefs de maistre that ardent champion of reaction found a striking argument for the presence of the divine hand in the revolution in the intense mediocrity of the revolutionary leaders how could such men he asked have achieved such results if they had not been instruments of the directing will of heaven danton at any rate is above this caustic criticism danton was of the herculean type of a luther though without luthers deep vision of spiritual things or a chatham though without chathams august majesty of life or a cromwell though without cromwells calm steadfastness of patriotic purpose his visage and port seemed to declare his character dark overhanging brows eyes that had the gleam of lightning a savage mouth an immense head the voice of a stentor madame roland pictured him as a fiercer sardanapalus artists called him jove the thunderer his enemies saw in him the satan of the paradise lost he was no moral regenerator the difference between him and robespierre is typified in dantons version of an old saying that he who hates vices hates men he was not free from that careless lifecontemning desperation which sometimes belongs to forcible natures danton cannot be called noble because nobility implies a purity an elevation and a kind of seriousness which were not his he was too heedless of his good name and too blind to the truth that though right and wrong may be near neighbours yet the line that separates them is of an awful sacredness if robespierre passed for a hypocrite by reason of his scruple danton seemed a desperado by his airs of immoral thoughtlessness but the world forgives much to a royal size and danton was one of the men who strike deep notes he had that largeness of motive fulness of nature and capaciousness of mind which will always redeem a multitude of infirmities  though the author of some of the most tremendous and farsounding phrases of an epoch that was only too rich in them yet phrases had no empire over him he was their master not their dupe of all the men who succeeded mirabeau as directors of the unchained forces we feel that danton alone was in his true element action which poisoned the blood of such men as robespierre and drove such men as vergniaud out of their senses with exaltation was to danton his native sphere when france was for a moment discouraged it was he who nerved her to new effort by the electrifying cry we must dare and again dare and without end dare if his rivals or his friends seemed too intent on trifles too apt to confound side issues with the central aim of the battle danton was ever ready to urge them to take a juster measurewhen the edifice is all ablaze i take little heed of the knaves who are pilfering the household goods i rush to put out the flames when base egoism was compromising a cause more priceless than the personality of any man it was danton who made them ashamed by the soulinspiring exclamation let my name be blotted out and my memory perish if only france may be free the girondins denounced the popular clubs of paris as hives of lawlessness and outrage danton warned them that it were wiser to go to these seething societies and to guide them than to waste breath in futile denunciation a nation in revolution he cried to them in a superb figure is like the bronze boiling and foaming and purifying itself in the cauldron not yet is the statue of liberty cast fiercely boils the metal have an eye on the furnace or the flame will surely scorch you if there was murderous work below the hatches that was all the more reason why the steersman should keep his hand strong and ready on the wheel with an eye quick for each new drift in the hurricane and each new set in the raging currents this is ever the figure under which one conceives dantona titanic shape doing battle with the fury of the seas yielding while flood upon flood sweeps wildly over him and then with unshaken foothold and undaunted front once more surveying the waste of waters and striving with dexterous energy to force the straining vessel over the waters of the bar  la fayette had called the huge giant of popular force from its squalid lurkingplaces and now he trembled before its presence and fled from it shrieking with averted hands marat thrust swords into the giants halfunwilling grasp and plied him with bloody incitement to slay hip and thigh and so filled the land with a horror that has not faded from out of mens minds to this day danton instantly discerned that the problem was to preserve revolutionary energy and still to persuade the insurgent forces to retire once more within their boundaries robespierre discerned this too but he was paralysed and bewildered by his own principles as the convinced doctrinaire is so apt to be amid the perplexities of practice the teaching of rousseau was ever pouring like thin smoke among his ideas and clouding his view of actual conditions the tenth of august produced a considerable change in robespierres point of view it awoke him to the precipitous steepness of the slope down which the revolutionary car was rushing headlong his faith in the infallibility of the people suffered no shock but he was in a moment alive to the need of walking warily and his whole march from now until the end twentythree months later became timorous cunning and oblique his intelligence seemed to move in subterranean tunnels with the gleam of an equivocal premiss at one end and the mist of a vague conclusion at the other  the enthusiastic pedant with his narrow understanding his thin purism and his idyllic sentimentalism found that the summoning archangel of his paradise proved to be a ruffian with a pike the shock must have been tremendous robespierre did not quail nor retreat he only revised his notion of the situation a curious interview once took place between him and marat robespierre began by assuring the friend of the people that he quite understood the atrocious demands for blood with which the columns of marats newspaper were filled to be merely useful exaggerations of his real designs marat repelled the disparaging imputation of clemency and common sense and talked in his familiar vein of poniarding brigands burning despots alive in their palaces and impaling the traitors of the assembly on their own benches robespierre says marat listened to me with affright he turned pale and said nothing the interview confirmed the opinion i had always had of him that he united the integrity of a thoroughly honest man and the zeal of a good patriot with the enlightenment of a wise senator but that he was without either the views or the audacity of a real statesman the picture is instructive for it shows us robespierres invariable habit of leaving violence and iniquity unrebuked of conciliating the practitioners of violence and iniquity and of contenting himself with an inward hope of turning the world into a right course by fine words he had no audacity in marats sense but he was no coward he knew as all these men knew that almost from hour to hour he carried his life in his hand yet he declined to seek shelter in the obscurity which saved such men as sieyès but if he had courage he had not the initiative of a man of action he invented none of the ideas or methods of the revolution not even the reign of terror but he was very dexterous in accepting or appropriating what more audacious spirits than himself had devised and enforced the pedant cursed with the ambition to be a ruler of men is a curious study he would be glad not to go too far and yet his chief dread is lest he be left behind his consciousness of pure aims allows him to become an accomplice in the worst crimes suspecting himself at bottom to be a theorist he hastens to clear his character as man of practice by conniving at an enormity thus in september 1792 a band of miscreants committed the grievous massacres in the prisons of paris robespierre though the best evidence goes to show that he not only did not abet the prison murders but in his heart deplored them yet after the event did not scruple to justify what had been done this was the beginning of a long course of compliance with sanguinary misdeeds for which robespierre has been as hotly execrated as if he prompted them we do not for the moment measure the relative degrees of guilt that attached to mere compliance on the one hand and cruel origination on the other but his position in the revolution is not rightly understood unless we recognise him as being in almost every case an accessory after the fact  between the fall of lewis in 1792 and the fall of robespierre in 1794 france was the scene of two main series of events one set comprises the repulse of the invaders the suppression of an extensive civil war and the attempted reconstruction of a social framework the other comprises the rapid phases of an internecine struggle of violent and shortlived factions by an unhappy fatality due partly to antidemocratic prejudice and partly to mens unfailing passion for melodrama the reign of terror has been popularly taken for the central and most important part of the revolutionary epic this is nearly as absurd as it would be to make gustave flourens manifestation of the fifth of october or the rising of the thirtyfirst of october the most prominent features in a history of the war of french defence in our own day in truth the terror was a mere episode and just as the rising of october 1870 was due to marshal bazaines capitulation at metz it is easy to see that with one exception every violent movement in paris from 1792 to 1794 was due to menace or disaster on the frontier every one of the famous days of paris was an answer to some enemy without the storm of the tuileries on the tenth of august as we have already said was the response to brunswicks proclamation the bloody days of september were the reaction of panic at the capture of longwy and verdun by the prussians the surrender of cambrai provoked the execution of marie antoinette the defeat of aixlachapelle produced the abortive insurrection of the tenth of march and the treason of dumouriez the reverses of custine and the rebellion in la vendée produced the effectual insurrection of the thirtyfirst of may 1793 the last of these two risings of paris headed by the commune against the convention which was until then controlled by the girondins at length gave the government of france and the defence of the revolution definitely over to the jacobins their patriotic dictatorship lasted unbroken for a short period of ten months and then the great party broke up into factions the splendid triumphs of the dictatorship have been in england at any rate too usually forgotten and only the crimes of the factions remembered robespierres history unfortunately belongs to the less important battle   ii  the girondins were driven out of the convention by the insurgent parisians at the beginning of june 1793 the movement may be roughly compared to that of the independents in our own rebellion when the army compelled the withdrawal of eleven of the presbyterian leaders from the parliament or it may recall prides memorable purge of the same famous assembly both cases illustrate the common truth that large deliberative bodies be they never so excellent for purposes of legislation and even for a general control of the executive government in ordinary times are found to be essentially unfit for directing a military crisis if there are any historic examples that at first seem to contradict such a proposition it will be found that the bodies in question were close aristocracies like the great council of venice or the senate of rome in the strong days of the commonwealth they were never the creatures of popular election with varying aims and a diversified political spirit modern publicists have substituted the divine right of assemblies for the old divine right of monarchies those who condone the violence done to the king on the tenth of august and even acquiesce in his execution five months afterwards are relentless against the violence done to the convention on the thirtyfirst of may we confess ourselves unable to follow this transfer of the superstition of sacrosanctity from a king to a chamber no doubt the sooner a nation acquires a settled government the better for it provided the government be efficient but if it be not efficient the mischief of actively suppressing it may well be fully outweighed by the mischief of retaining it we have no wish to smooth over the perversities of a revolutionary time they cost a nation very dear but if all the elements of the state are in furious convulsion and uncontrollable effervescence then it is childish to measure the march of events by the standard of happier days of social peace and political order the prospect before france at the violent close of girondin supremacy was as formidable as any nation has ever yet had to confront in the history of the world rome was not more critically placed when the defeat of varro on the plain of cannæ had broken up her alliances and ruined her army the brave patriots of the netherlands had no gloomier outlook at that dolorous moment when the prince of orange had left them and alva had been appointed to bring them back by rapine conflagration and murder under the loathed yoke of the spanish tyrant  let us realise the conditions that robespierre and danton and the other jacobin leaders had now to face in the northwest one division of the fugitive girondins was forming an army at caen in the southwest another division was doing the same at bordeaux marseilles and lyons were rallying all the disaffected and reactionary elements in the southeast la vendée had flamed out in wild rebellion for church and king the strong places on the north frontier and the strong places on the east were in the hands of the foreign enemy the fate of the revolution lay in the issue of a struggle between paris with less than a score of departments on her side and all the rest of france and the whole european coalition marshalled against her and even this was not the worst in paris itself a very considerable proportion of its halfmillion of inhabitants were disaffected to the revolutionary cause reactionary historians dwell on the fact that such risings as that of the tenth of august were devised by no more than half of the sections into which paris was divided it was common they say for half a dozen individuals to take upon themselves to represent the fourteen or fifteen hundred other members of a section but what better proof can we have that if france was to be delivered from restored feudalism and foreign spoliation the momentous task must be performed by those who had sense to discern the awful peril and energy to encounter it  the girondins had made their incapacity plain the execution of the king had filled them with alarm and with hatred against the ruder and more robust party who had forced that startling act of vengeance upon them puny social disgusts prevented them from cooperating with danton or with robespierre prussia and austria were not more redoubtable or more hateful to them than was paris and they wasted in futile recriminations about the september massacres or the alleged peculations of municipal officers the time and the energy that should have been devoted without let or interruption to the settlement of the administration and the repulse of the foe it is impossible to think of such fine characters as vergniaud or madame roland without admiration or of their untimely fate without pity but the deliverance of a people beset by strong and implacable enemies could not wait on mere good manners and fastidious sentiments when these comely things were in company with the most stupendous want of foresight ever shown by a political party how can we measure the folly of men who so missed the conditions of the problem as to cry out in the convention itself almost within earshot of the jacobin club that if any insult were offered to the national representation the departments would rise paris would be annihilated and men would come to search on the banks of the seine whether such a city had ever existed it was to no purpose that danton urgently rebuked the senseless animosity with which the right poured incessant malediction on the left and the wild shrieking hate with which the left retaliated on the right the battle was to the death and it was the girondins who first menaced their political foes with vengeance and the guillotine as it happened the treason of dumouriez and their own ineptitude destroyed them before revenge was within reach such a consummation was fortunate for their country it was the girondins whose want of union and energy had by the middle of 1793 brought france to distraction and imminent ruin it was a short year of jacobin government that by the summer of 1794 had welded the nation together again and finally conquered the invasion the city of the seine had once more shown itself what it had been for nine centuries ever since the days of odo count of paris and first king of the french not merely a capital but france itself its living heart and surest bulwark  the immediate instrument of so rapid and extraordinary an achievement was the committee of public safety the french have never shown their quick genius for organisation with more triumphant vigour while the girondins were still powerful nine members of the convention had been constituted an executive committee april 6 1793 they were in fact a kind of permanent cabinet with practical irresponsibility in the summer of 1793 the number was increased from nine to twelve and these twelve were the centre of the revolutionary government they fell into three groups first there were the scientific or practical administrators of whom the most eminent was carnot next came the directors of internal policy the pure revolutionists headed by billaud de varennes finally there was a trio whose business it was to translate action into the phrases of revolutionary policy this famous group was robespierre couthon and saint just  besides the committee of public safety there was another chief governmental committee that of general security its functions were mainly connected with the police the arrests and the prisons but in all serious affairs the two committees deliberated in common there were also fourteen other groups of various size taken from the convention they applied themselves with admirable zeal and usually not with more zeal than skill to schemes of public instruction of finance of legislation of the administration of justice and a host of other civil reforms of all of which napoleon bonaparte was by and by to reap the credit these bodies completed the civil revolution which the constituent and the legislative assemblies had left so mischievously incomplete that as soon as ever the convention had assembled it was besieged by a host of petitioners praying them to explain and to pursue the abolition of the old feudal rights everything had still been left uncertain in mens minds even upon that greatest of all the revolutionary questions the feudal division of the committee of general legislation had in this eleventh hour to decide innumerable issues from those of the widest practical importance down to the prayer of a remote commune to be relieved from the charge of maintaining a certain mortuary lamp which had been a matter of seignorial obligation the work done by the radical jurisconsults was never undone it was the great and durable reward of the struggle and we have to remember that these industrious and efficient bodies as well as all other public bodies and functionaries whatever were placed by the definite revolutionary constitution of 1793 under the direct orders of the committee of public safety                                       it is hardly possible even now for any one who exults in the memory of the great deliverance of a brilliant and sociable people to stand unmoved before the walls of that palace which philibert delorme reared for catherine de medici and which was thrown into ruin by the madness of a band of desperate men in our own days lewis had walked forth from the tuileries on the fatal morning of the tenth of august holding his children by the hand and lightly noticing as he traversed the gardens how early that year the leaves were falling lewis had by this time followed the fallen leaves into nothingness the palace of the kings was now styled the palace of the nation and the new republic carried on its work surrounded by the outward associations of the old monarchy the convention after the spring of 1793 held its sittings in what had formerly been the palace theatre fierce men from the faubourgs of st antoine and st marceau and fiercer women from the markets shouted savage applause or menace from galleries where not so long ago the italian buffoons had amused the perpetual leisure of the finest ladies and proudest grandees of france the committee of general security occupied the pavillon de marsan looking over a dingy space that the conqueror at rivoli afterwards made the most dazzling street in europe the committee of public safety sat in the pavillon de flore at the opposite end of the tuileries on the river bank the approaches were protected by guns and by a bodyguard while inside there flitted to and fro a cloud of familiars who have been compared by the enemies of the great committee to the mutes of the court of the grand turk any one who had business with this awful body had to grope his way along gloomy corridors that were dimly lighted by a single lamp at either end the room in which the committee sat round a table of green cloth was incongruously gay with the clocks the bronzes the mirrors the tapestries of the ruined court the members met at eight in the morning and worked until one from one to four they attended the sitting of the convention in the evening they met again and usually sat until night was far advanced it was no wonder if their hue became cadaverous their eyes hollow and bloodshot their brows stern their glance preoccupied and sinister between ten and eleven every evening a sombre piece of business was transacted which has half effaced in the memory of posterity all the heroic industry of the rest of the twentyfour hours it was then that fouquiertinville the public prosecutor brought an account of his days labour how the revolutionary tribunal was working how many had been convicted and how many acquitted how large or how small had been the batch of the guillotine since the previous night across the breadth of the gardens beyond their trees and fountains stood the monster itself with its cruel symmetry its colour as of the blood of the dead its unheeding knife neutral as the fates  robespierre has been held responsible for all the violences of the revolutionary government and his position on the committee appeared to be exceedingly strong it was however for a long time much less strong in reality than it seemed all depended upon successfully playing off one force against another and at the same time maintaining himself at the centre of the seesaw robespierre was the literary and rhetorical member of the band he was the author of the strident manifestoes in which europe listened with exasperation to the audacious hopes and unfaltering purpose of the new france this had the effect of investing him in the eyes of foreign nations with supreme and undisputed authority over the government the truth is that robespierre was both disliked and despised by his colleagues they thought of him as a mere maker of useful phrases he in turn secretly looked down upon them as the man who has a doctrine and a system in his head always looks down upon the man who lives from hand to mouth if the committee had been in the place of a government which has no opposition to fear robespierre would have been one of its least powerful members but although the government was strong there were at least three potent elements of opposition even within the ranks of the dominant revolutionary party itself  three bodies in paris were each of them the centre of an influence that might at any moment become the triumphant rival of the committee of public safety these bodies were first the convention second the commune of paris and thirdly the jacobin club the jealousy thus existing outside the committee would have made any failure instantly destructive at one moment at the end of 1793 it was only the surrender of toulon that saved the committee from a hostile motion in the convention and such a motion would have sent half of them to the guillotine they were reviled by the extreme party who ruled at the town hall for not carrying the policy of extermination far enough they were reproached by danton and his powerful section for carrying that policy too far they were discredited by the small band of intriguers like bazire who identified government with peculation finally they were haunted by the shadow of a fear which events were by and by to prove only too substantial lest one of their military agents on the frontier should make himself their master the key to the struggle of the factions between the winter of 1793 and the revolution of the summer of 1794 is the vigorous resolve of the governing committees not to part with power the drama is one of the most exciting in the history of faction it abounds in rapid turns and unexpected shifts upon which the student may spend many a day and many a night and after all he is forced to leave off in despair of threading an accurate way through the labyrinth of passion and intrigue the broad traits of the situation however are tolerably simple the difficulty was to find a principle of government which the people could be induced to accept the rights of men and the new principles of liberty and equality burke said were very unhandy instruments for those who wished to establish a system of tranquillity and order the factions he added with fierce sarcasm were to accomplish the purposes of order morality and submission to the laws from the principles of atheism profligacy and sedition they endeavoured to establish distinctions by the belief of which they hoped to keep the spirit of murder safely bottled up and sealed for their own purposes without endangering themselves by the fumes of the poison which they prepared for their enemies this is a ferocious and passionate version but it is substantially not an unreal account of the position  upon one point all parties agreed and that was the necessity of founding the government upon force and force naturally meant terror their plea was that of dido to ilioneus and the stormbeaten sons of dardanus when they complained that her people had drawn the sword upon them and barbarously denied the hospitality of the sandy shore     res dura et regni novitas me talia cogunt moliri  and that pithy chapter in machiavellis prince which treats of cruelty and clemency and whether it be better to be loved or feared anticipates the defence of the terrorists in the maxim that for a new prince it is impossible to avoid the name of cruel because all new states abound in many perils the difference arose on the question when terror should be considered to have done as much of its work as it could be expected to do this difference again was connected with difference of conception as to the type of the society which was ultimately to emerge from the existing chaos billaudvarennes the guiding spirit of the committees was without any conception of this kind he was a man of force pure and simple danton was equally untouched by dreams of social transformation his philosophy so far as he had a definite philosophy was in spite of one or two inconsistent utterances materialistic and materialism when it takes root in a sane perspicacious and indulgent character as in the case of danton and to take a betterknown example in the case of jefferson usually leads to a sound and positive theory of politics chimeras have no place in it though a rational social hope has the first place of all neither danton nor billaud expected a millennium their only aim was to shape france into a coherent political personality and the war between them turned upon the policy of prolonging the terror after the frontiers had been saved and the risings in the provinces put down there were however two parties who took the literature of the century in earnest they thought that the hour had struck for translating one of them the sentimentalism of rousseau the other of them the rationality of voltaire and diderot into terms of politics that should form the basis of a new social life the strife between the faction of robespierre and the faction of chaumette was the reproduction under the shadow of the guillotine of the great literary strife of a quarter of a century before between jean jacques and the writers whom he contemptuously styled holbachians the battle of the books had become a battle between bands of infuriated men the struggle between hébert and chaumette and the common council of paris on the one part and the committee and robespierre on the other was the concrete form of the deepest controversy that lies before modern society can the social union subsist without a belief in god chaumette answered yes and robespierre cried no robespierre followed rousseau in thinking that any one who should refuse to recognise the existence of a god should be exiled as a monster devoid of the faculties of virtue and sociability chaumette followed diderot and diderot told samuel romilly in 1783 that belief in god as well as submission to kings would be at an end all over the world in a very few years the hébertists might have taken for their motto diderots shocking couplet if they could have known it about using     les entrailles du prêtre    au défaut dun cordon pour étrangler les rois  the theists and the atheists chaumette and robespierre each of them accepted the doctrine that it was in the power of the armed legislator to impose any belief and any rites he pleased upon the country at his feet the theism or the atheism of the new france depended as they thought on the issue of the war for authority between the hébertists in the common council of paris and the committee of public safety that was the religious side of the attitude of the government to the opposition and it is the side that possesses most historic interest billaud cared very little for religion in any way his quarrel with the commune and with hébert was political what robespierres drift appears to have been was to use the political animosity of the committee as a means of striking foes against whom his own animosity was not only political but religious also  it would doubtless show a very dull apprehension of the violence and confusion of the time to suppose that even robespierre with all his love for concise theories was accustomed to state his aim to himself with the definite neatness in which it appears when reduced to literary statement pedant as he was he was yet enough of a politician to see the practical urgency of restoring material order whatever spiritual belief or disbelief might accompany it the prospect of a rallying point for material order was incessantly changing and robespierre turned to different quarters in search of it almost from week to week he was only able to exert a certain limited authority over his colleagues in the government by virtue of his influence over the various sections of possible opposition and this was a moral and not an official influence it was acquired not by marked practical gifts for in truth robespierre did not possess them but by his good character by his rhetoric and by the skill with which he kept himself prominently before the public eye the effective seat of his power notwithstanding many limits and incessant variations was the jacobin club there a speech from him threw his listeners into ecstasies that have been disrespectfully compared to the paroxysms of jansenist convulsionaries or the hysterics of methodist negroes on a cotton plantation we naturally think of those grave men who a few years before had founded the republic in america jefferson served with washington in the virginian legislature and with franklin in congress and he afterwards said that he never heard either of them speak ten minutes at a time while john adams declared that he never heard jefferson utter three sentences together of robespierre it is stated on good authority that for eighteen months there was not a single evening on which he did not make to the assembled jacobins at least one speech and that never a short one  strange as it may seem robespierres credit with this grim assembly was due to his truly philistine respectability and to his literary faculty he figured as the philosopher and bookman of the party the most iconoclastic politicians are usually willing to respect the scholar provided they are sure of his being on their side robespierre had from the first discountenanced the fantastic caprices of some too excitable allies he distrusted the noisy patriots of the middle class who curried favour with the crowd by clothing themselves in coarse garments clutching a pike and donning the famous cap of red woollen which had been the emblem of the emancipation of a slave in ancient rome one night at the jacobin club robespierre mounted the tribune dressed with his usual elaborate neatness and still wearing powder in his hair an onlooker unceremoniously planted on the orators head the red cap demanded by revolutionary etiquette robespierre threw the sacred symbol on the ground with a severe air and then proceeded with a discourse of much austerity not that he was averse to a certain seemly decoration or to the embodiment of revolutionary sentiment by means of a symbolism that strikes our cooler imagination as rather puerile he was as ready as others to use the arts of the theatre for the liturgy of patriots one of the most touching of all the minor dramatic incidents of the revolution was the death of barra this was a child of thirteen who enrolled himself as a drummer and marched with the blues to suppress the rebel whites in la vendée one day he advanced too close to the enemys post intrepidly beating the charge he was surrounded but the peasant soldiers were loth to strike cry long live the king they shouted or else death long live the republic was the poor little heros answer as a ball pierced his heart robespierre described the incident to the convention and amid prodigious enthusiasm demanded that the body of the young martyr of liberty should be transported to the pantheon with special pomp and that david the artist of the revolution should be charged with the duty of devising and embellishing the festival as it happened the arrangements were made for the ceremony to take place on the tenth of thermidora day on which robespierre and all paris were concerned about a celebration of bloodier import thermidor however was still far off and the red sun of jacobin enthusiasm seemed as if it would shine unclouded for ever  even at the jacobins however popular as he was robespierre felt every instant the necessity of walking cautiously he was as far removed as possible from that position of dictator which some historians with a wearisome iteration persist in ascribing to him even at the moment when they are enumerating the defeats which the party of hébert was able to inflict upon him in the very bosom of the mother club itself they make him the sanguinary dictator in one sentence and the humiliated intriguer in the next the latter is much the more correct account of the two if we choose to call a man an intriguer who was honestly anxious to suppress what he considered a wicked faction and yet had need of some dexterity to keep his own head upon his shoulders                                       in the winter of 1793 the municipal party guided by hébert and chaumette made their memorable attempt to extirpate christianity in france the doctrine of dholbachs suppertable had for a short space the arm of flesh and the sword of the temporal power on its side it was the first appearance of dogmatic atheism in europe as a political force this makes it one of the most remarkable moments in the revolution just as it makes the revolution itself the most remarkable moment in modern history the first political demonstration of atheism was attended by some of the excesses the folly the extravagances that stained the growth of christianity on the whole it is a very mild story compared with the atrocities of the jewish records or the crimes of catholicism the worst charge against the party of chaumette is that they were intolerant and the charge is deplorably true but this charge cannot lie in the mouth of persecuting churches  historical recriminations however are not very edifying it is perfectly fair when catholics talk of the atheist terror to rejoin that the retainers of anjou and montpensier slew more men and women on the first day of the saint bartholomew than perished in paris through the years i and ii but the retort does us no good beyond the region of dialectic it rather brings us down to the level of the poor sectaries whom it crushes let us raise ourselves into clearer air the fault of the atheist is that they knew no better than to borrow the maxims of the churchmen and even those who agree with the dogmatic denials of the atheistsif such there beought yet to admit that the mere change from superstition to reason is a small gain if the conclusions of reason are still to be enforced by the instruments of superstition our opinions are less important than the spirit and temper with which they possess us and even good opinions are worth very little unless we hold them in a broad intelligent and spacious way now some of the opinions of chaumette were full of enlightenment and hope he had a generous and vivid faith in humanity and he showed the natural effect of abandoning belief in another life by his energetic interest in arrangements for improving the lot of man in this life but it would be far better to share the superstitious opinions of a virtuous and benignant priest like the bishop in victor hugos misérables than to hold those good opinions of chaumette as he held them with a rancorous intolerance a reckless disregard of the rights and feelings of others and a shallow forgetfulness of all that great and precious part of our natures that lies out of the immediate domain of the logical understanding one can understand how an honest man would abhor the darkness and tyranny of the church but then to borrow the same absolutism in the interests of new light was inevitably to bring the new light into the same abhorrence as had befallen the old system of darkness and this is exactly what happened in every family where a mother sought to have her child baptized or where sons and daughters sought to have the dying spirit of the old consoled by the last sacrament there sprang up a bitter enemy to the government which had closed the churches and proscribed the priests  how could a society whose spiritual life had been nourished in the solemn mysticism of the middle ages suddenly turn to embrace a gaudy paganism the common selfrespect of humanity was outraged by apostate priests who whether under the pressure of fear of chaumette or in a very superfluity of folly and ecstasy of degradation hastened to proclaim the charlatanry of their past lives as they filed before the convention led by the archbishop of paris and accompanied by rude acolytes bearing piles of the robes and the vessels of silver and gold with which they had once served their holy offices our enemies voltaire had said have always on their side the fat of the land the sword the strong box and the canaille for a moment all these forces were on the other side and it is deplorable to think that they were as much abused by their new masters as by the old the explanation is that the destructive party had been brought up in the schools of the ecclesiastical party and their work was a mere outbreak of mutiny not a grave and responsible attempt to lead france to a worthier faith if as chaumette believed mankind are the only providence of men surely in that faith more than in any other are we bound to be very solicitous not to bring the violent hand of power on any of the spiritual acquisitions of the race and very patient in dealing with the slowness of the common people to leave their outworn creeds  instead of defying the church by the theatrical march of the goddess of reason under the great sombre arches of the cathedral of our lady chaumette should have found comfort in a firm calculation of the conditions you he might have said to the priestsyou have so debilitated the minds of men and women by your promises and your dreams that many a generation must come and go before europe can throw off the yoke of your superstition but we promise you that they shall be generations of strenuous battle we give you all the advantages that you can get from the sincerity and pious worth of the good and simple among you we give you all that the bad among you may get by resort to the poisoned weapons of your profession and its traditionsits bribes to mental indolence its hypocritical affectations in the pulpit its tyranny in the closet its false speciousness in the world its menace at the deathbed with all these you may do your worst and still humanity will escape you still the conscience of the race will rise away from you still the growth of brighter ideals and a nobler purpose will go on leaving ever further and further behind them your dwarfed finality and leaden moveless stereotype we shall pass you by on your flank your fieriest darts will only spend themselves on air we will not attack you as voltaire did we will not exterminate you we shall explain you history will place your dogma in its class above or below a hundred competing dogmas exactly as the naturalist classifies his species from being a conviction it will sink to a curiosity from being the guide to millions of human lives it will dwindle down to a chapter in a book as history explains your dogma so science will dry it up the conception of law will silently make the conception of the daily miracle of your altars seem impossible the mental climate will gradually deprive your symbols of their nourishment and men will turn their backs on your system not because they have confuted it but because like witchcraft or astrology it has ceased to interest them the great ship of your church once so stout and fair and well laden with good destinies is become a skeleton ship it is a phantom hulk with warped planks and sere canvas and you who work it are no more than ghosts of dead men and at the hour when you seem to have reached the bay down your ship will sink like lead or like stone to the deepest bottom  alas the speculation of the century had not rightly attuned mens minds to this firm confidence in the virtue of liberty sounding like a bell through all distractions none of these high things were said the temples were closed the sacred symbols defiled the priests maltreated the worshippers dispersed the commune of paris imitated the policy of the king of france who revoked the edict of nantes and democratic atheism parodied the dragonnades of absolutist catholicism                                       robespierre was unutterably outraged by the proceedings of the atheists they perplexed him as a politician intent upon order and they afflicted him sorely as an ardent disciple of the savoyard vicar hébert however was so strong that it needed some courage to attack him nor did robespierre dare to withstand him to the face but he did not flinch from making an energetic assault upon atheism and the excesses of its partisans his admirers usually count his speech of the twentyfirst of november one of the most admirable of his oratorical successes the sphinx still sits inexorable at our gates and his words have lost none of their interest every philosopher and every individual he said may adopt whatever opinion he pleases about atheism any one who wishes to make such an opinion into a crime is an insensate but the public man or the legislator who should adopt such a system would be a hundred times more insensate still the national convention abhors it the convention is not the author of a scheme of metaphysics it was not to no purpose that it published the declaration of the rights of man in presence of the supreme being i shall be told perhaps that i have a narrow intelligence that i am a man of prejudice and a fanatic i have already said that i spoke neither as an individual nor as a philosopher with a system but as a representative of the people atheism is aristocratic the idea of a great being who watches over oppressed innocence and punishes triumphant crime is essentially the idea of the people this is the sentiment of europe and the universe it is the sentiment of the french nation that people is attached neither to priests nor to superstition nor to ceremonies it is attached only to worship in itself or in other words to the idea of an incomprehensible power the terror of wrongdoers the stay and comfort of virtue to which it delights to render words of homage that are all so many anathemas against injustice and triumphant crime  this is robespierres favourite attitude the priest posing as statesman like others he declares the supreme power incomprehensible and then describes him in terms of familiar comprehension he first declares atheism an open choice and then he brands it with the most odious epithet in the accepted vocabulary of the hour danton followed practically the same line though saying much less about it if greece he said in the convention had its olympian games france too shall solemnise her sansculottid days the people will have high festivals they will offer incense to the supreme being to the master of nature for we never intended to annihilate the reign of superstition in order to set up the reign of atheism if we have not honoured the priest of error and fanaticism neither do we wish to honour the priest of incredulity we wish to serve the people i demand that there shall be an end of these antireligious masquerades in the convention  there was an end of the masquerading but the hébertists still kept their ground danton robespierre and the committee were all equally impotent against them for some months longer the revolutionary force had been too strong to be resisted by any government since the paris insurgents had carried both king and assembly in triumph from versailles in the october of 1789 it was now too strong for those who had begun to strive with all their might to build a new government out of the agencies that had shattered the old to pieces for some months the battle which had been opened by robespierres remonstrance against atheistic intolerance degenerated into a series of masked skirmishes the battleground of rival principles was overshadowed by the baleful wings of the genius of demonic hate vexilla regis prodeunt inferni the banners of the king of the pit came forth the scene at the cordeliers for a time became as frantic as a council of the early church settling the true composition of the holy trinity or it recalls the fierce and bloody contentions between demos and oligarchy in an old greek town we think of the day in the harbour of corcyra when the athenian admiral who had come to deliver the people sailed out to meet the spartan enemy and on turning round to see if his corcyrean allies were following saw them following indeed but the crew of every ship striving in enraged conflict with one another collot dherbois had come back in hot haste from lyons where along with fouché he had done his best to carry out the decree of the convention that not one stone of the city should be left on the top of another and that even its very name should cease from the lips of men carrier was recalled from nantes where his feats of ingenious massacre had rivalled the exploits of the cruellest and maddest of the roman emperors the presence of these men of blood gave new courage and resolution to the hébertists though the alliance was informal yet as against danton camille desmoulins and the rest of the indulgents as well as against robespierre they made common cause  camille desmoulins attacked hébert in successive numbers of a journal that is perhaps the one truly literary monument of this stage of the revolution hébert retaliated by impugning the patriotism of desmoulins in the club and the unfortunate wit notwithstanding the efforts of robespierre on his behalf was for a while turned out of the sacred precincts the power of the extreme faction was shown in relation to other prominent members of the party whom they loved to stigmatise by the deadly names of indulgent and moderantist even danton himself was attacked december 1793 and the integrity of his patriotism brought into question robespierre made an energetic defence of his great rival in the hierarchy of revolution and the defence saved danton from the mortal ignominy of expulsion from the communion of the orthodox on the other hand anacharsis clootz that guileless ally of the party of delirium was less fortunate robespierre assailed the cosmopolitan for being a german baron for having four thousand pounds a year and for striking his sansculottism some notes higher than the regular pitch even m louis blanc calls this an iniquity and sets it down as the worst page in robespierres life others have described robespierre as struck at this time by the dire malady of kingshatred of the idea it seems however a hard saying that devotion to the idea is to extinguish common sense clootz notwithstanding his simple and disinterested character and his possession of some rays of the modern illumination was one of the least sane of all the men who in the exultation of their silly gladness were suddenly caught up by that great wheel of fire all we can say is that robespierres bitter demeanour towards clootz was ungenerous but then this is only natural in him robespierre often clothed cool policy in the semblance of clemency but i cannot hear in any phrase he ever used or see in any measure he ever proposed the mark of true generosity of kingliness of spirit not a trace he had no element of ready and cordial propitiation an element that can never be wanting in the greatest leaders in time of storm if he resisted the atrocious proposals to put madame elizabeth to death he was thinking not of mercy or justice but of the mischievous effect that her execution would have upon the public opinion of europe and he was so unmanly as to speak of her as la méprisable soeur de louis xvi such a phrase is the disclosure of an abject stratum in his soul  yet this did not prevent him from seeing and denouncing the bloody extravagances of the proconsuls the representatives of parisian authority in the provinces nor from standing firm against the execution of the seventythree who had been bold enough to question the purgation of the national convention on the thirtyfirst of may but the return of collot dherbois made the situation more intricate collot was by his position the ally of billaud and to attack him therefore was to attack the most powerful member of the committee of public safety billaud was too formidable he was always the impersonation of the ruder genius of the revolution and the incarnation of the philosophy of the terror not as a delirium but as a piece of deliberate policy his pale sober and concentrated physiognomy seemed a perpetual menace he had no gifts of speech but his silence made people shudder like the silence of the thunder when the tempest rages at its height it was said by contemporaries that if vadier was a hyæna barère a jackal and robespierre a cat billaud was a tiger  the cat perceived that he was in danger of not having the tiger jackal and hyæna on his side robespierre in whom spasmodical courage and timidity ruled by rapid turns began to suspect that he had been premature and a convenient illness which some suppose to have been feigned excused his withdrawal for some weeks from a scene where he felt that he could no longer see clear we cannot doubt that both he and danton were perfectly assured that the anarchic party must unavoidably roll headlong into the abyss but the hour of doom was uncertain to make a mistake in the right moment to hurry the crisis was instant death robespierre was a more adroit calculator than danton we must not confound his thin and querulous reserve with that stout and deepbrowed patience which may imply as superb a fortitude and may demand as much iron control in a statesman as the most heroic exploits of political energy but his habit of waiting on force instead of like the other taking the initiative with force had trained his sight the mixture of astuteness with his scruple of egoistic policy with his stiffness for doctrine gave him an advantage over danton that made his life worth exactly three months more purchase than dantons it has been said that spinozism or transcendentalism in poetic production becomes machiavellism in reflection for the same reasons we may always expect sentimentalism in theory to become under the pressure of action a very selfprotecting guile robespierres mind was not rich nor flexible enough for true statesmanship and it is a grave mistake to suppose that the various cunning tacks in which his career abounds were any sign of genuine versatility or resource or political growth and expansion they were in fact the resort of a man whose nerves were weaker than his volition robespierre was a kind of spinster force of head did not match his spiritual ambition he was not we repeat a coward in any common sense in that case he would have remained quiet among the croaking frogs of the marsh and by and by have come to hold a portfolio under the first consul he did not fear death and he envied with consuming envy those to whom nature had given the qualities of initiative but his nerves always played him false the consciousness of having to resolve to take a decided step alone was the precursor of a fit of trembling his heart did not fail but he could not control the parched voice nor the twitching features not the ghastly palsy of inner misgiving in this respect robespierre recalls a more illustrious man we think of cicero tremblingly calling upon the senate to decide for him whether he should order the execution of the catilinarian conspirators it is to be said however in his favour that he had the art which cicero lacked to hide his pusillanimity robespierre knew himself and did his best to keep his own secret  his absence during the final crisis of the anarchic party allowed events to ripen without committing him to that initiative in dangerous action which he had dreaded on the tenth of august as he dreaded it on every other decisive day of this burning time the party of the commune became more and more daring in their invectives against the convention and the committees at length they proclaimed open insurrection but paris was cold and opinion was divided in the night of the thirteenth of march hébert chaumette clootz were arrested the next day robespierre recovered sufficiently to appear at the jacobin club he joined his colleagues of the committee of public safety in striking the blow on the twentyfourth of march the ultrarevolutionist leaders were beheaded  the first bloody breach in the jacobin ranks was speedily followed by the second the right wing of the opposition to the committee soon followed the left down the ways to dusty death and the execution of the anarchists only preceded by a week the arrest of the moderates when the seizure of danton had once before been discussed in the committee robespierre resisted the proposal violently we have already seen how he defended danton at the jacobin club when the club underwent the process of purification in the winter what produced this sudden tack how came robespierre to assent in march to a violence which he had angrily discountenanced in february there had been no change in the policy or attitude of danton himself the military operations against the domestic and foreign enemies were no sooner fairly in the way of success than danton began to meditate in serious earnest the consolidation of a republican system of law and justice he would fain have stayed the terror let us leave something he said to the guillotine of opinion he aided no doubt in the formation of the revolutionary tribunal but this was exactly in harmony with his usual policy of controlling popular violence without alienating the strength of popular sympathy the process of the tribunal was rough and summary but it was faireruntil robespierres law of prairialthan people usually suppose and it was the very temple of the goddess of justice herself compared with the september massacres let us prove ourselves terrible danton said to relieve the people from the necessity of being so his activity had been incessant in urging and superintending the great levies against the foreigner he had gone repeatedly on distant and harassing expeditions as the representative of the convention at the camps on the frontier in the midst of all this he found time to press forward measures for the instruction of the young and for the due appointment of judges and his head was full of ideas for the construction of a permanent executive council it was this which made him eager for a cessation of the method of terror and it was this which made the committee of public safety his implacable enemy  why then did robespierre who also passed as a man of order and humanity not continue to support danton after the suppression of the hébertists as he had supported him before the common and facile answer is that he was moved by a malignant desire to put a rival out of the way on the whole the evidence seems to support napoleons opinion that robespierre was incapable of voting for the death of anybody in the world on grounds of personal enmity and his acquiescence in the ruin of danton is intelligible enough on the grounds of selfish policy the committee hated danton for the good reason that he had openly attacked them and his cry for clemency was an inflammatory and dangerous protest against their system now robespierre rightly or wrongly had made up his mind that the committee was the instrument by which and which only he could work out his own vague schemes of power and reconstruction and in any case how could he resist the committee the famous insurrectionary force of paris which danton had been the first to organise against a government had just been chilled by the fall of the hébertists least of all could this force be relied upon to rise in defence of the very chief whose every word for many weeks past had been a protest against the communal leaders in separating himself from the ultras danton had cut off the great reservoir of his peculiar strength  it may be said that the convention was the proper centre of resistance to the designs of the committee and that if danton and robespierre had united their forces in the convention they would have defeated billaud and his allies this seems to us more than doubtful the committee had acquired an immense preponderance over the convention they had been eminently successful in the immense tasks imposed upon them they had the prestige not only of being the governmentso great a thing in a country that had just emerged from the condition of a centralised monarchy they had also the prestige of being a government that had done its work triumphantly we are now in march in july we shall find that robespierre adopted the very policy that we are now discussing of playing off the convention against the committee in july that policy ended in his headlong fall why should it have been any more successful four months earlier  what we may say is that robespierre was bound in all morality to defend danton in the convention at every hazard possibly so but then to run risks for chivalrys sake was not in robespierres nature and no man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character his narrow head and thin blood and instable nerve his calculating humour and his frigid egoism disinclined him to all games of chance his apologists have sought to put a more respectable colour on his abandonment of danton the precisian they say disapproved of dantons lax and heedless courses danton said to him one daywhat do i care public opinion is a strumpet and posterity a piece of nonsense how should the puritanical lawyer endure such cynicism as this and danton delighted in inflicting these coarse shocks again danton had given various gross names of contempt to saint just was robespierre not to feel insults offered to the ablest and most devoted of his lieutenants what was more important than all the acclamations with which the partisans of reaction greeted the fall of the ultras made it necessary to give instant and unmistakable notice to the foes of the revolution that the goddess of the scorching eye and fiery hand still grasped the axe of her vengeance  these are pleas invented after the fact all goes to show that robespierre was really moved by nothing more than his invariable dread of being left behind of finding himself on the weaker side of not seeming practical and political enough and having made up his mind that the stronger party was bent on the destruction of the dantonists he became fiercer than billaud himself it is constantly seen that the waverer of nervous atrabiliar constitution no sooner overcomes the agony of irresolution than he flings himself on his object with a vindictive tenacity that seems to repay him for all the moral humiliation inflicted on him by his stifled doubts he redeems the slowness of his approach by the fury of his spring robespierre says m dhéricault precipitated himself to the front of the opinion that was yelling against his friends of yesterday in order to keep his usual post in the van of the revolution in order to secure the advantage to his own popularity of an execution which the public voice seemed to demand he came forward as the author of that execution though only the day before he had hesitated about its utility and though it was in truth far less useful to him than it proved to be to his future antagonists  robespierre first alarmed dantons friends by assuming a certain icy coldness of manner and by some menacing phrases about the faction of the socalled moderates danton had gone as he often did to his native village of arcissuraube to seek repose and a little clearness of sight in the night that wrapped him about he was devoid of personal ambition he never had any humour for mere factious struggles his again was the temperament of violent force and in such types the reaction is always tremendous the indomitable activity of the last twenty months had bred weariness of spirit the nemesis of a career of strenuous will in large natures is apt to be a sudden sense of the irony of things in danton as with byron it happened afterwards the vehemence of the revolutionary spirit was touched by this desolating irony his friends tried to rouse him it is not clear that he could have done anything the balance of force after the suppression of the hébertists was irretrievably against him as calculation had already revealed to robespierre  there are various stories of the pair having met at dinner almost on the eve of dantons arrest and parting with sombre disquietude on both sides the interview with its champagne its interlocutors its play of sinister repartee may possibly have taken place but the alleged details are plainly apocryphal after all religion ist in der thiere trieb says wallenstein the very savage drinks not with the victim into whose breast he means to plunge a sword danton was warned that robespierre was plotting his arrest if i thought he had the bare idea said danton with something of gargantuan hyperbole i would eat his bowels out such was the disdain with which the giant of the mighty bone and bold emprise thought of our meagrehearted pedant the truth is that in the stormy and distracted times of politics and perhaps in all times contempt is a dangerous luxury a man may be a very poor creature and still have a faculty for mischief and robespierre had this faculty in the case of danton with singular baseness he handed over to saint just a collection of notes to serve as material for the indictment which saint just was to present to the convention they comprised everything that suspicion could interpret malignantly from the most conspicuous acts of dantons public life down to the casual freedom of private discourse  another infamy was to follow after the arrest and on the proceedings to obtain the assent of the convention to the trial of danton and others of its members one only of their friends had the courage to rise and demand that they should be heard at the bar robespierre burst out in cold rage he asked whether they had undergone so many heroic sacrifices counting among them these acts of painful severity only to fall under the yoke of a band of domineering intriguers and he cried out impatiently that they would brook no claim of privilege and suffer no rotten idol the word was felicitously chosen for the convention dreaded to have its independence suspected and it dreaded this all the more because at this time its independence did not really exist the vote against danton was unanimous and the fact that it was so is the deepest stain on the fame of this assembly on the afternoon of the sixteenth germinal april 5 1794 paris in amazement and some stupefaction saw the oncedreaded titan of the mountain fast bound in the tumbril and faring towards the sharpclanging knife i leave it all in a frightful welter danton is reported to have said not a man of them has an idea of government robespierre will follow me he is dragged down by me ah better be a poor fisherman than meddle with the governing of men                                       let us pause for a moment over a calmer reminiscence this was the very day on which the virtuous and highminded condorcet quitted the friendly roof that for nine months had concealed him from the search of proscription the same week he was found dead in his prison while danton was storming with impotent thunder before the tribunal condorcet was writing those closing words of his sketch of human progress which are always so full of strength and edification how this picture of the human race freed from all its fetterswithdrawn from the empire of chance as from that of the enemies of progress and walking with firm and assured step in the way of truth of virtue and happiness presents to the philosopher a sight that consoles him for the errors the crimes the injustice with which the earth is yet stained and of which he is not seldom the victim it is in the contemplation of this picture that he receives the reward of his efforts for the progress of reason for the defence of liberty he ventures to link them with the eternal chain of the destinies of man it is there he finds the true recompense of virtue the pleasure of having done a lasting good fate can no longer undo it by any disastrous compensation that shall restore prejudice and bondage this contemplation is for him a refuge into which the recollection of his persecutors can never follow him in which living in thought with man reinstated in the rights and the dignity of his nature he forgets man tormented and corrupted by greed by base fear by envy it is here that he truly abides with his fellows in an elysium that his reason has known how to create for itself and that his love for humanity adorns with all purest delights                                       in following the turns of the drama which was to end in the tragedy of thermidor we perceive that after the fall of the anarchists and the death of danton the relations between robespierre and the committees underwent a change he who had hitherto been on the side of government became in turn an agency of opposition he did this in the interest of ultimate stability but the difference between the new position and the old is that he now distinctly associated the idea of a stable republic with the ascendency of his own religious conceptions how far the ascendency of his own personality was involved we have no means of judging the vulgar accusation against him is that he now deliberately aimed at a dictatorship and began to plot with that end in view it is always the most difficult thing in the world to draw a line between mere arrogant egoism on the one hand and on the other the identification of a mans personal elevation with the success of his public cause the two ends probably become mixed in his mind and if the cause be a good one it is the height of pharisaical folly to quarrel with him because he desires that his authority and renown shall receive some of the lustre of a farshining triumph what we complain of in napoleon bonaparte for instance is not that he sought power but that he sought it in the interests of a coarse brutal and essentially unmeaning personal ambition and so of robespierre we need not discuss the charge that he sought to make himself master the important thing is that his mastery could have served no great end for france that it would have been like himself poor barren and hopelessly mediocre and this would have been seen on every side france had important military tasks to perform before her independence was assured robespierre hated war and was jealous of every victory france was in urgent need of stable government of new laws of ordered institutions robespierre never said a word to indicate that he had a single positive idea in his head on any of these great departments and more than this he was incapable of making use of men who were more happily endowed than himself he had never mastered that excellent observation of de retz that of all the qualities of a good party chief none is so indispensable as being able to suppress on many occasions and to hide on all even legitimate suspicions he was corroded by suspicion and this paralyses able servants finally robespierre had no imperial quality of soul but only that very sorry imitation of it a lively irritability  the base of robespierres schemes of social reconstruction now came clearly into view and what a base an official supreme being and a regulated terror the one was to fill up the spiritual void and the other to satisfy all the exigencies of temporal things it is to the credit of robespierres perspicacity that he should have recognised the human craving for religion but this credit is as naught when we contemplate the jejune thing that passed for religion in his dim and narrow understanding rousseau had brought a new soul into the eighteenth century by the savoyard vicars profession of faith the most fervid and exalted expression of emotional deism that religious literature contains vague irrational incoherent cloudy but the clouds are suffused with glowing gold when we turn from that to the political version of it in robespierres discourse on the relations of religious and moral ideas with republican principles we feel as one who revisits a landscape that had been made glorious to him by a summer sky and fresh liquid winds from the gates of the evening sun only to find it dead under a gray heaven and harsh blasts from the northeast robespierres words on the supreme being are never a brimming stream of deep feeling they are a literary concoction never the selfforgetting expansion of the religious soul but only the composite of the rhetorician he thought he had a passion for religion what he took for religion was little more than mental decorum we do not mean that he was insincere or that he was without a feeling for high things but here as in all else his aspiration was far beyond his faculty he yearned for great spiritual emotions as he had yearned for great thoughts and great achievements but his spiritual capacity was as scanty and obscure as his intelligence and where unkind nature thus unequally yokes lofty objects in a man with a short mental reach she stamps him with the very definition of mediocrity  how can we speak with decent patience of a man who seriously thought that he should conciliate the conservative and theological elements of the society at his feet by such an odious operapiece as the feast of the supreme being this was designed as a triumphant ripost to the feast of reason which chaumette and his friends had celebrated in the winter the energumens of the goddess of reason had now been some weeks in their bloody graves by this time if they had given the wrong answer to the supreme enigma their eyes would perhaps be opened robespierre persuaded the convention to decree an official recognition of the supreme being and to attend a commemorative festival in honour of their mystic patron he contrived to be chosen president for the decade in which the festival would fall when the day came 20th prairial june 8 1794 he clothed himself with more than even his usual care as he looked out from the windows of the tuileries upon the jubilant crowd in the gardens he was intoxicated with enthusiasm o nature he cried how sublime thy power how full of delight how tyrants must grow pale at the idea of such a festival as this in pontifical pride he walked at the head of the procession with flowers and wheatears in his hand to the sound of chants and symphonies and choruses of maidens on the first of the great basins in the gardens david the artist had devised an allegorical structure for which an inauspicious doom was prepared atheism a statue of life size was throned in the midst of an amiable group of human vices with madness by her side and wisdom menacing them with lofty wrath great are the perils of symbolism robespierre applied a torch to atheism but alas the wind was hostile or else atheism and madness were damp they obstinately resisted the torch and it was hapless wisdom who took fire her face all blackened by smoke grinned a hideous ghastly grin at her sturdy rivals the miscarriage of the allegory was an evil omen and men probably thought how much better the churchmen always managed their conjurings and the art of spectacle there was a great car drawn by milkwhite oxen in the front were ranged sheaves of golden grain while at the back shepherds and shepherdesses posed with scenic graces the whole mummery was pagan it was a bringing back of cerealia and thesmophoria to earth it stands as the most disgusting and contemptible anachronism in history  the famous republican calendar with its prairials and germinals its ventoses and pluvioses was an anachronism of the same kind though it was less despicable in its manifestation its philosophic base was just as retrograde and out of season as the fooleries of the feast of the supreme being the association of worship and sacredness with the fruits of the earth with the forces of nature with the power and variety of the elements could only be sincere so long as men really thought of all these things as animated each by a special will of its own such an association became mere charlatanry when knowledge once passed into the positive stage how could men go back to adore an outer world after they had found out the secret that it is a mere huge group of phenomena following fixed courses and not obeying spontaneous and unaccountable volitions of their own and what could be more puerile than the fanciful connection of the supreme being with a pastoral simplicity of life this simplicity was gone irrecoverably gone with the passage from nomad times to the complexities of a modern society to typify therefore the supreme being as specially interested in shocks of grain and in shepherds and shepherdesses was to make him a mere figure in an idyll the ornament of a rural mask a god of the garden instead of the sovereign director of the universal forces and stern master of the destinies of men chaumettes commemoration of the divinity of reason was a sensible performance compared with robespierres farcical repartee it was something as comte has said to select for worship mans most individual attribute if they could not contemplate society as a whole it was at least a gain to pay homage to that faculty in the human rulers of the world which had brought the forces of natureits pluviosity nivosity germinality and vendemiarityunder the yoke for the service of men  if the philosophy of robespierres pageant was so retrograde and false its politics were still more inane it is a monument of presumptuous infatuation that any one should feel so strongly as he did that order could only be restored on condition of coming to terms with religious use and prejudice and then that he should dream that his supreme beinga mere didactic phrase the deity of a poets georgicshould adequately replace that eternal marvel of construction by means of which the great churchmen had wrought dogma and liturgy and priest and holy office into every hour and every mood of mens lives there is no binding principle of human association in a creed with this one bald article in truth as i have said elsewhere of such deism as robespierres one can scarcely call it a creed it is mainly a name for a particular mood of fine spiritual exaltation the expression of a state of indefinite aspiration and supreme feeling for lofty things are you going to convert the new barbarians of our western world with this fair word of emptiness will you sweeten the lives of suffering men and take its heaviness from that droning piteous chronicle of wrong and cruelty and despair which everlastingly saddens the compassionating ear like moaning of a midnight sea will you animate the stout of heart with new fire and the firm of hand with fresh joy of battle by the thought of a being without intelligible attributes a mere abstract creation of metaphysic whose mercy is not as our mercy nor his justice as our justice nor his fatherhood as the fatherhood of men it was not by a cold a cheerless a radically depraving conception such as this that the church became the refuge of humanity in the dark times of old but by the representation to men sitting in bondage and confusion of godlike natures moving among them under figure of the most eternally touching of human relationsa tender mother ever interceding for them and an elder brother laying down his life that their burdens might be loosened                                       on the day of the feast of the supreme being the guillotine was concealed in the folds of rich hangings it was the twentieth of prairial two days later couthon proposed to the convention the memorable law of the twentysecond prairial robespierre was the draftsman and the text of it still remains in his own writing this monstrous law is simply the complete abrogation of all law of all laws ever passed in the world it is the most nakedly iniquitous tyrants have often substituted their own will for the ordered procedure of a tribunal but no tyrant before ever went through the atrocious farce of deliberately making a tribunal the organised negation of security for justice couthon laid its theoretic base in a fallacy that must always be full of seduction to shallow persons in authority he who would subordinate the public safety to the inventions of jurisconsults to the formulas of the court is either an imbecile or a scoundrel as if public safety could mean anything but the safety of the public the author of the law of prairial had forgotten the minatory word of the sage to whom he had gone on a pilgrimage in the days of his youth all becomes legitimate and even virtuous helvétius had written on behalf of the public safety rousseau inscribed on the margin the public safety is nothing unless individuals enjoy security what security was possible under the law of prairial  after the probity and good judgment of the tribunal the two cardinal guarantees in state trials are accurate definition and proof the offence must be capable of precise description and the proof against an offender must conform to strict rule the law of prairial violently infringed all three of these essential conditions of judicial equity first the number of the jury who had power to convict was reduced second treason was made to consist in such vague and infinitely elastic kinds of action as inspiring discouragement misleading opinion depraving manners corrupting patriots abusing the principles of the revolution by perfidious applications third proof was to lie in the conscience of the jury there was an end of preliminary inquiry of witnesses in defence and of counsel for the accused any kind of testimony was evidence whether material or moral verbal or written if it was of a kind likely to gain the assent of a man of reasonable mind  now what was robespierres motive in devising this infernal instrument the theory that he loved judicial murder for its own sake can only be held by the silliest of royalist or clerical partisans it is like the theory of the vulgar kind of protestantism that mary tudor or philip of spain had a keen delight in shedding blood robespierre like mary and like philip would have been as well pleased if all the world would have come round to his mind without the destruction of a single life the true inquisitor is a creature of policy not a man of blood by taste what then was the policy that inspired the law of prairial to us the answer seems clear we know what was the general aim in robespierres mind at this point in the history of the revolution his brother augustin was then the representative of the convention with the army of italy and general bonaparte was on terms of close intimacy with him bonaparte said long afterwards when he was expiating a life of iniquity on the rock of saint helena that he saw long letters from maximilian to augustin robespierre all blaming the conventional commissionerstallien fouché barras collot and the restfor the horrors they perpetrated and accusing them of ruining the revolution by their atrocities again there is abundant testimony that robespierre did his best to induce the committee of public safety to bring those odious malefactors to justice the text of the law itself discloses the same object the vague phrases of depraving manners and applying revolutionary principles perfidiously were exactly calculated to smite the band of violent men whose conduct was to robespierre the scandal of the revolution and there was a curious clause in the law as originally presented which deprived the convention of the right of preventing measures against its own members robespierres general design in short was to effect a further purgation of the convention there is no reason to suppose that he deliberately aimed at any more general extermination on the other hand it is incredible that as some have maintained he should merely have had in view the equalisation of rich and poor before the tribunals by withdrawing the aid of counsel and testimony to civic character from both rich and poor alike  if robespierres design was what we believe it to have been the result was a ghastly failure the committee of public safety would not consent to apply his law against the men for whom he had specially designed it the frightful weapon which he had forged was seized by the committee of general security and paris was plunged into the fearful days of the great terror the number of persons put to death by the revolutionary tribunal before the law of prairial had been comparatively moderate from the creation of the tribunal in april 1793 down to the execution of the hébertists in march 1794 the number of persons condemned to death was 505 from the death of the hébertists down to the death of robespierre the number of the condemned was 2158 one half of the entire number of victims namely 1356 were guillotined after the law of prairial no deadlier instrument was ever invented by the cruelty of man innocent women no less than innocent men poor no less than rich those in whom life was almost spent no less than those in whom its pulse was strongest virtuous no less than vicious were sent off in woestricken batches all those summer days a man was informed against he was seized in his bed at five in the morning at seven he was taken to the conciergerie at nine he received information of the charge against him at ten he went into the dock by two in the afternoon he was condemned by four his head lay in the executioners basket  what stamps the system of the terror at this date with a wickedness that cannot be effaced is that at no moment was the danger from foreign or domestic foe less serious we may always forgive something to wellgrounded panic the proscriptions of an earlier date in paris were not excessively sanguinary if we remember that the city abounded in royalists and other reactionists who were really dangerous in fomenting discouragement and spreading confusion if there ever is an excuse for martial law and it must be rare the french government were warranted in resorting to it in 1793 paris in those days was like a city beleaguered and the world does not use very harsh words about the commandant of a besieged town who puts to death traitors found within his walls opinion in england at this very epoch encouraged the tory government to pass a treason bill which introduced as vague a definition of treasonable offence as even the law of prairial itself windham did not shrink from declaring in parliament that he and his colleagues were determined to exact a rigour beyond the law and they were as good as their word the jacobins had no monopoly either of cruel law or cruel breach of law in the eighteenth century only thirty years before opinion in pennsylvania had prompted a hideous massacre of harmless indians as a deed acceptable to god and the grandson of william penn proclaimed a bounty of fifty dollars for the scalp of a female indian and three times as much for a male a man would have had quite as good a chance of justice from the revolutionary tribunal as at the hands of braxfield the scotch judge who condemned muir and palmer for sedition in 1793 and who told the government with a brazen front worthy of carrier or collot dherbois themselves that if they would only send him prisoners he would find law for them  we have no sympathy with the spirit of paradox that has arisen in these days amusing itself by the vindication of bad men we think that the author of the law of prairial was a bad man but it is time that there should be an end of the cant which lifts up its hands at the crimes of republicans and freethinkers and shuts its eyes to the crimes of kings and churches once more we ought to rise into a higher air we ought to condemn wherever we find it whether on the side of our adversaries or on our own all readiness to substitute arbitrary force for the processes of ordered justice there are moments when such a readiness may be leniently judged but prairial of 1794 was not one of them either in france or in england and what makes the crime of this law more odious is its association with the official proclamation of the state worship of a supreme being the scene of robespierres holy festival becomes as abominable as a catholic autodafé where solemn homage was offered to the god of pity and lovingkindness while flame glowed round the limbs of the victims                                       robespierre was inflamed with resentment not because so many people were guillotined every day but because the objects of his own enmity were not among them he was chagrined at the miscarriage of his scheme but the chagrin had its root in his desire for order and not in his humanity a good mansay so imperfectly good a man as dantoncould not have endured life after enacting such a law and seeing the ghastly work that it was doing he could hardly have contented himself with drawing tears from the company in madame duplays little parlour by his pathetic recitations from corneille and racine or with listening to melting notes from the violin of le bas it is commonly said by robespierres defenders that he withdrew from the committee of public safety as soon as he found out that he was powerless to arrest the daily shedding of blood the older assumption used to be that he left paris and ceased to be cognisant of the committees deliberations the minutes however prove that this was not the case robespierre signed papers nearly every day of messidorjune 19 to july 18 the bloodstained month between prairial and thermidorand was thoroughly aware of the doings of the committee his partisans have now fallen back on the singular theory of what they style moral absence he was present in the flesh but standing aloof in the spirit his frowning silence was a deadlier rebuke to the slayers and oppressors than secession unfortunately for this ingenious explanation of the embarrassing fact of a merciful man standing silent before merciless doings there are at least two facts that show its absurdity  first there is the affair of catherine théot catherine théot was a crazy old woman of a type that is commoner in protestant than in catholic countries she believed herself to have special gifts in the interpretation of the holy writings and a few other people as crazy as herself chose to accept her pretensions one revelation vouchsafed to her was to the effect that robespierre was a messiah and the new redeemer of the human race the committee of general security resolved to indict this absurd sect vadierone of the roughest of the men whom the insurrections of paris had brought to the frontreported on the charges to the convention 27 prairial june 15 and he took the opportunity to make robespierre look profoundly ridiculous the unfortunate messiah sat on his bench gnawing his lips with bitter rage while amid the sneers and laughter of the convention the officers brought to the bar the foolish creatures who had called him the son of god his thin pride and prudish selfrespect were unutterably affronted and he quite understood that the ridicule of the mysticism of théot was an indirect pleasantry upon his own supreme being he flew to the committee of public safety angrily reproached them for permitting the prosecution summoned fouquiertinville and peremptorily ordered him to let the matter drop in vain did the public prosecutor point out that there was a decree of the convention ordering him to proceed robespierre was inexorable the committee of general security were baffled and the prosecution ended lutteur impuissant et fatigué says m hamel the most thoroughgoing defender of robespierre upon this il va se retirer moralement du moins impotent and wearied but he had just won a most signal victory for good sense and humanity why was it the only one if robespierre was able to save théot why could he not save cécile renault  cécile renault was a young seamstress who was found one evening at the door of robespierres lodging calling out in a state of exaltation that she would fain see what a tyrant looked like she was arrested and upon her were found two little knives used for the purposes of her trade that she should be arrested and imprisoned was natural enough the times were charged with deadly fire people had not forgotten that marat had been murdered in his own house only a few days before cécile renaults visit to robespierre an assassin had fired a pistol at collot dherbois on the staircase of his apartment we may make allowance for the excitement of the hour and robespierre had as much right to play the martyr as had lewis the fifteenth after the incident of damiens rusty penknife but the histrionic exigencies of the chief of a faction ought not to be pushed too far and it was a monstrous crime that because robespierre found it convenient to pose as sacrificial victim at the club therefore he should have had no scruple in seeing not only the wretched cécile but her father her aunt and one of her brothers all despatched to the guillotine in the red shirt of parricide as agents of pitt and coburg and assassins of the father of the land this was exactly two days after he had shown his decisive power in the affair of the religious illuminists the only possible conclusion open to a plain man after weighing and putting aside all the sophisms with which this affair has been obscured is that robespierre interfered in the one case because its further prosecution would have tended to make him ridiculous and he did not interfere in the other because the more exaggerated the more melodramatic the more murderous it was made the more interesting an object would he seem in the eyes of his adorers  the second fact bearing on robespierres humanity is this he had encouraged the formation and stimulated the activity of popular commissions who should provide victims for the revolutionary tribunal on the second of messidor june 20 a list containing one hundred and thirtyeight names was submitted for the ratification of the committee the committee endorsed the bloody document and the last signature of the endorsement is that of him who had resigned a post in his youth rather than be a party to putting a man to death as was observed at the time robespierre in doing this suppressed his pique against his colleagues in order to take part in a measure that was a sort of complement to his law of prairial  from these two circumstances then even if there were no other we are justified in inferring that robespierre was struck by no remorse at the thought that it was his law which had unbound the hands of the horrible genie of civil murder his mind was wholly absorbed in the calculations of a frigid egoism his intelligence as we have always to remember was very dim he only aimed at one thing at once and that was seldom anything very great or farreaching he was a man of peering and obscured vision in face of practical affairs in passing the law of prairial his designsand they were meritorious and creditable designs enough in themselveshad been directed against the corrupt chiefs such as tallien and fouché and against the fierce and coarse spirits of the committee of general security such as vadier and voulland robespierre was above all things a precisian he had a sentimental sympathy with the common people in the abstract but his spiritual pride his pedantry his formalism his personal fastidiousness were all wounded to the very quick by the kind of men whom the revolution had thrown to the surface gouverneur morris then the american minister describes most of the members of the two committees as the very dregs of humanity with whom it is a stain to have any dealings as degraded men only worthy of the profoundest contempt danton had said robespierre is the least of a scoundrel of any of the band the committee of general security represented the very elements by which robespierre was most revolted they offended his respectability their evil manners seemed to tarnish that good name which his vanity hoped to make as revered all over europe as it already was among his partisans in france it was indispensable therefore to cut them off from the revolutionary government just as hébert and as danton had been cut off his colleagues of public safety refused to lend themselves to this henceforth with characteristically narrow tenacity he looked round for new combinations but so far as i can see with no broader design than to enable him to punish these particular objects of his very just detestation  the position of sections and interests which ended in the revolution of thermidor is one of the most extraordinarily intricate and entangled in the history of faction it would take a volume to follow out all the peripeteias of the drama here we can only enumerate in a few sentences the parties to the contest and the conditions of the game the reader will easily discern the difficulty in robespierres way of making an effective combination first there were the two committees of these the one the general security was thoroughly hostile to robespierre its members as we have said were wild and hardy spirits with no political conception and with a great contempt for fine phrases and philosophical principles they knew robespierres hatred for them and they heartily returned it they were the steadfast centre of the changing schemes which ended in his downfall the committee of public safety was divided carnot hated saint just and collot dherbois hated robespierre and billaud had a sombre distrust of robespierres counsels shortly speaking the object of the billaudists was to retain their power and their power was always menaced from two quarters the convention and paris if they let robespierre have his own way against his enemies would they not be at his mercy whenever he chose to devise a popular insurrection against them yet if they withstood robespierre they could only do so through the agency of the convention and to fall back upon the convention would be to give that body an express invitation to resume the power that had in the pressure of the crisis a year before been delegated to the committee and periodically renewed afterwards the dilemma of billaud seemed desperate and events afterwards proved that it was so  if we turn to the convention we find the position equally distracting they too feared another insurrection and a second decimation if the right helped robespierre to destroy the fouchés and vadiers he would be stronger than ever and what security had they against a repetition of the violence of the thirtyfirst of may if the dantonists joined in destroying robespierre they would be helping the right and what security had they against a girondin reaction on the other hand the centre might fairly hope just what billaud feared that if the committee came to the convention to crush robespierre that would end in a combination strong enough to enable the convention to crush the committees  much depended on military success the victories of the generals were the great strength of the committee for so long it would be difficult to turn opinion against a triumphant administration at the first defeat robespierre had said to barère i await you but the defeat did not come the plotting went on with incessant activity on one hand robespierre aided by saint just and couthon strengthening himself at the jacobin club and through that among the sections on the other the mountain and the committee of general security trying to win over the right more contemptuously christened the marsh or the belly of the convention the committee of public safety was not yet fully decided how to act  at the end of the first week of thermidor robespierre could endure the tension no longer he had tried to fortify his nerves for the struggle by riding but with so little success that he was lifted off his horse fainting he endeavoured to steady himself by diligent pistolpractice but nothing gave him initiative and the sinews of action saint just urged him to raise paris some bold men proposed to carry off the members of the committee bodily from their midnight deliberations robespierre declined and fell back on what he took to be his greatest strength and most unfailing resource he prepared a speech on the eighth of thermidor he delivered it to the convention amid intense excitement both within its walls and without all paris knew that they were now on the eve of one more of the famous days the revolution of thermidor had begun  the speech of the eighth thermidor has seemed to men of all parties since a masterpiece of tactical ineptitude if robespierre had been a statesman instead of a phrasemonger he had a clear course he ought to have taken the line of argument that danton would have taken that is to say he ought to have identified himself fully with the interests and security of the convention to have accepted the growing resolution to close the terror to have boldly pressed the abolition of the committee of general security and the removal from the committee of public safety of billaud collot barère to have proposed to send about fifty persons to cayenne for life and to have urged a policy of peace with the foreign powers this was the substantial wisdom and real interest of the position the task was difficult because his hearers had the best possible reasons for knowing that the author of the law of prairial was a terrorist on principle and in truth we know that robespierre had no definite intention of erecting clemency into a rule he had not mental strength enough to throw off the profound apprehension which the incessant alarms of the last five years had engendered in him and the only device that he could imagine for maintaining the republic against traitors was to stimulate the rigour of the revolutionary tribunal  if however robespierre lacked the grasp which might have made him the representative of a broad and stable policy it was at least his interest to persuade the men of the plain that he entertained no designs against them and this is what in his own mind he intended but to do it effectively it was clearly best to tell his hearers in so many words whom he really wished them to strike that would have relieved the majority and banished the suspicion which had been busily fomented by his enemies that he had in his pocket a long list of their names for proscription but robespierre having for the first time in his life ventured on aggressive action without the support of a definite party faltered he dared not to designate his enemies face to face and by name instead of that he talked vaguely of conspirators against the republic and calumniators of himself there was not a single bold definite unmistakable sentence in the speech from first to last the men of the plain were insecure and doubtful they had no certainty that among conspirators and calumniators he did not include too many of themselves people are not so readily seized by grand phrases when their heads are at stake the sitting was long and marked by changing currents and reverses when they broke up all was left uncertain robespierre had suffered a check billaud felt that he could no longer hesitate in joining the combination against his colleague each party was aware that the next day must seal the fate of one or other of them there is a legend that in the evening robespierre walked in the champs elysées with his betrothed accompanied as usual by his faithful dog brount they admired the purple of the sunset and talked of the prospect of a glorious tomorrow but this is apocryphal the evening was passed in no lovers saunterings but amid the storm and uproar of the club he went to the jacobins to read over again his speech of the day it is my testament of death he said amid the passionate protestations of his devoted followers he had been talking for the last three years of his willingness to drink the hemlock and to offer his breast to the poniards of tyrants that was a fashion of the speech of the time and in earlier days it had been more than a fashion of speech for brunswick would have given them short shrift but now when he talked of his last testament robespierre did not intend it to be so if he could prevent it when he went to rest that night he had a tolerably calm hope that he should win the next days battle in the convention when he was aware that saint just would attack the committees openly and directly if he would have allowed his band to invade the pavillon de flore and carry off or slay the committees who sat up through the night the battle would have been won when he awoke his friends are justified in saying that his strong respect for legality was the cause of his ruin  men in all ages have had a superstitious fondness for connecting awful events in their lives with portents and signs among the outer elements it was noticed that the heat during the terrible days of thermidor was more intense than had been known within the memory of man the thermometer never fell below sixtyfive degrees in the coolest part of the night and in the daytime men and women and beasts of burden fell down dead in the streets by five oclock in the morning of the ninth thermidor the galleries of the convention were filled by a boisterous and excited throng at ten oclock the proceedings began as usual with the reading of correspondence from the departments and from the armies robespierre who had been escorted from his lodgings by the usual body of admirers instead of taking his ordinary seat remained standing by the side of the tribune it is a familiar fact that moments of appalling suspense are precisely those in which we are most ready involuntarily to note a trifle everybody observed that robespierre wore the coat of violetblue silk and the white nankeens in which a few weeks previously he had done honour to the supreme being  the galleries seemed as enthusiastic as ever the men of the plain and the marsh had lost the abject mien with which they usually cowered before robespierres glance they wore a courageous air of judicial reserve the leaders of the mountain wandered restlessly to and fro among the corridors at noon tallien saw that saint just had ascended the tribune instantly he rushed down into the chamber knowing that the battle had now begun in fierce earnest saint just had not got through two sentences before tallien interrupted him he began to insist with energy that there should be an end to the equivocal phrases with which paris had been too long alarmed by the triumvirate billaud fearing to be outdone in the attack hastily forced his way to the tribune broke into what tallien was saying and proceeded dexterously to discredit robespierres allies without at once assailing robespierre himself le bas ran in a fury to stop him collot dherbois the president declared le bas out of order the hall rang with cries of to prison to the abbey and le bas was driven from the tribune this was the beginning of the tempest robespierres enemies knew that they were fighting for their lives and this inspired them with a strong and resolute power that is always impressive in popular assemblies he still thought himself secure billaud pursued his accusations robespierre at last unable to control himself scaled the tribune there suddenly burst forth from tallien and his partisans vehement shouts of down with the tyrant down with the tyrant the galleries were swept by a wild frenzy of vague agitation the presidents bell poured loud incessant clanging into the tumult the men of the plain held themselves firm and silent in the tribune raged ferocious groups tallien menacing robespierre with a dagger billaud roaring out proposals to arrest this person and that robespierre gesticulating threatening yelling shrieking his enemies knew that if he were once allowed to get a hearing his authority might even yet overawe the waverers a penetrative word or a heroic gesture might lose them the day the majority of the chamber still hesitated they called for barère in whose adroit faculty for discovering the winning side they had the confidence of long experience robespierre recovering some of his calm and perceiving now that he had really to deal with a serious revolt again asked to be heard before barère but the cries for barère were louder than ever barère spoke in a sense hostile to robespierre but warily and without naming him  then there was a momentary lull the plain was uncertain the battle might even now turn either way robespierre made another attempt to speak but tallien with intrepid fury broke out into a torrent of louder and more vehement invective robespierres shrill voice was heard in disjected snatches amidst the violent tones of tallien the yells of the president calling robespierre to order the murderous clanging of the bell then came that supreme hour of the struggle whose tale has been so often told when robespierre turned from his old allies of the mountain and succeeded in shrieking out an appeal to the probity and virtue of the right and the plain to his horror even these despised men after a slight movement remained mute then his cheeks blanched and the sweat ran down his face but anger and scornful impatience swiftly came back and restored him president of assassins he cried out to thuriot for the last time i ask to be heard thou canst not speak called one the blood of danton chokes thee he flung himself down the steps of the tribune and rushed towards the benches of the right come no further cried another vergniaud and condorcet sat here he regained the tribune but his speech was gone he was reduced to the dregs of an impotent and gasping voiceless gesticulation like the strife of one in a nightmare  the day was lost the tension of a passionate and violent struggle prolonged for many hours always at length exasperates onlookers with something of the brute ferocity of the actors the physical strain stirs the tiger in the blood they conceive a cruel hatred against weakness just as the heated throng of a roman amphitheatre turned up their thumbs for the instant despatch of the unfortunate swordsman who had been too ready to lower his arms the right the plain even the galleries despised the man who had succumbed if robespierre had possessed the physical strength of mirabeau or danton the ninth thermidor would have been another of his victories he was crushed by the relentless ferocity and endurance of his antagonists a decree for his arrest was resolved upon by acclamation he cast a glance at the galleries as marvelling that they should remain passive in face of an outrage on his person they were mute the ushers advanced with hesitation to do their duty and not without trembling carried him away along with couthon and saint just the brother for whom he had made honourable sacrifices in days that seemed to be divided from the present by an abyss of centuries insisted with fine heroism on sharing his fate and augustin robespierre and le bas were led off to the prisons along with their leader and idol  it was now a little after four oclock the convention with the selfpossession that so often amazes us in its proceedings went on with formal business for another hour at five they broke up for life as the poets tell is a daily stageplay men declaim their high heroic parts then doff the buskin or the sock wash away the paint from their cheeks and gravely sit down to meat the conventionals as they ate their dinners were unconscious apparently that the great crisis of the drama was still to come the next twelve hours were to witness the climax robespierre had been crushed by the convention it remained to be seen whether the convention would not now be crushed by the commune of paris  robespierre was first conducted to the prisons of the luxembourg the gaoler on some plea of informality refused to receive him the terrible prisoner was next taken to the mairie where he remained among joyful friends from eight in the evening until eleven meanwhile the old insurrectionary methods of the nights of june and of august in 92 of may and of june in 93 were again followed the beating of the rappel and the générale was heard in all the sections the tocsin sounded its dreadful note reminding all who should hear it that insurrection is the most sacred and the most indispensable of duties hanriot the commandant of the forces had been arrested in the evening but he was speedily released by the agents of the commune the council issued manifestoes and decrees from the common hall every moment the barriers were closed cannon were posted opposite the doors of the hall of the convention the quays were thronged emissaries sped to and fro between the jacobin club and the common hall and between these two centres and each of the fortyeight sections it is one of the inscrutable mysteries of this delirious night that hanriot did not at once use the force at his command to break up the convention there is no obvious reason why he should not have done so the members of the convention had reassembled after their dinner towards seven oclock the hall which had resounded with the shrieks and yells of the furious gladiators of the factions all day now lent a lugubrious echo to gloomy reports which one member after another delivered from the shadow of the tribune towards nine oclock the members of the two dread committees came in panic to seek shelter among their colleagues as dejected in their peril says an eyewitness as they had been cruel and insolent in the hour of their supremacy when they heard that hanriot had been released and that guns were at their door all gave themselves up for lost and made ready for death news came that robespierre had broken his arrest and gone to the common hall robespierre after urgent and repeated solicitations had been at length persuaded about an hour before midnight to leave the mairie and join his partisans of the commune this was an act of revolt against the convention for the mairie was a legal place of detention and so long as he was there he was within the law the convention with heroic intrepidity declared both hanriot and robespierre beyond the pale of the law this prompt measure was its salvation twelve members were instantly named to carry the decree to all the sections with the scarf of office round their waists and a sabre in hand they sallied forth mounting horses and escorted by attendants with flaring torches they scoured paris calling all good citizens to the succour of the convention haranguing crowds at the street corners with power and authority and striking the imaginations of men at midnight heavy rain began to fall  the leaders of the commune meanwhile in full confidence that victory was sure contented themselves with incessant issue of paper decrees to each of which the convention replied by a counterdecree those who have studied the situation most minutely are of opinion that even so late as one oclock in the morning the commune might have made a successful defence although it had lost the opportunity which it had certainly possessed up to ten oclock of destroying the convention but on this occasion the genius of insurrection slumbered and there was a genuine division of opinion in the eastern quarters of paris the result of a grim distrust of the man who had helped to slay hébert and chaumette at a word this distrust began to declare itself the opinion of the sections became more and more distracted one armed group cried down with the convention another armed group cried the convention for ever and down with the commune the two great faubourgs were all astir and three battalions were ready to march emissaries from the convention actually succeeded in persuading themsuch the dementia of the nightthat robespierre was a royalist agent and that the commune were about to deliver the little lewis from his prison in the temple one body of communist partisans after another was detached from its allegiance the deluge of rain emptied the place de grève and when companies came up from the sections in obedience to orders from hanriot and the commune the silence made them suspect a trap and they withdrew towards the great metropolitan church or elsewhere  barras whom the convention had charged with its military defence gathered together some six thousand men with the right instinct of a man who had studied the history of paris since the july of 1789 he foresaw the advantage of being the first to make the attack he arranged his forces into two divisions one of them marched along the quays to take the common hall in front the other along the rue saint honoré to take it in flank inside the common hall the staircases and corridors were alive with bustling messengers and those mysterious busybodies who are always found lingering without a purpose on the skirts of great historic scenes robespierre and the other chiefs were in a small room preparing manifestoes and signing decrees they were curiously unaware of the movements of the convention an aggressive attack by the party of authority upon the party of insurrection was unknown in the tradition of revolt they had an easy assurance that at daybreak their forces would be prepared once more to tramp along the familiar road westwards it was now halfpast two robespierre had just signed the first two letters of his name to a document before him when he was startled by cries and uproar in the place below in a few instants he lay stretched on the ground his jaw shattered by a pistolshot his brother had either fallen or had leaped out of the window couthon was hurled over a staircase and lay for dead saint just was a prisoner  whether robespierre was shot by an officer of the conventional force or attempted to blow out his own brains we shall never know any more than we shall ever be quite assured how rousseau his spiritual master came to an end the wounded man was carried a ghastly sight first to the committee of public safety and then to the conciergerie where he lay in silent stupefaction through the heat of the summer day as he was an outlaw the only legal preliminary before execution was to identify him at five in the afternoon he was raised into the cart couthon and the younger robespierre lay confused wrecks of men at the bottom of it hanriot and saint just bruised begrimed and foul completed the band one who walks from the palace of justice over the bridge along the rue saint honoré into the rue royale and so to the luxor column retraces the via dolorosa of the revolution on the afternoon of the tenth of thermidor                                       the end of the intricate manoeuvres known as the revolution of thermidor was the recovery of authority by the convention the insurrections known as the days of the twelfth germinal first prairial and thirteenth vendémiaire all ended in the victory of the convention over the revolutionary forces of paris the committees on the other hand had beaten robespierre but they had ruined themselves very gradually the movement towards order which had begun in the mind of danton and had gone on in the cloudy purposes of robespierre became definite but it was in the interest of very different ideas from those of either danton or of robespierre a white terror succeeded the red terror not at once however it was not until nine months after the death of robespierre that the reaction was strong enough to smite his colleagues of the two committees the surviving girondins had come back to their seats in the convention the dantonians had not forgiven the execution of their chief these two parties were bent on vengeance in april 1795 a decree was passed banishing billaud de varennes collot dherbois and barère in the following month the leaders of the committee of general security were thrown into prison the revolution had passed into new currents we cannot see any reasons for thinking that those currents would have led to any happier results if robespierre had won the battle tallien fouché barras and the rest may have been thoroughly bad men but then what qualities had robespierre for building up a state he had neither strength of practical character nor firm breadth of political judgment nor a sound social doctrine when we compare himi do not say with frederick of prussia with jefferson with washingtonbut with the group of able men who made the closing year of the convention honourable and of good service to france we have a measure of robespierres profound and pitiable incompetence
