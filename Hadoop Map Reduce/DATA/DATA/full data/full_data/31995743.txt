discovered johnnythepriest deserves his nickname with his pale thin cleanshaven face mild blue eyes and white hair a cassock would seem more suited to him than the apron he wears neither his voice nor his general manner dispel this illusion which has made him a personage of the water front they are soft and bland but beneath all his mildness one senses the man behind the maskcynical callous hard as nails he is lounging at ease behind the bar a pair of spectacles on his nose reading an evening paper  two longshoremen enter from the street wearing their working aprons the button of the union pinned conspicuously on the caps pulled sideways on their heads at an aggressive angle  first longshoremanas they range themselves at the bar gimme a shock number two he tosses a coin on the bar

it is pushed open and christopher christopherson enters he is a short squat broadshouldered man of about fifty with a round weatherbeaten red face from which his light blue eyes peer shortsightedly twinkling with a simple good humor his large mouth overhung by a thick drooping yellow mustache is childishly selfwilled and weak of an obstinate kindliness a thick neck is jammed like a post into the heavy trunk of his body his arms with their big hairy freckled hands and his stumpy legs terminating in large flat feet are awkwardly short and muscular he walks with a clumsy rolling gait his voice when not raised in a hollow boom is toned down to a sly confidential halfwhisper with something vaguely plaintive in its quality he is dressed in a wrinkled illfitting dark suit of shore clothes and wears a faded cap of gray cloth over his mop of grizzled blond hair just now his face beams with a tooblissful happiness and he has evidently been drinking he reaches his hand out to johnny  chrishello yohnny have drink on me come on larry give us drink have one yourself putting his hand in his pocket ay gat moneyplenty money  johnnyshakes chris by the hand speak of the devil we was just

purple veins her thick gray hair is piled anyhow in a greasy mop on top of her round head her figure is flabby and fat her breath comes in wheezy gasps she speaks in a loud mannish voice punctuated by explosions of hoarse laughter but there still twinkles in her bloodshot blue eyes a youthful lust for life which hard usage has failed to stifle a sense of humor mocking but goodtempered she wears a mans cap doublebreasted mans jacket and a grimy calico skirt her bare feet are encased in a mans brogans several sizes too large for her which gives her a shuffling wobbly gait  marthygrumblingly what

days later the stern of the deeplyladen barge simeon winthrop at anchor in the outer harbor of provincetown mass it is ten oclock at night dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides and she floats motionless on a calm a lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull filtering light on objects near itthe heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines etc in the rear is the cabin its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside the chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof the doleful tolling of bells on long point on ships at anchor breaks the silence at regular intervals  as the curtain rises anna is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed she looks healthy transformed the natural color has come back to her face she has on a black oilskin coat but wears no hat she is staring out into the fog astern with an expression of awed wonder the cabin door is pushed open and chris appears he is dressed in yellow

off toward the bow anna walks back toward the extreme stern as if she wanted to remain as much isolated possible she turns her back on the proceedings and stares out into the fog the voice is heard again shouting ahoy and chris answering dis way then there is a pausethe murmur of excited voicesthen the scuffling of feet chris appears from around the cabin to port he is supporting the limp form of a man dressed in dungarees holding one of the mans arms around his neck the deckhand johnson a young blond swede follows him helping along another exhausted man similar fashion anna turns to look

immense strength his dark eyes are bloodshot and wild from sleeplessness the muscles of his arms and shoulders are lumped in knots and bunches the veins of his forearms stand out like blue cords he finds his way to the coil of hawser and sits down on it facing the cabin his back bowed head in his hands in an attitude of spent weariness  burketalking aloud to himself row ye divil row then lifting his head and looking about him whats this tub well were safe anywaywith the help of god he makes the sign of the cross mechanically johnson comes along the deck to port supporting the fourth man who

sunny day about a week later from the harbor and docks outside muffled by the closed door and windows comes the sound of steamers whistles and the puffing snort of the donkey engines of some ship unloading nearby  as the curtain rises chris and anna are discovered anna is seated in the rockingchair by the table with a newspaper in her hands she is not reading but staring straight in front of her she looks unhappy troubled frowningly concentrated on her thoughts chris wanders about the room casting quick uneasy side glances at her face then stopping to peer absentmindedly out of the window his attitude betrays an overwhelming gloomy anxiety which has him on tenter hooks he pretends to be engaged in setting things shipshape but this occupation is confined to picking up some object staring at it stupidly for a second then aimlessly putting it down again he clears his throat and starts to sing to himself in a low doleful voice my yosephine come aboard de ship long time ay wait

distractedly clenching and unclenching her hands she speaks aloud to herself in a tense trembling voice gawd i cant stand this much longer what am i waiting for anywaylike a damn fool she laughs helplessly then checks herself abruptly as she hears the sound of heavy footsteps on the deck outside she appears to recognize these and her face lights up with joy she gasps mat a strange terror seems suddenly to seize her she rushes to the table takes the revolver out of drawer and crouches down in the corner left behind the cupboard a moment later the door is flung open and mat burke appears in the doorway he is in bad shapehis clothes torn and dirty covered with sawdust as if he had been grovelling or sleeping on barroom floors there is a red bruise on his forehead over one of his eyes another over one cheekbone his knuckles are skinned and rawplain evidence of the fighting he has been through on his bat his eyes are bloodshot and heavylidded his face has a bloated look but
