      but before his eye grew dim     he had seen the faces of the sons       whose sires had served with him      he had touched their swordhilts and greeted each       with the old sure word of praise     and there was virtue in touch and speech       as it had been in old days      so he dismissed them and took his rest       and the steadfast spirit went forth     between the adoring east

delivered by mere mankind       vowed to one sacrifice     and not as i hold them battleblind       but dying with open eyes      that they did not ask me to draw the sword       when they stood to endure their lot     that they only looked to me for a word       and i answered i knew them not      if it be found when the battle clears       their death has set me free     then how shall i live

long deceived         him     he spoke and exacted the truth and the basest believed him      and god poured him an exquisite wine that was daily renewed to him     in the clearwelling love of his peoples that daily accrued to him     honour and service we gave him rejoicingly fearless     faith absolute trust beyond speech and a friendship as peerless     and since he was master and servant in all that we asked him     we leaned hard on his wisdom in all things knowing not how we         tasked him      for on him each new day laid command every tyrannous hour     to confront or confirm or

    hearing his people had need of him straightway he came to us      as he received so he gavenothing grudged naught denying     not even the last gasp of his breath when he strove for us dying     for our sakes without question he put from him all that he         cherished     simply as any that serve him he served and he perished     all that kings covet was his and he flung it aside for us     simply as any that die in his service he died for us      who in the realm today has choice of the easy road or the hard to         tread       and much concerned for his own estate would sell his

sailor settled near the sea      he knows hes never going on no cruise     he knows hes done and finished with the sea     and yet he likes to feel shes there to use     if he should ask heras she used to be      even though she cost him all he had to lose     even though she made him sick to hear or see     still what she left of him will mostly choose     her skirts to sit by how comes such
