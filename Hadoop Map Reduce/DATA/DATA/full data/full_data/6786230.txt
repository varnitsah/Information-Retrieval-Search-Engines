6786230	the good news of god     sermon i  the beatific vision    matthew xxii 27  thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind  these words often puzzle and pain really good people because they seem to put the hardest duty first  it seems at times so much more easy to love ones neighbour than to love god  and strange as it may seem that is partly true  st john tells us sohe that loves not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen  therefore many good people who really do love god are unhappy at times because they feel that they do not love him enough they say in their heartsi wish to do right and i try to do it but i am afraid i do not do it from love to god  i think that they are often too hard upon themselves  i believe that they are very often loving god with their whole hearts when they think that they are not doing so  but still it is well to be afraid of oneself and dissatisfied with oneself  i think toonay i am certainthat many good people do not love god as they ought and as they would wish to do because they have not been rightly taught who god is and what he is like  they have not been taught that god is loveable they have been taught that god feels feelings and does deeds which if a man felt or did we should call him arbitrary proud revengeful cruel  and yet they are told to love him and they do not know how to love such a being as that  nor do i either my friends  let us therefore think over today for ourselves why we ought to love god and why both bible and catechism bid child as well as man to love the lord our god with all our hearts souls and minds before they bid us love our neighbours  and keep this in mind all through that the reason why we are to love god must depend upon what gods character is  for you cannot love any one because you are told to love them  you can only love them because they are loveable and worthy of your love  and that they will not be unless they are loving themselves as it is written we love god because he first loved us  now friends look at this one thing first  when we see any man do a just action or a kind action do we not like to see it  do we not like the man the better for doing it  a man must be sunk very low in stupidity and illfeelingdead in tresspasses and sins as the bible calls itif he does not  indeed i never saw the man yet however bad he was himself who did not in his better moments admire what was right and good and say bad as i may be that man is a good man and i wish i could do as he does  one sees the same but far more strongly in little children  from their earliest years as far as i have ever seen children like and admire what is good even though they be naughty themselves and if you tell them of any very loving generous or brave action their hearts leap up in answer to it  they feel at once how beautiful goodness is  but why  st john tells us  that feeling comes he tells us from christ the light who is the life of men and lights every man who comes into the world and that light in our hearts which makes us see and admire and love what is good is none other than christ himself shining in our hearts and showing to us his own likeness and the beauty thereof  but if we stop there if we only admire what is good without trying to copy it we shall lose that light  our corrupt and diseased nature and corrupt and diseased it is as we shall surely find as soon as we begin to try to do right will quench that heavenly spark in us more and more till it dies outas god forbid that it should die out in any of us  for if it did die out we should care no more for what is good  we should see nothing beautiful and noble and glorious in being just and loving and merciful  and then indeed we should see nothing worth loving in god himself and it were better for us that we had never been born  but none of us i trust are fallen as low as that  we all surely admire a good action and love a good man  surely we do  then i will go on to ask you one question more  did it ever strike you that goodness is not merely a beautiful thing but the beautiful thingby far the most beautiful thing in the world and that badness is not merely an ugly thing but the ugliest thing in the worldso that nothing is to be compared for value with goodness that riches honour power pleasure learning the whole world and all in it are not worth having in comparison with being good and the utterly best thing for a man is to be good even though he were never to be rewarded for it  and the utterly worst thing for a man is to be bad even though he were never to be punished for it and in a word goodness is the only thing worth loving and badness the only thing worth hating  did you ever feel this my friends  happy are those among you who have felt it for of you the lord says blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled  ay happy are you who have felt it for it is the sign the very and true sign that the holy spirit of god who is the spirit of goodness is working in your hearts with power revealing to you the exceeding beauty of holiness and the exceeding sinfulness of sin  but did it never strike you besides that goodness was one and everlasting  let me explain what i mean  did you never see that all good men show their goodness in the same way by doing the same kind of good actions  let them be english or french black or white if they be good there is the same honesty the same truthfulness the same love the same mercy in all and what is right and good for you and me now and here is right and good for every man everywhere and at all times for ever  surely surely what is noble and loveable and admirable now was so five thousand years ago and will be five thousand years hence  what is honourable for us here would be equally honourable for us in america or australiaay or in the farthest star in the skies  but some of you may say men at different times and in different countries have had very different notionsindeed quite opposite notions of what men ought to be  i know that some people say so  i can only answer that i differ from them  true some men have had less light than others and god knows have made fearful mistakes enough and fancied that they could please god by behaving like devils  but on the first principles of goodness all the world has been pretty well agreed all along for wherever men have been taught what is really right there have been plenty of hearts to answer yes this is good this is what we have wanted all along though we knew it not  and all the wisest men among the heathenthe men who have been honoured and even worshipped as blessings to their fellow men have agreed one and all in the great and golden rule thou shalt love god with all thy heart and soul and thy neighbour as thyself  believe about this as you may my friends still i believe and will believe i preach and will preach this and nought else but this that there is but one everlasting goodness which is good in men good in all rational beingsyea good in god himself  these last are solemn words but they are true and the more you think over them the more i tell you will you find them true  and to them i have been trying to lead you and will try once more  for did it never strike you againas it has meand all the world has looked different to me since i found it outthat there must be one in whom all goodness is gathered together one who must be perfectly and absolutely good  and did it never strike you that all the goodness in the world must in some way or other come from him i believe that our hearts and reasons if we will listen fairly to them tell us that it must be so and i am certain that the bible tells us so from beginning to end  when we see the million rain drops of the shower we say with reason there must be one great sea from which all these drops have come  when we see the countless rays of light we say with reason there must be one great central sun from which all these are shed forth  and when we see as it were countless drops and countless rays of goodness scattered about in the world a little good in this man and a little good in that shall we not say there must be one great sea one central sun of goodness from whence all human goodness comes  and where can that centre of goodness be but in the very character of god himself  yes my friends if you would know what god is think of all the noble beautiful loveable actions tempers feelings which you ever saw or heard of  think of all the good and admirable and loveable people whom you ever met and fancy to yourselves all that goodness nobleness admirableness loveableness and millions of times more gathered together in one to make one perfectly good characterand then you have some faint notion of god some dim sight of god who is the eternal and perfect goodness  it is but a faint notion no doubt that the best man can have of gods goodness so dull has sin made our hearts and brains  but let us comfort ourselves with this thoughtthat the more we learn to love what is good the more we accustom ourselves to think of good people and good things and to ask ourselves why and how this action and that is good the more shall we be able to see the goodness of god  and to see that even for a moment is worth all sights in earth or heaven  worth all sights indeed  no wonder that the saints of old called it the beatific vision that is the sight which makes a man utterly blessed namely to see if but for a moment with his minds eye what god is like and behold he is utterly good  no wonder that they said and i doubt not that they spoke honestly and simply what they felt that while that thought was before them this world was utterly nothing to them that they were as men in a dream or dead not caring to eat or to move for fear of losing that glorious thought but felt as if they were as they were most really and truly caught up into heaven and taken utterly out of themselves by the beauty and glory of gods perfect goodness  no wonder that they cried out with david whom have i in heaven o lord but thee and there is none on earth whom i desire in comparison of thee  no wonder that they said with st peter when he saw our lords glory lord it is good for us to be here and felt like men gazing upon some glorious picture or magnificent show off which they cannot take their eyes and which makes them forget for the time all beside in heaven and earth  and it was good for them to be there  but not too long  man was sent into this world not merely to see but to do and the more he sees the more he is bound to go and do accordingly  st peter had to come down from the mount and preach the gospel wearily for many a year and die at last upon the cross  st augustine in like wise though he would gladly have lived and died doing nothing but fixing his souls eye steadily on the glory of gods goodness had to come down from the mount likewise and work and preach and teach and wear himself out in daily drudgery for that god whom he learnt to serve even when he could not adore him in the press of business and the bustle of a rotten and dying world  but see my dear friends and consider it wellbefore a man can come to that state of mind or anything like it he must have begun by loving goodness wherever he saw it and have settled in his heart that to be good and therefore to do good is the most beautiful thing in the world  so he will begin by loving his brother whom he has seen and by taking delight in good people and in all honest true loving merciful generous words and actions and in those who say and do them  and so he will be fit to love god whom he has not seen when he finds out as god grant that you may all find out that all goodness of which we can conceive and far far more is gathered together in god and flows out from him eternally over his whole creation by that holy spirit who proceeds from the father and the son and is the lord and giver of life and therefore of goodness for goodness is nothing else if you will receive it but the eternal life of god which he has lived and lives now and will live for evermore god blessed for ever  amen  so my dear friends it will not be so difficult for you to love god if you will only begin by loving goodness which is gods likeness and the inspiration of gods holy spirit  for you will be like a man who has long admired a beautiful picture of some one whom he does not know and at last meets the person for whom the picture was meant and behold the living face is a thousand times more fair and noble than the painted one  you will be like a child which has been brought up from its birth in a room into which the sun never shone and then goes out for the first time and sees the sun in all his splendour bathing the earth with glory  if that child had loved to watch the dim narrow rays of light which shone into his dark room what will he not feel at the sight of that sun from which all those rays had come just so will they feel who having loved goodness for its own sake and loved their neighbours for the sake of what little goodness is in them have their eyes opened at last to see all goodness without flaw or failing bound or end in the character of god which he has shown forth in jesus christ our lord who is the likeness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person to whom be glory and honour for ever  amen    sermon ii  the glory of the cross    john xvii 1  father the hour is come  glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee  i spoke to you lately of the beatific vision of god i will speak of it again today and say this  if any man wishes to see god truly and fully with the eyes of his soul  if any man wishes for that beatific vision of god that perfect sight of gods perfect goodness then must that man go and sit down at the foot of christs cross and look steadfastly upon him who hangs thereon  and there he will see what the wisest and best among the heathen among the mussulmans among all who are not christian men never have seen and cannot see unto this day however much they may feel and some of them thank god do feel that god is the eternal goodness and must be loved accordingly  and what shall we see upon the cross  many things friends and more than i or all the preachers in the world will be able to explain to you though we preached till the end of the world  but one thing we shall see if we will which we have forgotten sadly christians though we be in these very days forgotten it most of us so utterly that in order to bring you back to it i must take a seemingly roundabout road  does it seem or does it not seem to you that the finest thing in a man is magnanimitywhat we call in plain english greatness of soul and if it does seem to you to be so what do you mean by greatness of soul  when you speak of a great soul and of a great man what manner of man do you mean  do you mean a very clever man a very farsighted man a very determined man a very powerful man and therefore a very successful man  a man who can manage everything and every person whom he comes across and turn and use them for his own ends till he rises to be great and gloriousa ruler king or what you will  wellhe is a great man  but i know a greater and nobler and more glorious stamp of man and you do also  let us try again and think if we can find his likeness and draw it for ourselves  would he not be somewhat like this patterna man who was aware that he had vast power and yet used that power not for himself but for others not for ambition but for doing good  surely the man who used his power for other people would be the greatersouled man would he not  let us go on then to find out more of his likeness  would he be stern or would he be tender  would he be patient or would he be fretful would he be a man who stands fiercely on his own rights or would he be very careful of other mens rights and very ready to waive his own rights gracefully and generously  would he be extreme to mark what was done amiss against him or would he be very patient when he was wronged himself though indignant enough if he saw others wronged  would he be one who easily lost his temper and lost his head and could be thrown off his balance by one foolish man  surely not  he would be a man whom no fool nor all fools together could throw off his balance a man who could not lose his temper could not lose his selfrespect a man who could bear with those who are peevish make allowances for those who are weak and ignorant forgive those who are insolent and conquer those who are ungrateful not by punishment but by fresh kindness overcoming their evil by his gooda man in short whom no illusage without and no illtemper within could shake out of his even path of generosity and benevolence  is not that the truly magnanimous man the great and royal soul  is not that the stamp of man whom we should admire if we met him on earth  should we not reverence that man esteem it an honour and a pleasure to work under that man to take him for our teacher our leader in hopes that by copying his example our souls might become great like his  is it so my friends  then know this that in admiring that man you admire the likeness of god  in wishing to be like that man you wish to be like god  for this is gods true greatness this is gods true glory this is gods true royalty the greatness glory and royalty of loving forgiving generous power which pours itself out untiring and undisgusted in help and mercy to all which he has made the glory of a father who is perfect in this that he causeth his rain to fall on the evil and on the good and his sun to shine upon the just and on the unjust and is good to the unthankful and the evil a father who has not dealt with us after our sins or rewarded us after our iniquities  a father who is not extreme to mark what is done amiss but whom it is worth while to fear for with him is mercy and plenteous redemptionall this and morea father who so loved a world which had forgotten him a world whose sins must have been disgusting to him that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for us and will with him freely give us all things a father in one word whose name and essence is love even as it is the name and essence of the son and of the holy ghost  this my friends is the glory of god  but this glory never shone out in its full splendour till it shone upon the cross  forthat we may go back again to that greatsouled man of whom i spoke just nowdid we not leave out one thing in his character or at least one thing by which his character might be proved and tried we said that he should be generous and forgiving we said that he should bear patiently folly peevishness ingratitude  but what if we asked of him that he should sacrifice himself utterly for the peevish ungrateful men for whose good he was toiling  what if we asked him to give up for them not only all which made life worth having but to give up life itself  to die for them and what is bitterest of all to die by their handsto receive as their reward for all his goodness to them a shameful death  if he dare submit to that then we should call his greatness of soul perfect magnanimity we should say could rise no higher in that would be the perfection of goodness  surely your hearts answer that this is true  when you hear of a father sacrificing his own life for his children when you hear of a soldier dying for his country when you hear of a clergyman or a physician killing himself by his work while he is labouring to save the souls or the bodies of his fellowcreatures then you feelthere is goodness in its highest shape  to give up our lives for others is one of the most beautiful and noble and glorious things on earth but to give up our lives willingly joyfully for men who misunderstand us hate us despise us is if possible a more glorious action still and the very perfection of perfect virtue then looking at christs cross we see that and even moreay far more than that  the cross was the perfect token of the perfect greatness of god and of the perfect glory of god  so on the cross the father justified himself to man yea glorified himself in the glory of his crucified son  on the cross god proved himself to be perfectly just perfectly good perfectly generous perfectly glorious beyond all that man could ever have dared to conceive or dream  that god must be good the wise heathens knew but that god was so utterly good that he could stoop to suffer to die for men and by menthat they never dreamed  that was the mystery of gods love which was hid in christ from the foundation of the world and which was revealed at last upon the cross of calvary by him who prayed for his murderersfather forgive them for they know not what they do  that truly blessed sight of a saviourgod who did not disdain to die the meanest and the most fearful of deathsthat that came home at once and has come home ever since to all hearts which had left in them any love and respect for goodness and melted them with the fire of divine love as god grant it may melt yours this day and henceforth for ever  i can say no more my friends  if this good news does not come home to your hearts by its own power it will never be brought home to you by any words of mine    sermon iii  the life of god    1 john i 2  for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us  what do we mean when we speak of the life everlasting  do we mean that mens souls are immortal and will live for ever after death either in happiness or misery  we must mean more than that  at least we ought to mean more than that if we be christian men  for the bible tells us that christ brought life and immortality to light  therefore they must have been in darkness before christs coming and men did not know as much about life and immortality before christs coming as they knowor ought to knownow  but if we need only believe that we shall live for ever after death in happiness or misery then christ has not brought life and immortality to light  he has thrown no fresh light upon the matter  and why  for this simple reason that the old heathen knew as much as that before christ came  the old greeks and romans and persians and our own forefathers before they became christians believed that mens souls would live for ever happy or miserable  the mussulmans mahommedans turks as they are called in the prayerbook believe as much as that now they believe that mens souls live for ever after death and go to heaven or hell  so those words everlasting life must needs mean something more than that  what do they mean  first  what does everlasting mean  it means exactly the same as eternal  the two words are the same only everlasting is english and eternal latin  but they have the same sense  now everlasting and eternal mean something which has neither beginning nor end  that is certain  the wisest of the heathen knew that  but we are apt to forget it  we are apt to think a thing may be everlasting because it has no end though it has a beginning  we are careless thinkers if we fancy that  god is eternal because he has neither beginning nor end  but here come two puzzles  first  the athanasian creed says that there is but one eternal that is god and never were truer words written  but do we not make out two eternals  for god is one eternal and eternal life is another eternal  now which is right we or the athanasian creed  i shall hold by the athanasian creed my friends and ask you to think again over the matter  thusif there be but one eternal there is but one way of escaping out of our puzzle which makes two eternals and that is to go back to the old doctrine of st paul and st john and the wisest of the fathers and say there is but one eternal and therefore eternal life is in the eternal god  and it is eternal life because it is gods life the life which god lives and it is eternal just because and only because it is the life of god and eternal death is nothing but the want of gods eternal life  certainly whether you think this true or not st john thought it true for he says so most positively in the text  he says that the life was manifestedshowed plainly upon earth and that he had seen it  and he says that he saw it in a man whom his eyes had seen and his hands had handled  how could that be  my friends how else could it be  how can you see life but by seeing some one live it  you cannot see a mans life unless you see him live such and such a life or hear of his living such and such a life and so knowing what his life manners character are  and so no one could have seen gods life or known what life god lived and what character gods was had it not been for the incarnation of our lord jesus christ who was made flesh and dwelt among us that by seeing him the son we might see the father whose likeness he was and is and ever will be  but now says st john we know what gods eternal life is for we know what christs life was on earth  and more we know that it is a life which men may live for christ lived it perfectly and utterly though he was a man  what sort of life then is everlasting life  who can tell altogether and completely  and yet who cannot tell in part  use the common sense my friends which god has given to you and thinkif eternal life be the life of god it must be a good life for god is good  that is the first and the most certain thing which we can say of it  it must be a righteous and just life a loving and merciful life for god is righteous just loving merciful and more it must be an useful life a life of good works for god is eternally useful doing good to all his creatures working for ever for the benefit of all which he has made  yesa life of good works  there is no good life without good works when you talk of a mans life you mean not only what he feels and thinks but what he does  what is in his heart goes for nothing unless he brings it out in his actions as far as he can  therefore st james says thou hast faith and i have works  shew me thy faith without thy works and who can do that and i will shew thee my faith by my works  and st john says there is no use saying you love  let us love not in word and in tongue but in deed and in truth and againand would to god that most people who talk so glibly about heaven and hell and the ways of getting thither would recollect this one plain textlittle children let no man deceive you  he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as god is righteous  and therefore it is that st paul bids rich men be rich also in noble deeds generous and liberal of their money to all who want that they may lay hold of that which is really life namely the eternal life of goodness  and therefore also my friends we may be sure that god loves in deed and in truth  because it is written that god is love  for if a man loves he longs to help those whom he loves  it is the very essence of love that it cannot be still cannot be idle cannot be satisfied with itself cannot contain itself but must go out to do good to those whom it loves to seek and to save that which is lost  and therefore god is perfect love and his eternal life a life of eternal love because he sends his son eternally to seek and to save that which is lost  this then is eternal life a life of everlasting love showing itself in everlasting good works and whosoever lives that life he lives the life of god and hath eternal life  what i have just said will help you i think to understand another royal text about eternal life  for now we may understand why it is written that this is life eternal to know the true and only god and jesus christ whom he has sent  for if eternal life be gods life we must know god and gods character to know what eternal life is like  and if no man has seen god at any time and gods life can only be seen in the life of christ then we must know christ and christs life to know god and gods life that the saying may be fulfilled in us god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son  one other royal text did i say  we may understand many perhaps all the texts which speak of life and eternal life if we will look at them in this way  we may see why st paul says that to be spiritually minded is life and that the life of jesus may be manifested in men  and how the sin of the old heathen lay in this that they were alienated from the life of god  we may understand how christs commandment is everlasting life how the water which he gives can spring up within a mans heart to everlasting lifeall such texts we may and shall understand more and more if we will bear in mind that everlasting life is the life of god and of christ a life of love a life of perfect active selfsacrificing goodness which is the one only true life for all rational beings whether on earth or in heaven  in heaven my friends as well as on earth  form your own notions as you will about angels and saints in heaven for every one must have some notions about them and try to picture to himself what the souls of those whom he has loved and lost are doing in the other world  but bear this in mind  that if the saints in heaven live the everlasting life they must be living a life of usefulness of love and of good works  and here i must say friends that however much the roman catholics may be wrong on many points they have remembered one thing about the life everlasting which we are too apt to forget and that is that everlasting life cannot be a selfish idle life spent only in being happy oneself  they believe that the saints in heaven are not idle that they are eternally helping mankind doing all sorts of good offices for those souls who need them that as st paul says of the angels they are ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who are heirs of salvation  and i cannot see why they should not be right  for if the saints delight was to do good on earth much more will it be to do good in heaven  if they helped poor sufferers if they taught the ignorant if they comforted the afflicted here on earth much more will they be able much more will they be willing to help comfort teach them now that they are in the full power the full freedom the full love and zeal of the everlasting life  if their hearts were warmed and softened by the fire of gods love here how much more there  if they lived gods life of love here how much more there before the throne of god and the face of christ  but if any one shall say that the souls of good men in heaven cannot help us who are here on earth i answer when did they ascend into heaven to find out that  if they had ever been there friends be sure they would have had better news to bring home than thisthat those whom we have honoured and loved on earth have lost the power which they used to have of comforting us who are struggling here below  that notion springs altogether out of a superstitious fancy that heaven is a great many millions of miles away from this earth which fancy wherever men get it from they certainly do not get it from the bible  moreover it seems to me that if the saints in heaven cannot help men then they cannot be happy in heaven  cannot be happy  ay must be miserable  for what greater misery for really good men than to see things going wrong and not to be able to mend them to see poor creatures suffering and not to be able to comfort them  no my friends we will believewhat every one who loves a beloved friend comes sooner or later to believethat those whom we have honoured and loved though taken from our eyes are near to our spirits that they still fight for us under the banner of their master christ and still work for us by virtue of his life of love which they live in him and by him for ever  pray to them indeed we need not as if they would help us out of any selfwill of their own  there i think the roman catholics are wrong  they pray to the saints as if the saints had wills of their own and fancies of their own and were respecters of persons and could have favourites and grant private favours to those who especially admired and i fear i must say it flattered them  but why should we do that  that is to lower gods saints in our own eyes  for if we believe that they are made perfect and like perfectly the everlasting life then we must believe that there is no selfwill in them  but that they do gods will and not their own and go on gods errands and not their own that he and not their own liking sends them whithersoever he wills and that if we ask of himof god our father himself that is enough for us  and what shall we ask  askfather thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  for in asking that we ask for the best of all things  we ask for the happiness the power the glory of saints and angels  we ask to be put into tune with gods whole universe from the meanest flower beneath our feet to the most glorious spirit whom god ever created we ask for the one everlasting life which can never die fail change or disappoint  yea for the everlasting life which christ the only begotten son lives from eternity to eternity for ever saying to his father thy will be done  yeswhen we ask god to make us do his will then indeed we ask for everlasting life  does that seem little  would you rather ask for all manner of pleasant things if not in this life at least in the life to come  oh my friends consider this  we were not put into this world to get pleasant things and we shall not be put into the next world as it seems to me to get pleasant things  we were put into this world to do gods will  and we shall be put i believe into the next world for the very same purposeto do gods will and if we do that we shall find pleasure enough in doing it  i do not doubt that in the next world all manner of harmless pleasure will come to us likewise because that will be we hope a perfect and a just world not a piecemeal confused often unjust world like this  but pleasant things will come to us in the next life only in proportion as we shall be doing gods will in the next life and we shall be happy and blessed only because we shall be living that eternal life of which i have been preaching to you all along the life which christ lives and has lived and will live for ever saying to the eternal fatheri come to do thy willnot my will but thine be done  oh may god give to us all his spirit the spirit by which christ did his fathers will and lived his fathers life in the soul and body of a mortal man that we may live here a life of obedience and of good works which is the only true and living life of faith and that when we die it may be said of usblessed are the dead who die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their works do follow them  they rest from their labours  all their struggles disappointments failures backslidings which made them unhappy here because they could not perfectly do the will of god are past and over for ever but their works follow them  the good which they did on earththat is not past and over  it cannot die  it lives and grows for ever following on in their path long after they are dead and bearing fruit unto everlasting life not only in them but in men whom they never saw and in generations yet unborn    sermon iv  the song of the three children    daniel iii 16 17 18  o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king  but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up  we read this morning instead of the te deum the song of the three children beginning oh all ye works of the lord bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  it was proper to do so because the ananias azarias and misael mentioned in it are the same as the shadrach meshech and abednego whose story we heard in the first lesson and because some of the old jews held that this noble hymn was composed by them and sung by them in the burning fiery furnace wherefore it has been called the song of the three children for child in old english meant a young man  be that as it may it is a glorious hymn worthy of the church of god worthy of those three young men worthy of all the noble army of martyrs and if the three young men did not actually use the very words of it still it was what they believed and because they believed it they had courage to tell nebuchadnezzar that they were not careful to answer himhad no manner of doubt or anxiety whatsoever as to what they were to say when he called on them to worship his gods  for his gods we know were the sun moon and planets and the angels who as the chaldeans believed ruled over the heavenly bodies and that image of gold is supposed by some learned men to have been probably a sign or picture of the wondrous power of life and growth which there is in all earthly thingsand that a sign of which i need not speak or you hear  so that the meaning of this song of the three children is simply this  you bid us worship the things about us which we see with our bodily eyes  we answer that we know the one true god who made all these things and that therefore instead of worshipping them we will bid them to worship him  now let us spend a few minutes in looking into this hymn and seeing what it teaches us  you see at once that it says that the one god and not many gods made all things  much more that things did not make themselves or grow up of their own accord by any virtue or life of their own  but it says more  it calls upon all things which god has made to bless him praise him and magnify him for ever  this is much more than merely saying one god made the world  for this is saying something about gods character declaring what this one god is like  for when you bless a personi do not mean when you pray god to bless himthat is a different thingwhen you bless any one i say you bless him because he is blessed and has done blessed things because he has shown himself good generous merciful useful  you praise a person because he is praiseworthy noble and admirable you magnify a personthat is speak of him to every one and everywhere in the highest termsbecause you think that every one ought to know how good and great he is  and therefore when the hymn says bless god praise him and magnify him for ever it does not merely confess gods power  no  it confesses too gods wisdom goodness beauty love and calls on all heaven and earth to admire him the alone admirable and adore him the alone adorable  for this is really to believe in god  not merely to believe that there is a god but to know what god is like and to know that he is worthy to be believed in worthy to be trusted honoured loved with heart and mind and soul because we know that he is worthy of our love  and this we have a right to say these three young men did or whosoever wrote this hymn and that as a reward for their faith in god there was granted to them that deep insight into the meaning of the world about them which shines out through every verse of this hymn  deep  i tell you my friends that this hymn is so deep that it is too deep for the shallow brains of which the world is full nowa days who fancy that they know all about heaven and earth just because they happen to have been born now and not two hundred years ago  to such this old hymn means nothing it is in their eyes merely an oldfashioned figure of speech to call on sun and stars green herb and creeping thing to praise and bless god  nevertheless the old hymn stands in our prayerbooks as a precious heirloom to our children and long may it stand  though we may forget its meaning yet perhaps our children after us will recollect it once more and say with their hearts what we now i fear only say with our lips and should not say at all if it was not put into our months by the prayerbook  do you not understand what i mean  then think of this  if we were writing a hymn about god should we dare to say to the things about usto the cattle feeding in the fieldsmuch less to the clouds over our heads and to the wells of which we drink bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  we should not dare and for two reasons  firstthere is a notion abroad borrowed from the old monks that this earth is in some way bad and cursed that a curse is on it still for mans sake  but a notion which is contrary to plain fact for if we till the ground it does not bring forth thorns and thistles to us as the scripture says it was to do for adam but wholesome food and rich returns for our labour  and which in the next place is flatly contrary to scripture  for we read in genesis viii 21 how the lord said i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake and the psalms always speak of this earth and of all created things as if there was no curse at all on them saying that all things serve god and continue as they were at the beginning and that he has given them a law which cannot be broken and in the face of those words let who will talk of the earth being cursed i will not and you shall not if i can help it  another reason why we dare not talk of this earth as this hymn does is that we have got into the habit of saying cattle and creeping thingsthey are not rational beings  how can they praise god clouds and wellsthey are not even living things  how can they praise god  why speak of them in a hymn much less speak to them  yet this hymn does speak to them and so do the psalms and the prophets again and again  and so will men do hereafter when the fashions and the fancies of these days are past and men have their eyes opened once more to see the glory which is around them from their cradle to their grave and hear once more the word of the lord walking among the trees of the garden  but how can this be  how can not only dumb things but even dead things praise god  my friends this is a great mystery of which the wisest men as yet know but little and confess freely how little they know  but this at least we know already and can say boldlyall things praise god by fulfilling the law which our lord himself declared when he said not every one who saith to me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven  but he that doeth the will of my father who is in heaven  by doing the will of the heavenly father  by obeying the laws which god has given them  by taking the shape which he has appointed for them  by being of the use for which he intended them  by multiplying each after their kind by laws and means a thousand times more strange than any signs and wonders of which man can fancy for himself and by thus showing forth gods boundless wisdom goodness love and tender care of all which he has made  yes my friends in this sense and this is the true sense all things can serve and praise god and all things do serve and praise him  not a cloud which fleets across the sky not a clod of earth which crumbles under the frost not a blade of grass which breaks through the snow in spring not a dead leaf which falls to the earth in autumn but is doing gods work and showing forth gods glory not a tiny insect too small to be seen by human eyes without the help of a microscope but is as fearfully and wonderfully made as you and me and has its proper food habitation work appointed for it and not in vain  nothing is idle nothing is wasted nothing goes wrong in this wondrous world of god  the very scum upon the standing pool which seems mere dirt and dust is all alive peopled by millions of creatures each full of beauty full of use obeying laws of god too deep for us to do aught but dimly guess at them and as men see deeper and deeper into the mystery of gods creation they find in the commonest things about them wonder and glory such as eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive and can only say with the psalmist oh lord thy ways are infinite thy thoughts are very deep and confess that the grass beneath their feet the clouds above their headsay every worm beneath the sod and bird upon the bough do in very deed and truth bless the lord who made them praise him and magnify him for ever not with words indeed but with works and say to man all day long go thou and do likewise  yes my friends let us go and do likewise  if we wish really to obey the lesson of the hymn of the three children let us do the will of god  and so worship him in spirit and in truth  do not fancy as too many do that thou canst praise god by singing hymns to him in church once a week and disobeying him all the week long crying to him lord lord and then living as if he were not thy lord but thou wast thine own lord and hadst a right to do thine own will and not his  if thou wilt really bless god then try to live his blessed life of goodness  if thou wilt truly praise god then behave as if god was praiseworthy good and right in what he bids thee do  if thou wouldest really magnify god and declare his greatness then behave as if he were indeed the great god who ought to be obeyed ay who must be obeyed for his commandment is life and it alone to thee as well as to all which he has made  dost thou fancy as the heathen do that god needs to be flattered with fine words or that thou wilt be heard for thy much speaking and thy vain repetitions he asks of thee works as well as words and more he asks of thee works first and words after  and better it is to praise him truly by works without words than falsely by words without works  cry if thou wilt holy holy holy lord god of hosts but show that thou believest him to be holy by being holy thyself  sing if thou wilt of the father of an infinite majesty but show that thou believest his majesty to be infinite by obeying his commandments like those three children let them cost thee what they may  join and join freely in the songs of the heavenly host for god has given thee reason and speech after the likeness of his only begotten son and thou mayest use them as well as every other gift in the service of thy father  but take care lest while thou art trying to copy the angels thou art not even as righteous as the beasts of the field for they bless and praise god by obeying his laws and till thou dost that and obeyest gods laws likewise thou art not as good as the grass beneath thy feet  for after all has been said and sung my friends the sum and substance of true religion remains what it was and what it will be for ever and lies in this one word if ye love me keep my commandments    sermon v  the eternal goodness    matthew xxii 39  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  why are wrong things wrong  why for instance is it wrong to steal  because god has forbidden it you may answer  but is it so whatsoever god forbids must be wrong  but is it wrong because god forbids it or does god forbid it because it is wrong  for instance suppose that god had not forbidden us to steal would it be right then to steal or at least not wrong  we must really think of this  it is no mere question of words it is a solemn practical question which has to do with our everyday conduct and yet which goes down to the deepest of all matters even to the depths of god himself  the question is simply this  did god who made all things make right and wrong  many people think so  they think that god made goodness  but how can that be  for if god made goodness there could have been no goodness before god made it  that is clear  but god was always good good from all eternity  but how could that be how could god be good before there was any goodness made  that notion will not do then  and all we can say is that goodness is eternal and everlasting just as god is  because god was and is and ever will be eternally and always good  but is eternal goodness one thing and the eternal god another that cannot be again for as the athanasian creed tells us so wisely and well there are not many eternals but one eternal  therefore goodness must be the spirit of god and god must be the spirit of goodness and right is nothing else but the character of the everlasting god and of those who are inspired by god  what is wrong then  whatever is unlike right whatever is unlike goodness whatever is unlike god that is wrong  and why does god forbid us to do wrong  simply because wrong is unlike himself  he is perfectly beautiful perfectly blest and happy because he is perfectly good and he wishes to see all his creatures beautiful blest and happy  but they can only be so by being perfectly good and they can only be perfectly good by being perfectly like god their father and they can only be perfectly like god the father by being full of love loving their neighbour as themselves  for what do we mean when we talk of right righteousness goodness  many answers have been given to that question  the old romans who were a stern legalminded people used to say that righteousness meant to hurt no man and to give every man his own  the eastern people had a better answer still which our blessed lord used in one place when he told them that righteousness was to do to other people as we would they should do to us  but the best answer the perfect answer is our lords in the text thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  this is the true eternal righteousness  not a legal righteousness not a righteousness made up of forms and ceremonies of keeping days holy and abstaining from meats or any other arbitrary commands whether of god or of man this is gods goodness gods righteousness christs own goodness and righteousness  do you not see what i mean  remember only one word of st johns  god is love  love is the goodness of god  god is perfectly good because he is perfect love  then if you are full of love you are good with the same goodness with which god is good and righteous with christs righteousness  that as what st paul wished to be when he wished to be found in christ not having his own righteousness but the righteousness which is by faith in christ his own righteousness was the selfish and selfconceited righteousness which he had before his conversion made up of forms and ceremonies and doctrines which made him narrowhearted bigoted selfconceited fierce cruel a persecutor the righteousness which made him stand by in cold blood to see st stephen stoned  but the righteousness which is by faith in christ is a loving heart and a loving life which every man will long to lead who believes really in jesus christ  for when he looks at christ christs humiliation christs work christs agony christs death and sees in it nothing but utter and perfect love to poor sinful undeserving man then his heart makes answer yes i believe in that i believe and am sure that that is the most beautiful character in the world that that is the utterly noble and right sort of person to befull of love as christ was  i ought to be like that  my conscience tells me that i ought  and i can be like that  christ who was so good himself must wish to make me good like himself and i can trust him to do it  i can have faith in him that he will make me like himself full of the spirit of love without which i shall be only useless and miserable  and i trust him enough to be sure that good as he is he cannot mean to leave me useless or miserable  so by true faith in christ the man comes to have christs righteousnessthat is to be loving as christ was  he believes that christs loving character is perfect beauty that he must be the son of god if his character be like that  he believes that christ can and will fill him with the same spirit of love and as he believes so is it with him and in him those words are fulfilled whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god and that if a man love me says the lord i and my father will come to him and take up our abode with him  those are wonderful words  but if you will recollect what i have just said you may understand a little of them  st john puts the same thing very simply but very boldly  god is love he says and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  strange as it may seem it must be so if god be love  let us thank god that it is true and keep in mind what awful and wonderful creatures we are that god should dwell in us what blessed and glorious creatures we may become in time if we will only listen to the voice of god who speaks within our hearts  and what does that voice say  the old commandment my friends which was from the beginning love one another  whatever thoughts or feeling in your hearts contradict that whatever tempts you to despise your neighbour to be angry with him to suspect him to fancy him shut out from gods love that is not of god  no voice in our hearts is gods voice but what says in some shape or other love thy neighbour as thyself  care for him bear with him long and try to do him good  for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god  he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love still less can he who is not loving fulfil the law for the law of god is the very pattern and picture of gods character and if a man does not know what god is like he will never know what gods law is like and though he may read his bible all day long he will learn no more from it than a dumb animal will unless his heart is full of love  for love is the light by which we see god by which we understand his bible by which we understand our duty and gods dealings in the world  love is the light by which we understand our own hearts by which we understand our neighbours hearts  so it is if you hate any man or have a spite against him you will never know what is in that mans heart never be able to form a just opinion of his character  if you want to understand human beings or to do justice to their feelings you must begin by loving them heartily and freely and the more you like them the better you will understand them and in general the better you will find them to be at heart the more worthy of your trust at least the more worthy of your compassion  at least so st john says he that saith he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness even till now and knoweth not whither he goeth  but he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no occasion of stumbling in him  no occasion of stumbling  that is of making mistakes in our behaviour to our neighbours which cause scandal drive them from us and make them suspect us dislike usand perhaps with too good reason  just think for yourselves  what does half the misery and all the quarrelling in the world come from but from peoples loving themselves better than their neighbours  would children be disobedient and neglectful to their parents if they did not love themselves better than their parents  why does a man kill commit adultery steal bear false witness covet his neighbours goods his neighbours custom his neighbours rights but because he loves his own pleasure or interest better than his neighbours loves himself better than the man whom he wrongs  would a man take advantage of his neighbour if he loved him as well as himself  would he be hard on his neighbour and say pay me the uttermost farthing if he loved him as he loves himself  would he speak evil of his neighbour behind his back if he loved him as himself  would he cross his neighbours temper just because he will have his own way right or wrong if he loved him as himself  judge for yourselves  what would the world become like this moment if every man loved his neighbour as himself thought of his neighbour as much as he thinks of himself  would it not become heaven on earth at once  there would be no need then for soldiers and policemen lawyers rates and taxes my friends and all the expensive and heavy machinery which is now needed to force people into keeping something of gods law  ay there would be no need of sermons preachers and prophets to tell men of gods law and warn them of the misery of breaking it  they would keep the law of their own freewill by love  for love is the fulfilling of the law and as st augustine says love you neighbour and then do what you willbecause you will be sure to will what is right  so truly did our lord say that on this one commandment hung all the law and the prophets  but though that blessed state of things will not come to the whole world till the day when christ shall reign in that new heaven and new earth in which righteousness shall dwell still it may come here now on earth to each and every one of us if we will but ask from god the blessed gift to love our neighbour as we love ourselves  and then my friends whether we be rich or poor fortunate or unfortunate still that spirit of love which is the spirit of god will be its exceeding great reward  i say its own reward  for what is to be our reward if we do our duty earnestly however imperfectly  well done thou good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy lord  and what is the joy of our lord  what is the joy of christ  the joy and delight which springs for ever in his great heart from feeling that he is for ever doing good from loving all and living for all from knowing that if not all yet millions on millions are grateful to him and will be for ever  my friends if you have ever done a kind action if you have ever helped any one in distress or given up a pleasure for the sake of othersdo you not know that that deed gave you a peace a self content a joy for the moment at least which nothing in this world could give or take away  and if the person whom you helped thanked you if you felt that you had made that man your friend that he trusted you now looked on you now as a brotherdid not that double the pleasure  i ask you is there any pleasure in the world like that of doing good and being thanked for it  then that is the joy of your lord  that is the joy of christ rising up in you as often as you do good the love which is in you rejoicing in itself because it has found a loving thing to do and has called out the love of a human being in return  yes if you will receive it that is the joy of christthe glorious knowledge that he is doing endless good and calling out endless love to himself and to the father till the day when he shall give up to his father the kingdom which he has won back from sin and death and god shall be all in all  that is the joy of your lord  if you wish for any different sort of joy after you die you must not ask me to tell you of it for i know nothing about the matter save what i find written in the holy scripture    sermon vi  worship    isaiah i 12 13  when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts  bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting  this is a very awful text one of those which terrify usor at least ought to terrify usand set us on asking ourselves seriously and honestlywhat do i believe after all  what manner of man am i after all  what sort of show should i make after all if the people round me knew my heart and all my secret thoughts  what sort of show then do i already make in the sight of almighty god who sees every man exactly as he is  i say such texts as this ought to terrify us  it is good to be terrified now and then to be startled and called to account and set thinking and sobered as it were now and then that we may look at ourselves honestly anti bravely and see if we can what sort of men we are  and therefore perhaps it is that this chapter is chosen for the first advent lesson to prepare us for christmas to frighten us somewhat at least to set us thinking seriously and to make us fit to keep christmas in spirit and in truth  for whom does this text speak of  it speaks of religious people and of a religious nation and of a fearful mistake which they were making and a fearful danger into which they had fallen  now we are religious people and england is a religious nation and therefore we may possibly make the same mistake and fall into the same danger as these old jews  i do not say that we have done so but we may for human nature is just the same now as it was then and therefore it is as well for us to look roundat least once now and then and see whether we too are in danger of falling while we think that we are standing safe  what does isaiah then tell the religious jews of his day  that their worship of god their churchgoing their sabbaths and their appointed feasts were a weariness and an abomination to him that god loathed them and would not listen to the prayers which were made in them  that the whole matter was a mockery and a lie in his sight  these are awful words enoughthat god should hate and loathe what he himself had appointed that what would be one would think one of the most natural and most pleasant sights to a loving father in heavennamely his own children worshipping blessing and praising himshould be horrible in his sight  there is something very shocking in that at least to church people like us  if we were dissenters who go to chapel chiefly to hear sermons it would be easy for us to sayof course forms and ceremonies and appointed feasts are nothing to begin with they are mans invention at best and may therefore be easily enough an abomination to god  but we know that they are not so that forms and ceremonies and appointed feasts are good things as long as they have spirit and truth in them that whether or not they be of mans invention they spring out of the most simple wholesome wants of our human nature which is a good thing and not a bad one for god made it in his own likeness and bestowed it on us  we know or ought to know that appointed feast days like christmas are good and comfortable ordinances which cheer our hearts on our way through this world and give us something noble and lovely to look forward to month after month that they are like landmarks along the road of life reminding us of what god has done and is doing for us and all mankind  and if you do not know i know that people who throw away ordinances and festivals end at least in a generation or two in throwing away the gospel truth which that ordinance or festival reminds us of just as too many who have thrown away good friday have thrown away the good friday good news that christ died for all mankind and too many who have thrown away christmas are throwing awayoften without meaning to do sothe christmas good news that christ really took on himself the whole of our human nature and took the manhood into god  so it is my friends and so it will be  for these forms and festivals are the old landmarks and beacons of the gospel and if a man will not look at the landmarks then he will lose his way  therefore to church people like us it ought to be a shocking thing even to suspect that god may be saying to us your appointed feasts my soul hateth and it ought to set them seriously thinking how such a thing may happen that they may guard against it  for if god be not pleased with our coming to his house what right have we in his house at all  but recollect this my dear friends that we are not to use this text to search and judge others faults but to search and judge our own  for if a man hearing this sermon looks at his neighbour across the church and says in his heart ay such a bad one as he iswhat right has he in churchthen god answers that man who art thou who judgest another  to his own master he standeth or falleth yes my friends recollect what the old tombstone outside saysand right good doctrine it isand fit it to this sermon   when this you see pray judge not me    for sin enough i own judge yourselves mend your lives    leave other folks alone   but if a man hearing this sermon begins to say to himself such a man as i amso full of faults as i amwhat right have i in church so selfishso uncharitableso worldlyso uselessso unfair or whatever other faults the man may feel guilty ofin one word so unlike what i ought to beso unlike christso unlike god whom i come to worship  how little i act up to what i believe how little i really believe what i have learnt what right have i in church  what if god were saying the same of me as he said of those old jews thy churchgoing thy coming to communion thy christmasday my soul hateth i am weary to bear it  who hath required this at thy hands to tread my courts  people round me may think me good enough as men go now but i know myself too well and i know that instead of saying with the pharisee to any man here i thank god that i am not as this man or that i ought rather to stand afar off like the publican and not lift up so much as my eyes toward heaven crying only god be merciful to me a sinner  if a man should think thus my friends his thoughts may make him very serious for awhile nay very sad  but they need not make him miserable  need still less make him despair  they ought to set him on thinkingwhy do i come to church  because it is the fashion  because i want to hear the preacher  noto worship god  but what is worshipping god  that must depend entirely my friends upon who god is  as i often tell you most questionsay if you will receive it all questionsdepend upon this one root question who is god  but certainly this question of worshipping god must depend upon who god is  for how he ought to be worshipped depends on what will please him  and what will please him depends on what his character is  if god be as some fancy hard and arbitrary then you must worship him in a way in which a hard arbitrary person would like to be addressed with all crouching and cringing and slavish terror  if god be again as some fancy cold and hard of hearing then you must worship him accordingly  you must cry aloud as baals priests did to catch his notice and put yourselves to torment as they did and as many a christian has done since to move his pity and you must use repetitions as the heathen do and believe that you will be heard for your much speaking  the lord jesus called all such repetitions vain and much speaking a fancy  but then the lord jesus spoke to men of a father in heaven a very different god from such as i speak ofand alas some christian people believe in  but my friends if you believe in your heavenly father the good god whom your lord jesus christ has revealed to you and if you will consider that he is good and consider what that word good means then you will not have far to seek before you find what worship means and how you can worship him in spirit and in truth  for if god be good worshipping him must mean praising and admiring himadoring him as we call itfor being good  and nothing more  certainly much more  also to ask him to make us good  that too must be a part of worshipping a good god  for the very property of goodness is that it wishes to make others good  and if god be good he must wish to make us good also  to adore god then for his goodness and to pray to him to make us good is the sum and substance of all wholesome worship  and for that purpose a man may come to church and worship god in spirit and in truth though he be dissatisfied with himself and ashamed of himself and knows that he is wrong in many things provided always that he wishes to be set right and made good  for he may come saying o god thou art good and i am bad and for that very reason i come  i come to be made good  i admire thy goodness and i long to copy it but i cannot unless thou help me purge me make me clean  cleanse thou me from my secret faults and give me truth in the inward parts  do what thou wilt with me  train me as thou wilt  punish me if it be necessary  only make me good  then is the man fit indeed to come to church sins and all if he carry his sins into church not to carry them out again safely and carefully as we are all too apt to do but to cast them down at the foot of christs cross in the hope and no man ever hoped that hope in vainthat he will be lightened of that burden and leave some of them at least behind him  ay no man i say ever hoped that in vain  no man ever yet felt the burden of his sins really intolerable and unbearable but what the burden of his sins was taken off him before all was over and christs righteousness given to him instead  then a man is fit not only to come to church but to come to holy communion on christmasday and all days  for then and there he will find put into words for him the very deepest sorrows and longings of his heart  there he may say as heartily as he can and the more heartily the better i acknowledge and bewail my manifold sins and wickedness  the remembrance of them is grievous unto me the burden of them is intolerable but there he will hear christ promising in return to pardon and deliver him from all his sins to confirm and strengthen him in all goodness  that last is what he ought to want and if he wants it he will surely find it  he may join there with the whole universe of god in crying holy holy holy lord god of hosts heaven and earth are full of thy glory and still in the same breath he may confess again his unworthiness so much as to gather up the crumbs under gods table and cast himself simply and utterly upon the eternal property of gods eternal essence which isalways to have mercy  but he will hear forthwith christs own answerif thou art bad i can and will make thee good  my blood shall wash away thy sin  my body shall preserve thee body soul and spirit to the everlasting life of goodness  and so god will bless that mans communion to him and bless to him his keeping of christmasday because out of a true penitent heart and lively faith he will be offering to the good god the sacrifice of his own bad self that god may take it and make it good and so will be worshipping the everlasting and infinite goodness in spirit and in truth    sermon vii  gods inheritance    gal iv 6 7  because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father  wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ  this is the second good news of christmasday  the first is that the son of god became man  the second is why he became man  that men might become the sons of god through him  therefore st paul says you are the sons of god  notyou may be if you are very good  but you are in order that you may become very good  your being good does not tell you that you are the sons of god  your baptism tells you so  your baptism gives you a right to say i am the child of god  how shall i behave then  what ought a child of god to be like  now st paul you see knew well that we could not make ourselves gods children by any feelings fancies or experiences of our own  but he knew just as well that we cannot make ourselves behave as gods children should by any thoughts and trying of our own  god alone made us his children god alone can make us behave like his children  and therefore st paul says god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts  by which we cry to god our father  but some will say have we that spirit  st paul says that you have  and surely he speaks truth  let us search then and see where that spirit is in us  it is a great and awful honour for sinful men  but i do believe that if we seek we shall find that he is not far from any one of us for in him we live and move and have our being and all in us which is not ignorance falsehood folly and filth comes from him  now the bible says that this spirit is the spirit of gods son the spirit of christ and what sort of spirit is that  we may see by remembering what sort of a spirit christ had when on earth for he certainly has the same spirit nowthe spirit which proceedeth everlastingly from the father and from the son  and what was that like  what was christ like  what was his spirit like  it was a spirit of love mercy pity generosity usefulness unselfishness  a spirit of truth honour fearless love of what was right  a spirit of duty and willing obedience which made him rejoice in doing his fathers will  in all things the spirit of a perfect son in all things a lovely noble holy spirit  and now my dear friends is there nothing in you like that  you may forget it at times you may disobey it very often  but is there not something in all your hearts more or less which makes you love and admire what is right  when you hear of a noble action is there nothing in you which makes you approve and admire it  is there nothing in your hearts which makes you pity those who are in sorrow and long to help them nothing which stirs your heart up when you hear of a mans nobly doing his duty and dying rather than desert his post or do a wrong or mean thing  surely there issurely there is  then o my dear friends when those feelings come into your hearts rejoice with trembling as men to whom god has given a great and precious gift  for they are none other than the spirit of the son of god striving with your hearts that he may form christ in you and raise up your hearts to cry with full faith to god my father which art in heaven  ah but you will say we like what is right but we do not always do it  we like to see pity and mercy  but we are very often proud and selfish and tyrannical  we like to see justice and honour  but we are too apt to be mean and unjust ourselves  we like to see other people doing their duty  but we very often do not do ours  well my dear friends perhaps that is true  if it be confess your sins like honest men and they shall be forgiven you  if you can so complain of yourselves i am sure i can of myself ten times more  but do you not see that this very thing is a sign to you that the good and noble thoughts in you are not your own but gods  if they came out of your own spirits then you would have no difficulty in obeying them  but they came out of gods spirit and our sinful and selfwilled spirits are striving against his and trying to turn away from gods light  what can we do then  we can cherish those noble thoughts those pure and higher feelings when they arise  we can welcome them as heavenly medicine from our heavenly father  we can resolve not to turn away from them even though they make us ashamed not to grieve the spirit of the son of god even though he grieves us as he ought to do and will do more and more by showing us our own weakness and meanness and how unlike we are to christ the only begotten son  if we shut our hearts to those good feelings they will go away and leave us  and if they do we shall neither respect our neighbours nor respect ourselves  we shall see no good in our neighbours but become scornful and suspicious to them and if we do that we shall soon see no good in ourselves  we shall become discontented with ourselves more and more given up to angry thoughts and mean ways which we hate and despise all the while that we go on in them  and thenmark my wordswe shall lose all real feeling of god being our father and we his sons  we shall begin to fancy ourselves his slaves and not his children and god our taskmaster and not our father  we shall dislike the thought of god  we shall long to hide from god  we shall fall back into slavish terror and a fearful looking forward to of judgment and fiery indignation because we have trampled under foot the grace of god the noble pure tender and truly graceful feelings which gods spirit bestowed on us to fill us with the grace of christ  therefore my dear friends never check any good or right feelings in yourselves or in your children for they come from the spirit of the son of god himself  but as st paul says phil iv 3 finally brethren whatsoever things are honourable whatsoever things are just what soever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things    and the god of peace shall be with you  avoid all which can make you mean low selfish cruel  cling to all which can fill your mind with lofty kindly generous loyal thoughts and so in gods good time you will enter into the meaning of those great wordsabba father  the more you give up your hearts to such good feelings the more you will understand of god the more nobleness there is in you the more you will see gods nobleness gods justice gods love gods true glory  the more you become like gods son the more you will understand how god can stoop to call himself your father and the more you will understand what a father what a perfect father god is and in the world to come i trust you will enter into the glorious liberty of the sons of godthat liberty which comes as i told you last sunday not from doing your own will but the will of god that glory which comes not from having anything of your own to pride yourselves upon but from being filled with the spirit of god the spirit of jesus christ by which you shall for ever look up freely and yet reverently to the almighty god of heaven and earth and say impossible as the honour seems for man yet thou o god hast said it and it is true  thou even thou art my father and i thy son in jesus christ who became awhile the son of man on earth that i might become for ever the son of god in heaven  and so will come true to us st pauls great words if we be sons then heirs of god joint heirs with christ  heirs of god  but what is our inheritance  the same as christs  and what is christs inheritance  what but god himselfthe knowledge of our father in heaven of his love to us and of his eternal beauty and glory which fills all heavens and all worlds with light and life    sermon viii  de profundis    psalm cxxx 1  out of the deep have i cried unto thee o lord  lord hear my voice  what is this deep of which david speaks so often  he knew it well for he had been in it often and long  he was just the sort of man to be in it often  a man with great good in him and great evil with very strong passions and feelings dragging him down into the deep and great light and understanding to show him the dark secrets of that horrible pit when he was in it and with great love of god too and of order and justice and of all good and beautiful things to make him feel the horribleness of that pit where he ought not to be all the more from its difference its contrast with the beautiful world of light and order and righteousness where he ought to be therefore he knew that deep well and abhorred it and he heaps together every ugly name to try and express what no man can express the horror of that place  it is a horrible pit mire and clay where he can find no footing but sinks all the deeper for his struggling it is a place of darkness and of storms a shoreless and bottomless sea where he is drowning and drowning while all gods waves and billows go over him  it is a place of utter loneliness where he sits like a sparrow on the housetop or a doleful bird in the desert while god has put his lovers and friends away from him and hid his acquaintance out of his sight and no man cares for his soul and all men seem to him liars and god himself seems to have forgotten him and forgotten all the world  it is a dreadful net which has entangled his feet a dark prison in which he is set so fast that he cannot get forth  it is a torturing disgusting disease which gives his flesh no health and his bones no rest and his wounds are putrid and corrupt  it is a battlefield after the fight where he seems to lie stript among the dead like those who are wounded and cut away from gods hand and lies groaning in the dust of death seeing nothing round him but doleful shapes of destruction and misery alone in the outer darkness while a horrible dread overwhelms him  yea it is hell itself the pit of hell the nethermost hell he says where gods wrath burns like fire till his tongue cleaves to his gums and his bones are burnt up like a firebrand till he is weary of crying his throat is dry his heart fails him for waiting so long upon his god  yes  a dark and strange place is that same deep pit of godif indeed it be gods and god made it  perhaps god did not make it for god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and that pit cannot be very good for all good things are orderly and in shape and in that pit is no shape no order nothing but contradiction and confusion  when a man is in that pit it will seem to him as if he were alone in the world and longing above all things for company and yet he will hate to have any one to speak to him and wrap himself up in himself to brood over his own misery  when he is in that pit he shall be so blind that he can see nothing though his eyes be open in broad noonday  when he is in that pit he will hate the thing which he loves most and love the thing which he hates most  when he is in that pit he will long to die and yet cling to life desperately and be horribly afraid of dying  when he is in that pit it will seem to him that god is awfully horribly near him and he will try to hide from god try to escape from under gods hand  and yet all the while that god seems so dreadfully near him god will seem further off from him than ever millions and millions of miles away parted from him by walls of iron and a great gulf which he can never pass  there is nothing but contradiction in that pit  the man who is in it is of two minds about himself and his kin and neighbours and all heaven and earth and knows not where to turn or what to think or even where he is at all  for the food which he gets in that deep pit is very hunger of soul and rage and vain desires  and the ground which he stands on in that deep is a bottomless quagmire and doubt and change and shapeless dread  and the air which he breathes in that deep is the very fire of god which burns up everlastingly all the chalk and dross of the world  i said that that deep was not merely the deep of affliction  no for you may see men with every comfort which wealth and home can give who are tormented day and night in that deep pit in the midst of all their prosperity calling for a drop of water to cool their tongue and finding none  and you may see poor creatures dying in agony on lonely sick beds who are not in that pit at all but in that better place whereof it is written blessed are they who going through the vale of misery use it for a well and the pools are filled with water and again if any man thirst let him come to me and drink and the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life  nothat deep pit is a far worse place an utterly bad place and yet it may be good for a man to have fallen into it and strangely enough if he do fall in the lower he sinks in it the better for him at last  that is another strange contradiction in that pit which david found that though it was a bottomless pit the deeper he sank in it the more likely he was to find his feet set on a rock the further down in the nethermost hell he was the nearer he was to being delivered from the nethermost hell  of course if he had staid in that pit he must have died body and soul  no mortal man or immortal soul could endure it long  no immortal soul could for he would lose all hope all faith in god all feeling of there being anything like justice and order in the world all hope for himself or for mankind lying so in that living grave where no man can see gods righteousness or his faithfulness in that land where all things are forgotten  and his mere mortal body could not stand it  the misery and terror and confusion of his soul would soon wear out his body and he would die as i have seen men actually die when their souls have been left in that deep somewhat too long shrink together into dark melancholy and pine away and die  and i have seen sweet young creatures too whom god for some purpose of his own which must be good and loving for he did it has let fall awhile into that deep of darkness and then in compassion to their youth and tenderness and innocence has lifted them gently out again and set their weary feet upon the everlasting rock which is christ and has filled them with the light of his countenance and joy and peace in believing and has led them by green pastures and made them rest by the waters of comfort and yet though their souls were healed their bodies were not  that fearful struggle has been too much for frail humanity and they have drooped and faded and gone peacefully after a while home to their god as a fair flower withers if the fire has but once past over it  but some i have seen men and women who have arisen like david out of that strange deep all the stronger for their fall and have found out another strange contradiction about that deep and the fire of god which burns below in it  for that fire hardens a man and softens him at the same time and he comes out of it hardened to that hardness of which it is written do thou endure hardness like a good soldier of jesus christ and again i have fought a good fight i have kept the faith i have finished my course yet softened to that softness of which it is written be ye tenderhearted compassionate forgiving one another even as god for christs sake has forgiven youand again we have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities seeing that he has been tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  happy thrice happy are they who have thus walked through the valley of the shadow of death and found it the path which leads to everlasting life  happy are they who have thus writhed awhile in the fierce fire of god and have had burnt out of them the chaff and dross and all which offends and makes them vain light and yet makes them dull drags them down at the same time till only the pure gold of gods righteousness is left seven times tried in the fire incorruptible and precious in the sight of god and man  such people need not regretthey will not regretall that they have gone through  it has made them brave made them sober made them patient it has given them   the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill   and so has shaped them into the likeness of christ who was made perfect by suffering and though he were a son yet in the days of his flesh made strong supplication and crying with tears to his father and was heard in that he feared and so though he died on the cross and descended into hell yet triumphed over death and hell by dying and by descending and conquered them by submitting to them and yet they have been softened in that fierce furnace of gods wrath into another likeness of christwhich after all is still the same the character which he showed when he wept by the grave of lazarus and over the sinful city of jerusalem which he showed when his heart yearned over the perishing multitude and over the leper and the palsied man and the maniac possessed with devils the character which he showed when he said to the woman taken in adultery neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more which he showed when he said to the sinful magdalene who washed his feet with tears and wiped them with her hair her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much the likeness which he showed in his very death agony upon the torturing cross when he prayed for his murderers father forgive them for they know not what they do this is the character which man may get in that dark deepto feel for all and feel with all to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep to understand peoples trials and make allowances for their temptations to put oneself in their place till we see with their eyes and feel with their hearts till we judge no man and have hope for all to be fair and patient and tender with every one we meet to despise no one despair of no one because christ despises none and despairs of none to look upon every one we meet with love almost with pity as people who either have been down into the deep of horror or may go down into it any day to see our own sins in other peoples sins and know that we might do what they do and feel as they feel any moment did god desert us to give and forgive to live and let live even as christ gives to us and forgives us and lives for us and lets us live in spite of all our sins  and how shall we learn this  how shall the bottomless pit if we fall into it be but a pathway to the everlasting rock  david tells us  out of the deep have i cried unto thee o lord  he cried to god  not to himself his own learning talents wealth prudence to pull him out of that pit  not to princes nobles and great men  not to doctrines books churchgoings  not to the dearest friend he had on earth for they had forsaken him could not understand him thought him perhaps beside himself  not to his own good works almsgivings churchgoings churchbuildings  not to his own experiences faiths assurances frames or feelings  the matter was too terrible to be plastered over in that way or in any way  he was face to face with god alone in utter weakness in utter nakedness of soul he cried to god himself  there was the lesson  god took away from him all things that he might have no one to cry to but god  god took him up and cast him down  and there he sat all alone astonished and confounded like rizpah the daughter of aiah when she sat alone upon the parching rock  like rizpah he watched the dead corpses of all his hopes and plans all for which he had lived and which made life worth having withering away there by his side but it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah had done and it is told to one greater than david even to jesus christ the son of david what the poor soul does when it sits alone in its despair  or rather it need not be told him for he sees all weeps over all will comfort all  and it shall be to that poor soul as it was to poor deserted hagar in the sandy desert when the water was spent in the bottle and she cast her childthe only thing she had leftunder one of the shrubs and hurried away for she said let me not see the child die  and the angel of the lord called to her out of heaven saying the lord hath heard the voice of the lad where he is and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water  it shall be with that poor soul as it was with moses when he went up alone into the mount of god and fasted forty days and forty nights amid the earthquake and the thunderstorm and the rocks which melted before the lord  and behold when it was past he talked face to face with god as a man talketh with his friend and his countenance shone with heavenly light when he came down triumphant out of the mount of god  so shall it be with every soul of man who being in the deep cries out of that deep to god whether in bloody india or in peaceful england  for he with whom we have to do is not a tyrant but a father not a taskmaster but a giver and a redeemer  we may ask him freely as david does to consider our complaint because he will consider it well and understand it and do it justice  he is not extreme to mark what is done amiss and therefore we can abide his judgments  there is mercy with him and therefore it is worth while to fear him  he waits for us year after year with patience which cannot tire therefore it is but fair that we should wait a while for him  with him is plenteous redemption and therefore redemption enough for us and for those likewise whom we love  he will redeem us from all our sins  and what do we need more  he will make us perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect  let him then if he must make us perfect by sufferings  by sufferings christ was made perfect and what was the best path for jesus christ is surely good enough for us even though it be a rough and a thorny one  let us lie still beneath gods hand for though his hand be heavy upon us it is strong and safe beneath us too and none can pluck us out of his hand for in him we live and move and have our being and though we go down into hell with david with david we shall find god there and find with david that he will not leave our souls in hell or suffer his holy ones to see corruption  yes have faith in god  nothing in thee which he has made shall see corruption for it is a thought of gods and no thought of his can perish  nothing shall be purged out of thee but thy disease nothing shall be burnt out of thee but thy dross and that in thee shall be saved and live to all eternity of which god said at the beginning let us make man in our own image  yes  have faith in god and say to him once for all though thou slay me yet will i love thee for thou lovedst me in jesus christ before the foundation of the world    sermon ix  the love of god its own reward    deut xxx 19 20  i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord god sware unto thy fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give them  i spoke to you last sunday on this text  but there is something more in it which i had not time to speak of then  moses here tells the israelites what will happen to them if they keep gods law  they will love god  that was to be their reward  they were to have other rewards beside  beside loving god it would be well with them and their children and they would live long in the land which god had given them  but their first reward their great reward would be that they would love god  if they obeyed god they would have reason to love him  now we commonly put this differently  we say if you love god you will obey him which is quite true  but what moses says is truer still and deeper still  moses says if you obey god you will love him  again we say if you love god god will reward you which is true though not always true in this life  but moses says a truer and deeper thing  moses says that loving god is our reward that the greatest reward the greatest blessing which a man can have is this that the man should love god  now does this seem strange  it is not strange nevertheless  for there are two sorts of faith and one must always i sometimes think come before the other  the first is implicit faithblind faiththe sort of faith a child has in what its parents tell it  a child we know believes its parents blindly even though it does not understand what they tell it  it takes for granted that they are right  the second is experimental faiththe faith which comes from experience and reason when a man looks back upon his life and on gods dealings with him and then sees from experience what reason he has for trusting and loving god who has helped him onward through so many chances and changes for so many years  now some people cry out against blind implicit faith as if it was childish and unreasonable  but i cannot  i think every one learns to love his neighbour very much as moses told the jews they would learn to love god namely by trusting them somewhat blindly at first  is it not so  is it not so always with young people when they begin to be fond of each other  they trust each other they do not know why or how  before they are married they have little or no experience of each other of each others tempers and characters and yet they trust each other and say in their hearts he can never be false to me and are ready to put their honour and fortunes into each others hands to live together for better for worse till death them part  it is a blind faith in each other that and those who will may laugh at it and call it the folly and rashness of youth  i do not believe that god laughs at it  that god calls it folly and rashness  it surely comes from god  for there is something in each of them worth trusting worth loving true they may be disappointed in each other but they need not be if they are true to themselves if they will listen to the better voice within and be true to their own better feelings all will be well and they will find after marriage that they did not do a rash and a foolish thing when they gave up themselves to each other and cast in their lot together blindly to live and die  and then after that first blind faith and love in each other which they had before marriage will come as the years roll by a deeper sounder faith and love from experiencean experience of which i shall not talk here for those who have not felt it for themselves would not know what i mean and those who have felt it need no clumsy words of mine to describe it to them  now my dear friends this is one of the things by which marriage is consecrated to an excellent mystery as the prayerbook says  this is one of the things in which marriage is a pattern and picture of the spiritual union which is between christ and his church  first as i said comes blind faith  a young person setting out in life has little experience of gods love he has little to make him sure that the way of life and honour and peace is to obey gods laws  but he is told so  his bible tells him so  wiser and older people than he tell him so and god himself tells him so  god himself makes up in the young persons heart a desire after goodness  then he takes it for granted blindly  he says to himself i can but try  they tell me to taste and see whether the lord is gracious  i will taste  they tell me that the way of his commandments is the way to make life worth loving and to see good days  i will try  and so the years go by  the young person has grown middleaged old  he or she has been through many trials many disappointments perhaps more than one bitter loss  but if they have held fast by god if they have tried however clumsily to keep gods law and walk in gods way then there will have grown up in them a trust in god and a love for god deeper and broader far than any which they had in youth a love grounded on experience  they can point back to so many blessings which the lord gave them unexpectedly to so many sorrows which the lord gave them strength to bear though they seemed at first sight past bearing to so many disappointments which seemed ill luck at the time and yet which turned out good for them in the end and so comes a deep reasonable love to their heavenly father  now they have tasted that the lord is gracious  now they can say with the samaritans now we believe not because of thy saying but because we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world  and when sadness and affliction come on them as it must come they can look back and so get strength to look forward  they can say with david i will go on in the strength of the lord god  i will make mention only of his righteousness  oh my god thou hast taught me from my youth up until now hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works  now also when i am old and greyheaded oh lord forsake me not till i have showed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to those whom i leave behind me  and so by remembering what god has been to them they can face what is coming  they will not be afraid of evil tidings as david says for their heart is fixed trusting in the lord  and when old age comes and brings weakness and sickness and low spirits still they have comfort  they can say with david again i have been young and now am old but never saw i the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  oh my dear friends young people especiallythere are many things which you may long for which you cannot have  much happiness which is not within your reach  but this you can have if you will but long for it  this happiness is within your reach if you will but put out your hand and take itthe everlasting unfailing comfort of loving god and of knowing that god loves you  oh choose that now at once  choose gods ways which are pleasantness and gods paths which are peace and then in your old age whether you become rich or poor whether you are left alone or go down to your grave in peace with children and grandchildren to close your eyes you will still have the one great reward the true reward the everlasting reward which moses promised the old israelites  you will have reason to love god who has carried you safe through life and will carry you safe through death and to say with all his saints and martyrs many things i know not and many things i have lost  but this i knowi know in whom i have believed and this i cannot lose even god himself whose name is faithful and true    sermon x  the race of life    john i 26  there standeth one among you whom ye know not  this is a solemn text  it warns us and yet it comforts us  it tells us that there is a person standing among us so great that john the baptist the greatest of the prophets was not worthy to unloose his shoes latchet  some of you know who he is  some of you perhaps do not  if you know him you will be glad to be reminded of him today  if you do not know him i will tell you who he is  only bear this in mind that whether you know him or not he is standing among us  we have not driven him away and cannot drive him away  our not seeing him will not prevent his seeing us  he is always near us ready if we ask him as the collect bids us to come among us and with great might succour us  for my friends this is the meaning of the text as far as it has to do with us  the noble collect for today tells this and explains to us what we are to think of the epistle and the gospel  the epistle tells us that the lord jesus christ is at hand and that therefore we are to fret about nothing but make our requests known to him  the gospel tells us that he stands among us  the collect tells us what we are to do because he is at hand because he stands among us  and what are we to do  recollect my friends what john the baptist said according to st matthew after the words in the texthe shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire  the collect asks him to do thatthe first half of it at least  to baptize us with the holy ghost lest he should need to baptize us with fire  for the collect says we have all a race to run  we have all a journey to make through life  we have all so to get through this world that we shall inherit the world to come so to pass through the things of time as one of the collects says that we finally lose not the things eternal  god has given each of us our powers and character marked out for each of us our path in life set each of us our duty to do  but how shall we make the proper use of our powers  how shall we keep to our path in life  how shall we do our duty faithfully  in short so as st paul puts ithow shall we run our race so as not to lose but to win it  for the collect saysand we ought to have found it out for ourselves before nowour sins and wickedness hinder us sorely in running the race which is set before us  our sins and wickedness  the collect speaks of these as two different things and i believe rightly for the new testament speaks of them as two different things  sin in the new testament means strictly what we call failings defects a missing the mark a falling short as it is writtenall have sinned and come short of the glory of god that is of the likeness of a perfect man  75  thus stupidity laziness cowardice bad temper greediness after pleasurethese are strictly speaking what the new testament calls sins  wickednessiniquityseem to be harder words and to mean worse offences  they mean the evil things which a man does not out of the weakness of his mortal nature but out of his own wicked will and what the bible calls the naughtiness of his heart  so wickedness means not merely open crimes which are punishable by the law but all which comes out of a mans own wilfulness and perverseness injustice which is the first meaning of iniquity cunning falsehood covetousness pride selfconceit tyranny crueltythese seem to be what the scripture calls wickedness  of course one cannot draw the line exactly in any matters so puzzling as questions about our own souls must always be  but on the whole  i think you will find this rule not far wrong   that all which comes from the weakness of a mans soul is sin  all which comes from abusing its strength is wickedness  all which drags a man down and makes him more like a brute animal is sin all which puffs him up and makes him more like a devil is wickedness  it is as well to bear this in mind because a man may have a great horror of sin and be hard enough and too hard upon poor sinners and yet all the time he may be thoroughly and to his hearts core a wicked man  the pharisees of old were so  so they are now  take you care that you be not like to them  keep clear of sin  but keep clear of wickedness likewise  for says the collect both will hinder you in your race  perhaps cause you to break down in it and never reach the goal at all  sin will hinder you by dragging you back  wickedness will hinder you by putting you altogether out of the right road  if a man be laden with sins stupid lazy careless over fond of pleasuremuch more if he be given up to enjoying himself in bad ways about which we all know too wellthen he is like a man who starts in a race weak crippled overweighted or not caring whether he wins or loses and who therefore lags behind or grows tired or looks round and wants to stop and amuse himself instead of pushing on stoutly and bravely  and therefore st paul bids us lay aside every weight that is every bad habit which makes us lazy and careless and the sin which does so easily beset us and run with patience our appointed race looking to jesus the author of our faithwho stands by to give us faith confidence courage to go on jesus who has compassion on those who are ignorant and out of the way by no wilfulness of their own who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities who can help us can deliver us and who will do what he can and do all he can  he can and will strengthen us freshen us encourage us inspirit us by giving us his holy spirit that we may have spirit and power to run our race day by day and tide by tide  and so if he sees us weak and fainting over our work he will baptize us with the holy ghost  and yet there are times when he will baptize a sinner not only with the holy ghost but with firei am still speaking mind of a sinner not of a wicked man  and when  when he sees the man sitting down by the roadside to play with no intention of moving on  i do not sayif he sees the man sitting down to play at all  god forbid  how can a man run his lifelong racehow can he even keep up for a week a day at doing his best at the full stretch of his power without stopping to take breath  i cannot god knows  if any man canbe it so  some are stronger than others  but be sure of this that god counts it no sin in a man to stop and take breath  press forward toward the mark of your high calling st paul says  but he does not forbid a man to refresh and amuse himself harmlessly and rationally from time to time with all the pleasant things which god has put into this world they do refresh us and they do amuse us these pleasant things  and god made them and put them here  surely he put them here to refresh and amuse us  he did not surely put them here to trap us and snare us and tempt us not to run the very race which he himself has set before us  no no my friends  he made pleasant things to please us amusing things to amuse us  every good gift comes from him  but if a man thinks of nothing but amusing himself he is like a horse who stands still in the middle of a journey and begins feeding  let him do his days journey and feed afterwards and so get strength for his next days work  but if he will stand still and feed if he will forget that he has any work at all to do then we shall punish him to make him go on  and so will god do with us he will strike us then and sharply too  much more if a man gives himself up to sinful pleasure if he gives himself up to a loose and profligate life and like many a young man wastes his substance in riotous living and devours his heavenly fathers gifts with harlots then god will strike that man and all the more sharply the more worth and power there is in the man  the more god has given the man the sharper will be gods stroke if he deserves it  and why  ask yourselves  suppose that your horse had plunged into a deep ditch and was lying there in mire and thorns would you not strike him and sharply too to make him put out his whole strength and rise and by one great struggle clear himself  of course you would  and the more spirited the more powerful the animal was the sharper you would be with him because the more sure you would be that he could answer to your call if he chose  even so does god with us  if he sees us lying down forgetting utterly that we have any work or duty to do and wallowing in the mire of fleshly lusts and thorns of worldly cares then he will strike and all the more sharply the more real worth or power there is in us that he may rouse us and force us to exert ourselves and by one great struggle like the mired horse clear ourselves out of the sin which besets us and holds us down and leap as it were once and for all out of the death of sin into the life of righteousness  but much more if there be not merely sin in us but wickedness self will selfconceit and rebellion  for see my friends  if we were training a young animal how should we treat it  if it were merely weak we should strengthen and exercise it  if it were merely ignorant we should teach it  if it were lazy we should begin to punish it but gently that it might still have confidence faith in us and pleasure in its work  but if we found wickedness in itvice as we rightly call itif it became restive that is rebellious and selfwilled then we should punish it indeed  seldom perhaps but very sharply that it might see clearly that we were the stronger and that rebellion was of no use at all  and so does the lord with us my friends  if we will not go his way by kindness he will make us go by severity  first when we are christened and after that day by day if we ask himand often when we ask him nothe gives us the gentle baptism of his holy spirit freshening strengthening encouraging inspiriting but if we will not go on well for that if we will rebel and try our own way and rush out of gods road after this and that in pride and selfwill as if we were our own masters then my friendsthen will god baptize us with fire and strike with a blow which goes nigh to cut a man in two  very seldom he strikes for he is pitiful and of tender mercy  but with a rod as of fire of which it is written that it is sharper than a twoedged sword and pierces through the joints and marrow  very seldom  but very sharply that there may be no mistake about what the blow means and that the man may know however cunning or proud or selfrighteous he may be that god is the lord god is his master and will be obeyed and woe to him if he obey him not  and what can a man do then but writhe in the bitterness of his soul and get back into gods highway as fast as he can in fear and trembling lest the next blow cut him in asunder and so by the bitterness of disappointment or bereavement or sickness or poverty or worst of all of shame will the lord baptize the man with fire  but all in love my friends and all for the mans good  does god like to punish his creatures like to torment them  some think that he does and say that he finds what they call satisfaction in punishing  i think that they mistake the devil for god  no my friends what does he say himself  have i any pleasure in the death of the wicked and not rather that he should turn from his ways and live  surely he has not  if he had do you think that he would have sent us into this world at all  i do not  and i trust and hope that you will not  believe that even when he cuts us to the hearts core and baptizes us with fire he does it only out of his eternal love that he may help and deliver us all the more speedily  for gods sakefor christs sakefor your own sakekeep that in mind that christs will and therefore gods will is to help and deliver us that he stands by us and comes among us for that very purpose  consider st pauls parable in which he talks of us as men running a race and of christ as the judge who looks on to see how we run  but for what purpose does christ look on  to catch us out as we say  to mark down every fault of ours and punish wherever he has an opportunity or a reason  does he stand there spying frowning faultfinding accusing every man in his turn extreme to watch what is done amiss  if an earthly judge did that we should call him what he would bean illconditioned man  but dare we fancy anything illconditioned in god  god forbid  his conditions are altogether good and his will a good will to men and therefore say the epistle and the collect we ought not to be terrified but to rejoice at the thought that the lord is looking on  however badly we are running our race yet if we are trying to move forward at all we ought to rejoice that god in christ is looking on  and why  why  because he is looking on not to torment but to help  because he loves us better than we love ourselves  because he is more anxious for us to get safely through this world than we are ourselves  will you understand that and believe that once for all my friendsthat god is not against you but for you in the struggles of life that he wants you to get through safe wants you to succeed wants you to win and that therefore he will help you and hear your cry  and therefore when you find yourselves wrong utterly wrong do not cry to this man or that man do you help me do you set me a little more right before god comes and finds me in the wrong and punishes me  cry to god himself to christ himself ask him to lift you up ask him to set you right  do not be like st peter before his conversion and cry depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord wait a little till i have risen up and washed off my stains and made myself somewhat fit to be seenno  cry come quickly o lordat once just because i am a sinful man just because i am sore let and hindered in running my race by my own sins and wickedness because i am lazy and stupid because i am perverse and vicious therefore raise up thy power and come to me thy miserable creature thy lost child and with thy great might succour me  lift me up for i have fallen very low deliver me for i have plunged out of thy sound and safe highway into deep mire where no ground is  help myself i cannot and if thou help me not i am undone  do so  pray so  let your sins and wickedness be to you not a reason for hiding from christ who stands by but a reason the reason of all reasons for crying to christ who stands by  and then whether he deliver you by kind means or by sharp ones deliver you he will and set your feet on firm ground and order your goings that you may run with patience the race which is set before you along the road of life and the pathway of gods commandments wherein there is no death  this my friends is one of the meanings of advent  this is the meaning of the collect the epistle and the gospelthat god in christ stands by us ready to help and deliver us and that if we cry to him even out of the lowest depth he will hear our voice  and that then when he has once put us into the right road again and sees us going bravely along it to the best of the power which he has given us he will fulfil to us his eternal promise thy sinsand not only thy sins but thine iniquitiesi will remember no more    sermon xi  selfrespect and selfrighteousness    psalm vii 8  give sentence for me o lord according to my righteousness and according to the innocency that is in me  is this speech selfrighteous  if so it is a bad speech for self righteousness is a bad temper of mind there are few worse  if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us  if we confess our sins god is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar  this is plain enough and true as god is true  but there is another temper of mind which is right in its way and which is not self righteousness though it may look like it at first sight  i mean the temper of job when his friends were trying to prove to him that he must be a bad man and to make him accuse himself of all sorts of sins which he had not committed and he answered that he would utter no deceit and tell no lies about himself  till i die i will not remove mine integrity from me my righteousness i will hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me as long as i live  i have on the whole tried to be a good man and i will not make myself out a bad one  for my friends with the bible as with everything else we must hear both sides of the question lest we understand neither side  we may misuse st johns doctrine that if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves  we may deceive ourselves in the very opposite way  in the first place some people having learnt that it is right to confess their sins try to have as many sins as possible to confess i do not mean that they commit the sins but that they try to fancy they have committed them  this is very common now and has been for many hundred years especially among young women and lads who are of a weakly melancholy temper or who have suffered some great disappointment  they are fond of accusing themselves of making little faults into great ones of racking their memories to find themselves out in the wrong of taking the darkest possible view of themselves and of what is going to happen to them  they forget that solomon the wise when he says be not overmuch wicked neither be thou foolishwhy shouldst thou die before thy timesays also be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself overwise  why shouldst thou destroy thyself  for such people do destroy themselves  i have seen them kill their own bodies and die early by this folly  and i have seen them kill their own souls too and enter into strong delusions till they believe a lie and many lies from which one had hoped that the bible would have delivered any and every man  one cannot be angry with such people  one can only pity them and pity them all the more when one finds them generally the most innocent the very persons who have least to confess  one can but pity them when one sees them applying to themselves gods warnings against sins of which they never even heard the names and fancying that god speaks to them as st paul says that he did to the old heathen romans when they were steeped up to the lips in every crime  noone can do more than pity them  one can pray for them that they may learn to know god and who he is  and by knowing him may be delivered out of the hands of cunning and cruel teachers who make a market of their melancholy and hide from them the truth about god lest the truth should make them free while their teachers wish to keep them slaves  this is one misuse of st johns doctrine  there is another and a far worse misuse of it  a man may be proud of confessing his sins may become selfrighteous and conceited according to the number of the sins which he confesses  so deceitful is this same human heart of ours that so it is i have seen people quite proud of calling themselves miserable sinners  i say proud of it  for if they had really felt themselves miserable sinners they would have said less about their own feelings  if a man really feels what sin isif he feels what a miserable pitiful mean thing it is to be doing wrong when one knows better to be the slave of ones own tempers passions appetitesoh if man or woman ever knew the exceeding sinfulness of sin he would hide his own shame in the depths of his heart and tell it to god alone or at most to none on earth save the holiest the wisest the trustiest the nearest and the dearest  but when one hears a man always talking about his own sinfulness one suspectsand from experience one has only too much reason to suspectthat he is simply saying in a civil way i am a better man than you for i talk about my sinfulness and you do not  for if you answer such a man as old job or david would have done i will not confess what i have not felt  i have tried and am trying to be an upright respectable sober rightliving man  let god judge me according to the innocency that is in me  i know that i am not perfect  no man is that  but i will not cant i will not be a hypocrite and if i accuse myself of sins which i have not committed it seems to me that i shall be mocking god and deceiving myself  i will trust to god to judge me fairly to balance between the good and the evil which is in me and deal with me accordingly  if you speak in that way the other man will answer you plainly enough ah you are utterly benighted  you are building on legality and morality  you have not yet learnt the first principles of the gospel  and with these and other words will give you to understand thisthat he thinks he is going to heaven and you are going to hell  now my dear friends you are partly right and he is partly right st paul will show you where you are right and where he is right  he does so i think in a certain noble text of his in which he says i judge not mine own self for i know nothing against myself yet am i not hereby justified  but he that judgeth me is the lord  now remember that no man was less selfrighteous than st paul  no man ever saw more clearly the sinfulness of sin  no man ever put into words so strongly the struggle between good and evil which goes on in the human heart  in one place even when speaking of his former life he calls himself the chief of sinners  yet st paul when he had done his duty knew that he had done it and was not afraid to sayas no honest and upright man need be afraid to sayi know nothing against myself  for if you have done right my friend it is god who has helped you to do it and it is difficult to see how you can honour god by pretending instead that he has left you to do wrong  this then seems to be the rule  if you have done wrong be not afraid to confess it  if you have done right be not afraid to confess that either  and meanwhile keep up your selfrespect  try to do your duty  try to keep your honour bright  let no man be able to say that he is the worse for you  still more let no woman be able to say that she is the worse for you for if you treat another mans daughter as you would not let him treat yours where is your honour then or your clear conscience  what cares man what cares god for your professions of uprightness and respectability if you take good care to behave well to men who can defend themselves and take no care to behave well to a poor girl who cannot defend herself recollect that when job stood up for his own integrity and would not give up his belief that he was a righteous man he took care to justify himself in this matter as well as on others  i made a covenant with mine eyes he says why then should i think upon a maid  if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid wait at my neighbours door then he says in words too strong for me to repeat let others do to my wife as i have done to theirs  avoid this sin and all sins  let no man be able to say that you have defrauded him that you have tyrannized over him that you have neglected to do your duty by him  let no man be able to say that you have rewarded him evil for evil  if possible let him not be able to say that you have even lost your temper with him  be generous be forgiving  if you have an opportunity be like david and help him who without a cause is your enemy and then you will have a right to say like david give sentence with me o lord according to my righteousness and according to the cleanness of my hands in thy sight  truethat will not justify you  in gods sight shall no man living be justified if justification is to come by having no faults  what man is there who lives and sins not  who is there among us but knows that he is not the man he might be  who does not know that even if he seldom does what he ought not he too often leaves undone what he ought  and more than thatnone of us but does many a really wrong thing of which he never knows at least in this life  none of us but are blind more or less to our own faults and often blind god forgive usto our very worst faults  then let us remember that he who judges us is the lord  now is that a thought to be afraid of  david did not think so when he had done right  for he says in this psalm judge me o lord  and when he has done wrong he thinks so still less for then he asks god all the more earnestly not only to judge him but to correct him likewise  purge me he says and i shall be clean  cleanse thou me from my secret faults and make me to understand wisdom secretly for thou requirest truth in the inward parts  that is bravely spoken and worthy of an honest man who wishes above all things to be right whatsoever it may cost him  but how did david get courage to ask that  by knowing god and who god was  for this my friends is the key to the whole matteras it is to all matterswho is god  if you believe god to be a hard taskmaster and a cruel being extreme to mark what is done amiss an accuser like the devil instead of a forgiver and a saviour as he really isthen you will begin judging yourself wrongly and clumsily instead of asking god to judge you wisely and well  you will break both of the golden rules which st anthony the famous hermit used to give to his scholarsregret not that which is past and trust not in thine own righteousness  for you will lose time and lose heart in fretting over old sins and follies instead of confessing them once and for all to god and going boldly to his throne of grace to find mercy and grace to help you in the time of need that you may try again and do better for the future  and so it will be true of youi am sure i have seen it come true of many a poor soulwhat david found before he found out the goodness of gods free pardon while i held my tongue my bones waxed old through my daily complaining  for thy hand was heavy upon me night and day my moisture was like the drought in summer  and all that while such contradictory creatures are we all you may be breaking st anthonys other golden rule and trusting in your own righteousness  you will begin trying to cleanse yourself from little outside faults and fancying that that is all you have to do instead of asking god to cleanse you from your secret faults from the deep inward faults which he alone can see forgetting that they are the root and the outside faults only the fruit  and so you will be like a foolish sick man who is afraid of the doctor and therefore tries to physic himself  but what does he do  only tamper and peddle with the outside symptoms of his complaint instead of going to the physician that he may find out and cure the complaint itself  many a man has killed his own body in that way and many a man more i fear has killed his own soul because he was afraid of going to the great physician  but if you will believe that god is good and not evil if you will believe that the heavenly father is indeed your father if you will believe that the lord jesus christ really loves you really died to save you really wishes to deliver you from your sins and make you what you ought to be and what you can be  then you will have heart to do your duty because you will be sure that god helps you to do your duty  you will have heart to fight bravely against your bad habits instead of fretting cowardly over them because you know that god is fighting against them for you  you will not on the other hand trust in your own righteousness because you will soon learn that you have no righteousness of your own  but that all the good in you comes from god who works in you to will and to do of his good pleasure  and when you examine yourself and think over your own life and character as every man ought to do especially in advent and lent you will have heart to say o god thou knowest how far i am right and how far wrong  i leave myself in thy hand certain that thou wilt deal fairly justly lovingly with me as a father with his son i do not pretend to be better than i am  neither will i pretend to be worse than i am  truly i know nothing about it  i ignorant human being that i am can never fully know how far i am right and how far wrong  i find light and darkness fighting together in my heart and i cannot divide between them  but thou canst  thou knowest  thou hast made me thou lovest me thou hast sent thy son into the world to make me what i ought to be and therefore i believe that he will make me what i ought to be  thou willest not that i should perish but come to the knowledge of the truth  and therefore i believe that i shall not perish but come to the knowledge of the truth about thee about my own character my own duty about everything which it is needful for me to know  and therefore i will go boldly on doing my duty as well as i can though not perfectly day by day and asking thee day by day to feed my soul with its daily bread  thou feedest my soul with its daily bread  how much more then wilt thou feed my mind and my heart more precious by far than my body  yes i will trust thee for soul and for body alike and if i need correcting for my sins i am sure at least of this that the worst thing that can happen to me or any man is to do wrong and not to be corrected and the best thing is to be set right even by hard blows as often as i stray out of the way  and therefore i will take my punishment quietly and manfully and try to thank thee for it as i ought for i know that thou wilt not punish me beyond what i deserve but far below what i deserve and that thou wilt punish me only to bring me to myself and to correct me and purge me and strengthen me  for this i believeon the warrant of thine own word i believe itundeserved as the honour is that thou art my father and lovest me and dost not afflict any man willingly or grieve the children of men out of passion or out of spite and that thou willest not that i should be damned nor any man but willest have all men saved and come to the knowledge of the truth    sermon xii  true repentance    ezekiel xviii 27  when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive  we hear a great deal about repentance and how necessary it is for a man to repent of his sins for unless a man repent he cannot be forgiven  but do we all of us really know what repentance means  i sometimes fear not  i sometimes fear that though this text stands at the opening of the church service and though people hear it as often as any text in the whole bible yet they have not really learnt the lesson which god sends them by it  what then does repentance mean  being sorry for what we have done wrong say some  but is that all  i suppose there are few wicked things done upon earth for which the doers of them are not sorry sooner or later  a man does a wrong thing and his conscience pricks him and makes him uneasy and he says in his heart i wish after all i had left that alone  but the next time he is tempted to do the same thing he does it and is ashamed of himself afterwards again  but that is not repentance  i suppose that there have been few murders committed in the world after which sooner or later the murderer did not say in his heartah that that man were alive and well again  but that is not repentance  for aught i can tell the very devil is sorry for his sin discontented angry with himself ashamed of himself for being a devil  he may be so to all eternity and yet never repent  for the dark uneasy feeling which comes over every man sooner or later after doing wrong is not repentance it is remorse the most horrible and miserable of all feelings when it comes upon a man in its full strength the feeling of hating oneself being at war with oneself and with all the world and with god who made it  but that will save no mans soul alive  repentance will save any and every soul alive then and there  but remorse will not  remorse may only kill him  kill his body by making him as many a poor creature has done put an end to himself in sheer despair  and kill his soul at least by making him say in his heart well if bad i am bad i must be  i hate myself and god hates me also  all i can do is to forget my unhappiness if i can in business in pleasure in drink and drive remorse out of my head and often a man succeeds in so doing  the first time he does a wrong thing he feels sorry and ashamed after it  then he takes courage after awhile and does it again and feels less sorrow and shame and so again and again till the sin becomes easier and easier to him and his conscience grows more and more dull till at last perhaps the feeling of its being wrong quite dies withinand that is the death of his soul  but of true repentance it is written that he who repents shall save his soul alive  and how  the word for repentance in scripture means simply a change of mind to change ones mind is in scripture words to repent  now if a man changes his mind he changes his conduct also  if you set out to go to a place and change your mind then you do not go there  if as you go on you begin to have doubts about its being right to go or to be sorry that you are going and still walk on in the same road however slowly or unwillingly that is not changing your mind about going  if you do change your mind you will change your steps  you will turn back or turn off and go some other road  this may seem too simple to talk of  but if it be why do not people act upon it  if a man finds that in his way through life be is on the wrong road the road which leads to shame and sorrow and death and hell why will he confess that he is on the wrong road and say that he is very sorry as perhaps he really may be that he is going wrong and yet go on and persevere on the wrong path  at least as long as he keeps on the road which leads to ruin he has not changed his mind or repented at all  he may find the road unpleasant full of thorns and briars and pitfalls for believe me however broad the road is which leads to destruction it is only the gate of it which is easy and comfortable it soon gets darker and rougher that road of sin and the further you walk along it the uglier and more wretched a road it is  but all the misery which it gives to a man is only useless remorse unless he fairly repents and turns out of that road into the path which leads to life  now the one great business of foolish man in all times has been to save his soul as he calls it without doing right to go to heaven as he calls it without walking the road which leads to heaven  it is a folly and a dream  for no man can get to heaven unless he be heavenly and being heavenly is simply being good and neither more or less  and sin is death and no man can save his soul alive while it is dead in sin  still men have been trying to do it in all ages and countries and as soon as one plan has failed they have tried some new one and have invented some false repentance which was to serve instead of the true one  the old jews seem to have thought that the repentance which god required was burntofferings and sacrifices  that if they could only offer bullocks and goats enough on gods altar he would forgive them their sins  but david and isaiah after him and ezekiel after him found out that that was but a dream that that sort of repentance would save no mans soul that god did not require burntofferings and sacrifice for sin  but simply that a man should do right and not wrong  when ye come before me saith the lord who has required this at your hand to tread my courts  they were to bring no more vain offerings  but to put away the evil of their doings to cease to do evil to learn to do well to seek justice relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow and then and then only though their sins were as scarlet they should be white as snow  for god would take them for what they wereas good if they were good as bad if they were bad  and this agrees exactly with the text  when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive  the papists again thought that the repentance which god required was for a man to punish himself bitterly for his sins to starve and torture himself to give up all that makes life pleasant and so to atone  and good and pious men and women with a real hatred and horror of sin tried this  but they found that making themselves miserable took away their sins no more than burntofferings and sacrifices would do it  their consciences were not relieved they gained no feeling of comfort no assurance of gods love  then they said i have not punished myself enough  i have not made myself miserable enough  i will try whether more torture and misery will not wipe out my sins  and so they tried again and failed again and then tried harder still till many a noble man and woman in old times killed themselves piecemeal by slow torments in trying to atone for their sins and wash out in their own blood what was already washed out in the blood of jesus christ  but on the whole that was found to be a failure  and now the great mass of the papists have fallen back on the wretched notion that repentance merely means confessing their sins to a priest and receiving absolution from him and doing some little penance too childish to speak of here  but is there no false repentance among us english too my friends no paltry substitute for the only true repentance which god will accept which is turning round and doing right  how many there are who feeli am very wrong  i am very sinful  i am on the road to hell  i am quarrelling and losing my temper and using bad languageori am cheating my neighbour  ori am living in adultery and drunkenness  i must repent before it is too late  but what do they mean by repenting  coming as often as they can to church or chapel and reading all the religious books which they can get hold of  till they come from often reading and hearing about the gospel promises to some confused notion that their sins are washed away in christs blood or perhaps on the strength of some violent feelings believe that they are converted all on a sudden and clothed with the robe of christs righteousness and renewed by gods spirit and that now they belong to the number of believers and are among gods elect  now my dear friends i complain of no one going to hear all the good they can i complain of no one reading all the religious books they can  but i thinkand more i knowthat hearing sermons and reading tracts may be and is often turned into a complete snare of the devil by people who do not wish to give up their sins and do right but only want to be comfortable in their sins  hear sermons if you will read good books if you will  but bear in mind that you know already quite enough to lead you to repentance you need neither book nor sermon to teach you those ten commandments which hang here over the communion table  all that books and tracts and sermons can do is to teach you how to keep those commandments in spirit and in truth  but i am sure i have seen people read books and run about to sermons in order to enable them to forget those ten commandments in order to find excuses for not keeping them and to find doctrines which tell them that because christ has done all they need do nothingonly feel a little thankfulness and a little sorrow for sin and a little liking to hear about religion  and call that repentance and conversion and the renewal of the holy spirit  now my dear friends let me ask you as reasonable beings do you think that hearing me or any man preach can save your souls alive do you think that sitting over a book for an hour a day or all day long will save your souls alive  do you think that your sins are washed away in christs blood when they are there still and you are committing them  would they be here and you doing them if they were put away  do you think that your sins can be put away out of gods sight if they are not even put out of your own sight  if you are doing wrong do you think that god will treat you as if you were doing right  cannot god see in you what you see in yourselves  do you think a man can be clothed in christs righteousness at the very same time that he is clothed in his own unrighteousness  can he be good and bad at once  do you think a man can be convertedthat is turned roundwhen he is going on his old road the whole week  do you think that a man has repentedthat is changed his mindwhen he is in just the same mind as ever as to how he shall behave to his family his customers and everybody with whom he has to do  do you think that a man is renewed by gods spirit when except for a few religious phrases and a little more outside respectability he is just the old man the same character at heart he ever was  do you think that there is any use in a mans belonging to the number of believers if he does not do what he believes or any use in thinking that god has elected and chosen him when he chooses not to do what god has chosen that every man must do or die  be not deceived  god is not mocked  what a man sows that shall he reap  let no man deceive you  he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as christ is righteous and no one else  he who tries to do as christ did and he only has christs righteousness imputed to him because he is trying to do what christ did that which is lawful and right  he who does righteousness and he only has truly repented changed his mind about what he should do and turned away from his wickedness which he has committed and is now doing that which is lawful and right  he who does righteousness and he only shall save his soul alive  not by feeling this thing or believing about that thing but by doing that which is lawful and right  we must face it my dear friends  we cannot deceive god  and god will certainly not deceive himself  he sees us as we are and takes us for what we are  what is right in us he accepts for the salvation of jesus christ in whom we are created unto good works what is wrong in us he will assuredly punish and give us the exact reward of the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil every work of ours shall come into judgment unless it be repented of and put away by the only true repentancenot doing the thing any more  god i say will judge righteous judgment and take us as we are  for the sake of jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world there is full free and perfect forgiveness for every sin when we give it up  as soon as a man turns round and instead of doing wrong tries to do right he need be under no manner of fear or terror any more  he is taken back into his fathers house as freely and graciously as the prodigal son in the parable was  whatsoever dark score there was against him in gods books is wiped out there and then and he starts clear a new man with a fresh chance of life  and whosoever tells him that the score is not wiped out lies and contradicts flatly gods holy word  but as long as a man does not give up his sins the dark score does stand against him in gods books and no praying reading devoutness of any kind will wipe it out and as long as he sins he is still in his sins and his sins will be his ruin  whosoever tells him that they are wiped out he too lies and contradicts flatly gods holy word  for god is just and true and therefore god takes us for what we are and will do so to all eternity and you will find it so my dearest friends  in spite of all doctrines which men have invented and then pretended to find in the bible to drug mens consciences and confuse gods clear light in their hearts you will find now and for ever that if you do right you will be happy even in the midst of sorrow if you do wrong you will be miserable even in the midst of pleasure  oh believe this my dear friends and do not rashly count on some sudden magical change happening to you as soon as you die to make you fit for heaven  there is not one word in the bible which gives us reason to suppose that we shall not be in the next world the same persons which we have made ourselves in this world  if we are unjust here we shall for aught we know or can know try to be unjust there if we be filthy here we shall be so there if we be proud here we shall be so there if we be selfish here we shall be so there  what we sow here we shall reap there  and it is good for us to know this and face this  anything is good for us however unpleasant it may be which drives us from the only real misery which is sin and selfishness to the only true happiness which is the everlasting life of christ a pure loving just generous useful life of goodness which is the righteousness of christ and the glory of christ and which will be our righteousness and our glory also for ever  but only if we live it only if we be useful as christ was generous as christ was just as christ was gentle as christ was pure as christ was loving as christ was and so put on christ not in name and in word but in spirit and in truth that having worn christs likeness in this world we may share his victory over all evil in the life to come    sermon xiii  the letter and the spirit    twelfth sunday after trinity  ii cor iii 6  god who hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit  for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life  when we look at the collect epistle and gospel for today one after the other we do not see perhaps what they have to do with each other  but they have to do with each other  they agree with each other  they explain each other  they all three tell us what god is like and what we are to believe about god and why we are to have faith in god  the collect tells of a god who is more ready to hear than we are to pray and is wont to givethat is usually and as a matter of course every day and all day long gives usmore than either we desire or deserve of a god who gives and forgives abundant in mercy  it bids us when we pray to god remember that we are praying to a perfectly bountiful perfectly generous god  some people worship quite a different god to that  they fancy that god is hard that he sits judging each man by the letter of the law watching and marking down every little fault which they commit extreme to mark what is done amiss and that in the very face of scripture which says that god is not extreme to mark what is done amiss for if he were who could abide it  their notion of god is that he is very like themselves proud grudging hard to be entreated expecting everything from men but not willing to give without a great deal of continued asking and begging and outward reverence and scrupulous fear lest he should be offended unexpectedly at the least mistake and they fancy like the heathen that they shall be heard for their much speaking  they forget altogether that god is their father and knows what they need before they ask and their ignorance in asking and has as any father fit to be called a father would have compassion on their infirmities  there is a great deal of this lipservice and superstitious devoutness creeping in nowadays a spirit of bondage unto fear st paul warns us against it and calls it willworship and voluntary humility  and i tell you of it that it is not christian at all but heathen and i say to you as st paul bids me say god who made the world and all therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed anything seeing that he giveth to all life and breath and all things  for in him we live and move and have our being and are the offspringthe childrenof god  away then with this miserable spirit of bondage and fear which insults that good god which it pretends to honour and in spirit and in truth not with slavish crouchings and cringings copied from the old heathen let us worship the father  but this leads us to the epistle  st paul tells us how it is that god is wont to give us more than we either desire or deserve  because he is the lord and giver of life in whom all created things live and move and have their being therefore in the epistle he tells us of a spirit which gives life  but some may ask what life  the gospel answers that and says all life  it tells us that our lord christ cared not merely for the life of mens souls but for the life of their bodies  that wherever he went he brought with him not merely health for mens souls by his teaching but health for their bodies by his miracles  that when he saw a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech he sighed over him in compassion and did not think it beneath him to cure that poor man of his infirmity though it was no such very great one  for he wished to show men that his heavenly father cared for them altogether body as well as soul that all health and strength whatsoever came from him  when we hear therefore of the spirit giving life we are not to fancy that means only some high devout spiritual life or that gods spirit has to do only with a few elect saints  that may be a very pleasant fancy for those who believe themselves to be the elect saints but the message of the gospel is far wider and deeper than that or any other of vain mans narrow notions  it tells us that lifeall life which we can see all health strength beauty order use power of doing good work in gods earthly world come from the spirit of god just as much as the spiritual life which we cannot seegoodness amiableness purity justice virtue power of doing work in gods heavenly world  this latter is the higher life  and the former the lower though good and necessary in its place  but the lower as well as the higher is life and comes from the spirit of god who gives life and breath to all things  and now perhaps we may see what st paul meant by his being a minister not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life  do you not see yet my friends  then i will tell you  if i were to get up in this pulpit and preach the terrors of the law and the wrath of god and hell fire  if i tried to bind heavy burdens on you and grievous to be borne cryingyou must do this you must feel that you must believe the otherwhile i having fewer temptations and more education than you touched not those burdens with one of my fingers if i tried to make out as many sins as i could against you crying continually this was wrong and that was wrong making you believe that god is always on the watch to catch you tripping and telling you that the least of your sins deserved endless tormentthings which neither i nor any man can find in the bible nor in common justice nor common humanity nor elsewhere save in the lying mouth of the great devil himselfor if i put into your hands books of selfexamination as they are called full of long lists of sins frightening poor innocents and defiling their thoughts and consciences and making the heart of the righteous sad whom god has not made sadif i in plain english had my mouth full of cursing and bitterness threatening and faultfinding and distrustful and disrespectful and insolent language about you my parishioners  why then i might fancy myself a christian priest and a minister of the gospel and a very able and eloquent and earnest one and might perhaps gain for myself the credit of being a searching preacher by speaking evil of people who are most of them as good and better than i and by taking a low mean false view of that human nature which god made in his own image and christ justified in his own mans flesh and soul and spirit but instead of being an able minister of the new covenant or of the spirit of god i should be no such man but the very opposite  no  i should be one of those of whom the psalmist says their mouths are full of cursing and bitternessand also their feet are swift to shed blood  to shed blood to kill with the letter which killeth and your blood if i did succeed in killing your souls would be upon my foolish head  for such preaching as that does kill  it kills three things  1  it kills the gospel  it turns the good news of god into the very worst news possible and the ministration of righteousness into the ministration of condemnation  2  it kills the souls of the congregationor would kill them if gods wisdom and love were not stronger than his ministers folly and hardness  for it kills in them selfrespect and hope and makes them say to themselves god has made me bad and bad i must be  let me eat and drink for tomorrow i die  god requires all this of me and i cannot do it  i shall not try to do it  i shall take my chance of being saved at last i know not how  it frightens people away from church from religion from the very thought of god  it sets people on spying out their neighbours faults on judging and condemning on fancying themselves righteous and despising others and so kills in them faith hope and charity which are the very life of their spirits  3  and by a just judgment it kills the soul of the preacher also it makes him forget who he is what god has set him to do and at last even who god is  it makes him fancy that he is doing gods work while he is simply doing the work of the devil the slanderer and accuser of the brethren judging and condemning his congregation when god has said judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned  it makes him at last like the false god whom he has been preaching for every man at last copies the god in whom he believes dark and deceiving proud and crueland may the lord have mercy upon his soul  but i will tell you how i can be an able minister of the new testament and of the spirit who gives life  if i say to youand i do say it now and will say it as long as i am heretrust god because god is good obey god because god is good  i preach to you the good god of the collect even your heavenly father who needs not be won over or appeased by anything which you can do for he loves you already for the sake of his dear son whose members you are  he will not hear you the more for your much speaking for he knows your necessities before you ask and your ignorance in asking  he will not judge you according to the letter of moses law or any other law whatsoever but according to the spirit of your longings and struggles after what is right  he will not be extreme to mark what you do amiss but will help you to mend it if you desire to mend setting you straight when you go wrong and helping you up when you fall if only your spirit is struggling after what is right  this allgood heavenly father i preach to you and i say to you trust him  i preach to you a spirit who is the lord and giver of life who hates death and therefore wills not that you should die who has given you all the life you have all health and strength of body all wit and power of mind all right pure loving noble feelings of heart and spirit and who is both able and willing to keep them alive and healthy in you for ever  this allgood spirit of life i preach to you and i say to you trust him  i preach to you a son of god who is the likeness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person in order that by seeing him and how good he is you may see your heavenly father and how good he is likewise a son of god who is your saviour and your judge who judges you that he may save you and saves you by judging you who has all power given to him in heaven and earth and declares that almighty power most chiefly by showing mercy and pity who when he was upon earth made the deaf to hear the lame to walk the blind to see who ate and drank with publicans and sinners and was the friend of all mankind a son of god who has declared everlasting war against disease ignorance sin death and all which makes men miserable those are his enemies and he reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and there is nothing left in gods universe but order and usefulness health and beauty knowledge and virtue in the day when god shall be all in all  this allgood son of god i preach to you and i say to you trust him and obey him  obey him not lest he should become angry and harm you like the false gods of the heathen but because his commandments are life because he has made them for your good  oh when will people understand thatthat god has not made laws out of any arbitrariness but for our goodthat his commandments are life  david of old knew as much as that  why do not we know more instead of knowing most of us much less  it is simple enough if you will but look at it with simple minds  god has made us and if he had not loved us he would not have made us at all  god has sent us into the world and if he had not loved us he would not have sent us into the world at all  in him we live and move and have our being and are the offspring and children of god  and therefore god alone knows what is good for us what is the good life the wholesome the safe the right the everlasting life for us  and he sends his son to tell usthis is the right life a life like christs a life according to gods spirit and if you do not live that life you will die not only body but soul also because you are not living the life which god meant for you when he made you  just as if you eat the wrong food you will kill your bodies so if you think the wrong thoughts and feel the wrong feelings and therefore do the wrong things you will kill your own souls  god will not kill you you will kill yourselves  god grudges you nothing  god does not wish to hurt you wish to punish you  he wishes you to live and be happy to live for ever and be happy for ever  but as your body cannot live unless it be healthy so your soul cannot live unless it be healthy  and it cannot be healthy unless it live the right life and it cannot live the right life without the right spirit  and the only right spirit is the spirit of god himself the spirit of your father in heaven who will make you as children should be like your father  but that spirit is not far from any of you  in him you live and move and have your being already  were he to leave you for a moment you would die and be turned again to your dust  from him comes all the good of body and soul which you have already  trust him for more  ask him for more  go boldly to the throne of his grace remembering that it is a throne of grace of kindness tenderness patience bountiful love and wealth without end  do not think that he is hard of hearing or hard of giving  how can he be  for he is the spirit of the allgenerous father and of the allgenerous son and has given and gives now and delights to give and delights to be asked  he is the charity of god the boundless love by which all things consist and like all love becomes more rich by spending and glorifies himself by giving himself away and has sworn by himselfthat is by his own eternal and necessary character which he cannot alter or unmakethis is the new covenant which i will make with my people  i will write my laws in their hearts and in their minds will i write them and i will dwell with them and be their god  oh my friends take these words to yourselves and trust in that good father in heaven whose love sent you into this world and gave you the priceless blessing of life whose love sent his son to show you the pattern of life and to redeem you freely from all your sins whose love sends his spirit to give you the power of leading the everlasting life and will raise you up again body and soul to that same everlasting life after death  trust him for he is your father whatever else he is he is that  he has bid you call him that and he will hear you  if you forget that he is your father you forget him and worship a false god of your own invention  and whenever you doubt whenever the devil or ignorant preachers or superstitious books make you afraid and tempt you to fancy that god hates you and watches to catch you tripping take refuge in that blessed name and say satan i defy thee for the almighty god of heaven is my father    sermon xiv  heroes and heroines whitsunday    psalm xxxii 8  i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with mine eye  this is gods promise which he fulfilled at sundry times and in different manners to all the men of the old world who trusted in him he informed them that is he put them into right form right shape right character and made them the men which they were meant to be he taught them in the way in which they ought to go  he guided them where they could not guide themselves  but god fulfilled this promise utterly and completely on the first whitsuntide when the holy spirit came down on the apostles  that was an extraordinary and special gift because the apostles had to do an extraordinary and special work  they had to preach the gospel to all nations and therefore they wanted tongues with which to speak to all nations at least to those of their countrymen who came from foreign parts and spoke foreign tongues that they might carry home the good news of christ into all lands  and they wanted tongues of fire too to set their own hearts on fire with divine zeal and earnestness and to set on fire the hearts of those who heard them  but that was an extraordinary gift  there was never anything like it before nor has been as far as we know since because it has not been needed  it is enough for us to know that the apostles had what they needed god called and sent them to do a great work  and therefore being just and merciful he gave them the power which was wanted for that great work  but if that is a special case if there has been nothing like it since what has whitsuntide to do with us  we need no tongues of fire and we shall have none on this whitsunday or any whitsunday has whitsunday then no blessing for us  do we get nothing by it god forbid my friends  we get what the apostles got and neither more nor less though not in the same shape as they did  god called them to do a work  god calls us each of us to do some work  god gave them the holy spirit to make them able to do their work god gives us the holy spirit to make us able to do our work whatsoever that may be  as their day so their strength was  as our day is so our strength shall be  for instance   how often one sees a persona woman sayeasy and comfortable enjoying life and taking little trouble about anything because she has no need  and when one looks at such a woman one is apt to say hastily in ones heart ah she does not know what sorrow isand well for her she does not for she would make but a poor fight if trouble came on her she would make but a poor nurse if she had to sit months by a sick bed  she would become downhearted and peevish and useless  there is no strength in her to stand in the evil day  and perhaps that woman would say so of herself  she might be painfully afraid of the thought of affliction she might shrink from the notion of having to nurse any one from having to give up her own pleasure and ease for the sake of others and she would say of herself as you say of her what would become of me if sorrow came i have no strength to stand in the evil day  yes my friends and you say true and she says true  and yet not true either  she has no strength to stand  but she will stand nevertheless for god is able to make her stand  as her day so her strength shall be  a day of suffering anxiety weariness all but despair may come to her  but in that day she shall be baptized with the holy spirit and with fire and then you shall be astonished and she shall be astonished at what she can do and what she can endure because gods spirit will give her a right judgment in all things and enable her even in the midst of her sorrow to rejoice in his holy comfort  and people will call herthose at least who know her a heroine  and they speak truly and well and give her the right and true name  why i will tell you presently  or how often it happens to a man to be thrown into circumstances which he never expected  an officer perhaps in war time in a foreign landin india now  he has a work to do  a heavy dangerous difficult almost hopeless work  he does not like it  he is afraid of it  he wishes himself anywhere but where he is  he has little or no hope of succeeding and if he fails he fears that he will be blamed misunderstood slandered  but he feels he must go through with it  he cannot turn back he cannot escape  as the saying is the bull is brought to the stake and he must bide the baiting  at first perhaps he tries to buoy himself up  he begins his work in a little pride and selfconceit and notion of his own courage and cunning  he tries to fancy himself strong enough for anything  he feeds himself up with the thought of what people will say of him the hope of gaining honour and praise  and that is not altogether a wrong feelinggod forbid  but the further the man gets into his work the more difficult it grows and the more hopeless he grows  he finds himself weak when he expected to be strong puzzled when he thought himself cunning he is not sure whether he is doing right  he is afraid of responsibility  it is a heavy burden on him too heavy to bear  his own honour and good name may depend upon a single word which he speaks  the comfort the fortune the lives of human beings may depend on his making up his mind at an hours notice to do exactly the right thing at the right time  people round him may be mistaking him slandering him plotting against him rebelling against him even while he is trying to do them all the good he can  little comfort does he get then from the thought of what people at home may say of him  he is set in the snare and he cannot find his way out he is at his own wits end and from whence shall he get fresh wits who will give him a right judgment in all things  who will give him a holy comfort in which he can rejoicea comfort which will make him cheerful because he knows it is a right comfort and that he is doing right  his heart is sinking within him getting chill and cold with despair  who will put fresh fire and spirit into it  god will  when he has learnt how weak he is in himself how stupid he is in himselfay bitter as it is to a brave man to have to confess it how cowardly he is in himselfthen when he has learnt the golden lesson god will baptize him with the holy ghost and with fire  a time will come to that man when finding no help in himself no help in man he will go for help to god  old words which he learnt at his mothers knee come back to himold words that he almost forgot perhaps in the strength and gaiety of his youth and prosperity  and he prays  he prays clumsily enough perhaps  he is not accustomed to praying and he hardly knows what to ask for or how to ask for it  be it so  in that he is not so very much worse off than others  what did st paul say even of himself  we know not how to ask for anything as we ought  but the spirit maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be utteredtoo deep for words  yes in every honest heart there are longings too deep for words  a man knows he wants something  but knows not what he wants  he cannot find the right words to say to god  let him take comfort  what he does not know the holy spirit of whitsuntidethe spirit of jesus christdoes know  christ knows what we want and offers our clumsy prayers up to our heavenly father not in the shape in which we put them but as they ought to be as we should like them to be and our father hears them  yes  our father hears the man who cries to him however clumsily for light and strength to do his duty  so it is so it has been always so it will be to the end  and then as the mans day so his strength will be  he may be utterly puzzled utterly downhearted utterly hopeless  but the day comes to him in which he is baptized with the holy ghost and with fire  he begins to have a right judgment to see clearly what he ought to do and how to do it  he grows more shrewd more prompt more steady than he ever has been before  and there comes a fire into his heart such as there never was before a spirit and a determination which nothing can daunt or break which makes him bold cheerful earnest in the face of the anxiety and danger which would have at any other time broken his heart  the man is lifted up above himself and carried on through his work he hardly knows how till he succeeds nobly or if he fails fails nobly and be the end as it may he gets the work done which god has given him to do  and then when he looks back he is astonished at himself  he wonders how he could dare so much wonders how he could endure so much wonders how the right thought came into his head at the right moment he hardly knows himself again  it seems to him when he thinks over it all like a grand and awful dream  and the world is astonished at him likewise  they cry who would have thought there was so much in this man who would have expected such things of him  and they call him a heroand so he is  yes the world is right more right than it thinks in both sayings who would have expected there was so much in the man  for there was not so much in him till god put it there  and again they are right too more right than they think in calling that man a hero or that woman a heroine  for what is the old meaning the true meaning of a hero or a heroine  it meantand ought to meanone who is a son or a daughter of god and whom god informs and strengthens and sends out to do noble work teaching them the way wherein they should go  that was the right meaning of a hero and of a heroine even among the old heathens  let it mean the same among us christians when we talk of a hero and let us give god the glory and saythere is a man who has entered even if it be but for one days danger and trial into the blessings of whitsuntide and the power of gods spirit a man whom god has informed and taught in the way wherein he should go  may that same god give him grace to abide herein all the days of his life  yes my friends may god give us all grace to under stand whitsuntide and feed on the blessings of whitsuntide not merely once in a way in some great sorrow great danger great struggle great striving point of our lives but every day and all day long and to rejoice in the power of his spirit till it becomes to us would that it could today become to uslike the air we breathe till having got our lifes work done if not done perfectly yet still done we may go hence to receive the due reward of our deeds    sermon xv  the measure of the cross    ephesians iii 18 19  that ye may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge  these words are very deep and difficult to understand for st paul does not tell us exactly of what he is speaking  he does not say what it is the breadth and length and depth and height of which we are to comprehend and take in  only he tells us afterwards what will come of our taking it in we shall know the love of christ  and therefore many great fathers and divines whose names there is no need for me to tell you but whose opinions we must always respect have said that what st paul is speaking of is the cross of christ  of course they do not mean the wood of which the actual cross was made  they mean the thing of which the cross was a sign and token  now of what is the cross a token  of the love of christ which is the love of god  but of what kind of love  not the love which is satisfied with sitting still and enjoying itself as long as nothing puts it out and turns its love to anger what we call mere good nature and good temper not that not that my friends  but love which will dare and do and yearn and mourn love which cannot rest love which sacrifices itself love which will suffer love which will die for what it lovessuch love as a father has who perishes himself to save his drowning child  now the cross of christ is a token to us that gods love to us is like that  a love which will dare anything and suffer anything for the sake of saving sinful man  and therefore it is that from the earliest times the cross has been the special sign of christians  we keep it up still when we make the sign of the cross on childrens foreheads in baptism  but we have given up using the sign of the cross commonly because it was perverted in old times into a superstitious charm  men worshipped the cross like an idol or bits of wood which they fancied were pieces of the actual cross while they were forgetting what the cross meant  so the use of the cross fell into disrepute and was put down in england  but that is no reason why we should forget what the cross meant and means now and will mean for ever  indeed the better christians the better men we are the more will christs cross fill us with thoughts which nothing else can give us thoughts which we are glad enough often to forget and put away so bitterly do they remind us of our own laziness selfishness and love of pleasure  but still the cross is our sign  it is gods everlasting token to us that he has told us christians something about himself which none of the wisest among the heathen knew which infidels now do not know which nothing but the cross can teach to men  there were men among the old heathens who believed in one god and some of them saw that he must be on the whole a good and a just god  but they could not help thinking of god with very rare exceptions as a respecter of persons a god who had favourites and at least that he was a god who loved his friends and hated his enemies  so the mussulmans believe now  so do the jews indeed so they did all along though they ought to have known better for their prophets in the old testament told them a very different tale about gods love  but that was all they could believein a god who was not unjust or wicked but was at least hard proud unbending  while the notion that god could love his enemies and bless those who used him despitefully and persecuted himmuch less die for his enemiesthat would have seemed to them impossible and absurd  they stumbled at the stumblingblock of the cross  god they thought would do to men as they did to him  if they loved him he would love them  if they neglected him he would hate and destroy them  but when the apostles preached the gospel the good news of christ crucified they preached a very different tale a tale quite new utterly different from any that mankind had ever heard before  st paul calls it a mysterya secretwhich had been hidden from the foundation of the world till then and was then revealed by gods spirit namely this boundless love of god shown by christs dying on the cross  and he says his great hope his great business the thing on which his heart was set and which god had sent him into the world to do was thisto make people know the love of christ to look at christs cross and take in its breadth and length and depth and height it passes knowledge he says  we shall never know the whole of it never know all that gods love has done and will do  but the more we know of it the more blessed and hopeful the more strong and earnest the more good and righteous we shall become  and what is the breadth of christs cross  my friends it is as broad as the whole world for he died for the whole world as it is written he is a propitiation not for our sins only but for the sins of the whole world and again god willeth that none should perish and again as by the offence judgment came on all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the gift came upon all men to justification of life  and that is the breadth of christs cross  and what is the length of christs cross  the length thereof says an old father signifies the time during which its virtue will last  how long then is the cross of christ  long enough to last through all time  as long as there is a sinner to be saved as long as there is ignorance sorrow pain death or anything else which is contrary to god and hurtful to man in the universe of god so long will christs cross last  for it is written he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet and god is all in all  and that is the length of the cross of christ  and how high is christs cross  as high as the highest heaven and the throne of god and the bosom of the fatherthat bosom out of which for ever proceed all created things  ay as high as the highest heaven forif you will receive itwhen christ hung upon the cross heaven came down on earth and earth ascended into heaven christ never showed forth his fathers glory so perfectly as when hanging upon the cross he cried in his deathagony father forgive them for they know not what they do  those words showed the true height of the cross and caused st john to know that his vision was true and no dream when he saw afterwards in the midst of the throne of god a lamb as it had been slain  and that is the height of the cross of christ  and how deep is the cross of christ  this is a great mystery and one which people in these days are afraid to look at and darken it of their own will because they will neither believe their bibles nor the voice of their own hearts  but if the cross of christ be as high as heaven then it seems to me it must also be as deep as hell deep enough to reach the deepest sinner in the deepest pit to which he may fall  we know that christ descended into hell  we know that he preached to the spirits in prison  we know that it is written as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive  we know that when the wicked man turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right he will save his soul alive  we know that in the very same chapter god tells us that his ways are not unequalthat he has not one law for one man and another for another or one law for one year and another for another  it is possible therefore that he has not one law for this life and another for the life to come  let us hope then that davids words may be true after all when speaking by the spirit of god he says not only if i ascend up to heaven thou art there but if i go down to hell thou art there also and let us hope that that is the depth of the cross of christ  at all events my friends i believe that we shall find st pauls words true when he says that christs love passes knowledge and therefore that we shall find this alsothat however broad we may think christs cross it is broader still  however long it is longer still  however high it is higher still  however deep it is deeper still  yes we shall find that st paul spoke solemn truth when he said that christ had ascended on high that he might fill all things that christ filled all in all and that he must reign till the day when he shall give up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all  and now do you take all this about the breadth and length of christs cross to be only ingenious fancies and a pretty play of words  ah my friends the day will come when you will find that the measure of christs cross is the most important question upon earth  in the hour of death and in the day of judgment then the one thing which you will care to think of if you can think at all then as too many poor souls cannot and therefore had best think of it now before their wits fail themthe one thing which you will care to think of i say will benot how clever you have been how successful you have been how much admired you have been how much money you have made of course not you answer i shall be thinking of the state of my soul whether i am fit to die whether i have faith enough to meet god whether i have good works enough to meet god  will you my friend  then you will soon grow tired of thinking of that likewise at least i hope and trust that you will  for however much faith you may have had you will find that you have not had enough  however so many good works you may have done you will find that you have not done enough  the better man you are the more you will be dissatisfied with yourself the more you will be ashamed of yourself till with all saints romanist or protestant or other who have been worthy of the name of saints you will be drivenif you are in earnest about your own soulto give up thinking of yourself and to think only of the cross of christ and of the love of christ which shines thereon and askis it great enough to cover my sins to save one as utterly unworthy to be saved as i  and so after all you will be forced to throw yourselfwhere you ought to have thrown yourself at the outsetat the foot of christs cross and say in spirit and in truth    nothing in my hand i bring simply to the cross i cling    in plain words i throw myself with all my sins upon that absolute and boundless love of god which made all things and me among them and hateth nothing that he hath made who redeemed all mankind and me among them and hath said by the mouth of his onlybegotten son him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out    sermon xvi  the pure in heart    titus i 15  unto the pure all things are pure  but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure  but even their mind and conscience is defiled  this seems at first a strange and startling saying  but it is a true one and the more we think over it the more we shall find it true  all things are pure in themselves good in themselves because god made them  is it not written god saw all that he had made and behold it was very good  therefore st paul says that all things are ours and that christ gives us all things richly to enjoy  all we need is to use things in the right way that is in the way in which god intended them to be used  for god is a god of truth a true a faithful andif i may so speakan honest and honourable and fair god  not a deceiving or unfair god who lays snares for his creatures or leads them into temptation  that would be a bad god a cruel god very unlike the father of our lord jesus christ  he has put us into a good world and not a wilderness as some people call it  if any part of this world be a wilderness it is because men have made it so or left it so by their own wilfulness ignorance cowardice laziness violence  no  god i say has put us into a good world and given us pure and harmless appetites feelings relations  therefore all the relations of life are holy  to be a husband a father a brother a son is pure and good  to have property and to use it to enjoy ourselves in this life as far as we can without hurting ourselves or our neighbours all this is pure and good and holy god does not grudge or upbraid  he does not frown upon innocent pleasure  for god is light and in him is no darkness at all therefore he rejoices in seeing his creatures healthy and happy therefore as i believe christ smiles out of heaven upon the little children at their play and the laugh of a babe is heavenly music in his ears  all things are pure which god has given to man  and therefore if a man be pure in heart all which god has given him will not only do him no harm but do him good  all the comforts and blessings of this life will help to make him a better man  they will teach him about his own character about human nature and the people with whom he has to do ayabout god himself as it is written blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god  all the blessings and comforts of this life my friends as well as the anxieties which must come to those who have a family or property even if he do not meet with losses and afflictions ought to help to improve a mans temper to call out in him right feelings to teach him more and more of the likeness of god  if he be a married man marriage ought to teach him not to live for himself only but to sacrifice his own fancies his own ease his own will for the sake of the woman whom god has given him as christ sacrificed himself and his own life for mankind  and so by the feelings of a husband he may enter into the mystery of the love of christ and of the cross of christ and so if only he be pure in heart he will see god  if he have parents he may learn by being a son how blessed it is to obey how useful to a mans character to submit  ay he will find out more still  he will find out that not by being selfwilled and independent does the finest and noblest parts of his character come out but by copying his father in everything that going where his father sends him being jealous of his fathers honour doing not his own will but his fathers that all this i say is its own reward for instead of lowering a man it raises him and calls out in him all that is purest tenderest soberest bravest  i tell you this dayjust as far as you are good sons to your parents so far will you be able to understand the mystery of the coequal and coeternal son of god who though he were in the form of god did not snatch greedily at being on the same footing with his father but emptied himself and took on him the form of a slave that he might do his fathers will and reveal his fathers glory  and so if you be only pure in heart you will see god  if again a man have childrenhow they ought to teach him to train himteach him to restrain his own temper lest he provoke them to anger to be calm and moderate with them lest he frighten them into lying to avoid bad language gluttony drunkenness and every coarse sin lest he tempt them to follow his example  i tell you friends that you will find if you choose all the noblest most generous most godlike parts of your character called out to your children and by having the feelings of a father to your children learn what feelings our father in heaven has toward us his human offspring and so if only you be pure in heart you will see god  if again a man has money money can teach him as it teaches hundreds of purehearted men that charity and generosity are not only a duty but an honour and a joy that mercy is twice blest it blesses him that gives and him that takes that giving is the highest pleasure upon earth because it is gods own pleasure because the blessedness of god and the glory of god is this that he giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not  and so in his wealth if only he be pure in heart a man will see god  if again a man has health and strength and high spirits they too will teach him if his heart be pure  he will learn from them to look up to god as the lord and giver of life health strength of the power to work and the power to delight in working  because god himself is ever full of life ever busy ever rejoicing to put forth his almighty power for the good of the whole universe as it is written my father worketh hitherto and i work  and soin every relation of lifeif only a mans heart be pure he will see god  how then can we get the pure heart which will make all things pure to us  by asking for the spirit of god the holy spirit the pure spirit in whom is no selfishness  for if our hearts be selfish they cannot be pure  the pure in heart is the same as the man whose eye is single and that is the man who is not caring for himself thinking of himself  if a man be thinking of himself he will never enjoy life  the pure blessings which god has given him will be no blessings to him as it is written he that saveth his life shall lose it  do you not know that that is true  do not the miseries of life i do not mean the afflictions like loss of friends or kin but the miseries of life which make a man dark and fretful and prevent his enjoying gods giftsdo they not come nineteentwentieths of them from thinking about oneself from lusting and longing after this and that from spite vanity bad temper wounded pride disappointed covetousness  i cannot get this or that that money that place this or that fine thing or the other  and how can i be contented there is a man whose heart is not pure  that man has used me ill and i cannot help thinking of it brooding over it  i cannot forgive him  how can i be expected to forgive him  there is a man whose heart is not pure and more there is a man who is making himself miserable  see again how a man may make marriage a curse to him instead of a blessing without being unfaithful to his wife which we all know to be simply abominable and unmanly and far below anything of which i am talking now  and how  simply by bad temper vanity greediness and selfish love of his own dignity his own pleasure his own this that and the other  so too he may make his children a torment to him instead of letting them be gods lessonbook to him in which he may see the likeness of the angels in heaven  he may make his wealth a continual anxiety to him  ay he may make it by ambition covetousness and wild speculation the cause of his shame and ruin if only his heart be not pure  ay there is not a blessing on earth which a man may not turn into a curse  there is not a good gift of god out of which a man may not get harm if only his heart be not pure as it is written to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure  but even their mind and conscience are defiled  but defiled with what  fouled with what  there is the question many answers have been invented by people who did not believe in that faithful and true god of whom i told you just now people who fancied that this world was a bad world and that god laid snares for his creatures and tempted his creatures  but the true answer is only to be got like most true answers by observing by using our eyes and ears and seeing what really makes people turn blessings into curses and suck poison out of every flower  and that is simply self  if you want to spoil all that god gives you if you want to be miserable yourself and a maker of misery to others the way is easy enough  only be selfish and it is done at once  be defiled and unbelieving  defile and foul gods good gifts by self and by loving yourself more than what is right  do not believe that the good god knows your needs before you ask and will give you whatsoever is good for you  think about yourself about what you want what you like what respect people ought to pay you what people think of you  and then to you nothing will be pure  you will spoil everything you touch you will make sin and misery for yourself out of everything which god sends you you will be as wretched as you choose on earth or in heaven either  in heaven either i say  for that proud greedy selfish self seeking spirit would turn heaven into hell  it did turn heaven into hell for the great devil himself  it was by pride by seeking his own gloryso at least wise men saythat he fell from heaven to hell  he was not content to give up his own will and do gods will like the other angels  he was not content to serve god and rejoice in gods glory  he would be a master himself and set up for himself and rejoice in his own glory and so when he wanted to make a private heaven of his own he found that he had made a hell  when he wanted to be a little god for himself he lost the life of the true god to lose which is eternal death  and why  because his heart was not pure clean honest simple unselfish  therefore he saw god no more and learnt to hate him whose name is love  may god keep our hearts pure from that selfishness which is the root of all sin from selfishness out of which alone spring adultery foul living drunkenness evil speaking lying slandering injustice oppression cruelty and all which makes man worse than the beasts  may god give us those pure hearts of which it is written that the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness meekness temperance  against such st paul says there is no law  and why  because no law is needed for as a wise father sayslove and do what thou wilt for then thou wilt be sure to will what is right and as st paul says if your heart be pure all things will be pure to you    sermon xvii  music christmas day    luke ii 13 14  and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men  you have been just singing christmas hymns and my text speaks of the first christmas hymn  now what the words of that hymn meant what peace on earth and goodwill towards man meant i have often told you  today i want you for once to think of thisthat it was a hymn that these angels were singing even as human beings sing  musicthere is something very wonderful in music  words are wonderful enough  but music is even more wonderful  it speaks not to our thoughts as words do  it speaks straight to our hearts and spirits to the very core and root of our souls  music soothes us stirs us up it puts noble feelings into us it melts us to tears we know not how it is a language by itself just as perfect in its way as speech as words just as divine just as blessed  music has been called the speech of angels i will go further and call it the speech of god himselfand i will with gods help show you a little what i mean this christmas day  music i say without words is wonderful and blessed one of gods best gifts to men  but in singing you have both the wonders together music and words  singing speaks at once to the head and to the heart to our understanding and to our feelings and therefore perhaps the most beautiful way in which the reasonable soul of man can show itself except of course doing right which always is and always will be the most beautiful thing is singing  now why do we all enjoy music  because it sounds sweet  but why does it sound sweet  that is a mystery known only to god  two things i may make you understandtwo things which help to make musicmelody and harmony  now as most of you know there is melody in music when the different sounds of the same tune follow each other so as to give us pleasure there is harmony in music when different sounds instead of following each other come at the same time so as to give us pleasure  but why do they please us and what is more why do they please angels and more still why do they please god  why is there music in heaven  consider st johns visions in the revelations  why did st john hear therein harpers with their harps and the mystic beasts and the elders singing a new song to god and to the lamb and the voices of many angels round about them whose number was ten thousand times ten thousand  in this is a great mystery  i will try to explain what little of it i seem to see  firstthere is music in heaven because in music there is no self will  music goes on certain laws and rules  man did not make those laws of music he has only found them out  and if he be selfwilled and break them there is an end of his music instantly all he brings out is discord and ugly sounds  the greatest musician in the world is as much bound by those laws as the learner in the school and the greatest musician is the one who instead of fancying that because he is clever he may throw aside the laws of music knows the laws of music best and observes them most reverently  and therefore it was that the old greeks the wisest of all the heathens made a point of teaching their children music because they said it taught them not to be selfwilled and fanciful but to see the beauty of order the usefulness of rule the divineness of law  and therefore music is fit for heaven therefore music is a pattern and type of heaven and of the everlasting life of god which perfect spirits live in heaven a life of melody and order in themselves a life of harmony with each other and with god  music i say is a pattern of the everlasting life of heaven because in heaven as in music is perfect freedom and perfect pleasure and yet that freedom comes not from throwing away law but from obeying gods law perfectly and that pleasure comes not from selfwill and doing each what he likes but from perfectly doing the will of the father who is in heaven  and that in itself would be sweet music even if there were neither voice nor sound in heaven  for wherever there is order and obedience there is sweet music for the ears of christ  whatsoever does its duty according to its kind which christ has given it makes melody in the ears of christ  whatsoever is useful to the things around it makes harmony in the ears of christ  therefore those wise old greeks used to talk of the music of the spheres  they said that sun moon and stars going round each in its appointed path made as they rolled along across the heavens everlasting music before the throne of god  and so too the old psalms say  do you not recollect that noble verse which speaks of the stars of heaven and says    what though no human voice or sound amid their radiant orbs be found to reasons ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voice for ever singing as they shine the hand that made us is divine   and therefore it is that that noble song of the three children calls upon sun and moon and stars of heaven to bless the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  and not only upon them but on the smallest things on earthon mountains and hills green herbs and springs cattle and feathered fowl they too he says can bless the lord and magnify him for ever  and how  by fulfilling the law which god has given them and by living each after their kind according to the wisdom wherewith christ the word of god created them when he beheld all that he had made and behold it was very good  and so can we my friends so can we  some of us may not be able to make music with our voices  but we can make it with our hearts and join in the angels song this day if not with our lips yet in our lives  if thou fulfillest the law which god has given thee the law of love and liberty then thou makest music before god and thy life is a hymn of praise to god  if thou art in love and charity with thy neighbours thou art making sweeter harmony in the ears of the lord jesus christ than psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of music  if thou art living a righteous and a useful life doing thy duty orderly and cheerfully where god has put thee then thou art making sweeter melody in the ears of the lord jesus christ than if thou hadst the throat of a nightingale for then thou in thy humble place art humbly copying the everlasting harmony and melody which is in heaven the everlasting harmony and melody by which god made the world and all that therein is and behold it was very good in the day when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy over the newcreated earth which god had made to be a pattern of his own perfection  for this is that mystery of which i spoke just now when i said that music was as it were the voice of god himself  yes i say it with all reverence  but i do say it  there is music in god  not the music of voice or sound a music which no ears can hear but only the spirit of a man when awakened by the holy spirit and taught to know god father son and holy spirit  there is one everlasting melody in heaven which christ the word of god makes for ever when he does all things perfectly and wisely and righteously and gloriously full of grace and truth  and from that all melody comes and is a dim pattern thereof here and is beautiful only because it is a dim pattern thereof  and there is an everlasting harmony in god which is the harmony between the father and the son who though he be coequal and co eternal with his father does nothing of himself but only what he seeth his father do saying for ever not my will but thine be done and hears his father answer for ever thou art my son this day have i begotten thee  therefore all melody and all harmony upon earth whether in the song of birds the whisper of the wind the concourse of voices or the sounds of those cunning instruments which man has learnt to create because he is made in the image of christ the word of god who creates all things all music upon earth i say is beautiful in as far as it is a pattern and type of the everlasting music which is in heaven which was before all worlds and shall be after them for by its rules all worlds were made and will be made for ever even the everlasting melody of the wise and loving will of god and the everlasting harmony of the father toward the son and of the son toward the father in one holy spirit who proceeds from them both to give melody and harmony order and beauty life and light to all which god has made  therefore music is a sacred a divine a godlike thing and was given to man by christ to lift our hearts up to god and make us feel something of the glory and beauty of god and of all which god has made  therefore too music is most fit for christmas day of all days in the year  christmas has always been a day of songs of carols and of hymns and so let it be for ever  if we had no music all the rest of the year in church or out of church let us have it at least on christmas day  for on christmas day most of all days if i may talk of eternal things according to the laws of time was manifested on earth the everlasting music which is in heaven  on christmas day was fulfilled in time and space the everlasting harmony of god when the father sent the son into the world that the world through him might be saved and the son refused not neither shrank back though he knew that sorrow shame and death awaited him but answered a body hast thou prepared me   i come to do thy will oh god and so emptied himself and took on himself the form of a slave and was found in fashion as a man that he might fulfil not his own will but the will of the father who sent him  on this day began that perfect melody of the sons life on earth one song and poem as it were of wise words good deeds spotless purity and untiring love which he perfected when he died and rose again and ascended on high for ever to make intercession for us with music sweeter than the song of angels and archangels and all the heavenly host  go home then remembering how divine and holy a thing music is and rejoice before the lord this day with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs by which last i think the apostle means not merely church musicfor that he calls psalms and hymnsbut songs which have a good and wholesome spirit in them and remembering too that music like marriage and all other beautiful things which god has given to man is not to be taken in hand unadvisedly lightly or wantonly but even when it is most cheerful and joyful as marriage is reverently discreetly soberly and in the fear of god  amen    sermon xviii  the christ child christmas day    luke ii 7  and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapt him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger  mother and childthink of it my friends on christmas day  what more beautiful sight is there in the world  what more beautiful sight and what more wonderful sight  what more beautiful  that man must be very far from the kingdom of godhe is not worthy to be called a man at allwhose heart has not been touched by the sight of his first child in its mothers bosom  the greatest painters who have ever lived have tried to paint the beauty of that simple thinga mother with her babe  and have failed  one of them rafaelle by name to whom god gave the spirit of beauty in a measure in which he never gave it perhaps to any other man tried again and again for years painting over and over that simple subjectthe mother and her babeand could not satisfy himself  each of his pictures is most beautifuleach in a different way and yet none of them is perfect  there is more beauty in that simple everyday sight than he or any man could express by his pencil and his colours  and yet it is a sight which we see every day  and as for the wonder of that sightthe mystery of iti tell you this  that physicians and the wise men who look into the laws of nature of flesh and blood say that the mystery is past their finding out that if they could find out the whole meaning and the true meaning of those two words mother and child they could get the key to the deepest wonders of the world  but they cannot  and philosophers who look into the laws of soul and spirit say the same  the wiser men they are the more they find in the soul of every newborn babe and its kindred to its mother wonders and puzzles past mans understanding  i will say boldly my friends that if one could find out the full meaning of those two words mother and child one would be the wisest philosopher on earth and see deeper than all who have ever yet lived into the secrets of this world of time which we can see and of the eternal world which no man can see save with the eyes of his reasonable soul  and yet it is the most common everyday sight  that only shows once more what i so often try to show you that the most common everyday things are the most wonderful  it shows us how we are to despise nothing which god has made above all to despise nothing which belongs to human nature which is the likeness and image of god  above all upon this christmas day it is not merely ignorant and foolish but quite sinful and heretical to despise anything which belongs to human nature  for on this day god appeared in human nature and in the first and lowest shape of itin the form of a newborn babe that by beginning at the beginning he might end at the end and being made in all things like as his brethren might perfectly and utterly take the manhood into god  this then we are to think of at least on christmas daygod revealed and shown to men as a babe upon his mothers bosom  men had pictured god to themselves already in many shapessome foolish foul brutalgod forgive themsome noble and majestic sometimes they thought of him as a mighty lawgiver sitting upon his throne in the heavens with solemn face and awful eyes looking down upon all the earth  that fancy was not a false one  st john saw the lord so  and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle  his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters  and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength  sometimes again they thought of him as the terrible warrior going forth to conquer and destroy all which opposed him to kill wicked tyrants and devils and all who rebelled against him and who hurt human beings  and that was not a false fancy either  st john saw the lord so  and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war  his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself  and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god  and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean  and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron  and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god  but all these were only as it were fancies about one side of gods character  it was only in the babe of bethlehem that the whole of gods character shone forth that men might not merely fear him and bow before him but trust in him and love him as one who could be touched with the feeling of their infirmities 151  it was on christmas day that god appeared among men as a child upon a mothers bosom  and why  surely for this reason among a thousand more that he might teach men to feel for him and with him and to be sure that he felt for them and with them  to teach them to feel for him and with him he took the shape of a little child to draw out all their love all their tenderness and if i may so say all their pity  a god in need  a god weak  god fed by mortal woman  a god wrapt in swaddling clothes and laid in a mangerif that sight will not touch our hearts what will  and by that same sight he has taught men that he feels with them and for them  god has been through the pains of infancy  god has hungered  god has wept  god has been ignorant  god has grown and increased in stature and in wisdom and in favour both with god and man  and why  that he might take on him our human nature  not merely the nature of a great man of a wise man of a grown up man only  but all human nature from the nature of the babe on its mothers bosom to the nature of the fullgrown and fullsouled man fighting with all his powers against the evil of the world  all this is his and he is all that no human being from the strongest to the weakest from the eldest to the youngest but may be able to say what i am christ has been  take home with you then this thought on this christmas day among all the rest which christmas ought to put into your minds  respect your own children  look on them as the likeness of christ and the image of god and when you go home this day believe that christ is in them the hope of glory to them hereafter  draw them round you and say to them each in your own fashionmy children god was made like to you this day that you might be made like god children this is your day for on this day god became a child that god gives you leave to think of him as a child that you may be sure he loves children sure he understands children sure that a little child is as near and as dear to god as kings nobles scholars and divines  yes my dear children you may think of god as a child now and always  for you christ is always the babe of bethlehem  do not say to yourselves christ is grown up long ago he is a fullgrown man he is and yet he is not  his life is eternal in the heavens above all change of time and space for time and space are but his creatures and his tools  therefore he can be all things to all men because he is the son of man  yes all things to all men  hearken to me you children and you grownup children also if there be any in this churchfor if you will receive it such is the sacred heart of jesusall things to all and wherever there is the true heart of a true human being there beating in perfect answer to it is the heart of christ  to the strong he can be strongest and to the weak weakest of all with the mighty he can be the king of kings and yet with the poor he can wander not having where to lay his head  with quiet jacob he goes round the farm among the quiet sheep and yet he ranges with wild esau over battlefield and desert and far unknown seas  with the mourner he weeps for ever and yet he will sit as of oldif he be but invitedand bless the marriagefeast  for the penitent he hangs for ever on the cross and yet with the man who works for god his father he stands for ever in his glory his eyes like a flame of fire and out of his mouth a twoedged sword judging the nations of the earth  with the aged and the dying he goes down for ever into the grave and yet with you children christ lies for ever on his mothers bosom and looks up for ever into his mothers face full of young life and happiness and innocence the everlasting christ child in whom you must believe whom you must love to whom you must offer up your childish prayers  the day will come when you can no longer think as a child or pray as a child but put away childish things  i do not know whether you will be the happier for that change  god grant that you may be the better for it  meanwhile go home and think of the baby jesus your lord your pattern your saviour and ask him to make you such good children to your mothers as the little jesus was to the blessed virgin when he increased in knowledge and in stature and in favour both with god and man    sermon xix  christs boyhood    luke ii 52  and jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favour both with god and man  i do not pretend to understand these words  i preach on them because the church has appointed them for this day  and most fitly  at christmas we think of our lords birth  what more reasonable than that we should go on to think of our lords boyhood  to think of this aright even if we do not altogether understand it ought to help us to understand rightly the incarnation of our lord jesus christ the right faith about which is that he was very man of the substance of his mother  now if he were very and real man he must have been also very and real babe very and real boy very and real youth and then very and real fullgrown man  now it is not so easy to believe that as it may seem  it is not so easy to believe  i have heard many preachers preach without knowing it what used to be called the apollinarian heresy which held that our lord had not a real human soul but only a human body and that his godhead served him instead of a human soul and a mans reason mans feelings  about that the old fathers had great difficulty before they could make people understand that our lord had been a real babe  it seemed to peoples unclean fancies something shocking that our lord should have been born as other children are born  they stumbled at the stumblingblock of the manger in bethlehem as they did at the stumblingblock of the cross on calvary and they wanted to make out that our lord was born into the world in some strange wayi know not howi do not choose to talk of it here but they would fancy and invent anything rather than believe that jesus was really born of the virgin mary made of the substance of his mother  so that it was hundreds of years before the fathers of the church set peoples minds thoroughly at rest about that  in the same way though not so much people found it very hard to believe that our lord grew up as a real human child  they would not believe that he went down to nazareth and was subject to his father and mother  people believe generally nowthe roman catholics as well as wethat our lord worked at his fathers tradethat he himself handled the carpenters tools  we have no certain proof of it  but it is so beautiful a thought that one hopes it is true  at least our believing it is a sign that we do believe the incarnation of our lord jesus christ more rightly than most people did fifteen hundred years ago  for then too many of them would have been shocked at the notion  they stumbled at the carpenters shop even as they did at the manger and at the cross  and they invented false gospelsone of which especially had strange and fanciful stories about our lords childhoodwhich tried to make him out  most of these stories are so childish i do not like to repeat them one of them may serve as a sample  our lord it says was playing with other children of his own age and making little birds out of clay  but those which our lord made became alive and moved and sang like real birdsstories put together just to give our lord some magical power different from other children and pretending that he worked signs and wonders  which were just what he refused to work  but the old fathers rejected these false gospels and their childish tales and commanded christian men only to believe what the bible tells us about our lords childhood for that is enough for us and that will help us better than any magical stories and childish fairy tales of mans invention to believe rightly that god was made man and dwelt among us  and what does the bible tell us  very little indeed  and it tells us very little because we were meant to know very little  trust your bibles always my friends and be sure if you were meant to know more the bible would tell you more  it tells us that jesus grew just as a human child grows in body soul and spirit  then it tells us of one caseonly onein which he seemed to act without his parents leave  and as the saying is the exception proves the rule  it is plain that his rule was to obey except in this case that he was always subject to his parents as other children are except on this one occasion  and even in this case he went back with them it is expressly said and was subject to them  now i do not pretend to explain why our lord stayed behind in the temple  i cannot explain who can the why and wherefore of what i see people do in common daily life  how much less can one explain why our lord did this and that who was both man and god  but one reason and one which seems to me to be plain on the very face of st lukes wordshe stayed behind to learn to learn all he could from the scribes and pharisees the doctors of the law  he told the people after when grown up the scribes and pharisees sit in moses seat  all therefore which they command you that observe and do  and he was a jew himself and came to fulfil all righteousness and therefore he fulfilled such righteousness as was customary among jews according to their law and religion  therefore i do not like at all a great many pictures which i see in childrens sunday books which set the child jesus in the midst as on a throne holding up his hand as if he were laying down the law and the scribes and pharisees looking angry and confounded  the bible says not that they heard him but that he heard them that they were astonished at his understanding not that they were confounded and angry  no  i must believe that even those hard proud pharisees looked with wonder and admiration on the glorious child that they perhaps felt for the moment that a prophet another samuel had risen up among them  and surely that is much more like the right notion of the child jesus full of meekness and humility of jesus who though he were a son learnt obedience by the things which he suffered of jesus who while he increased in stature increased in favour with man as well as with god  and surely no child can increase in favour either with god or man if he sets down his elders and contradicts and despises the teachers whom god has set over him  no let us believe that when he said know ye not that i must be about my fathers business that a childs way of doing the work of his father in heaven is to learn all that he can understand from his teachers spiritual pastors and masters whom god the father has set over him  thereforeand do listen to this children and young peopleif you wish really to think what christ has to do with you you must remember that he was once a real human childnot different outwardly from other children except in being a perfectly good child in all things like as you are but without sin  then whatever happens to you you will have the comfort of feeling christ understands this christ has been through this  child though i am christ can be touched with the feeling of my weakness for he was once a child like me  and then if trouble or sickness or death come among youand you all know how sickness and death have come among you of lateyou may be cheerful and joyful still if you will only try to be such children as jesus

be accepted for jesus christs sake and if you be trying to be good children doing your little work well where god has put you humble obedient and teachable winning love from the people round you and from god your father in heaven then i say you need not be afraid of sickness not even afraid of death for whenever it takes you it will find you about your fathers business    sermon xx  the locustswarms    joel ii 12 13  therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil  this is one of the grandest chapters in the whole old testament and one which may teach us a great deal and above all teach us to be thankful to god for the blessings which we have  i think i can explain what it means best by going back to the chapter before it  joel begins his prophecy by bitter lamentation over the mischief which the swarms of insects had done such as had never been in his days nor in the days of his fathers  what the palmer worm had left the locust had eaten what the locust had left the cankerworm had eaten and what the cankerworm had left the caterpillar had eaten whether these names are rightly rendered or whether they mean different sorts of locusts or the locusts in their different stages of growth crawling at first and flying at last matters little what mischief they had done was plain enough  they had come up a nation strong and without number whose teeth were like the teeth of a lion and his cheekteeth like those of a strong lion  they had laid his vines waste and barked his figtree and made its branches white and all drunkards were howling and lamenting for the wine crop was utterly destroyed  and all other crops it seems likewise the corn was wasted the olives destroyed the seed was rotten under the clods the granaries empty the barns broken down for the corn was withered the vine and fig pomegranate palm and apple were all gone the green grass was all gone the beasts groaned the herds were perplexed because they had no pasture the flocks of sheep were desolate  there seems to have been a dry season also to make matters worse for joel says the rivers of waters were dried up likely enough if then as now it is the dry seasons which bring the locustswarms  still the locusts had done the chief mischief  they came just as they come now only in smaller strength thank god in many parts of the east and of southern russia darkening the sky and shutting out the very light of the sun the noise of their innumerable jaws like the noise of flame devouring the stubble as they settled upon every green thing and gnawed away leaf and bark and a fire devoured before them and behind them a flame burned the land was as the garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness 162 till there was not enough left to supply the daily sacrifices and the meat offering and the drink offering were withheld from the house of god  but what has all this to do with us  there have never as far as we know been any locusts in england  and what has this to do with god  why does joel tell these jews that god sent the locusts and bid them cry to god to take them away  for these locusts are natural things and come by natural laws  and there is no need that there should be locusts anywhere  for where the wild grass plains are broken up and properly cultivated there the locusts which lay their countless eggs in the old turf disappear and must disappear  we know that now  we know that when the east is tilled as god grant it may be some day as thoroughly as england is locusts will be as unknown there as here and that is another comfortable proof to us that there is no real curse upon gods earth  but that just as far as man fulfils gods command to replenish the earth and subdue it so far he gets rid of all manner of terrible scourges and curses which seemed to him in the days of his ignorance necessary and supernatural  how then was joel right in saying that god sent the locusts  in this way my friends  suppose you or i took cholera or fever  we know that cholera or fever is preventible that man has no right to have these pestilences in a country because they can be kept out and destroyed  but if you or i caught cholera or fever by no fault or folly of our own we are bound to say god sent me this sickness  it has some private lesson for me  it is part of my education my schooling in gods school house  it is meant to make me a wiser and better man and that he can only do by teaching me more about himself  so with these locusts and still more so for joel did not know could not know that these locusts could be prevented  but even if he had known that it was not his fault or folly or his countrymens which had brought the locusts  most probably they were tilling the ground to the best of their knowledge  most probably too these locusts were not bred in palestine at all but came down upon the northwind as they are said to do now from some land hundreds of miles away and therefore joel could saywhatever i do not know about these locusts this i know that god whose providence orders all things in heaven and earth has sent them that he means to teach you a lesson by them that they are part of his schooling to us jews that he intends to make us wiser and better men by them  and that he can only do by teaching us more about himself  what then does joel say about the locusts which he might say to you or me if we were laid down by cholera or fever  he does not say these troubles have come upon you from devils or evil spirits or by any blind chance of the world about you  he says they have come on you from the lord from the same good loving merciful lord who brought your fathers out of egypt and made a great nation of you and has preserved you to this day  and do not fancy that he is changed  do not fancy that he has forgotten you or hates you or has become cruel or proud or unlike himself  it is you who have forgotten him and have shown that by living bad lives and all he wishes is to drive you back to him that you may live good lives turn to him and you will find him unchanged the same loving forgiving lord as ever  he requires no sacrifices no great offerings on your part to win him round  all he asks is that you should confess yourselves in the wrong and turn and repent  turn therefore to the lord with all your heart and with weeping and with fasting and with mourningwhich was and is still the eastern fashion and rend your heart and not your garments  and why because the lord is very dreadful angry and dark and has determined to destroy you all  not so  but because he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil  yes my friends  and this you will find is at the bottom of all true repentance and turning to god  if you believe that god is dark and hard and cruel you may be afraid of him  but you cannot repent cannot turn to him  the more you think of him the more you will be terrified at him and turn from him  but if you believe that god is gracious and merciful then you can turn to him then you can repent with a true repentance and a godly sorrow which breeds joy and peace of mind  so joel thought at least for he tells them that if they will but turn to god if they will but confess themselves in the wrong all shall be well again and better than before  now if joel had been a heathen worshipping the false gods of the canaanites he would have spoken very differently he would have said perhapsbaal the true god is angry with you and he has sent the drought  or ashtoreth the queen of heaven by whose power all seeds grow and all creatures breed is angry with you and she has destroyed the seeds and sent the locusts  or ammon the lord of the sheep is angry and he has destroyed your flocks and herds  but one thing we know he would have saidthese angry gods want blood  you cannot pacify them without human blood  you must give them the most dear and precious things you havethe most beautiful and pure  you must sacrifice boys and girls to them and then perhaps they will be appeased  we know this  we know that the heathen whenever they were in trouble took to human sacrifices  the canaanitesand the jews when they fell into idolatryused to burn their children in the fire to moloch  we know that the carthaginians who were of the same blood and language as the canaanites used human sacrifices and that once when their city was in great danger they sacrificed at one time two hundred boys of their highest families  we know that the greeks and romans who had much more humane and rational notions about their gods were tempted in times of great distress to sacrifice human beings  it has always been so  the old mexicans in america used to sacrifice many thousands of men and women every year to their idols and when the spaniards came and destroyed them off the face of the earth in the name of the lordas joshua did the canaanites of oldthey found the walls of the idol temples crusted inches thick with human blood  even to this day the wild khonds in the indian mountains and the red men of america sacrifice human beings at times and i fear very often indeed and believe that the gods will be the more pleased and more certain to turn away their anger the more horrible and lingering tortures they inflict upon their wretched victims  i say these things were and were it not for the light of the gospel these things would be still and when we hear of them we ought to bow our heads to our father in heaven in thankfulness and saywhat joel the prophet taught the jews to say dimly and in partwhat our lord jesus and his apostles taught us to say fully and perfectly   it is very meet right and our bounden duty at all times and in all placeswhether in joy or sorrow in wealth or in want to give thanks to thee o lord holy father almighty everlasting god  through jesus christ our lord according to whose most true promise the holy ghost came down from heaven upon the apostles to teach them and to lead them into all truth and give them fervent zeal constantly to preach the gospel to all nations by which we have been brought out of darkness and error into the clear light and true knowledge of thee and of thy son jesus christ  yes my friends this is the lesson which we have to learn from joels prophecy and from all prophecies  this lesson the old prophets learnt for themselves slowly and dimly through many temptations and sorrows  this lesson our lord jesus christ revealed fully and left behind him to his apostles  this lesson men have been learning slowly but surely in all the hundreds of years which have past since to know that there is one father in heaven of whom are all things and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things that they may in all the chances and changes of this mortal life in weal and in woe in light and in darkness in plenty and in want look up to that heavenly father who so loved them that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for them and say father not our will but thine be done  all things come from thy hand and therefore all things come from thy love  we have received good from thy hand and shall we not receive evil  though thou slay us yet will we trust in thee  for thou art gracious and merciful longsuffering and of great goodness  thou art loving to every man and thy mercy is over all thy works  thou art righteous in all thy ways and holy in all thy doings  thou art nigh to all that call on thee thou wilt hear their cry and wilt help them  for all thou desirest when thou sendest trouble on them is to make them wiser and better men  and that thou canst only make them by teaching them more about thyself    sermon xxi  salvation    isaiah lix 15 16  and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment  and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor  therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him  this text is often held to be a prophecy of the coming of our lord jesus christ  i certainly believe that it is a prophecy of his coming and of something better still namely his continual presence and a very noble and deep one and one from which we may learn a great deal  we may learn from it what salvation really is  what christ came to save men from and how he saves them  the common notion of salvation nowadays is this  that salvation is some arrangement or plan by which people are to escape hellfire by having christs righteousness imputed to them without their being righteous themselves  now i have nothing to say about that this morning  it may be so or again it may not i read a good many things in books every week the sense of which i cannot understand  at all events it is not the salvation of which isaiah speaks here  for isaiah tells us very plainly from what god was going to save these jews  not from hellfirenothing is said about it  but simply from their sins  as it is written thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins  the case is very simple if you will look at isaiahs own words these jews had become thoroughly bad men  they were not ungodly men they were very religious orthodox devout men  they sought god daily and delighted to know his ways like a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinances of their god  they asked of him the ordinances of justice they took delight in approaching unto god  but unfortunately for them and for all with whom they had to do after they had asked of god the ordinances of justice they never thought of doing them and in spite of all their religion they were isaiah tells them plainly rogues and scoundrels none of whom stood up for justice or pleaded for truth but trusted in vanity and spoke lies  their feet ran to evil and they made haste to shed innocent blood the way of peace they knew not and they had made themselves crooked paths speaking oppression and revolt and conceiving and uttering words of falsehood so that judgment was turned away backward and justice stood afar off for truth was fallen in the street and equity could not enter  yea truth failed and he that departed from evil made himself a prey or as some render it was accounted mad  and this is in the face of all their religion and their churchgoing verily my friends fallen human beings were much the same then as now and there are too many in england and elsewhere now who might sit for that portrait  but how was the lord going to save these hypocritical false unjust men  was he going to say to them believe certain doctrines about me and you shall escape all punishment for your sins and my righteousness shall be imputed to you  we do not read a word of that  we readnot that the lords righteousness was imputed to these bad men but that it sustained the lord himselfah there is a depth if you will receive ita depth of hope and comforta well spring of salvation for us and all mankind  you may be false and dishonest saith the lord but i am honest and true  unjust but i am just unrighteous but i am righteous  if men will not set the world right then i will saith the lord  my righteousness shall sustain me and keep me up to my duty though man may forget his  to me all power is given in heaven and earth and i will use my power aright  if men are bringing themselves and their country their religion their church to ruin by hypocrisy falsehood and injustice as those jews were then the lords arm will bring salvation  he will save them from their sins by the only possible waynamely by taking their sins away and making those of them who will take his lesson good and righteous men instead  it may be a very terrible lesson of vengeance and fury as isaiah says  it may unmask many a hypocrite confound many a politic and frustrate many a knavish trick till the lords salvation may look at first sight much more like destruction and misery for his fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather the wheat into his garner  but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire  but his purpose is to saveto save his people from their sins to purge out of them all hypocrisy falsehood injustice and make of them honest men true men just menmen created anew after his likeness  and this is the meaning of his salvation and is the only salvation worth having for this life or the life to come  oh my friends let us pray to god whatsoever else he does for us to make honest men of us  for if we be not honest men we shall surely come to ruin and bring all we touch to ruin past hope of salvation whatsoever denomination or church we belong to it will be all the same  we may call ourselves children of abraham of the holy catholic church which god preserve or what we will  but when the axe is laid to the root of the tree every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and is cast into the fire and woe to the foolish fowl who have taken shelter under the branches of it  and we who are coming to the holy communion this daylet us ask ourselves what do we want there  do we want to be made good men true honest just  do we want to be saved from our sins or merely from the punishment of them after we die  do we want to be made sharers in that everlasting righteousness of christ which sustains him and sustains the whole world too and prevents it from becoming a cage of wild beasts tearing each other to pieces by war and oppression falsehood and injustice  then we shall get what we want and more  but if not then we shall not get what we want not discerning that the lords body is a righteous and just and good body and his blood a purifying blood which purifies not merely from the punishment of our sins but from our sins themselves  and bear in mind my friends when times grow evil and rogues and hypocrites abound and all the world seems going wrong there is one arm to fall back upon and one righteousness to fall back upon which can never fail you or the world   the arm of the lord which brings salvation to him that he may give it to all who are faithful and true which cannot weaken or grow weary till it has cast out of his kingdom all which offends and whosoever loveth or maketh a lie   and the eternal righteousness of the lord which will do justice by every living soul of man and which will never fail or fade away because it is his own property belonging to his own essence which if he gave up for a moment he would give up being god  yes god is good though every man were bad god is just though every man were a rogue god is true though every man were a liar and as long as that is so all is safe for you and me and the whole world if we will    sermon xxii  the beginning and end of wisdom    proverbs ii 2 3 5  if thou incline thine ear to wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding yea if thou criest after wisdom and liftest up thy voice for understanding then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god  we shall see something curious in the last of these verses when we compare it with one in the chapter before  the chapter before says that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom  that if we wish to be wise at all we must begin by fearing god  but this chapter says that the fear of the lord is the end of wisdom too for it says that if we seek earnestly after knowledge and understanding then we shall understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god  so according to solomon the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the end likewise  it is the starting point from which we are to set out and the goal toward which we are to run  how can that be  if by wisdom solomon meant high doctrines what we call theology and divinity it would seem more easy to understand  but he does not mean that at least in our sense for his rules and proverbs about wisdom are not about divinity and high doctrines but about plain practical everyday life shrewd maxims as to how to behave in this life so as to thrive and prosper in it  and yet again they must be about divinity and theology in some sense for what does he say about wisdom in the text  if thou search after wisdom thou shalt understand the fear of the lord and is that all no  he says more than that  thou shalt find he says the knowledge of god  to know godwhat higher theology can there be than that it is the end of all divinity of all religion  it is eternal life itself to know god  if a man knows god he is in heaven there and then though he be walking in flesh and blood upon this mortal earth  how can all this be  let us consider the words once again  solomon does not say to understand the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom but simply the fear of the lord is the beginning of it  but the end of wisdom he says is not merely to fear the lord but to understand the fear of the lord  this then i suppose is his meaning  we are to begin life by fearing god without understanding it  as a child obeys his parents without understanding the reason of their commands  therefore says solomon to the young man begin with thatwith the solemn earnest industrious godfearing frame of mindwithout that you will gain no wisdom  you may be as clever as you will but if you are reckless and wild you will gain no wisdom  if you are violent and impatient if you are selfish and selfconceited if you are weak and selfindulgent given up to your own pleasures your cleverness will be of no use to you  it will be only hurtful to you and to others  a clever fool is common enough and dangerous enough for he is one who never sees things as they really are but as he would like them to be  a bad man let him be as clever as he may is like one in a fever whose mind is wandering who is continually seeing figures and visions and mistaking them for actual and real things and so with all his cleverness he lives in a dream and makes mistake upon mistake because he knows not things as they are and sees nothing by the light of christ who is the light of the world from whom alone all true understanding comes  begin then with the fear of the lord  make up your mind to do what you are told is right whether you know the reason of it or not take for granted that your elders know better than you and have faith in them in your teachers in your bible in the words of wise men who have gone before you  and do right whatever it costs you  if you do not always know the reason at first you will know it in due time and get so solomon says to understand the fear of the lord  in due time you will see from experience that you are in the path of life  you will be able to say with st paul i know in whom i have believed and with job before i heard of thee o lord with the hearing of the ear  but now mine eye seeth thee  and why  because says solomon god himself will show you and teach you by his holy spirit  as our lord says the holy spirit shall take of mine and show it unto you and lead you into all truth and therefore solomon talks of wisdom who is the holy ghost the comforter as a person who teaches men whose delight is with the sons of men  he speaks of wisdom as calling to men  he speaks of her as a being who is seeking for those that seek her who will teach those who seek after her  yes this my friends is i believe the secret of life  at least it is the secret both of solomons teaching and our lords and st pauls and st johns that true wisdom is not a thing which man finds out for himself but which god teaches him  this is the secret of lifeto believe that god is your father schooling and training you from your cradle to your grave and then to please him and obey him in all things lifting up daily your hands and thankful heart entreating him to purge the eyes of your soul and give you the true wisdom which is to see all things as they really are and as god himself sees them  if you do that you may believe that god will teach you more and more how to do in all the affairs of life that which is right in his sight and therefore good for you  he will teach you more and more to see in all which happens to you all which goes on around you his fatherly love his patient mercy his providential care for all his creatures  he will reward you by making you more and more partaker of his holy spirit and of truth by which seeing everything as it really is you will at lastif not in this life still in the life to comegrow to see god himself who has made all things according to his own eternal mind that they may be a pattern of his unspeakable glory and beyond that who needs to see  for to know god and to see god is eternal life itself  and this true wisdom which lies in knowing god and understanding his laws is within the reach of the simplest person here  as i told you cleverness without godliness will not give it you but godliness without cleverness may  therefore let no one say we are no scholars nor philosophers and we never can be  are we then shut out from this heavenly wisdom god forbid my friends  god is no respecter of persons  only remember one thing and by it you too may attain to the heavenly wisdom  i said that the fear of the lord was the beginning of wisdom  i said that the fear of the lord was the end of wisdom  now let the fear of the lord be the middle of wisdom also and walk in it from youth to old age and all will be well  that is the short way the royal road to wisdom  to be good and to do good  to keep the single eyethe eye which does not look two ways at once and want to go two ways at once as too many do who want to serve god and mammon and to be good people and bad people too both at once  but the single eye of the man who looks straightforward at everything and has made up his mind what it ought to do and will do so help him god  as stout old joshua said choose ye whom ye will serve  but as for me and my house we will serve the lord  that is the single eye which wants simply to know what is right and do what is right  and if a man has that he may be a very wise man indeed though he can neither read nor write  it is good for a man of course to be able to read that he may know what wiser men than he have said  above all that he may know what his bible says  but even if he cannot read let him fear god and set his heart earnestly to know and do his duty  let him keep his soul pure and his body also for nothing hinders that heavenly wisdom like loose living and he will be wise enough for this world and for the world to come likewise  i tell you my friends i have known women who were neither clever women nor learned women nor anything except good women whose souls were pure and full of the holy spirit and who lived lives of prayer and sat all day long with mary at the feet of jesusi have known such women to have at times a wisdom which all books and all sciences on earth cannot give  i have known them give opinions on deep matters which learned and experienced men were glad enough to take i have known them have in a wonderful degree that wisdom which the scripture calls discerning of spirits being able to see into peoples hearts knowing at a glance what they were thinking of what made them unhappy how to manage and comfort them knowing at a glance whether they were honest or not pureminded or nota precious and heavenly wisdom which comes as i believe from none other than the inspiration of the spirit of christ who is the discerner of the secret thoughts of all hearts  and when i have seen such people altogether simple and humble and yet most wise and prudent because they were full of the fear of the lord and of the knowledge of god i could not but askwhy should we not be all like them  my friends i believe that we may all be more or less like them if we will make the fear of the lord the beginning of our wisdom and the middle of our wisdom and the end of our wisdom  ninetenths of the mistakes we make in life come from forgetting the fear of god and the law of god and saying not i will do what is right  buti will do what will profit me i will do what i like if we would say to ourselves manfully instead all our lives through i will learn the will of god and do it whatsoever it cost me we should find in our old age that gods holy spirit was indeed a guide and a comforter able and willing to lead us into all truth which was needful for us  we should find st paul had spoken truth when he said that godliness has the promise of this life as well as of that which is to come    sermon xxiii  human nature septuagesima sunday    genesis i 27  so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them  on this sunday the church bids us to begin to read the book of genesis and hear how the world was made and how man was made and what the world is and who man is  and why  to prepare us i think for lent and passion week good friday and easter day  for you must know what a thing ought to be before you can know what it ought not to be you must know what health is before you can know what disease is you must know how and why a good man is good before you can know how and why a bad man is bad  you must know what man fell from before you can know what man has fallen to and so you must hear of mans creation before you can understand mans fall  now in lent we lament and humble ourselves for mans fall  in passion week we remember the death and suffering of our blessed lord by which he redeemed us from the fall  on easter day we give him thanks and glory for having conquered death and sin and rising up as the new adam of whom st paul writes as in adam all died even so in christ shall all be made alive  and therefore to prepare us for lent and passion week and easter day we begin this sunday to read who the first man was and what he was like when he came into the world  now we all say that man was created good righteous innocent holy but do you fancy that man had any goodness or righteousness of his own so that he could stand up and say i am good i can take care of myself i can do what is right in my own strength  if you fancy so you fancy wrong  the book of genesis and the text tell us that it was not so  it tells us that man could not be good by himself that the lord god had to tell him what to do and what not to do that the lord god visited him and spoke to him  so that he could only do right by faith  by trusting the lord and believing him and believing that what the lord told him was the right thing for him and it tells us that he fell for want of faith by not believing the lord and not believing that what the lord told him was right for him  so he was holy and stood safe only as long as he did not stand alone  but the moment that he tried to stand alone he fell  so that it was with adam as it is with you and me  the just man can only live by faith  and st john explains this more fully when he tells us that the voice of the lord the word of god whom adam heard walking among the trees of the garden was our blessed lord jesus christ who was the life of adam and all men and the light of adam and all men  all death and misery and all ignorance and darkness come at first from forgetting the lord jesus christ and forgetting that he is about our path and about our bed and spying out all our ways as st john says that christs light is always shining in the darkness of this world but the darkness comprehendeth it not that he came to his own but his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god as he gave to man at first for st luke says that adam was the son of god  but a son must depend on his father and therefore man was sent into the world to depend on god  so do not fancy that man before he fell could do without gods grace though he cannot now  if man had never fallen he would have been just as much in need of gods grace to keep him from falling  to deny that is the root of what is called the pelagian heresy  therefore the church has generally said and said most truly that adam stood by grace in paradise and had a supernatural gift and that as long as he used that gift he was safe and only so long  now what does supernatural mean  it means above nature  adam had a human nature  but he wanted something to keep him above that nature lest he should die as all natural things on earth must trees and flowers birds and beasts yea the great earth itself must die and have an end in time because it has had a beginning  man had and has still a human nature the most beautiful noble and perfect nature in the world high above the highest animals in rank beauty understanding and feelings  human nature is made so the bible tells us in some mysterious way after the likeness of god of christ the eternal son of man who is in heaven for the bible speaks of the word or voice of god as appearing to man in something of a human voice  reasoning with him as man reasons with man and feeling toward him human feelings  that is the doctrine of the bible of david and the prophets just as much as of genesis or of st paul  that is a great mystery and a great glory  but that alone could not make man good could not even keep him alive  for god made man for something more noble and blessed than to follow even his own lofty human nature  god made the animals to follow their natures each after its kind and to do each what it liked without sin  but he made man to do more than that to do more than what he likes namely to do what he ought  god made man to love him to obey him to copy him by doing gods will and living gods life lovingly joyfully and of his own free will as a son follows the father whose will he delights to do  all animals god made to live and multiply each after their kind and man likewise  but the animals he made to die again and fresh generations ay and fresh kinds of animals to take their place and do their work as we know has happened again and again both before and since man came upon the earth  but of man the bible says that he was not meant to die  that into him god breathed the breath or spirit of life  of that life of men who is jesus christ the lord that in christ man might be the son of god  to man he gave the life of the soul the moral and spiritual life which isto do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with his god the life which is always tending upward to the source from which it came and longing to return to god who gave it and to find rest in him  for in god alone in the assurance of gods love to us and in the knowledge that we are living the life of god can a mans spirit find rest  so st augustine found through so many bitter experiences when as he tells us he tried to find rest and comfort in all gods creatures one after another and yet never found them till he found god or rather was found by god and illuminated so he says himself with that grace which by the fall he lost  what then does holy baptism mean  it means that god lifts us up again to that honour from whence adam fell  that as adam lost the honour of being gods son so jesus christ restores to us that honour  that as adam lost the supernatural grace in which he stood so god for christs sake freely gives us back that grace that we may stand by faith in that christ the word of god whom adam disbelieved and fell away  baptism says you are not true and right men by nature you are only fallen menmen in your wrong place  but by grace you become men indeed true men men living as man was meant to live by faith which is the gift of god  for without grace man is like a stream when the fountain head is stopped it stops toolies in foul puddles decays and at last dries up  to keep the stream pure and living and flowing the fountain above must flow and feed it for ever  and so it is with man  man is the stream christ is the fountain of life  parted from him mankind becomes foul and stagnant in sin and ignorance and at last dries up and perishes because there is no life in them  joined to him in holy baptism mankind lives spreads grows becomes stronger better wiser year by year each generation of his church teaching the one which comes after as our lord says not only if any man thirst let him come to me and drink but also he that believeth in me out of him shall flow rivers of living water  yes my brethren if you want to see what man is you must not look at the heathens who are in a state of fallen and corrupt nature but at christians who are in a state of grace for they only those of them i mean who are true to god and themselves give us any true notion of what man can be and should be  heathendom is the foul and stagnant pool parted from christ the fount of life  christendom in spite of all its sins and short comings is the stream always fed from the heavenly fountain  and holy baptism is the river of the water of life which st john saw in the revelations clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb the trees of which are for the healing of the nations  and when that river shall have spread over the world there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in the city of god and the nations of them that are saved shall grow to glory and blessedness such as eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath entered into the heart of man to conceive but god hath prepared for those who love him  oh may god hasten that day  may he accomplish the number of his elect and hasten his kingdom and the day when there shall not be a heathen soul on earth but all shall know him from the least to the greatest and the knowledge of the lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea  thenwhen all men are brought into the fold of christs holy church then will they be men indeed men not after nature but after grace and the likeness of christ and the stature of perfect men  and then what shall happen to this earth matters little no not if the earth and all the works therein beautiful though they be be burned up for though this world perish man would still have his portion sure in the city of god which is eternal in the heavens and before the face of the son of man who is in heaven  oh my friends think of this  think of what you say when you say i am a man  remember that you are claiming for yourselves the very highest honouran honour too great to make you proud an honour so great that if you understand it rightly it must fill you with awe and trembling and the spirit of godly fear lest when god has put you up so high you should fall shamefully again  for the higher the place the deeper the fall and the greater the honour the greater the shame of losing it  but be sure that it was an honour before adam fell  that ever since christ has taken the manhood into god it is an honour now to be a man  do not let the devil or bad men ever tempt you to say i am only a man and therefore you cannot expect me to do right  i am but a man and therefore i cannot help being mean and sinful and covetous and quarrelsome and foul  for that is the devils doctrine though it is common enough  i have heard a story of a man in americawhere very few i am sorry to say have heard the true doctrine of the catholic church and therefore do not know really that god made man in his own image and redeemed him again into his own image by jesus christand this man was rebuked for being a drunkard and what do you fancy his excuse was  ah he said you should remember that there is a great deal of human nature in a man  that was his excuse  he had been so illtaught by his calvinist preachers that he had learnt to look on human nature as actually a bad thing as if the devil and not god had made human nature and as if christ had not redeemed human nature  because he was a man he thought he was excused in being a bad man because he had a human nature in him he was to be a drunkard and a brute  my friends i trust that you have not so learned christ  and if you have it is from no teaching of your bible of your catechism or your prayerbook and i say boldly from no teaching of mine  the church bids you say yes i have a human nature in me and what nature is that but the nature which the son of god took on himself and redeemed and justified it and glorified it sitting for ever now in his human nature at the right hand of god the son of man who is in heaven  yes i am a man and what is it to be a man but to be the image and glory of god  what is it to be a man  to belong to that race whose head is the coequal and coeternal son of god true it is not enough to have only a human nature which may sin will sin must sin if left to itself a moment  but you have unless the holy spirit has left you and your baptism is of none effect more than human nature in you  you have divine gracethat supernatural grace and spirit of god by which man stood in paradise and by neglecting which he fell  obey that spirit from him comes every right judgment of your minds every good desire of your hearts every thought and feeling in you which raises you up instead of dragging you down which bids you do your duty and live the life of god and christ instead of living the mere deathinlife of selfish pleasure and covetousness  obey that spirit and be men  men indeed that you may not come to shame in the day when christ the son of man shall take account of you how you have used your manhood body soul and spirit    sermon xxiv  the charity of god    quinquagesima sunday  luke xviii 31 32 33  all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished  for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on  and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again  this is a solemn text a solemn gospel but it is not its solemnity which i wish to speak of this morning but thiswhat has it to do with the epistle and with the collect  the epistle speaks of charity the collect bids us pray for the holy spirit of charity what have they to do with the gospel  let me try to show you  the epistle speaks of gods eternal charity  the gospel tells us how that eternal charity was revealed and shown plainly in flesh and blood on earth in the life and death of jesus christ our lord  but you may ask how does the epistle talk of gods charity  it bids men be charitable but the name of god is never mentioned in it  not so my friends  look again at the epistle and you will see one word which shows us that this charity which st paul says we must have is gods charity  for he says charity never faileth that though prophecies shall fail tongues cease knowledge vanish away charity shall never fail now if a thing never fail it must be eternal  and if it be eternal it must be in god  for as i have reminded you before about other things the athanasian creed tells us and never was truer or wiser word written there is but one eternal  but if charity be not in god there must be two eternals god must be one eternal and charity another eternal which cannot be  therefore charity must be in god and of god part of gods essence and being and not only gods saints but god himselfsuffereth long and is kind envieth not is not puffed up seeketh not his own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things  so st augustine believed and the greatest fathers of old time they believed and they have taught us to believe that before all things above all things beneath all things is the divine charity the love of god infinite as god is infinite everlasting as god is everlasting the charity by which god made all worlds all men and all things that they might be blest as he is blest perfect as he is perfect useful as he is useful the charity which is gods essence and holy spirit which might be content in itself because it is perfectly at peace in itself and yet cannot be content in itself just because it is charity and love and therefore must be going forth and proceeding everlastingly from the father and the son upon errands of charity love and mercy rewarding those whom it finds doing their work in their proper place and seeking and saving those who are lost and out of their proper place  but what has this to do with the gospel  surely my friends it is not difficult to see  in jesus christ our lord the eternal charity of god was fully revealed  the veil was taken off it once for all that men might see the glory of god in the face of jesus christ and know that the glory of god is charity and the spirit of god is love  there was a veil over that in old times and the veil comes over it often enough now  it was difficult in old times to believe that god was charity it is difficult sometimes now  sad and terrible things happenplague and famine earthquake and war  all these things have happened in our times  not two months ago in italy an earthquake destroyed many thousands of people and in india this summer things have happened of which i dare not speak which have turned the hearts of women to water and the hearts of men to fire  and when such things happen it is difficult for the moment to believe that god is love and that he is full of eternal boundless untiring charity toward the creatures whom he has made and who yet perish so terribly suddenly strangely  well then we must fall back on the gospel  we must not be afraid of the terror of such awful events but sanctify the lord god in our hearts and say whatever may happen i know that god is love i know that his glory is charity i know that his mercy is over all his works for i know that jesus christ who was full of perfect charity is the express image of his fathers person and the brightness of his fathers glory  i know for the gospel tells me that he dared all things endured all things in the depth of his great love for the sake of sinful men  i know that when he knew what was going to happen to him when he knew that he should be mocked scourged crucified he deliberately calmly faced all that shame horror agony and went up willingly to jerusalem to suffer and to die there because he was full of the spirit of god the spirit of charity and love  i know that he was so full of it that as he went up on his fatal journey with a horrible death staring him in the face still instead of thinking of himself he was thinking of others and could find time to stop and heal the poor blind man by the way side who called jesus thou son of david have mercy on me  and in him and his love will i trust when there seems nothing else left to trust on earth  oh my friends believe this with your whole heart  whatever happens to you or to your friends happens out of the eternal charity of god who cannot change who cannot hate who can be nothing but what he is and was and ever will belove  and when st paul tells you as he told you in the epistle today to have charity to try for charity because it is the most excellent way to please god and the eternal virtue which will abide for ever in heaven when all wisdom and learning even about spiritual things which men have had on earth shall seem to us when we look back such as a childs lessons do to a grown manwhen i say st paul tells you to try after charity he tells you to be like god himself to be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect to bear and forbear because god does so  to give and forgive because god does so to love all because god loves all and willeth that none should perish but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth  how he will fulfil that how he fulfilled it last summer with those poor souls in india we know not and never shall know in this life let it be enough for us that known unto god are all his works from the foundation of the world and that his charity embraces the whole universe    sermon xxv  the days of the week    james i 17  every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is neither variableness nor shadow of turning  it seems an easy thing for us here to say i believe in god  we have learnt from our childhood that there is but one god  it seems to us strange and ridiculous that people anywhere should believe in more gods than one  we never heard of any other doctrine except in books about the heathen and there are perhaps not three people in this church who ever saw a heathen man or talked to him  yet it is not so easy to learn that there is but one god  were it not for the church and the missionaries who were sent into this part of the world by the church now 1200 years ago we should not know it now  our forefathers once worshipped many gods and not one only god  i do not mean when they were savages for i do not believe that they ever were savages at all  but after they were settled here in england living in a simple way very much as country people live now and dressing very much as country people do now they worshipped many gods  now what put that mistake into their minds  it seems so ridiculous to us now that we cannot understand at first how it ever arose  but if we will consider the names of their old gods we shall understand it a little better  now the names of the old english gods you all know  they are in your mouths every day  the days of the week are named after them  the old english kept time by weeks as the old jews did and they named their days after their gods  why would take me too much time to tell  but so it is  why then did they worship these gods  first because man must worship something  before man fell he was created in christ the image and likeness of god the father and therefore he was created that he might hear his fathers voice and do his fathers will as christ does everlastingly and after man fell and lost christ and christs likeness still there was left in his heart some remembrance of the childs feeling which the first man had he felt that he ought to look up to some one greater than himself obey some one greater than himself that some one greater than himself was watching over him doing him good and perhaps too doing him harm and punishing him  then these simple men looked up to the heaven above and round on the earth beneath and asked who is it who is calling for us  who is it we ought to obey and please who gives us good things  who may hurt us if we make him angry  then the first thing they saw was the sun  what more beautiful than the sun  what more beneficent  from the sun came light and heat the growth of all living things ay the growth of life itself  the sun they thought must surely be a god so they worshipped the sun and called the first day of the week after himsunday  next the moon  nothing except the sun seemed so grand and beautiful to them as the moon and she was their next god and monday was named after her  then the windwhat a mysterious awful miraculous thing the wind seemed always moving yet no one knew how with immense power and force and yet not to be seen as our blessed lord himself said the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth  thenand this is very curiousthey fancied that the wind was a sort of pattern or type of the spirit of man  with them as with the old jews and greeks the same word which meant wind meant also a mans soul his spirit and so they grew to think that the wind was inhabited by some great spirit who gave men spirit and inspired them to be brave and to prophesy and say and do noble things and they called him wodin the mover the inspirer and named wednesday after him  next the thunderwhat more awful and terrible and yet so full of good than the summer heat and the thunder cloud  so they fancied that the thunder was a god and called him thorand the dark thunder cloud was thors frowning eyebrow and the lightning flash thors hammer with which he split the rocks and melted the winterice and drove away the cold of winter and made the land ready for tillage so they worshipped thor and loved him for they fancied him a brave kindly useful god who loved to see men working in their fields and tilling the land honestly  then the spring  that was a wonder to them againand is it not a wonder to see all things grow fresh and fair after the dreary winter cold  so the spring was a goddess and they called her freya the free one the cheerful one and named friday after her and she it was they thought who gave them the pleasant spring time and youth and love and cheerfulness and rejoiced to see the flowers blossom and the birds build their nests and all young creatures enjoy the life which god had given them in the pleasant days of spring  and after her friday is named  then the harvest  the ripening of the grain that too was a wonder to themand should it not be to ushow the corn and wheat which is put into the ground and dies should rise again and then ripen into golden corn  that too must be the work of some kindly spirit who loved men and they called him seator the setter the planter the god of the seed field and the harvest and after him saturday is named  and so instead of worshipping him who made all heaven and earth they turned to worship the heaven and the earth itself like the foolish canaanites  but some may say this was all very mistaken and foolish  but what harm was there in it  how did it make them worse men  my friends among these very woodlands here some thirteen hundred years ago you might have come upon one of the places where your forefathers worshipped thor and odin the thunder and the wind beneath the shade of ancient oaks in the darkest heart of the forest  and there you would have seen an ugly sight enough  there was an altar there with an everlasting fire burning on it but why should that altar and all the ground around be crusted and black with blood why should that dark place be like a charnel house or a butchers shambles why from all the trees around should there be hanging the rotting carcases not of goats and horses merely but of men sacrificed to thor and odin the thunder and the wind  why that butchery why those works of darkness in the dark places of the world  because that was the way of pleasing thor and odin  to that our forefathers came  to that all heathens have come sooner or later they fancy gods in their own likeness and then they make out those gods no better than and at last as bad as themselves  the old english and danes were fond of thor and odin they fancied them as i told you brave gods very like themselves  but they themselves were not always what they ought to be they had fierce passions were proud revengeful bloodthirsty and they thought thor and odin must be so too  and when they looked round them that seemed too true  the thunder storm did not merely melt the snow cool the air bring refreshing rain it sometimes blasted trees houses men that they thought was thors anger  so of the wind  sometimes it blew down trees and buildings sank ships in the sea  that was odins anger  sometimes too they were not brave enough or they were defeated in battle  that was because thor and odin were angry with them and would not give them courage how were they to appease thor and odin and put them into good humour again  by giving them their revenge by letting them taste blood by offering them sheep goats horses in sacrifice  and if that would not do by offering them something more precious still living men  and so too often when the weather was unfavourable and crops were blasted by tempest or they were defeated in battle by their enemies thors and odins altars were turned into slaughterplaces for wretched human beingscaptives taken in war and sometimes if the need was very great their own children  that was what came of worshipping the heaven above and the earth around instead of the true god  human sacrifices butchery and murder  english and danes alike  it went on among them both across the seas in their old country and here in england till they were made christians  there is no doubt about it  i could give you tale on tale which would make your blood run cold  then they learnt to throw away those false gods who quarrelled among themselves and quarrelled with mankind gods who were proud revengeful changeable spiteful who had variableness in them and turned round as their passions led them  then they learnt to believe in the one true god the father of lights in whom is neither variableness nor shadow of turning  then they learnt that from one god came every good and perfect gift that god filled the sun with light that god guided the changes of the moon that god and not thor gave to men industry and courage god and not wodin inspired them with the spirit which bloweth where it listeth and raised them up above themselves to speak noble words and do noble deeds that god and not friga sent spring time and cheerfulness and youth and love and all that makes earth pleasant that god and not satur sent the yearly wonder of the harvest crops sent rain and fruitful seasons filling the earth with food and gladness  but what was there about this new god even the true god which the old missionaries preached which won the hearts of our forefathers  this my friends not merely that he was one god and not many but that he was a father of lights from whom came good gifts in whom was neither variableness nor shadow of turning  not merely a master but a father who gave good gifts because he was good himself a god whom they could love because he loved them a god whom they could trust and depend on because there was no variableness in him and he could not lose his temper as thor and odin did  that was the god whom their wild passionate hearts wanted and they believed in him  and when they doubted and asked how can we be sure that god is altogether goodhow can we be sure that he is always trustworthy always the samethen the missionaries used to point them to the crucifix the image of christ upon his cross and say there is the token there is what god is to you what god suffered for you there is the everlasting sign that he gives good gifts even to the best of all gifts even to his own self when it was needed there is the everlasting sign that in him is neither darkness passion nor change but that he wills all men to be saved from their own darkness and passions and from the ruin which they bring and to come to the knowledge of the truth that they have a father in heaven    sermon xxvi  the heavenly father    acts xvi 2428  god that made the world and all that therein is seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands    for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring  i told you last sunday of the meaning of the days of the week but one day i left outnamely tuesday  i did so on purpose  i wish to speak of that day by itself in this sermon  i told you how our forefathers worshipped many gods by fancying that various things in the world round them were godssun and moon wind and thunder spring and harvest  but if that seems to you at times wrong and absurd it seemed so to them also  they like all heathens had at times dreams of one god  they thought to themselvesall heaven and earth must have had a beginning and they cannot have grown out of nothing for out of nothing nothing comes  they must have been made in some way perhaps they were made by some one  the more they saw of this wonderful world and all the order and contrivance in it the more sure they were that one mind must have planned it one will created it  but menthey thoughtpersons living soulsare not merely made they are begotten they must have a father whose sons they are perhaps they thought there is somewhere a great father a father of all persons from whom all souls come who was before all things and all persons however great however ancient they may be  and so like the greeks and romans and many other heathen nations they had dim thoughts of an allfather as they called him father of gods and men the father of spirits  they looked round them too in this world and saw that everything in it must die  the tree though it stood for a thousand years must decay at last the very rocks and mountains crumbled to dust at last and so they thoughttruly and wisely enougheverything which we see near us perishes at last  why should not everything which we can see however far off however great perish  why should not this earth come to an end  why should not sun and moon wind and thunder spring and harvest end at last  and then will not these gods who are mixed up with the world and live in it and govern it die too if the sun perishes the sungod will perish too  if the thunder ceases for ever then there will be no more thundergod  yes they thoughtand wisely and truly tooeverything which has a beginning must have an end  everything which is born must die  the sun and the earth wind and thunder will perish some day the gods of sun and earth wind and thunder will die some day  and then what will be left  will there be nothing and nowhere  that thought was too horrible  gods voice in their hearts the word of the lord jesus christ who lights every man who comes into the world made them feel that it was horrible unreasonable that it could not be  but it was all dim to them and uncertain  of one thing only they were certain that death reigned and that death had passed upon all men and things and even gods  evil beasts evil gods evil passions were gnawing at the root of all things  a time would come of nothing but rage and wickedness fury and destruction the gods would fight and be slain and earth and heaven would be sent back again into shapeless ruin  and after that they knew no more though they longed to know  they dreamed i say at moments of a new and a better world new men new gods  but how were they to come  who would live when all things died  was there not somewhere an all father who had eternal life  then they looked round upon the earth those simplehearted forefathers of ours and said within themselves where is the all father if allfather there be  not in this earth for it will perish  not in the sun moon or stars for they will perish too where is he who abideth for ever  then they lifted up their eyes and saw as they thought beyond sun and moon and stars and all which changes and will change the clear blue sky the boundless firmament of heaven  that never changed that was always the same  the clouds and storms rolled far below it and all the bustle of this noisy world but there the sky was still as bright and calm as ever  the allfather must be there unchangeable in the unchanging heaven bright and pure and boundless like the heavens and like the heavens too silent and afar off  so they named him after the heaven tuith tuisco diviscothe god who lives in the clear heaven and after him tuesday is called  the day of tuisco the heavenly father  he was the father of gods and men and man was the son of tuisco and herthaheaven and earth  that was all they knew and even that they did not know they contradicted themselves and each other about it  after a time they began to think that odin and not tuisco was the allfather all was dim and far off to them  they were feeling after him as st paul says he had intended them to do  but they did not find him  they did not know the father because they did not know jesus christ the son as it is written no man cometh to the father but through me and no man hath seen god at any time only the onlybegotten son who is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him  many other heathens had the same thought and the same word the old greeks and romans for instance who many thousand years ago spoke the same tongue as we did then called him zeus or deus pater jupiter the heavenly father father of gods and men using the same word as our tuisco a little altered  and that same word changed slightly means god now in welsh french and italian and many languages in europe and in asia and will do so till the end of time  that i say was all they knew of their father in heaven till missionaries came and preached the gospel to them and told them what st paul told the greeks in my text  now what did st paul tell the greeks  he came we read to athens in greece and found the city wholly given to idolatry worshipping all manner of false gods and images of them  and yet they were not content with their false gods  they felt as our forefathers felt that there must be a greater better more mighty more faithful god than all  and they thought we will worship him too  for we are sure that he is though we know nothing about him  so they set up beside all the altars and temples of the false gods to the unknown god  and st paul passed by and saw it and his heart was stirred within him with pity and compassion and he rose up and preached them a sermonthe first and the best missionary sermon which ever was preached on earth the model of all missionary sermons and said that god whom you ignorantly worship him i will declare unto you  now here was a gospel here was good news  st paul told themas the missionaries afterwards told our forefathersthat one at least of their heathen fancies was not wrong  there was a heavenly father mankind was not an orphan come into the world he knew not whence and going when he died he knew not whither  no man was not an orphan  from god he came to god if he chose he might return  the heathen poet had spoken truth when he said for we are the offspring of god  but where was the heavenly father  far away in the clear sky in the highest heaven beyond all suns and stars  silent and idle caring for no one on earth content in himself and leaving sinful man to himself to go to ruin as he chose  no says st paul he is not far off from any one of us for in him we live and move and have our being  wonderful words  eighteen hundred years have past since then and we have not spelt out half the meaning of them  it is such good news such blessed news and yet such awful news that we are afraid to believe it fully  that the almighty god should be so near us sinful men that we in spite of all our sins should live and move and have our being in god  how can it be true  my friends it would not be true if something more was not true  we should have no right to say i believe in god the father almighty unless we said also i believe in jesus christ his only son our lord  st paul after he had told them of a father in heaven went on to tell them of a man whom that father had sent to judge the world having raised him from the deadand there his sermon stopped  those foolish greeks laughed at him they would not receive the news of jesus christ the son and therefore they lost the good news of their father in heaven  we can guess from st pauls epistle what he was going on to tell them  how by believing in jesus christ the son and claiming their share in him and being baptized into his name they might become once more gods children and take their place again as new men and true men in jesus christ  but they would not hear his message  our forefathers did hear that message and believed it they had been feeling after the heavenly father and at last they found him and claimed their share in christ as sons of the heavenly father and therefore we are christian men this day baptized into gods family and thriving as gods family must thrive as long as it remembers that god dwelleth not in temples made with hands and needs nothing from man seeing that he gives to all life and breath and all things and is not far from any one of us seeing that in him we live and move and have our being and are the offspring the children of god  bear that in mind  bear it in mind i say that in god you live and move and have your being  day and night going out and coming in say to yourselves i am with god my father and god my father is with me  there is not a good feeling in my heart but my heavenly father has put it there  ay i have not a power which he has not given a thought which he does not know even the very hairs of my head are all numbered  whither shall i go then from his presence whither shall i flee from his spirit  for he filleth all things  if my eyes were opened i should see at every moment gods love gods power gods wisdom working alike in sun and moon in every growing blade and ripening grain and in the training and schooling of every human being and every nation to whom he has appointed their times and the bounds of their habitation if haply they may seek after the lord and find him in whom they live and move and have their being everywhere i should see life going forth to all created things from god the father of whom are all things and god the son by whom are all things and god the holy spirit the lord and giver of that life  a little of that glorious sight we may see in this life if our hearts and reasons are purified by the spirit of god to see god in all things and all things in god  and more in that life whereof it is written beloved we are now the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be  but this we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is  to that life may he in his mercy bring us all  amen    sermon xxvii  the good shepherd    john x 11  i am the good shepherd  here are blessed words  they are not new words  you find words like these often in the bible and even in ancient heathen books  kings priests prophets judges are called shepherds of the people  david is called the shepherd of israel  a prophet complains of the shepherds of israel who feed themselves and will not feed the flock  but the old hebrew prophets had a vision of a greater and better shepherd than david or any earthly king or priestof a heavenly and almighty shepherd  the lord is my shepherd says one therefore i shall not want  and another says he shall feed his flock like a shepherd  he shall gather his lambs in his arms and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those who are with young  this was blessed news good news for all mankind if there had been no more than this  but there is more blessed news still in the text in the text the lord of whom those old prophets spoke spoke for himself with human voice upon this earth of ours and declared that all they had said was true and that more still was true  i am the good shepherd he says  and then he adds the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep  oh my friends consider these words  think what endless depths of wonder there are in them  is it not wonderful enough that god should care for men should lead them guide them feed them condescend to call himself their shepherd  wonderful indeed so wonderful that the old prophets would never have found it out but by the inspiration of almighty god  but what a wider deeper nobler more wonderful blessing and more blessed wonder that the shepherd should give his life for the sheepthat the master should give his life for the servant the good for the bad the wise one for the fools the pure one for the foul the loving one for the spiteful the king for those who had rebelled against him the creator for his creatures  that god should give his life for man  truly says st john herein is love  not that we loved him  but that he loved us  herein indeed is love  herein is the beauty of god and the glory of god that he spared nothing shrank from nothing that he might save man because the sheep were lost the good shepherd would go forth into the rough and dark places of the earth to seek and to save that which was lost  that was enough  that was a thousand times more than we had a right to expect  had he done only that he would have been for ever glorious for ever adorable for ever worthy of the praises and thanks of heaven and earth and all that therein is  but that seemed little in the eyes of jesus little to the greatness of his divine love  he would understand the weakness of his sheep by being weak himself understand the sorrows of his sheep by sorrowing himself understand the sins of his sheep by bearing all their sins the temptations of his sheep by conquering them himself and lastly he would understand and conquer the death of his sheep by dying himself  because the sheep must die he would die too that in all things and to the uttermost he might show himself the good shepherd who shared all sorrow danger and misery with his sheep as if they had been his children bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh  in all things he would show himself the good shepherd and no hireling who cared for himself and his own wages  if the wolf came he would face the wolf and though the wolf killed him yet would he kill the wolf that by his death he might destroy death and him who had the power of death that is the devil  he would go where the sheep went  he would enter into the sheepfold by the same gate as they did and not climb over into the fold some other way like a thief and a robber  he would lead them into the fold by the same gate  they had to go into gods fold through the gate of death and therefore he would go in through it also and die with his sheep that he might claim the gate of death for his own and declare that it did not belong to the devil but to him and his heavenly father and then having led his sheep in through the gate of death he would lead them out again by the gate of resurrection that they might find pasture in the redeemed land of everlasting life where can enter neither devil nor wolf nor robber evil spirit evil man or evil thing  this and more than this he would do in the greatness of his love  he would become in all things like his sheep that he might show himself the good shepherd  because they died he would die that so because he rose they might rise also  oh my friends who is sufficient for these things  not men not saints not angels or archangels can comprehend the love of christ how can they  for christ is god and god is love the root and fountain of all love which is in you and me and angels and all created beings  and therefore his love is as much greater than ours or than the love of angels and archangels as the whole sun is greater than one ray of sunlight  say rather as much greater and more glorious as the sun is greater and more glorious than the light which sparkles in the dewdrop on the grass  the love and goodness and holiness of a saint or an angel is the light in that dewdrop borrowed from the sun  the love of god is the sun himself which shineth from one part of heaven to the other and there is nothing hid from the lifegiving heat and light thereof  when the dewdrop can take in the sun then can we take in the love of god which fills all heaven and earth  but there is if possible better news still behindi am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine  i know my sheep  surely some of the words which i have just spoken may help to explain that to you  i know my sheep  not merely i know who are my sheep and who are not  of course the lord does that  we might have guessed that for ourselves  what comfort is there in that  no he does not say merely i know who my sheep are but i know what my sheep are  i know them their inmost hearts  i know their sins and their follies  but i know too their longing after good  i know their temptations their excuses their natural weaknesses their infirmities which they brought into the world with them  i know their inmost hearts for good and for evil  true i think some of them often miserable and poor and blind when they fancy themselves strong and wise and rich in grace and having need of nothing  but i know some of them too to be longing after what is good to be hungering and thirsting after righteousness when they can see nothing but their own sin and weakness and are utterly ashamed and tired of themselves and are ready to lie down in despair and give up all struggling after god  i know their weaknessand of me it is written i will carry the lambs in mine arms  those who are innocent and inexperienced in the ways of this world i will see that they are not led into temptation and i will gently lead those that are with young  those who are weary with the burden of their own thoughts those who are yearning and labouring after some higher better more free more orderly more useful life those who long to find out the truth and to speak it and give birth to the noble thoughts and the good plans which they have conceived i have inspired their good desires and i will bring them to good effect i will gently lead them says the lord for i know them better than they know themselves  yes  christ knows us better than we know ourselves  and better too than we know him  thanks be to god that it is so  or the last words of the text would crush us into despairi know my sheep and am known of mine  is it so  we trust that we are christs sheep  we trust that he knows us  but do we know him  what answer shall we make to that question do you know christ  i do not mean do you know about christ  you may know about a person without knowing the person himself when you see him  i do not mean do you know doctrines about christ though that is good and necessary  nor do you know what christ has done for your soul though that is good and necessary also  but do you know christ himself  you have never seen him true  but have you never seen any one like himeven in part  do you know his likeness when you see it in any of your neighbours that is a question worth thinking over  againdo you know what christ is like  what his character iswhat his way of dealing with your soul and all souls is  are you accustomed to speak to him in your prayers as to one who can and will hear you and do you know his voice when he speaks to you and puts into your heart good desires and longings after what is right and true and fair and noble and loving and patient as he himself is  do you know christ  alas my friends what a poor answer we can make to that question how little do we know christ  what would become of us if he were like usif he were one who bargained with us and saidunless you know me i will not take the trouble to know you  unless you care for me you cannot expect me to care for you  what would become of us if god said as you do to me so will i do to you  but our only hope lies in this that in christ the lord is no spirit of bargaining no pride no spite no rendering evil for evil  in this is our hope that he is the likeness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person perfect as his father is perfect that like his father he causeth his rain to fall on the evil and the good and his sun to shine on the just and on the unjust and is good to the unthankful and the evilto you and meand knows us though we know him not and cares for us though we care not for him and leads us his way like a good shepherd when we fancy in our conceit that we are going in our own way  this is our hope that his love is greater than our stupidity that he will not tire of us and our fancies and our selfwill and our laziness in spite of all our peevish tempers and our mean and fruitless suspicions of his goodness  no  he will not tire of us but will seek us and save us when we go astray  and some day somewhere somehow he will open our eyes and let us see him as he is and thank him as he deserves some day when the veil is taken off our eyes we shall see like those disciples at emmaus that jesus has been walking with us and breaking our bread for us and blessing us all our lives long and that when our hearts burned within us at noble thoughts and stories of noble and righteous men and women and at the hope that some day good would conquer evil and heaven come down on earth thenso we shall findgod had been dwelling among men all alongeven jesus who was dead and is alive for evermore and has the keys of death and hell and knows his sheep in this world and in all worlds past present and to come and leads them and will lead them for ever and none can pluck them out of his hand  amen    sermon xxviii  dark times    1 john iv 1618  we have known and believed the love that god hath to us  god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world  there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment  he that feareth is not made perfect in love  have we learnt this lesson  our reading and thinking and praying have been in vain unless they have helped us to believe and know the love which god has to us  but indeed no reading or thinking or praying will teach us that perfectly  god must teach it us himself it is easy to say that god is love easy to say that christ died for us easy to say that gods spirit is with us easy to say all manner of true doctrines and run them off our tongues at secondhand easy for me to stand up here and preach them to you just as i find them written in a book  but do i believe what i say  do you believe what you say  there is an awful question  we believe it all now or think we believe it while we are easy and comfortable  but should we have boldness in the day of judgmentshould we believe it all if god visited us to judge us and try us and pierce asunder the very joints and marrow of our heart with fearful sorrow and temptation  o lord who shall stand in that day  suppose for instance god were to take away the desire of our eyes with a stroke  suppose we were to lose a wife a darling child suppose we were struck blind or paralytic suppose some unspeakable unbearable shame fell on us tomorrow  could we say then god is love and this horrible misery is a sign of it  he loves me for he chastens me  or should we say like jobs wife and one of the foolish women curse god and die  god knows  ah when that dark day seems coming on us and bringing some misery which looks to us beforehand quite unbearablethen how our lip belief and bookfaith is tried and burnt up in the fire of god and in the fire of our own proud angry hearts too  how we struggle and rage at first at the very thought of the coming misery and are ready to say god will not do this  he cannotcannot be so unjust so cruel as to bring this misery on me  what have i done to deserve it  or if i have deserved it what have these innocents done  why should they be punished for my sins  after all my prayers too and my churchgoings and my tryings to be good  is this gods reward for all my trouble to please him  then how vain all our old prayers seem how empty and dry all ordinances  we cry i have cleansed my hands in vain and in vain washed my heart in innocency  we have no heart to pray to god  if he has not heard our past prayers why should we pray anymore  let us lie down and die let us bear his heavy hand if we must bear it sullenly desperately  but as for saying that god is love or to say that we know the love which god has for us we say in our hearts let the clergyman talk of that it is his business to speak about it or comfortable easy people who are not watering their pillow with bitter tears all night long  but if they were in my place says the unhappy man they would know a little more of what poor souls have to go through  they would talk somewhat less freely about its being a sin to doubt gods love  he has sent this great misery on me  how can i tell what more he may not send  how can i help being afraid of god and looking up to him with tormenting fear  yes my friends  these are very terrible thoughtsvery wrong thoughts some of them very foolish thoughts some of them though pardonable enough for god pardons them as we shall see  but they are real thoughts  they are what really come into peoples minds every day and i am here to talk to you about what is really going on in your soul and mine not to repeat to you doctrines at secondhand out of a book and say there that is what you have to believe and do and if you do not you will go to hell  but to speak to you as men of like passions with myself as sinning sorrowing doubting struggling human beings and to talk to you of what is in my own heart and will be in your hearts too some day if it has not been already  this is the experience of all real men all honest men who ever struggled to know and to do what is right  david felt it all you find it all through those glorious psalms of his  he was no comfortable bookread secondhand christian who had an answer ready for every trouble because he had never had any real trouble at all  david was not one of them  he had to go through a very rough trainingvery terrible and fiery trials year after year and had to say again and again i am weary of crying my heart is dry my heart faileth me for waiting so long upon my god  all thy billows and storms are gone over me  thou hast laid me in a place of darkness and in the lowest deep   not by sitting comfortably reading his book but by such terrible trials as that was david taught to trust god to the uttermost and to learn that gods love was so perfect that he need never dread him or torment himself with anxiety lest god should leave him to perish  hezekiah felt it too good man as he was when he was sick and like to die  and it was not for many a day that he found out the truth about these dark hours of misery that by all these things men live and in all these things is the life of the spirit  and this was jacobs experience too on that most fearful night of all his life when he waited by the ford of jabbok expecting that with the morning light the punishment of his past sins would come on him and not only on him but on all his family and his innocent children when he stood there alone by the dark river not knowing whether esau and his wild arabs would not sweep off the earth all he had and all he loved and knowing too that it was his own fault that he had brought it all upon them by his own deceit and treachery then when his sins stared him in the face and god rose up to judgment against him he learnt to pray as he had never prayed beforea prayer too deep for words  and jacob was left alone  and there wrestled a man with him till the breaking of the day  and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh and the hollow of his thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him  and he said let me go for the day breaketh  and he said i will not let thee go till thou bless me  and he blessed him there  and jacob called the name of that place peniel  for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved  so it may be with us  so it must be with us in the dark day when our faith is really tried by terrible affliction  we must begin as jacob did  plead gods promises confess the mercies we have received already  i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies which thou hast showed to thy servant  ask for gods help as jacob did  deliver me i pray thee out of the hand of esau my brother  plead his written promises and the covenant of our baptism which tell us that we are gods children and god our father as jacob did according to his lightand thou saidst i will surely do thee good  so the proud angry heart will perhaps pass out of us and we shall set ourselves more calmly to face the worst and to try if gods promises be indeed true and god be indeed as he has said love  but do not be astonished do not be disheartened if when the trouble comes there comes with it as to jacob a more terrible struggle far a struggle too deep for words if you find out that fine words and set prayers are nothing in the hour of need and that you will not be heard for your much speaking  ah the darkness of that time which perhaps goes on for days for months all alone between you and god himself  clergymen and good people may come in with kind words and true words  but they give no comfort your heart is still dark still full of doubt you want god himself to speak to your heart and tell you that he is love  and you have no words to pray with at last you have used them all up and you can only cling humbly to god and hold fast  one moment you feel like a poor slave clinging to his stern masters arm and entreating him not to kill him outright  the next you feel like a child clinging to its father and entreating him to save him from some horrible monster which is going to devour it  but you have no words to pray with only sighs and tears and groans you feel that you know not what to pray for as you ought know not what is good for you dare ask for nothing lest it should be the wrong thing  and the longer you struggle the weaker you become as jacob did till your very bones seem out of joint your very heart broken within you and life seems not worth having or death either  only hold fast by god  only do not despair  only be sure that god cannot lie be sure that he who cared for you from your birth hour cares for you still that he who loved you enough to give his own son for you hundreds of years before you were born cannot but love you still do not despair i say and at last when you are fallen so low that you can fall no lower and so weak that you are past struggling you may hear through the darkness of your heart the still small voice of god  only hold fast and let him not go until he bless you and you shall find with jacob of old that as a prince you have power with god and with man and have prevailed  and so god will answer you as he answered elijah at first out of the whirlwind and the blinding storm  but at last doubt it not with the still small voice which cannot be mistaken which no earthly ear can hear but which is more precious to the broken heart than all which this world gives the peace which passes understanding and yet is the surest and the only lasting peace  but what is the secret of this strange awful struggle  can you or i change gods will by any prayers of ours  god forbid that we should my friends even if we could for his will is a good will to us and his name is love  do not be afraid of him  if you do you are not made perfect in love you have not yet learnt perfect the lesson of his great love to you  but what is the secret of this struggle  why has any poor soul to wrestle thus with god who made him before he can get peace and hope  why is the trouble sent him at all  it looks at first sight a strange sort of token of gods love to bring the creatures whom he has made into utter misery  my friends these are deep questions  there are plenty of answers for them ready written  but no answers like the bible ones which tell us that whom the lord loveth he chasteneth that these sorrows come on us and heaviness and manifold temptations in order that the trial of our faith being much more precious than that of gold which perishes though it be tried with fire may be found to praise and honour and glory at the appearance of jesus christ  this is the only answer but it does not explain the reason  it only gives us hope under it  we do not know that these dreadful troubles come from god  the bible tells us that god tempts no man that he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men  the bible speaks at times as if these dark troubles came from the devil himself and as if god turned them into good for us by making them part of our training part of our education and so making some devils attempt to ruin us only a great means of our improvement  i do not know but this i do know the troubles are here and god is love  at least this is comfortable that god will let no man be tempted beyond what he is able  but will with the temptation make a way for us to escape that we may be able to bear it  at least this is comfortable that our prayers are not needed to change gods will because his will is already that we should be saved because we are on his side in the battle against the devil or the flesh or the world or whatever it is which makes poor souls and bodies miserable and he on ours  and all we have to do in our prayers is to ask advice and orders and strength and courage from the great captain of our salvation that we may fight his battle and ours aright and to the end  and my friends if you be in trouble if your heart be brought low within you remember only remember who the captain of our salvation is  who but jesus who died on the crossjesus who was made perfect by sufferings jesus who cried out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  if christ had to be made perfect by sufferings much more must we if he needed to learn obedience by sorrow much more must we  if he needed in the days of his flesh to make supplication to god his father with strong crying and tears so do we  and if he was heard in that he feared so i trust we shall be heard likewise  if he needed to taste even the most horrible misery of all to feel for a moment that god had forsaken him surely we must expect if we are to be made like him to have to drink at least one drop out of his bitter cup  it is very wonderful  but yet it is full of hope and comfort  full of hope and comfort to be able in our darkest and bitterest sorrow to look up to heaven and say at least there is one who has been through all this  as christ was so are we in this world and the disciple cannot be above his master  yes we are in this world as he was and he was once in this world as we are he has been through all this and more  he knows all this and more  we have a high priest above us who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities because he has been tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  yes my friends  nothing like one honest look one honest thought of christ upon his cross  that tells us how much he has been through how much he endured how much he conquered how much god loved us who spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for us  dare we doubt such a god  dare we murmur against such a god  dare we lay the blame of our sorrows on such a godour father no let us believe the blessed message of our confirmation which tells us that it is his fatherly hand which is ever over us and that even though that hand may seem heavy for awhile it is the hand of him whose very being and substance is love who made the world by love by love redeemed man by love sustains him still  though we went down into hell says david he is there though we took the wings of the morning and fled into the uttermost part of the sea yet there his hand would hold us and his right hand guide us still it is holding and guiding every one of us now through storm as well as through sunshine through grief as well as through joy let us humble ourselves under that mighty hand and it will exalt us in due time  he knows and must know when that due time is and till then he is still love and his mercy is over all his works    sermon xxix  gods creation    genesis i 31  and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good  this is good news and a gospel  the bible was written to bring good news and therefore with good news it begins and with good news it ends  but it is not so easy to believe  we want faith to believe and that faith will be sometimes sorely tried  yes we want faith  as st paul says  through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which appear  no one can prove to us that god made the world yet we must believe it and what is more we do believe it and are certain of it  but all the proving and arguments in the world will not make us certain that god made the world they will only make us feel that it is probable that it is reasonable to think so  what then does make us certain that god made the worldas certain as if we had seen him make it  faith which is stronger than all arguments  faith which comes down from heaven to our hearts and is the gift of god  faith which is the light with which jesus christ lights us  faith which comes by the inspiration of gods holy spirit  so again when we have to believe not only that god made the world but that all things which he has made are very good  so it is and you must believe it  god is good the absolute and perfect good and from good nothing can come but good  and therefore all which god has made is good as he is and therefore if anything in the world seems to be bad one of two things must be true of it  1  either it is not bad though it seems so to us and god will bring good out of it in his good time and justify himself to men and show us that he is holy in all his works and righteous in all his ways  or elseif the thing be really bad then god did not make it  it must be a disease a mistake a failure of mans making or some persons making but not of gods making  for all that he has made he sees eternally and behold it is very good  now i can say that and i believe it and god grant i may never say anything else  and yet i cannot prove it to you by any argument but i believe it and i dare say many of you believe it you all must believe it before all is over by something better than any argument  by faithfaith which speaks to the very core and root of a mans heart and reason and teaches him things surer and deeper than all sermons and books all proofs and arguments  may god our heavenly father fill our hearts with his holy spirit of faith that we may believe utterly in his goodness and therefore believe in the goodness of all that he has made  for at times we shall need that faith very much indeed not only about our neighbours but about ourselves  we shall find it hard to believe that there is goodness in some of our neighbours and the better we know ourselves we shall find it very difficult to believe that there is goodness in us  for surely this is a great puzzle  god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and god made you and me  are we therefore very good  or were we ever very good  here is a great mystery  it would seem as if we must have been very good if god made us  for god can make nothing bad  surely not  for he who makes bad things is a bad maker he who makes bad houses is a bad builder and he who makes bad men is a bad maker of men  but god cannot be a bad maker for he is perfect and without fault in all his works  yet men are bad  yet on the other hand if god made us and the bible be true there must be good in us  when god said let that man be when god first thought of us if i may so speak before the foundation of the world he thought of us as good  he created each of us good in his own mind else he would not have created us at all  but why were we not good when we came on earth  why do we come into this world sinful why does gods thought of us gods purpose about us seem to have failed  we do not know and we need not know  st paul tells us that it came by adams fall that by adams fall sin entered into the world and each man as he came into it became sinful  how that was we cannot understandwe need not understand  let us believe and be silent but let us believe this also that st paul speaks truth not in this only but in that blessed and glorious news with which he follows up his sad and bad news  as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life  yes we may say boldly now whatever has been whatever sin i inherited from adam however sinful i came into this world god looks on me now not as i am in adam but as i am in christ  i am in christ now baptized into christ a new creature in christ to christ i belong and not to adam at all and god looks now not on the old corrupt nature which i inherited from adam but on the new and good grace which god meant for me from all eternity which christ has given me now  it is that good and new grace in me which god cares for it is that good and new grace which god is working on to strengthen and perfect it that i may grow in grace and in the likeness of christ and become at last what god intended me to be when he thought of me first before the foundation of all worlds and said let us make man not one man but all men male and female in our image after our likeness  this again is a great mystery  yet our own hearts will tell us if we will look at them that it is true  are there not as it were two different persons in us fighting for the mastery  are we not so different at different times that we seem to ourselves and to our neighbours perhaps to be two different people according as we give way to the better nature or to the worse  even as davidone year living a heroic and noble life by faith in god writing psalms which will live to the worlds end and the next committing adultery and murder  were those two davids the same david  yes and yet no  the good and noble david was david when he obeyed the grace of god  the base and foul david was david when he gave way to his fallen and corrupt nature  even so might we be  even so in a less degree are we sometimes so unlike ourselves so ashamed of ourselves so torn asunder with passions and lusts delighting in gods law and all that is good in our hearts and yet finding another law in us which makes us slaves at moments to our basest passionsto anger fear spite covetousnessthat when we think of it we are ready to cry with st paul oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death  who  who but he of whom st paul tells us gives the answer in the very next verse i thank god that god himself will through jesus christ our lord  oh my friends whosoever of you have ever felt angry with yourselves discontented with yourselves ashamed of yourselves and he that has not felt so knows no more about himself than a dumb animal doesyou that have felt so listen to st pauls glorious news and take comfort  do you wish to be right  do you wish to be what god intended you to be before all worlds  do you wish that of you the glorious words may come true and god saw all that he had made and behold it was very good  then believe this  that all which is good in you god has made and that he will take care of what he has made for he loves it that all which is bad in you god has not made and therefore he will destroy it for he hates all that he has not made and will not suffer it in his world and that if you your heart your will are enlisted on the good side if you are wishing and trying that the good nature in you should conquer the bad then you are on the side of god himself and god himself is on your side and if god be for you who shall be against you  before all worlds from eternity itself god said let us make man in our own likeness and nothing can hinder gods word but the man himself  the word of god comes down says the prophet as the rain and the dew from heaven and like the rain and dew returns not to him void but prospers in the thing whereto he sends it only if the ground be hard and barren and determined to bring forth thorns and briars rather than corn and fruit is it cursed and near to burning and only if a man loves his fallen nature better than the noble just loving generous grace of god and gives himself willingly up to the likeness of the beasts which perish can gods purpose towards him become of none effect  take courage then  if thou dislikest thy sins so does god  if thou art fighting against thy worse feelings so is god  on thy side is god who made all and christ who died for all and the holy spirit who alone gives wisdom purity nobleness  how canst thou fail when he is on thy side  on thy side are all spirits of just men made perfect all wise and good souls and persons in earth and heaven all good and wholesome influences whether of nature or of grace of matter or of mind  how canst thou fail if they are on thy side god i say and all that god has made are working together to bring true of thee the word of godand god saw all that he had made and behold it was very good  believe and endure to the end and thou shalt be found in christ at the last day and being in christ have thy share at last in the blessing which the father pronounces everlastingly on christ and on the members of christ this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased  amen    sermon xxx  true prudence    matthew vi 34  take therefore no thought for the morrow  for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof  let me say a few words to you on this text  be not anxious it tells you  and why  because you have to be prudent  in practice fretting and anxiety help no man towards prudence  we must all be as prudent and industrious as we can agreed  but does fretting make us the least more prudent  does anxiety make us the least more industrious  on the contrary i know nothing which cripples a man more and hinders him working manfully than anxiety  look at the worst case of allat a man who is melancholy and fancies that all is going wrong with him and that he must be ruined and has a mind full of all sorts of dark hopeless fancies  does he work any the more or try to escape one of these dangers which he fancies are hanging over him  so far from it he gives himself up to them without a struggle he sits moping helpless and useless and says there is no use in struggling  if it will come it must come  he has lost spirit for work and lost the mind for work too  his mind is so full of these dark fears that he cannot turn it to laying any prudent plan to escape from the very things which he dreads  and so in a less degree with people who fret and are anxious  they may be in a great bustle but they do not get their work done  they run hither and thither trying this and that but leaving everything half done to fly off to something else  or else they spend time unprofitably in dreaming and expecting and complaining which might be spent profitably in working  and they are always apt to lose their heads and their tempers just when they need them most to do in their hurry the very last things which they ought to have done to try so many roads that they choose the wrong road after all from mere confusion and run with open eyes into the very pit which they have been afraid of falling into  as we say here they will go all through the wood to cut a straight stick and bring out a crooked one at last  my friends even in a mere worldly way the men whom i have seen succeed best in life have always been cheerful and hopeful men who went about their business with a smile on their faces and took the changes and chances of this mortal life like men facing rough and smooth alike as it came and so found the truth of the old proverb that good times and bad times and all times pass over of all men perhaps who have lived in our days the most truly successful was the great duke of wellington and one thing i believe which helped him most to become great was that he was so wonderfully free from vain fretting and complaining free from useless regrets about the past from useless anxieties for the future  though he had for years on his shoulders a responsibility which might have well broken down the spirit of any man though the lives of thousands of brave men and the welfare of great kingdoms ay humanly speaking the fate of all europedepended on his using his wisdom in the right place and one mistake might have brought ruin and shame on him and on tens of thousands yet no one ever saw him anxious confused terrified  though for many years he was much tried and hampered and unjustly and foolishly kept from doing his work as he knew it ought to be down yet when the time came for work his head was always clear his spirit was always ready and therefore he succeeded in the most marvellous way  solomon says better is he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city  now the great duke had learnt in most things to rule his spirit and therefore he was able not only to take cities but to do better still to deliver citiesay and whole countriesout of the hand of armies often far stronger humanly speaking than his own  and for an example of what i mean i will tell you a story of him which i know to be true  some one once asked him what his secret was for winning battles  and he said that he had no secret that he did not know how to win battles and that no man knew  for all he said that man could do was to look beforehand steadily at all the chances and lay all possible plans beforehand  but from the moment the battle began he said no mortal prudence was of use and no mortal man could know what the end would be  a thousand new accidents might spring up every hour and scatter all his plaits to the winds and all that man could do was to comfort himself with the thought that he had done his best and to trust in god  now my friends learn a lesson from this a lesson for the battle of life which every one of us has to fight from our cradle to our gravethe battle against misery poverty misfortune sickness the battle against worse enemies even than theythe battle against our own weak hearts and the sins which so easily beset us against laziness dishonesty profligacy bad tempers hardheartedness deserved disgrace the contempt of our neighbours and just punishment from almighty god  take a lesson i say from the great duke for the battle of life  be not fretful and anxious about the morrow  face things like men count the chances like men lay your plans like men  but remember like men that a fresh chance may any moment spoil all your plans remember that there are thousand dangers round you from which your prudence cannot save you  do your best and then like the great duke comfort yourselves with the thought that you have done your best and like him trust in god  remember that god is really and in very truth your father and that without him not a sparrow falls to the ground and are ye not of more value than many sparrows o ye of little faith  remember that he knows what you have need of before you ask him that he gives you all day long of his own free generosity a thousand things for which you never dream of asking him and believe that in all the chances and changes of this life in bad luck as well as in good in failure as well as success in poverty as well as wealth in sickness as well as health he is giving you and me and all mankind good gifts which we in our ignorance and our natural dread of what is unpleasant should never dream of asking him for  but which are good for us nevertheless like him from whom they come the father of lights from whom comes every good and perfect gift who is neither neglectful capricious or spiteful for in him is neither variableness nor shadow of turning but who is always loving unto every man and his mercy is over all his works  bear this in mind my friends in all the troubles of lifethat you have a father in heaven who knows what you have need of before you ask him and your infirmity in asking and who is wontis regularly accustomed all day longto give you more than either you desire or deserve  and bear it in mind even more carefully if you ever become anxious and troubled about your own soul and the life to come  many people are troubled with such anxieties and are continually asking shall i be saved or not  in some this anxiety comes from bad teaching and the hearing of false cruel and superstitious doctrine  in others it seems to be mere bodily disease constitutional weakness and fearfulness which prevents their fighting against dark and sad thoughts when they arise but in both cases i think that it is the devil himself who tempts them the devil himself who takes advantage of their bodily weakness or of the false doctrines which they have heard and begins whispering in their ears you have no father in heaven  god does not love you  his promises are not meant for you  he does not will your salvation but your damnation and there is no hope for you till the poor soul falls into what is called religious melancholy and moping madness and despair and dread of the devil and often believes that the devil has got complete power over him and that he is the slave of satan for ever till in some cases the man is even driven to kill himself in the agony of his despair  now my friends the true answer to all such dark thoughts is your heavenly father knows what you have need of before you ask him therefore be not anxious about the morrow for the morrow shall take care for the things of itself sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  for in the first place my friends the devil was a liar from the beginning and therefore the chances are a million to one against his speaking the truth in any case and if he tells you that you are going to be damned i should take that for a fair sign that you were not going to be damned simply because the devil says it and therefore it cannot be true  no my friends the people who have real reason to be afraid are just those who are not afraidthe self conceited selfsatisfied souls for the devil attacks them too as he does every one by their weakest point and has his lie ready for them and whispers you are all right you are safe you cannot fall your salvation is sure  or else you hold the right doctrine you are orthodox and perfectly right and whoever differs from you must be wrong and so tempts them to vain confidence and unclean living or else into pride hardness of heart selfwilled and selfconceited quarrelling and slandering and lying for the sake of their own party in the church  it is the selfconfident ones who have reason to fear and tremble for after pride comes a fall  they have reason to fear lest while they are crying peace and safety and thanking god that they are not as other men are sudden destruction come on them but you anxious trembling souls who are terrified at the sight of your own sins you who feel how weak you are and ignorant and confused and unworthy to do aught but cry god be merciful to me a sinner you are the very ones who have least reason to be afraid just because you are most afraid  you are the true penitents over whom your father in heaven rejoices you are those of whom he has said i am the high and holy one who inhabiteth eternity yet i dwell with him that is of an humble and contrite heart to revive the spirit of the humble and to comfort the soul of the contrite ones as he will revive and comfort you if you will only have faith in god and take your stand on your baptism and from that safe ground defy the devil and all his dark imaginations saying i am gods child and god is my father and christs blood was shed for me and the holy spirit of god is with me and in the strength of my baptism i will hope against hope i trust in the lord my god who has called me into this state of salvation that he will keep to the end the soul which i have committed to him through jesus christ my lord  yes  be not anxious for the morrow and much more be not anxious for the life to come  your heavenly father knew that you had need of salvation long before you asked him  eighteen hundred years before you were born he sent his son into the world to die for you when you were but an infant he called you to be baptized into his church and receive your share of his spirit  long before you thought of him he thought of you long before you loved him he loved you and if he so loved you that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for you will he not with that son freely give you all things  therefore fear not little flock it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom  and be not anxious about the morrow for the morrow shall be anxious about the things of itself  be anxious about today if you will and work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you to will and to do of his good pleasure and therefore you can do right and therefore again it is your own fault if you do not do right  and yet for that very reason be not over anxious for if god be with you who can be against you  if god who is so mighty that he made all heaven and earth be on our side surely stronger is he that is with you than he that is against you  if god who so loved you that he gave his only begotten son for you be on your side surely you have a friend whom you can trust what can part you from his love  st paul asks you from gods love which is as boundless and eternal as god himself nothing can part you from it but your own sin  but i do sin you say again and again and that is what makes me fearful  i try to do better but i fall and i fail all day long  i try not to be covetous and worldly but poverty tempts me and i fall i try to keep my temper but people upset me and i say things of which i am bitterly ashamed the next minute  can god love such a one as me  my answer is if god loved the whole world when it was dead in trespasses and sins and not trying to be better much more will he love you who are not dead in trespasses and sins and are trying to be better  if he were not still helping you if his spirit were not with you you would care no more to become better than a dog or an ox cares  and if you fallwhy arise again  get up and go on  you may be sorely bruised and soiled with your fall but is that any reason for lying still and giving up the struggle cowardly in the name of jesus christ arise and walk  he will wash you and you shall be clean  he will heal you and you shall be strong again what else can a traveller expect who is going over rough ground in the dark but to fall and bruise himself and to miss his way too many a time  but is that any reason for his sitting down in the middle of the moor and saying i shall never get to my journeys end  what else can a soldier expect but wounds and defeat too often but is that any reason for his running away and crying we shall never take the place  if our brave men at sebastopol had done so and lost heart each time they were beaten back not only would they have never taken the place but the russians would have driven them long ago into the sea and perhaps not a man of them would have escaped  and be sure of it your battle is like theirs  every one of us has to fight for the everlasting life of his soul against all the devils of hell and there is no use in running away from them they will come after us stronger than ever unless we go to face them  as with our men at sebastopol unless we beat the enemy the enemy will destroy us and our only hope is to fight todays battle like men in the strength which god gives us and trust him to give us strength to fight tomorrows battle too when it comes  for here again as it was at sebastopol so it is with our souls  let our men be as prudent as they might they never knew what tomorrows battle would be like or where the enemy might come upon them and no more do we  they in general could not see the very enemy who was close on them and no more can we see our enemy near to us though he is  to morrows temptations may be quite different from todays  today we may be tempted to be dishonest tomorrow to lose our tempers the day afterwards to be vain and conceited and a hundred other things let the morrow be anxious about the things of itself then and face todays enemy and do the duty which lies nearest you  our brave men did so  they kept themselves watchful and took all the precautions they could in a general way just as we ought to do each in his own habits and temper but the great business was to go steadily on at their work and do each day what they could do instead of giving way to vain fears and fancies about what they might have to do some day which would have only put them out of heart and confused and distracted them  and so it came to pass that as their day so their strength was that each day they got forward somewhat and had strength and courage left besides to drive back each new assault as it came and so at last after many mistakes and many failures through sickness and weakness thirst and hunger and every misery except fear which can fall on man they conquered suddenly and beyond their highest hopes as every one will conquer suddenly and beyond his highest hope who fights on manfully under christs banner against sin against the sin in himself and in his neighbours and in his parish and faces the devil and his works wheresoever he may meet them sure that the devil and his works must be conquered at the last because gods wrath is gone out against them and christ who executes gods wrath will never sheath his sword till he has put all enemies under his feet and death be swallowed up in victory  therefore be not anxious about the morrow  do todays duty fight todays temptation and do not weaken and distract yourself by looking forward to things which you cannot see and could not understand if you saw them  enough for you that your saviour for whom you fight is just and merciful for he rewardeth every man according to his work  enough for you that he has said he that is faithful unto death i will give him a crown of life  enough for you that if you be faithful over a few things he will make you ruler over many things and bring you into his joy for evermore  but as for vain fears leave them to those who will not believe gods message concerning himselfthat he is love and his mercy over all his works  leave them for those who deny gods righteousness by denying that he has had pity on this poor fallen world but has left it to itself and its sins without sending any one to save it  and for real fears leave them for those who have no fears for those who think they see and yet are blind who think themselves orthodox and infallible and beyond making a mistake every man his own pope who say that they see and therefore their sin remaineth for those who thank god that they are not as other men are and who will find the publicans and harlots entering into the kingdom of heaven before them and for those who continue in sin that grace may abound and call themselves christians while they bring shame on the name of christ by their own evil lives by their worldliness and profligacy or by their bitterness and quarrelsomeness who make religious profession a byword and a mockery in the mouths of the ungodly and cause christs little ones to stumble  let them be afraid if they will for it were better for them that a millstone were hanged about their neck and they were drowned in the midst of the sea  but those who hate their sins and long to leave their sins behind those who distrust themselveslet them not be anxious about the morrow for tomorrow and today and for ever the almighty father is watching over them the lord jesus guiding them wisely and tenderly and the holy spirit inspiring them more and more to do all those good works which god has prepared for them to walk in and to conquer in the lifelong battle against sin the world and the devil    sermon xxxi  the penitent thief    luke xxiii 42 43  and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom  and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise  the story of the penitent thief is a most beautiful and affecting one  christians hearts in all times have clung to it for comfort not only for themselves but for those whom they loved  indeed some people think that we are likely to be too fond of the story  they have been afraid lest people should build too much on it lest they should fancy that it gives them licence to sin and lead bad lives all their days provided only they repent at last lest it should countenance too much what is called a deathbed repentance  now god forbid that i should try to narrow christs gospel  who am i to settle who shall be saved and who shall not  when the disciples asked the lord jesus are there few that be saved he would not tell them  and what christ did not choose to tell i am not likely to know  but i must say openly that i cannot see what the story of the penitent thief has to do with a deathbed repentance and for this plain reason that the penitent thief did not die in his bed  on the contrary he received the due reward of his deeds  he was crucified publicly executed by the most shameful painful and lingering torture and confessed that it was no more than he deserved  therefore if any man say to himselfand i am afraid that some do say to themselvesi know i am leading a bad life and i have no mind to mend it yet the penitent thief repented at the last and was forgiven so i dare say that i shall be one has a right to answer himvery well but you must first put yourself in the penitent thiefs place  are you willing to be hanged or worse than hanged as a punishment for your sins in this world  for till then the penitent thief would certainly not be on the same footing as you  if a man says to himself i will go on sinning now on the chance of repenting at last and making my peace with god he is not like the penitent thief he is much more like a famous emperor of rome who though a christian in name put off his baptism till his deathbed fancying that by it his sins would be washed away once and for all and made use of the meantime in murdering his eldest son and his nephew and committing a thousand follies and cruelties  whether his deathbed repentance purposely put off in order to give him time to sin was of any use to him let your own consciences judge  has then this story of the penitent thief no comfort for us  god forbid  why else was it put into christs gospel of good news surely there is comfort in it  only let us take the story honestly and word for word as it stands so we may hope to be taught by it what it was meant to teach us  he was a robber  the word means not a petty thief but a robber and his being put to such a terrible death shows the same thing most probably he had belonged to one of the bands of robbers which haunted the mountains of judea in those days as they used in old times to haunt the forests in england and as they do now in italy and spain and other waste and wild countries  some of these robbers would of course be shameless and hardened ruffians as that robber seems to have been who insulted our lord upon the very cross  others among them would not be lost to all sense of good  young men who got into trouble ran away from home and joined these robberbands and found pleasure in the wild and dangerous life  there is a beautiful story told of such a young robber in the life of the blessed apostle st john  a young man at ephesus who had become a christian and of whom st john was very fond got into trouble while st john was away and had to flee for his life into the mountains  there he joined a band of robbers and was so daring and desperate that they soon chose him as their captain  st john came back and found the poor lad gone  st john had stood at the foot of the cross years before and heard his lord pardon the penitent thief and he knew how to deal with such wild souls  and what did he do give him up for lost  no  he set off old as he was by himself straight for the mountains in spite of the warnings of his friends that he would be murdered and that this young man was the most desperate and bloodthirsty of all the robbers  at last he found the young robber  and what did the robber do  as soon as he saw st john comingbefore st john could speak a word to him he turned and ran away for shame and old st john followed him never saying a harsh word to him but only crying after him my son my son come back to your father and at last he found him where he was hidden and held him by his clothes and embraced him and pleaded with him so that the poor fellow burst into tears and let st john lead him away and so that blessed st john went down again to ephesus in joy and triumph bringing his lost lamb with him  now such a man one can well believe this penitent thief to have been  a man who however bad he had been had never lost the feeling that he was meant for better things whose conscience had never died out in him  he may have been such a man  he must have been such a man  for such faith as he showed on the cross does not grow up in an hour or a day  i do not mean the feeling that he deserved his punishment that might come to a man very suddenly but the feeling that christ was the lord and the king of the jews  he must have bought that by terrible struggles of mind by bitter shame and self reproach  he had heard i suppose of christs miracles and mercy of his teaching of his being the friend of publicans and sinners had admired the lord jesus and thought him excellent and noble  but he could not have done that without the holy spirit of god  it was the holy spirit striving with his sinful heart which convinced him of christs righteousness  but the holy spirit would have convinced him too of his own sin  the more he admired our lord the more he must have despised himself for being unlike our lord and doubt it not he had passed many bitter hours perhaps bitter years seeing what was right and yet doing what was wrong from bad habits or bad company before he came to his end upon the gallowstree  and there while he hung in torture on the cross the whole truth came to him at last  gods spirit shone truly on him at last and divided the light from the darkness in his poor wretched heart  all the good which had been in him came out once and for all  christs light had been shining in the darkness of his heart and the darkness had been trying to take it in and close over it but it could not and now the light had conquered the darkness and all was clear to him at last  he never despised himself so much he never admired christ so much as when they hung side by side in the same condemnation  side by side they hung scorned alike crucified alike seemingly come alike to open shame and ruin  and yet he could see that though he deserved all his misery that the man who hung by him not only did not deserve it but was his lord the lord the king of the jews and thatof course he knew not howthe cross would not destroy him that he would come in his kingdom  how he found out that no man can tell the spirit of god taught him the spirit of god alone to see in that crucified man the lord of glory and to cast himself humbly before his love and power in hope that there might be mercy even for himlord remember me when thou comest to thy kingdom  there was faith indeed and humility indeed royal faith and royal humility coming out in that dying robber  and so if you askhow was that robber justified by his works  how could his going into paradise be the receiving of the due reward of the deeds done in his body whether they be good or evil  i say he was justified by his works  he did receive the due reward of his deeds  one great and noble deed even that saying of his in his dying agonythat showed that whatever his heart had been it was now right with god  he could not only confess gods justice against sin in his own punishment but he could see gods beauty gods glory yea god himself in that man who hung by him helpless like himself scourged like himself crucified like himself like himself a scorn to men  he could know that christ was christ even on the cross and know that christ would conquer yet and come to his kingdom  that was indeed a faith in the merits of christ enough to justify him or any man alive  now what has all this to do with you or me living an easy comfortable life in sin here and hoping to die an easy comfortable death after all and get to heaven by having in a clergyman to read and pray a little with us and saying a few words of formal repentance when perhaps our body and our mind are so worn out and dulled by illness that we hardly know what we say  no my friends if our hearts be right we shall not think of the penitent thief to give us comfort about our own souls but we shall think of it and love it to give us comfort about the souls of many a man or woman for whom we care  how many men there are who are going wrong very wrong and yet whom we cannot help liking even loving  in the midst of all their sins there is something in them which will not let us give them up perhaps kindheartedness  perhaps an honest respect for good men and for good and right conduct loving the better while they choose the worse  perhaps a real shame and sorrow when they have broken out and done wrong and even though we know that they will go and do wrong again we cannot help liking them cannot give them up  then let us believe that god will not give them up any more than he gave up the penitent thief  if there be something in them that we love let us believe that god loves it also and what is more that god put it into them as he did into the penitent thief and let us hope we cannot of course be certain but we may hope that god will take care of it and make it conquer as he did in the penitent thief  let us hope that gods light will conquer their darkness gods strength conquer their weakness gods peace their violence gods heavenly grace their earthly passions  let us hope for them i say  when we hear as we often hear people say what a noblehearted man that is after all and yet he is going to the devil let us remember the penitent thief and have hope  who would have seemed to have gone to the devil more hopelessly than that poor thief when he hung upon the cross  and yet the devil did not have him  there was in him a seed of good and of eternal life which the devil had not trampled out and that seed flowered and bore fruit upon the very cross in noble thoughts and words and deeds  why may it not be so with others  true they may receive the due reward of their deeds  they may end in shame and misery like the penitent thief  perhaps it may be good for them to do so  if a man will sow the wind it may be good for him to reap the whirlwind and so find out that sowing the wind will not prosper  the penitent thief did so  as the proverb is he sowed the gallowsacorn poor wretch and he reaped the gallowstree but that gallowstree taught him to confess gods justice and his own sin and so it may teach others  yes let us hope and when we see some one whom we love and cannot help loving bringing misery on himself by his own folly let us hope and pray that the day may come to him when in the midst of his misery all that better nature in him shall come out once and for all and he shall cry out of the deep to christ i only receive the due reward of my deeds i have earned my shame i have earned my sorrow  lord i have deserved it all  i look back on wasted time and wasted powers  i look round on ruined health ruined fortune ruined hopes and confess that i deserve it all  but thou hast endured more than this for me though thou hast deserved nothing and hast done nothing amiss  thou hast done nothing amiss by me  thou hast been fair to me and given me a fair chance and more than that thou hast endured all for me  for me thou didst suffer for me thou hast been crucified and me thou hast been trying to seek and to save all through the years of my vanity  perhaps i have not wearied out thy love perhaps i have not conquered thy patience  i will take the blessed chance  i will still cast myself upon thy love  lord i have deserved all my misery yet lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom  oh my friends let us hope that that prayer will go up even out of the wildest heart in gods good time and that it will not go up in vain    sermon xxxii  the temper of christ    philippians ii 4  let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  what mind  what sort of mind and temper ought to be in us  st paul tells us in this chapter very plainly and at length what sort of temper he means and how it showed itself in christ and how it ought to show itself in us  all of you he tells us be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind  let nothing be done through strife or vainglory  but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself  look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others  first be likeminded having the same love  men cannot all be of exactly the same opinion on every point simply because their characters are different and the old proverb many men many minds will stand true in one sense to the end of the world  but in another sense it need not  people may differ in little matters of opinion without hating and despising and speaking ill of each other on these points they may agree to differ and yet keep the same love toward god and toward each other they may keep up a kindly feeling toward each other and they will do so if they have in their hearts the same love of god  if we really love god and long to do good and to work for god if we really love our neighbours and wish to help them then we shall have no heart to quarrelindeed we shall have no time to quarrelabout how the good is to be done provided it is done and we shall remember our lords own words to st john when st john said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us  wilt thou therefore that we forbid him  and jesus said forbid him not  forbid him not said jesus himself  he that hath ears to hear his saviours words let him hear  therefore st paul says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory  it is a very sad thing to think that the human heart is so corrupt that we should be tempted to do good and to show our piety through strife or vainglory  but so it is  party spirit pride the wish to show the world how pious we are the wish to make ourselves out better and more reverent than our neighbours too often creep into our prayers and our worship and turn our feasts of charity into feasts of uncharitableness vanity ambition  so it was in st pauls time  some he says preached christ out of contention hoping to add affliction to his bonds  not that he hated them for it or tried to stop them  any way he said christ was preached whether out of partyspirit against him or out of love to christ any way christ was preached  and he would and did rejoice in that thought  again i say he that hath ears to hear let him hear  esteem others better than ourselves  god forgive us which of us does that  is not ones first feeling not others are better than me but i am as good as my neighbour and perhaps better too people say it and act up to it also every day  if we would but take st pauls advice and be humble if we would take more for granted that our neighbours have common sense as well as we experience as well as we the wish to do right as well as weand perhaps more than we have and therefore listen humbly that is st pauls word bitter though it may be to our carnal pride listen humbly to every one who is in earnest or speaks of what he knows and feels  people are better than we fancy and have more in them than we fancy and if they do not show that they have it is three times out of four our own fault  instead of esteeming them better than ourselves and asking their advice and calling out their experience we are too in such a hurry to show them that we are better than they and to thrust our advice upon them that we give them no encouragement to speak often no time to speak and so they are silent and think the more and remain shut up in themselves and often pass for stupider people and worse people than they really are because we will not begin by doing justice to our neighbours we prevent them doing justice to themselves  look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others  ah my friends if we could but do that heartily and always what a different world it would be and what different people we should be  if instead of saying to ourselves as one is so apt to do will this suit my interest will this help me we would recollect to say too will this suit my neighbours interest will this harm my neighbours though it may help me  for if it hurts them i will have nothing to do with it  if again instead of saying to ourselves as we are too apt to do this is what i like and done it shall be we would generously and courteously think more of what other people like what will please them instruct them comfort them soften for them the cares of life and lighten the burden of mortalityhow much happier would not only they be but we also  for this my friends is the very likeness of christ who pleased not himself the very likeness of christ who sacrificed himself  and for this very reason st paul puts it the last of all his advices because it is the greatest the summing up of all the fulfilment of the whole law which says thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself and therefore after it he can give no more advice for there is none better left to give  but he goes on at once to speak of christ who fulfilled that whole law of love and more than fulfilled it for instead of merely loving his neighbours as he loved himself which is all god asks of us christ loved his enemies better than himself and died for them  so says st paullook not every man on his own things but on other peoples interest and comfort also  let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  what mind  the mind which looks not merely on its own things its own interest its own reputation its own opinions likes and dislikes but on those of others and has learnt to live and let live  yes this he says is the mind of christ  and this mind and spirit and temper he showed before all heaven and earth when though he was in the form of god and therefore as some interpret the text would have done no robbery no injustice by remaining for ever equal with god that is in the coequal and coeternal glory which he had with the father yet made himself of no reputation and took on him the form of a slave and was obedient to death even the death of the cross  my friends i beseech you young and old rich and poor remember the full meaning of these glorious words and of those which follow them  wherefore god hath highly exalted him  why  what was it in christ which was so precious so glorious in the eyes of the almighty father that no reward seemed too great for him  what but this very spirit of fellowfeeling and tenderness charity selfsacrifice even the holy spirit of god himself with which christ was filled without measure  because christ utterly and perfectly looked not on his own things but on the things of others  because he was pity itself patience itself love itself in the soul and body of a human being therefore his father declared of him this this is my wellbeloved son in whom i am well pleased  therefore it was that he highly exalted him therefore it was that he proclaimed him to be worthy of all honour and worship the most perfect lovely admirable and adorable of all beings in heaven and earth not merely because he showed himself to be light of light or wisdom of wisdom or power of power but because he showed himself to be love of love and therefore very god of very god begotten whom men and angels could not reverence admire adore imitate too much but were to see in him the perfection of all beauty all virtue all greatness the likeness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person  and therefore it is a very good and beautiful old custom to bow when the name of jesus is mentioned at least when it is mentioned for the first time or under any very solemn circumstances  it helps to remind us that he is really our king and lord  it helps too to remind us that he is actually and really near us standing by us looking at us face to face though we see him not and i am willing to say for myself that whenever i recollect that he is looking at me alas that is not a hundredth part often enough i cannot help bowing almost without any will of my own  but remember there is no commandment for it  it is just one of those things on which a christian is free to do what he likes and for which every christian is forbidden to judge or blame another according to st pauls rule he that observeth the day to the lord he observeth it and he that observeth it not to the lord he observeth it not  who art thou that judgest another  to his own master he standeth or falleth  yea and he shall stand for god is able to make him stand  beside the text says if we are to take it literally as we always ought with scripture not that every head shall bow at the name of jesus but every knee  and to kneel down every time we repeat that holy name would be impossible  while on the other hand we do bow our knees literally and in earnest at the name of jesus every time we kneel down in church every time we kneel down to say our prayers  and if any man is content with that no one has the least right to blame him  besides my friends there is i know too well a great danger in making too much of these little outward ceremonies especially with children and young people  for the heart of man is just as fond as it ever was of idolatry and superstition and willworship and voluntary humility and paying tithe of mint anise and cummin while it neglects the weightier matters of the law justice mercy and judgment  and therefore there is very great danger if we make too much of these ceremonies harmless and even good as many of them may be of getting to rest in them and thinking that god is pleased with them themselves  whereas what god looks at is the heart the spirit the soul and whether it is right or wrong proud or humble hard or loving  and if we think so much of the outward and visible form that we forget the inward and spiritual grace for which it ought to stand then we lay a snare for our own souls to turn them away from the worship of the living god and break the second commandment  much more if we pride ourselves on being more reverent than our neighbours in these outward forms and look down on and grudge at those who do not practise them for then we turn our humility into pride and our reverence to christ into an insult to him for the true way to honour christ is to copy christ  no one really honours and admires christs character who does not copy him and to esteem ourselves better than others to say in our hearts stand by for i am holier than thou to offend and drive away christs little ones and wound the consciences of weak brethren by insisting on things against which they have a prejudice is to run exactly counter to christ and the mind of christ and to be more like the pharisees than the lord jesus  that is not surely esteeming others better than ourselves  that is not surely looking not merely on our own things but also on the things of others that is not fulfilling the law of love that is not following st pauls example who gave up he says doing many things which he thought right because they offended weaker spirits than his own  all things he says are lawful to me but all things are not expedient  ay says he i would eat no meat while the world standeth if it cause my brother to offend  no my dear friends let us rather in this coming passion week take the lesson which the services of the church give us in this epistle let us keep passion week really and in spirit by remembering that it means the week of suffering in which christ instead of pleasing himself conquered himself and gave up himself and let wicked men do with him whatsoever they would  let us honour the holy name of jesus in spirit and in truth and bend not merely our necks or our knees when we hear his name but bend those stiff necks of our souls and those stubborn knees of our hearts let us conquer our selfwill selfopinion selfconceit selfinterest and take his yoke upon us for he is meek and lowly of heart  this is the passion week which he has chosento distrust ourselves and our own opinions likings and fancies  this is the repentance and this is the humiliation which he has chosento entreat him now and at once lest by pride we give place to the devil and fall while we think we stand to forgive us every hard and proud and conceited and selfwilled thought and word and deed to which we have given way since we were born to pray to him for really new hearts really tender hearts really humble hearts really broken and contrite hearts to look at his beautiful tenderness patience sympathy understanding generosity selfsacrifice and then to look at ourselves and be shocked and ashamed and confounded at the difference between ourselves and him and so really to honour the name of jesus who humbled himself even to the death upon the cross  i am not judging you my friends i am judging myself lest god judge me and telling you how to judge yourselves lest god judge you believe me if you will but take his yoke on you you will find it an easy yoke and a light burden you will find yourselves happier your duty simpler your prospects clearer your path through life smoother your character higher and more amiable in the eyes of all and you yourselves holy and fit to share on easter day in the precious body and blood of him who gave himself up to death that he might draw all men to himself and so draw them all to each other as children of one common father and brothers of jesus christ your lord    sermon xxxiii  the friend of sinners    preached in london  mark ii 15 16  and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him  and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said onto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners  we cannot wonder at the scribes and pharisees asking this question i think that we should most of us ask the same question now if we saw the lord jesus or even if we saw any very good or venerable man going out of his way to eat and drink with publicans and sinners  we should be inclined to say as the scribes and pharisees no doubt said why go out of his way to make fellowship with them to eat and drink with them  he might have taught them preached to them warned them of gods wrath against their sins when he could find them out in the street  or even if he could not do that if he could not find them all together without going into their house why sit down and eat and drink  why not say noi am not going to join with you in that  i am come on a much more solemn and important errand than eating  i have no time to eat  i must preach to you ere it be too late  and you would have no appetite to eat if you knew the terrible danger in which your souls are  besides however anxious for your souls i am you cannot expect me to treat you as friends to make companions of you and accept your hospitality while you are living these bad lives  i shall always feel pity and sorrow for you but i cannot be a table companion with you till you begin to lead very different lives  now if the scribes and pharisees had said that should we have thought them very unreasonable  for whatsoever kinds of sinners the sinners were these publicans were the very worst and lowest of company  they were not innkeepers as the word means now they were a kind of taxgatherers  but not like ours in england  for first these taxes were not taken by the jewish government but by the romansheathen foreigners who had conquered them and kept them down by soldiery quartered in their country  so that these publicans who gathered taxes and tribute for the heathen caesar of rome from their own countrymen were traitors to their country in league with their foreign tyrants as it were devouring their own flesh and blood and all the jews looked on them and really no wonder with hatred and contempt  beside these publicans did not merely gather the taxes as they do in free england they farmed them compounded for them with the roman emperor that is they had each to bring in to the romans a stated sum of money each out of his own district and to make their own profit out of the bargain by grinding out of the poor jews all they could over and above and most probably calling in the soldiery to help them if people would not pay  so this was a trade as you may easily see which could only prosper by all kinds of petty extortion cruelty and meanness and no doubt these publicans were devourers of the poor and as unjust and hardhearted men as one could be  as for those sinners who are so often mentioned with them i suppose this is what the word means  these publicans making their money ill spent it ill also in a low profligate way with the worst of women and of men  moreover all the other jews shunned them and would not eat or keep company with them so they hung all together and made company for themselves with bad people who were fallen too low to be ashamed of them  the publicans and harlots are often mentioned together and i doubt not they were often eating and drinking together god help them  and god did help them  the son of god came and ate and drank with them  no doubt he heard many words among them which pained his ears saw many faces which shocked his eyes faces of women who had lost all shame faces of men hardened by cruelty and greediness and cunning till gods image had been changed into the likeness of the fox and the serpent and worst of all the greatest pain to him of all he could see into their hearts their immortal souls and see all the foulness within them all the meanness all the hardness all the unbelief in anything good or true  and yet he ate and drank with them  make merry with them he could not  who could be merry in such company but he certainly so behaved to them that they were glad to have him among them though he was so unlike them in thought and word and look and action  and why  because though he was so unlike them in many things he was like them at least in one thing  if he could do nothing else in common with them he could at least eat and drink as they did and eat and drink with them too  yes  he was the son of man the man of all men and what he wanted to make them understand was that fallen as low as they were they were men and women still who were made at first in gods likeness and who could be redeemed back into gods likeness again  the only way to do that was to begin with them in the very simplest way to meet them on common human ground to make them feel that simply because they were men and women he felt for them that simply because they were men and women he loved them that simply because they were men and women he could not turn his back upon them for the sake of his father and their father in heaven  if he had left those poor wretches to themselves if he had even merely kept apart from their common everyday life and preached to them they would never have felt that there was still hope for them simply because they were men and women  they would have said in their hearts see he will talk to us  but he looks down on us all the time  we are fallen so low we cannot rise we cannot mend  what is there in us that can mend  we are nothing but brutes perhaps then brutes we must remain  heaven is for people like him perhaps but not for such as us  we are cut off from men  we have no brothers upon earth no father in heaven  let us eat and drink for to morrow we die  yes they would have said this for people like them will say it too often now here in christian england  but when our lord came to them ate and drank with them talked with them in a homely and simple way for our lords words are always simple and homely grand and deep and wonderful as they are then do you not see how selfrespect would begin to rise in those poor sinners hearts  not that they would say we are better men than we thought we were  no perhaps his kindness would make them all the more ashamed of themselves and convince them of sin all the more deeply for nothing nothing melts the sinners hard proud heart like a few unexpected words of kindnessay even a cordial shake of the hand from any one who he fancies looks down on him  to find a loving brother where he expected only a threatening schoolmaster that breaks the sinners heart and most of all when he finds that brother in jesus his saviour  thatthe sight of gods boundless love to sinners as it is revealed in the loving face of jesus christ our lordthat and that alone breeds in the sinner the broken and the contrite heart which is in the sight of god of great price  and so those publicans and sinners would not have begun to say we are better than we thought  but we can become better than we thought he must see something in us which makes him care for us  perhaps god may see something in us to care for  he does not turn his back on us  perhaps god may not  he must have some hope of us  may we not have hope of ourselves  surely there is a chance for us yet  oh if there were  we are miserable now in the midst of our drunkenness and our covetousness and our riotous pleasures  we are ashamed of ourselves  and our countrymen are ashamed of us  and though we try to brazen it off by impudence we carry heavy hearts under bold foreheads  oh that we could be different  oh that we could be even like what we were when we were little children  perhaps we may be yet  for he treats us as if we were men and women still his brothers and sisters still  he thinks that we are not quite brute animals yet it seems  perhaps we are not perhaps there is life in us yet which may grow up to a new and better way of living  what shall we do to be saved  o blessed charity bond of peace and of all virtues of brotherhood and fellowfeeling between man and man as children of one common father  ay bond of all virtuesof generosity and of justice of counsel and of understanding  charity unknown on earth before the coming of the son of man who was content to be called gluttonous and a winebibber because he was the friend of publicans and sinners  my friends let us try to follow his steps let us remember all day long what it is to be men that it is to have every one whom we meet for our brother in the sight of god that it is this never to meet any one however bad he may be for whom we cannot say christ died for that man and christ cares for him still  he is precious in gods eyes he shall be precious in mine also  let us take the counsel of the gospel for this day and love one another not in word merelyin doctrine but in deed and in truth really and actually in our everyday lives and behaviour words looksin all of them let us be cordial feeling pitiful patient courteous  masters with your workmen teachers with your pupils parents with your children be cordial and kind and patient respect every one whether below you or not in the worlds eyes  never do a thing to any human being which may lessen his selfrespect which may make him think that you look down upon him and so make him look down upon himself in awkwardness and shyness or else may make him start off from you angry and proud saying i am as good as you and if you keep apart from me i will from you if you can do without me i can do without you  i want none of your condescension  it is not so you cannot do without each other  we can none of us do without the other do not let us make any one fancy that he can and tempt him to wrap himself up in pride and surliness cutting himself off from the communion of saints and the blessing of being a man among men  and if any of you have a neighbour or a relation fallen into sin even into utter shameoh for the sake of him who ate and drank with publicans and sinners never cast them off never trample on them never turn your back upon them  they are miserable enough already doubt it not  do not add one drop to their cup of bitterness  they are ashamed of themselves already doubt it not do not you destroy in them what small grain of selfrespect still remains  you fancy they are not so  they seem to you brazenfaced proud impenitent  so did the publicans and harlots seem to those proud blind pharisees  those pompous selfrighteous fools did not know what terrible struggles were going on in those poor sin tormented hearts  their pride had blinded them while they were saying all along it is we alone who see  this people which knoweth not the law is accursed  then came the lord jesus the son of man who knew what was in man and he spoke to them gently cordially humanly and they heard him and justified god and were baptized confessing their sins and so as he said himself the publicans and harlots went into the kingdom of god before those proud selfconceited pharisees  therefore i say never hurt any ones selfrespect  never trample on any soul though it may be lying in the veriest mire for that last spark of selfrespect is as its only hope its only chance the last seed of a new and better life the voice of god which still whispers to it you are not what you ought to be and you are not what you can be  you are still gods child still an immortal soul you may rise yet and fight a good fight yet and conquer yet and be a man once more after the likeness of god who made you and christ who died for you  oh why crush that voice in any heart  if you do the poor creature is lost and lies where he or she falls and never tries to rise again  rather bear and forbear hope all things believe all things endure all things so you will as st john tells you in the epistle know that you are of the truth in the true and right road and will assure your hearts before god  for this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and believe really that he is now what he always was the friend of publicans and sinners and love one another as he gave us commandment  that was christs spirit the fairest the noblest spirit upon earth the spirit of god whose mercy is over all his works and hereby shall we know that christ abideth in us by his having given us the same spirit of pity charity fellowfeeling and love for every human being round us  and now i will also give you one lesson to carry home with youa lesson which if we all could really believe and obey the world would begin to mend from tomorrow and every other good work on earth would prosper and multiply tenfold a hundredfolday beyond all our fairest dreams  and my lesson is this  when you go out from this church into those crowded streets remember that there is not a soul in them who is not as precious in gods eyes as you are not a little dirty ragged child whom jesus were he again on earth would not take up in his arms and bless not a publican or a harlot with whom if they but asked him he would not eat and drinknow here in london on this sunday the 8th of june 1856 as certainly as he did in jewry beyond the seas eighteen hundred years ago  therefore do to all who are in want of your help as jesus would do to them if he were here as jesus is doing to them already  for he is here among us now and for ever seeking and saving that which was lost and all we have to do is to believe that and work on sure that he is working at our head and that though we cannot see him he sees us and then all will prosper at last for this brave old earth whereon we are living now and for that far braver new heaven and new earth whereon we shall live hereafter    sermon xxxiv  the sea of glass    trinity sunday  revelation iv 9 10 11  and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power  for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  the church bids us read this morning the first chapter of genesis which tells us of the creation of the world  not merely on account of that most important text which according to some divines seems to speak of the everblessed trinity and brings in god as saying let us make man in our image not let me make man in my image but let us in our imagenot merely for this reason is gen i a fit lesson for trinity sunday  but because it tells us of the whole world and all that is therein and who made it and how  it does not tell us why god made the world but the revelations do and the text does  and therefore perhaps it is a good thing for us that trinity sunday comes always in the sweet spring time when all nature is breaking out into new life when leaves are budding flowers blossoming birds building and countless insects springing up to their short and happy life  this wonderful world in which we live has awakened again from its winters sleep  how are we to think of it and of all the strange and beautiful things in it  trinity sunday tells us for trinity sunday bids us think of and believe a matter which we cannot understanda glorious and unspeakable god who is at the same time one and three  we cannot understand that no more can we understand anything else  we cannot understand how the grass grows beneath our feet  we cannot understand how the egg becomes a bird  we cannot understand how the butterfly is the very same creature which last autumn was a crawling caterpillar  we cannot understand how an atom of our food is changed within our bodies into a drop of living blood  we cannot understand how this mortal life of ours depends on that same blood  we do not know even what life is  we do not know what our own souls are  we do not know what our own bodies are  we know nothing  we know no more about ourselves and this wonderful world than we do of the mystery of the everblessed trinity  that of course is the greatest wonder of all  for as i shall try to show you presently god himself must be more wonderful than all things which he has made  but all that he has made is wonderful and all that we can say of it is to take up the heavenly hymn which this chapter in the revelations puts into our mouths and join with the elders of heaven and all the powers of nature in saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  let us do this  let us open our eyes and see honestly what a wonderful world we live in and go about all our days in wonder and humbleness of heart confessing that we know nothing and that we cannot know confessing that we are fearfully and wonderfully made and that our soul knows right well but that beyond we know nothing though god knows all for in his book were all our members written which day by day were fashioned while as yet there were none of them  how great are thy counsels o god they are more than i am able to express said david of old who knew not a tenth part of the natural wonders which we know more in number than the hairs of my head if i were to speak of them  this will keep us from that proud and yet shallow temper of mind which people are apt to fall into especially young men who are clever and selfeducated and those who live in great towns and so lose the sight of the wonderful works of god in the fields and woods and see hardly anything but what man has made and therefore forget how weak and ignorant even the wisest man is and how little he understands of this great and glorious world  such people are apt to fancy men are clever enough to understand anything  then they say why am i to believe anything i cannot understand  and then they laugh at the mysteries of faith and say three persons in one god  i cannot understand that  why am i expected to believe it  now here is the plain answer to such unwise speech for unwise it is let it be dressed up in all fine long words and show of wisdom whether the doctrine be true or not your not understanding the matter is no reason against it  here is the answer  you do believe all day long a hundred things which you do not understand which quite surpass your reason  you believe that you are alive  but you do not understand how you live  you believe that though you are made up of so many different faculties and powers you are one person  but you cannot understand how  you believe that though your body and your mind too have gone through so many changes since you were born yet you are still one and the same person and nobody else but yourself but you cannot understand that either  you know it is so but how and why it is so you cannot explain and the greatest philosopher would not be foolish enough to try to explain because if he is a really great scholar he knows that it cannot be explained  you lift your hand to your head  but how you do it neither you nor any mortal man knows and true philosophers tell you that we shall probably never know  true philosophers tell you that in the simplest movement of your body in the growth of the meanest blade of grass let them examine it with the microscope let them think over it till their brains are weary there is always some mystery some wonder over and above which neither their glasses nor their brains can explain or even find and see much less give a name to  they know that there is more in the matter in the simplest matter than man can find out and they are content to leave the wonder in the hands of god who made it and when they have found out all they can confess that the more they know the less they find they know  i tell you frankly my friends if you were to see through the microscope a few of the wonderful things which are going on round you now in every leaf and every gnat which dances in the sunbeam if you were to learn even the very little which is known about them you would see wonders which would surpass your powers of reasoning just as much as that far greater wonder of the everblessed trinity things which you would not believe if your own eyes did not show them you  and what if it be strange  what is there to surprise us in that  if the world be so wonderful how much more wonderful must that great god be who made the world and keeps it always living  if the smallest blade of grass be past our understanding how much more past our understanding must be the absolute eternal almighty god  do you not see that common sense and reason lead us to expect that god should be the most wonderful of all beings and things that there must be some mystery and wonder in him which is greater than all mysteries and wonders upon earth just as much as he is greater than all heaven and earth  which must be most wonderful the maker or the thing made  thou art man made in the likeness of god  thou canst not understand thyself  how much less canst thou understand god in whose likeness thou art made  for my part instead of keeping people from learning lest they should grow proud and despise the mysteries of faith i would make them learn and entreat them to learn and look seriously and patiently at all the wonderful things which are going on round them all day long for i am sure that they would be so much astonished with what they saw on earth that they would not be astonished much less staggered at anything they heard of in heaven and least of all astonished at being told that the name of almighty god was too deep for the little brain of mortal man and that they would learn more and more to take humbly like little children every hint which the experience of wise and good men of old time gives us of the everlasting mystery of mysteries the glory of the triune god which st john saw in the spirit  and what did st john see  something beyond even an apostles understanding  something which he could only see himself dimly and describe to us in figures and pictures as it were to help us to imagine that great wonder  he was in the spirit he says when he saw it  that is he did not see it with his bodily eyes but with his soul his heart and mind not with his bodily eyes for no man hath seen god at any time but with his minds eye which god had enlightened by his holy spirit  he sees a throne in heaven and one sitting on it bright and pure as richest precious stone and round his throne a rainbow like an emerald the sign to us of hope and faithfulness mercy and truth which he himself appointed after the flood to comfort the fearful hearts of men  around him are elders crowned men like ourselves but men who have fought the good fight and conquered and are now at rest pure as their white garments tell us and victorious as their golden crowns tell us  and from the throne come thunderings and lightnings and voices as they did when he spoke to the jews of old signs of his terrible power as judge and lawgiver and avenger of all the wrong which is done on earth  and there are there too seven burning lamps the seven spirits of god which give light and life to all created things and most of all to righteous hearts  and before the throne is a sea of glass the same sea which st john saw in another vision with us human beings standing on it and behold it was mingled with firethe sea of time and space and mortal life on which we all have our little day the brittle and dangerous sea of earthly life for it may crack any moment beneath our feet and drop us into eternity and the nether fire unless we have his hand holding us who conquered time and life and death and hell itself  it seems to us to be a great thing now time and space and the world and yet it looked small enough to st john as it lies in heaven before the throne of christ and he passes it by in a few words  for what are all suns and stars and what are all ages and generations and millions and millions of years compared with eternity with gods eternal heaven and god whom not even heaven can containone drop of water in comparison with all the rain clouds of the western sea  but there is one comfort for us in st johns vision that brittle and uncertain and dangerous as life may be yet it is before the throne of god and before the feet of christ  st john saw it lying there in heaven for a sign that in god we live and move and have our being  let us be content and hope on and trust on for god is with us and we with god  but st john saw another wonder  four beastsone like a man one like a calf one like an eagle one like a lion with six wings each  what those living creatures mean i can hardly tell you  some wise and learned men say they mean the four evangelists  but though there is much to be said for it i hardly think that for st john who saw them was one of the four evangelists himself  others think they mean great and glorious archangels and that may be so  but certainly the bible always speaks of angels as shaped like men like human beings only more beautiful and glorious  the two angels for instance who appeared to the three men at our lords tomb are plainly called in one place young men  i think rather that these four living creatures mean the powers and talents which god has given to men that they may replenish the earth and subdue it  for we read of these same living creatures in the book of the prophet ezekiel and we see them also on those ancient assyrian sculptures which are now in the british museum and we have good reason to think that is what they mean there  the creature with the mans head means reason the beast with the lions head kingly power and government with the eagles head and his piercing eye prudence and foresight with the oxs head labour and cultivation of the earth and successful industry  but whatsoever those living creatures mean it is more important to see what they do  they give glory and honour and thanks to him who sits upon the throne  they confess that all power all wisdom all prudence all success in men or angels in earth or heaven comes from god and is gods gift of which he will require a strict account for he is holy holy holy lord god almighty and all things are of him and by him and for him for ever and ever  but who is he who sits upon the throne  who but the lord jesus christ  who but the babe of bethlehem  who but the friend of publicans and sinners  who but he who went about doing good to suffering mortal man  who but he who died on the cross  who but he on whose bosom st john leaned at supper and now saw him highly exalted having a name above every name  oh blest st john to see that sight  to see his dear master in his glory after having seen him in his humiliation  god grant us so to follow in st johns steps that we may see the same sight unworthy though we are in gods good time  and where is god the father  yes where  the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him whom no man hath seen or can see who dwells in the light whom no man can approach unto  only the only begotten son who dwells in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and shown to men in his own perfect loveliness and goodness what their heavenly father is  that was enough for st john let it be enough for us  he who has seen christ has seen the father as far as any created being can see him  the son christ is merciful  therefore the father is merciful  the son is just therefore the father is just  the son is faithful and true therefore the father is faithful and true  the son is almighty to save  therefore the father is almighty to save  let that be enough for you and me  but where is the holy spirit  there is no where for spirits  all that we can say is that the holy spirit is proceeding for ever from the father and the son going forth for ever to bring light and life righteousness and love to all worlds and to all hearts who will receive him  the lamps of fire which st john saw the dove which came down at christs baptism the cloven tongues of fire which sat on the apostlesthese were signs and tokens of the spirit but they were not the spirit itself  of him it is written he bloweth where he listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence he cometh or whither he goeth  it is enough for us that he is the holy spirit the spirit of the holy father and of the holy son like them eternal like them incomprehensible like them almighty like them allwise alljust allloving merciful faithful and true for ever  this is what st john sawchrist the crucified christ the babe of bethlehem in the glory which he had before all worlds and shall have for ever with all the powers of this wondrous world crying to him for ever holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and the souls of just men made perfect answering those mystic animals and joining their hymns of praise to the hymn which goes up for ever from sun and stars from earth and seawhen they find out the deepest of all wisdomthe lesson which all the wonders of this earth and all which ever has happened or will happen in space and time is meant to teach us  thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  this is all that i can tell you  it may be a very little  but is it not enough  what says solomon the wise  knowest thou how the bones grow in the womb  not thou  how then wilt thou know god who made all things  thou art fearfully and wonderfully made though thou art but a poor mortal man  and is not god more fearfully and wonderfully made than thou art  it is a strange thing and a mystery how we ever got into this world  a stranger thing still to me how we shall ever get out of this world again  yet they are common things enoughbirth and death  every moment dies a man every moment one is born and yet you do not know what is the meaning of birth or death either  and i do not know and no man knows  how then can we know the mystery of god in whose hand are the issues of life and deathgod to whom all live for ever living and dead born and unborn in heaven and in hell  so it is in small things as well as great in great as well as small and so it ever will be  all things begin in some wonder and in some wonder all things end said saint augustine wisest in his day of all mortal men and all that great scholars have discovered since prove more and more that saint augustines words were true and that the wisest are only as a great philosopher once said and one too who discovered more of gods works than any man for many a hundred years even sir isaac newton himself  the wisest of us is but like a child picking up a few shells and pebbles on the shore of a boundless sea  the shells and pebbles are the little scraps of knowledge which god vouchsafes to us his sinful children knowledge of which at best st paul says that we know only in part and prophesy in part and think as children and that knowledge shall vanish away and tongues shall cease and prophecies shall fail  and the boundless sea is the great ocean of timeof gods created universe above which his spirit broods over perfect in love and wisdom and almighty power as at the beginning moving above the face of the waters of time giving life to all things for ever blessing and for ever blest  god grant us all to see the day when we shall have passed safely across that sea of time up to the sure land of eternity and shall no more think as children or know in part but shall see god face to face and know him even as we are known and find him the nearer we draw to him more wonderful and more glorious and more good than everholy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come  and meanwhile take comfort and recollect however little you and i may know god knows  he knows himself and you and me and all things and his mercy is over all his works    sermon xxxv  a god in pain    good friday  hebrews ii 9 50  but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man  for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings  what are we met together to think of this day  god in pain  god sorrowing god dying for man as far as god could die  now it is thisthe blessed news that god suffered pain god sorrowed god died as far as god could diewhich makes the gospel different from all other religions in the world and it is this too which makes the gospel so strong to conquer mens hearts and soften them and bring them back to god and righteousness in a way no other religion ever has done  it is the good news of this good day well called good friday which wins souls to christ and will win them as long as men are men  the heathen you will find always thought of their gods as happy the gods they thought always abide in bliss far above all the chances and changes of mortal life always young strong beautiful needing no help needing no pity and therefore my friends never calling out our love  the heathens never loved their gods  they admired them thanked them when they thought they helped them or they were afraid of them when they thought they were offended  but as far as i can find they never really loved their gods  love to god was a new feeling which first came into the world with the good news that god had suffered and that god had died upon the cross that was a god to be loved indeed and all good hearts loved him and will love him still  for you cannot really love any one who is quite different from you who has never been through what you have  you do not think that he can understand you you expect him to despise you laugh at you  you say as i have heard a poor woman say of a rich one how can she feel for me  she does not know what poor people go through  now it is just that feeling which mankind had about god till christ died  god or the gods were beautiful strong happy selfsufficient up in the skies and men on earth were full of sorrow and trouble disease accidents death and sin too quarrelling and killing hateful and hating each other  how could the gods love men  and then men had a sense of sin they felt they were doing wrong  surely the gods hated them for doing wrong  surely all the sorrows and troubles which came on them were punishments for doing wrong  how miserable they were  but the gods sat happy up in heaven and cared not for them  or if the gods did care they cared only for special favourites  if any man was very good or strong or handsome or clever or rich or prosperous the gods cared for himhe was a favourite  but what did they care for poor ugly deformed unfortunate foolish wretches  surely the gods despised them and had sent them into the world to be miserable  there was no sympathy no fellowfeeling between gods and men  the gods did not love men as men  why should men love them  and so men did not love them  and as there was no love to god before good friday so there was no love to men  if god despised the poor the deformed the helpless the ignorant the crazy why should not man  if god was hard on them why should not man oppress and illuse them  and so you will find that there was no charity in the world  among some of the eastern nationsthe hindoos for instancewhen they were much better men than now charity did spring up for a while here and there in a very beautiful shape but among greeks and romans there was simply no charity and you will find little or none among the jews themselves  the pharisees gave alms to save their own souls and feed their own pride of being good but had no charitythis people who knoweth not the law is accursed  as for poor diseased people they were born in sin  either they or their parents had sinned  we may see that the poor of judea as well as galilee were in a miserable neglected despised state and the worst thing that the pharisees could say of our lord jesus was that he ate and drank with publicans and sinners  because there was no love to god there was no love to man  there was a great gulf fixed between every man and his neighbour  but christ came god came and became man  and with the blood of his cross was bridged over for ever the gulf between god and man and the gulf between man and man  good friday showed that there was sympathy there was fellowfeeling between god and man that god would do all for man endure all for man that god so desired to make man like god that he would stoop to be made like man  there was nothing god would not do to justify himself to man to show men that he did care for them that he did love the creatures whom he had made  yes god had not forgotten man god had not made man in vain  god had not sent man into the world to be wicked and miserable here and to perish for ever hereafter wickedness and misery were here but god had not put them here and he would not leave them here  he would conquer them by enduring them  sin and misery tormented men then they should torment the son of god too  sin and misery killed men then they should kill the son of god too  he would taste death for every man that men might live by him  he would be made perfect by sufferings  not made perfectly good for that he was already but perfectly able to feel for men to understand them to help them because he had been tempted in all things like as they  and so on good friday did god bridge over the gulf between god and men  no man can say now why has god sent man into the world to be miserable while he is happy  for god in christ was miserable once no man can say god makes me go through pain and torture and death while he goes through none of such things  for god in christ endured pain torture death to the uttermost  and so god is a being which man can love admire have fellowfeeling for cling to god with all the noble feelings of his heart with admiration gratitude and tenderness even on this day with pityas christ himself said when i am lifted up i will draw all men to me  and no man can say now what has god to do with suffererssick weak deformed wretches  if he had cared for them would he have made them thus  for we can answer however sick or weak they may be god in christ has been as weak as they  god has shared their sufferings and has been made perfect by sufferings that they might be made perfect also  god has sanctified suffering pain and sorrow upon his cross and made them holy as holy as health and strength and happiness are  and so on good friday god bridged over the gulf between man and man  he has shown that god is charity and love and that the way to live for ever in god is to live for ever in that charity and love to all mankind which god showed this day upon the cross  and therefore all charity is rightly called christian charity for it is christ and the news of good friday which first taught men to have charity to look on the poor the afflicted the weak the orphan with love pity respect  by the sight of a suffering and dying god god has touched the hearts of men that they might learn to love and respect suffering and dying men and in the face of every mourner see the face of christ who died for them  because christ the sufferer is their elder brother all sufferers are their brothers likewise  because christ tasted pain shame misery death for all men therefore we are bound this day to pray for all men that they may have their share in the blessings of christs death not to look on them any longer as aliens strangers enemies parted from us and each other and god but whether wise or foolish sick or well happy or unhappy alive or dead as brothers  we are bound to pray for his holy church as one family of brothers for all ranks of men in it that each of them may learn to give up their own will and pleasure for the sake of doing their duty in their calling as christ did to pray for jews turks heathens and infidels as for gods lost children and our lost brothers that god would bring them home to his flock and touch their hearts by the news of his sufferings for them that they may taste the inestimable comfort of knowing that god so loved them as to suffer to groan to die for them and all mankind    sermon xxxvi  on the fall    sexagesima sunday  genesis iii 12  and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat  this morning we read the history of adams fall in the first lesson now does this story seem strange to you my friends  do you say to yourselves if i had been in adams place i should never have been so foolish as adam was  if you do say so you cannot have looked at the story carefully enough  for if you do look at it carefully i believe you will find enough in it to show you that it is a very natural story that we have the same nature in us that adam had that we are indeed adams children and that the bible speaks truth when it says adam begat a son after his own likeness  now let us see how adam fell and what he did when he fell  adam we find was not content to be in the image of god  he wanted he and his wife to be as gods knowing good and evil  now do i beseech you think a moment carefully and see what that means  adam was not content to be in the likeness of god to copy god by obeying god  he wanted to be a little god himself to know what was good for him and what was evil for him whereas god had told him as it were you do not know what is good for you and what is evil for you  i know and i tell you to obey me not to eat of a certain tree in the garden  but pride and selfwill rose up in adams heart  he wanted to show that he did know what was good for him  he wanted to be independent and show that he could do what he liked and take care of himself and so he ate the fruit which he was forbidden to eat partly because it was fair and welltasted but still more to show his own independence  now surely this is natural enough  have we not all done the very same thing in our time nay over and over again  when we were children were we never forbidden to do something which we wished to do  were we never forbidden just as adam was to take an apple something pleasant to the eye and good for food  and did we not long for it and determine to have it all the more because it was forbidden just as adam and eve did so that we wished for it much more than we should if our parents had given it to us  did we not in our hearts accuse our parents of grudging it to us and listen to the voice of the tempter as eve did when the serpent tried to make out that god was niggardly to her and envious of her and did not want her to be wise lest she should be too like god  have we not said in our heart why should my father grudge me that nice thing when he takes it himself  he wants to keep it all to himself  why should not i have a share of it  he says it will hurt me  how does he know that  it does not hurt him  i must be the best judge of whether it will hurt me  i do not believe that it will  but at least it is but fair that i should try  i will try for myself  i will run the chance  why should i be kept like a baby as if i had no sense or will of my own  i will know the right and the wrong of it for myself  i will know the good and evil of it myself  have we not said that every one of us in our hearts when we were youngand is not that just what the bible says adam and eve said  and then because we were adams children with his fallen nature in us and original sin which we inherited from him we could not help longing more and more after what our parents had forbidden we could think perhaps of nothing else cared for no pleasure no pay because we could not get that one thing which our parents had told us not to touch  and at last we fell and sinned and took the thing on the sly  and then  did it not happen to us as it did to adam that a feeling of shame and guiltiness came over us at once  yes of shame  we intended to feed our own pride  but instead of pride came shame and fear too so instead of rising we had fallen and felt that we had fallen  just so it was with adam  instead of feeling all the prouder and grander when he had sinned he became ashamed of himself at once he hardly knew why  we had intended to set ourselves up against our parents but instead we became afraid of them  we were always fancying that they would find us out  we were afraid of looking them in the face just so it was with adam  he heard the word of the lord god jesus christ walking in the garden  did he go to meet him thank him for that pleasant life pleasant earth for the mere blessing of existence  no  he hid himself among the trees of the garden  but why hide himself  even if he had given up being thankful to god even if he had learned from the devil to believe that god grudged him envied him had deceived him about that fruit why run away and hide  he wanted to be as god wise knowing good and evil for himself  why did he not stand out boldly when he heard the voice of the lord god and say i am wise now i am as a god now knowing good and evil i am no longer to be led like a child and kept strictly by rules which i do not understand i have a right to judge for myself and choose for myself and i have done it and you have no right to complain of me  perhaps adam had intended when he ate the fruit to stand up for himself with some such fine words as children intend when they disobey  but when it came to the point away went all adams selfconfidence all adams pride all adams fine notions of what he had a right to do and he hides himself miserably like a naughty and disobedient child  and then like a mean and cowardly one when he is called out and forced to answer for himself he begins to make pitiful excuses he has not a word to say for himself  he throws the blame on his wife it was all the womans fault nowindeed gods fault  the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat  my dear friends if we want a proof that the bible is a true divine inspired book we need go no further than this one story  for my friends have we never said the same  when we felt that we had done wrong when the voice of god and of christ in our hearts was rebuking us and convincing us of sin have we never tried to shift the blame off our own shoulders and lay it on god himself and the blessings which he has given us on ones wifeon ones familyon moneyon ones youth and health and high spiritsin a word on the good things which god has given us  ah my friends we are indeed adams children and have learned his lesson and inherited his nature only too fearfully well  for what adam did but once we have done a hundred times and the mean excuse which adam made but once we make again and again  but the loving lord has patience with us as he had with adam and does not take us at our word  he did not say to adam you lay the blame upon your wife then i will take her from you and you shall see then where the blame lies  ungrateful to me you shall live henceforth alone  and he does not say to us you make all the blessings which i have given you an excuse for sinning  then i will take them from you and leave you miserable and pour out my wrath upon you to the uttermost  not so  our god is not such a god as that  he is full of compassion and longsuffering and of tender mercy  he knows our frame and remembers that we are but dust  he sends us out into the world as he sent adam to learn experience by hard lessons to eat our bread in the sweat of our brow till we have found out our own weakness and ignorance and have learned that we cannot stand alone that pride and selfdependence will only lead us to guilt and misery and shame and meanness and that there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved from them but only the name of our lord jesus christ  he is the womans seed who so god promised was to bruise the head of the serpent  and he has bruised it  he is the womans seeda man as we are men with a human nature but one without spot of sin to make us free from sin  let us look up to him as often as we find our nature dragging us down making us proud and selfwilled greedy and discontented longing after this and that  let us trust in him ask him for his grace day by day ask him to shape and change us into his likeness that we may become daily more and more free free from sin free from this miserable longing after one thing and another free from our bad habits and the sin which does so easily beset us free from guilty fear and coward dread of god  let us ask him i say to change and purify and renew us day by day till we come to his likeness to the stature of perfect men free men men who are not slaves to their own nature slaves to their own pride slaves to their own vanity slaves of their own bad tempers slaves to their own greediness and foul lusts  but free as the lord christ was free able to keep their bodies in subjection and rise above nature by the eternal grace of god able to use this world without abusing it able to thank god for all the blessings of this life and learn from them precious lessons able to thank god for all the sorrows of this life and learn from them wholesome discipline  but yet able to rise above them all and say as long as i hold fast to christ the king of men this world cannot harm me  my life my real human life does not depend on my being comfortable or uncomfortable here below for a few short years my real life is hid in god with jesus christ who after he had redeemed human nature by his perfect obedience and washed it pure again in the blood of his cross for ever sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high that so being lifted up he might draw all men unto himselfeven as many as will come to him that they may have eternal life    sermon xxxvii  the worthy communicant    luke xviii 14  i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other  which of these two men was the more fit to come to the communion most of you will answer the publican  for he was more justified our lord himself says than the pharisee  true  but would you have said so of your own accord if the lord had not said so  which of the two men do you really think was the better man the pharisee or the publican  which of the two do you think had his soul in the safer state  which of the two would you rather be if you were going to die  which of the two would you rather be if you were going to the communion  for mind one could not have refused the pharisee if he had come to the communion  he was in no open sin  i may say no outward sin at all  you must not fancy that he was a hypocrite in the sense in which we usually employ that word  i mean he was not a man who was leading a wicked life secretly while he kept up a show of religion  he was really a religious man in his own way scrupulous and overscrupulous to perform every duty to the letter he went to his church to worship and he was no lipworshipper repeating a form of words by rote but prayed there honestly concerning the things which were in his heart  he did not say either that he had made himself good  if he was wrong on some points he was not on that  he knew where his goodness such as it was came from  god i thank thee he says that i am what i am what have we in this man one would ask at first sight  what reason for him to stay away from the sacrament  he would not have thought himself that there was any reason  he would probably have thought if i am not fit who is  repent me truly of my former sins certainly  if i have done the least harm to any one i shall be happy to restore it fourfold  if i have neglected one the least of gods services i shall be only too glad to keep it all the more strictly for the future  intend to lead a new life  i am leading one and trying to lead one more and more every day  i shall be thankful to any one who will show me any new service which i can offer to god any new act of reverence any new duty  i must go in love and charity with all men  i do so  i have not a grudge against any human being  of course i know the world too well to be satisfied with it  i cannot shut my eyes to the fact that millions are living very sinful shocking livesextortioners unjust adulterers and that three people out of four are going straight to hell  i pity them and forgive them any wrong which they have done to me  what more can i do  this is what the pharisee would have said  is this man fit to come to the communion  at least he himself thinks so  on the other hand was the publican fit  that is a serious question one which we cannot answer without knowing more about him than our lord has chosen to tell us  many a person is ready enough in these days to cry god be merciful to me a sinner who is fit i fear neither to come to the communion nor to stay away either  it was not so i suppose with the old jews in our lords time  the pharisees then were hard legalists who stood all on works and therefore if a man broke off from them and threw himself on gods grace and mercy he did it in a simple honest effectual way like this publican  but now i am sorry to say our pharisees have contrived to make themselves as proud and selfrighteous about their own faith and repentance as the jewish pharisees did about their own works and observances and there has risen up in england and elsewhere a very ugly new hypocrisy  people nowadays are too apt to pride themselves on their own convictions of sin and their own repentance till they trust in their repentance to save them and not in christ just as the pharisee trusted in his works to save him and not in christ and when they pray i cannot help fearing for i am sure many of their religious books teach them it that they pray very much like that pharisee god i thank thee that i am not as other men are carnal unconverted unconvinced of sin nor even as that plain moral respectable man  i am convinced of sin i am converted i have the right frames and the right feelings and the right experiences  oh of all the cunning snares of the devil that i think is the cunningest  well says the old proverbthe devil is old and therefore he knows many things  in old times he made men trust in their own righteousness  and that was snare enough now he has learnt how to make men actually trust in their own sinfulness and so turn the grace of god into a cloak of pride and contempt of their fellowcreatures  my friends do you think that if the publican after he had said god be merciful to me a sinner had said to himself therehow beautifully i have repentedhow honest i have been to godi am all right nowhe would have gone down to his house justified at all not he  no more will you and i my friends  if we have sinned what should we be but ashamed of it  ay utterly ashamed  and if we really know what sin isif we really see the sinfulness of sinif we really see ourselves as god sees uswe shall be too much shocked at the sight of our own hearts to have time to boast of our being able to see our own hearts  we shall be too full of loathing and hatred for our sins too full of longing to get rid of our sins and to become righteous and holy even as god is righteous and holy to give way to any pride in our own frames and feelings and instead of thinking ourselves better men than our neighbours because we see our sins and fancy they do not see theirs we shall be almost ready to think ourselves worse than our neighbours to think that they cannot have so much to repent of as we and as we grow in grace we shall see more and more sin in ourselves till we actually fancy at times that no one can be as bad as we are and in lowliness of mind esteem others better than ourselves  we may carry that too far too certainly there is no use in accusing ourselves of sins which we have not committed we have all quite enough real sins to answer for without inventing more  but still that is a better frame of mind than the other for no man can be too humble while any man can be too proud  but let us all ask god to open our eyes that we may see ourselves just as we are let our sins be many or few  let us ask god to convince us really of sin by his holy spirit and show us what sin is and its exceeding sinfulness how ugly and foul sin is how foolish and absurd how mean and ungrateful toward that good god who wishes us nothing but good and wishes us therefore to be good because goodness is the only path to life and happiness and then we shall be so ashamed of ourselves so afraid of our own weakness so shocked at the difference between ourselves and the spotless lord jesus that we shall have no time to despise others no time to admire our own frames and feelings and repentances  all we shall think of is our own sinfulness and gods mercy and we shall come eagerly if not boldly to the throne of grace to find grace and mercy to help us in the time of need crying purge thou me o lord or i shall never be pure wash thou me and then alone shall i be clean  for thou requirest not frames or feelings not pride and selfconceit but truth in the inward parts and wilt make me to understand wisdom secretly  then indeed we shall be fit to come to the holy communion for then we shall be so ashamed of ourselves that we shall truly repent of our sinsso ashamed of ourselves that we shall long and determine to lead a new lifeso ashamed of ourselves that we shall have no heart to look down on any of our neighbours or pass hard judgments on them but be in love and charity with all men and so in spite of all our past sins come to partake worthily of the body and blood of him who died for our sins whose blood will wash them out of our hearts whose body will strengthen and refresh us body and soul to a new and everlasting life of humbleness and thankfulness honesty and justice usefulness and love    sermon xxxviii  our deserts    luke vi 3638  be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful  judge not and ye shall not be judged  condemn not and ye shall not be condemned  forgive and ye shall be forgiven  give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom  for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again  one often hears complaints against this world and against mankind one hears it said that people are unjust unfair cruel that in this world no man can expect to get what he deserves  and of course there are great excuses for saying so  there are bad men in the world in plenty who do villanous and cruel things enough and besides there is a great deal of dreadful misery in the world which does not seem to come through any fault of the poor creatures who suffer it misery of which we can only say neither did this man sin nor his parents  but that the glory of god may be made manifest in him  but still our lord tells us in the text that on the whole there is order lying under all the disorder justice under all the injustice right under all the wrong and that on the whole we get what we deserve  be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and ye shall not be judged  condemn not and ye shall not be condemned  forgive and ye shall be forgiven  give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom  for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again  of course as i said just now it is not always so  none knew that better than the blessed lord  else why did he come to seek and save that which was lost  but still the more we look into our own lives the more we shall find our lords words true the more we shall find that on the whole in the long run men will be just and fair to us and give us sooner or later what we deserve  now to deserve a thing properly means to serve for it to work for it and earn it as a natural consequence  if a man puts his hand into the fire he deserves to burn it because it is the nature of fire to burn and therefore it burns him and so he gets his deserts and if a man does wrong he deserves to be unhappy because it is the nature of sin to make the sinner unhappy and so he gets his deserts god has not to go out of his way to punish sin sin punishes itself and so if a man does right he becomes in the long run happy  god has not to go out of his way to reward him and make him happy his own good deeds make him happy he earns happiness in the comfort of a good conscience and the love and respect of those about him and so he gets his deserts  for our lord says people in the long run will treat you as you treat them  if they feel and see by experience that you are loving and kind to them they will be loving and kind to you as you do to them they will in the long run do to you  they may mistake you at first even dislike you at first  did they not mistake hate crucify the lord himself and yet his own rule came true of him  a few crucified him but now all civilized nations worship him as god  be sure then that his rule will come true of you though not at first yet in gods good time  therefore hold still in the lord and abide patiently and he shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light and thy just dealing as the noonday  now this is a very blessed and comfortable thought  would to god that all of us young people especially would lay it to heart  how are we to get comfortably through this life  or if we are to have sorrows as we all must how can we make those sorrows as light as possible  how can we make friends who will comfort us in those sorrows instead of leaving us to bear our burden alone and turning their backs on us just when our poor hearts are longing for a kind look and a kind word from our neighbours  our lord tells us now the same measure that you mete withal it shall be measured to you again  there is his plan  it is a very simple one  it goes on the same principle as he that saveth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life shall save it  if we are selfish and take care only of ourselves the day will come when our neighbours will leave us alone in our selfishness to shift for ourselves  if we set out determining through life to care about other people rather than ourselves then they will care for themselves more than for us and measure their love to us by our measure of love to them  but if we care for others they will learn to care for us if we befriend others they will befriend us  if we show forth the spirit of god to them in kindliness generosity patience selfsacrifice the day will surely come when we shall find that the spirit of god is in our neighbours as well as in ourselves that on the whole they will be just to us and pay us what we have deserved and earned  blessed and comfortable thought that no kind word kind action not even the cup of cold water given in christs name can lose its reward  blessed thought that after all our neighbours are our brothers and that if we remember that steadily and treat them as brothers now they will recollect it too some day and treat us as brothers in return blessed thought that there is in the heart of every man a spark of gods light a grain of gods justice which may grow up in him hereafter and bear good fruit to eternal life  yes it is a pleasant thing to find men better than we fancied them a pleasant thing for first it makes us love them the more and there is nothing so pleasant as loving  and more it does thisit makes us more inclined to trust gods justice  we say to ourselves men are we find really more just and fair than they seem to us at times surely god must be more just and fair than he seems to us at times  for there are times when it does seem a hard thing to believe that god is just times when the devil tempts poor suffering creatures sorely and tries to make them doubt their heavenly father and say with david what am i the better for having done right surely in vain have i cleansed my heart in vain have i washed my hands in innocency  all the day long have i been punished and chastened every morning  yes when some poor woman working in the field with all the cares of a family on her looks up at great people in their carriages she is tempted she must be tempted to say at times why am i to be so much worse off than they  is god just in making me so poor and them so rich  it is a foolish thought  i do believe it is a temptation of the devil a deceit of the devil for rich people are not really one whit happier or lighterhearted than poor ones and all the devil wishes is to make poor people envy their neighbours and mistrust god  but still one cannot wonder at their faith failing them at times  i do not judge them still less condemn them for the text forbids me  or again when some poor creature crippled from his youth looks upon others strong and active cheerful and happy  think of a deformed child watching healthy children at play and then think must it not be hard at times for that child not to repine and cry to god why hast thou made me thus  yes  i will not go on giving fresh instances  the world is but too full of them  but when such thoughts trouble us here is one comfortay here is our only comfortgod must be more just than man  whatsoever appearances may seem to make against it he must be  for where did all the justice in the world come from but from god  who put the feeling of justice into every mans heart but god himself  he is the glorious sun perfectly bright perfectly pure and all the other goodness in the world is but rays and beams of light sent forth from his great light  so we may be certain that god is not only as just as man but millions of times more just more just and righteous and good than all the just men on earth put together  we can believe that  we must believe it  thousands have believed it already thousands of holy sufferers in prisons and on scaffolds in poverty and destitution on sickbeds of lingering torture have believed still that god was just and righteous in all his dealings with them and have cried in the hour of their bitterest agony though thou slay me o lord yet will i trust in thee  yes  god is just  he has revealed that in the person of his son jesus christ  there is gods likeness  there is proof enough that god is not one who afflicts willingly or grieves the children of men out of any neglect or spite or respecteth one person more than another  it may seem hard to be sure of that  unless we believe that jesus is the christ the coequal and coeternal son of the father we never shall be sure of it  believing in the message of the everblessed trinity we shall be sure for we shall be sure that such as the father is such is the son and such is the holy ghostperfect love perfect justice perfect mercy and therefore we can be sure that in the world beyond the grave the balance will be made even again and for ever and every mourner be comforted and every sufferer be refreshed and every one receive his due rewardif they will only now in this life take the lesson of the text judge not and you shall not be judged  condemn not and you shall not be condemned  forgive and you shall be forgiven for if you forgive every one his brother their trespasses in like wise will your heavenly father forgive you  do that and then you will get your deserts in the life to come and by forgiving and helping and blessing others deserve to be forgiven and comforted and blessed yourselves for the sake of that saviour who is day and night presenting all your good works to his father and your father as a precious and fragrant offeringa sacrifice with which the god of love is well pleased because it is like himself made up of love    sermon xxxix  the loftiness of god    isaiah lvii 15  for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones  this is a grand text one of the grandest in the whole old testament one of those the nearest to the spirit of the new  it is full of gospelof good news  but it is not the whole gospel  it does not tell us the whole character of god  we can only get that in the new we can get it there we can get it in that most awful and glorious chapter which we read for the second lessonthe twentyseventh chapter of st matthew  seen in the light of thatseen in the light of christs cross and what it tells us all is clear and all is bright and all is full of good newsat least to those who are humble and contrite crushed down by sorrow and by the feeling of their own infirmities  but what does the text tell us  of a high and lofty one who inhabits eternity  of a lofty god almighty incomprehensible so far above us so different from us that we cannot picture him to ourselves of a glory and majesty utterly beyond all human fancy or imagination  of a holy god in whom is no sin nor taint of sin who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity who is so perfect that he cannot be content with anything which is not as perfect as himself who looks with horror and disgust on evil of every shape who cannot endure it will at last destroy it  of a god who abides in eternitywho cannot changecannot alter his own decrees and laws because his decrees and laws are right and necessary and proceed out of his own character  if he has said a thing that thing must be because it is the thing which ought to be  how then shall we think of this lofty holy unchangeable godwe who are low unholy changing with every wind that blows  shall we say he is so far above us that he cannot feel for us  he is so holy that he must hate us and will our punishment and our damnation for all our sins  he is eternal and cannot change his will and therefore if he wills us to perish perish we must  we may think so of god and dread god and cry whither shall i flee from thy spirit and whither shall i go from thy presence  we may call to the mountains to fall on us and to the hills to cover us till we try to forget at all risks the thought of god  and if we do not there are plenty who will do it for us  the devil who slanders and curses god to men and men to god and to each otherhe will talk to us of god in this way  and men who preach the devils doctrine will talk to us likewise and say yes god is very dreadful and very angry with you  god certainly intends to damn you  but i have a plan for delivering you out of gods hands i know what you must do to be saved from godjoin my sect or party and believe and work with me and then you will escape god  but after all would it not be wiser my friends to hold your own tongues and let god himself speak  if he had not spoken in the first place what should we have known of him  can man by searching find out god  we should not have known that there was a high and lofty one who inhabits eternity if he had not told us  had we not better hear the rest of his message and let god finish his own character of himself  and what does he say  i dwelli the high and lofty one who inhabit eternitywith him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones  oh my friends is not this news good news and unexpected news perhaps but still as true as what went before it  god hath said the one and we believe it  and now he says the other and shall we not believe it too  come then thou humble soul thou crushed and contrite soul thou who fearest that thou art not worthy of gods care thou from whom god has taken so much that thou fearest that he will take allcome and hear the lords message to theegods own message no devils message or mans message but gods own  i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for then the spirit would fail before me and the souls which i have made  i have seen thy ways and will heal thee  i will lead thee also and restore comforts to thee and to thy mourners  i create the fruit of the lips  i give men cause to thank me and delight in giving  peace peace to him that is near and to him that is far off saith the lord  if thou art near me thou art safe for if i were to take all else from thee i should not take myself from thee though thou walkest through the valley of the shadow of death i will be with thee  and if thou art far off from me wandering in folly and sin i cry peace to thee still  why should i wish to be at war with any of my creatures saith the lord  my will is that thou shouldst be at peace  i am at peace myself and i wish to make all my creatures at peace also and thee among the rest  i am whole and perfect myself and i wish to heal all my creatures and make them whole and perfect also and thee among the rest  but the wicked  ay this is their very misery that there is no peace to them  i want them to enter into my peace and they will not  i am at peace with them saith the lord  i owe them no grudge poor wretches  but they will not be at peace with themselves  they are like the troubled sea which casts up mire and dirt and fouls itself  i cast up no mire nor dirt  i foul nothing  i tempt no man  i the good god create no evil  if the troubled sea fouls itself so do the wicked make themselves miserable and punish themselves by their own lusts which war in their members  but they cannot alter me saith the lord they cannot change my temper my character my everlasting name  i am that i am who inhabit eternity and no creature and no creatures sin can make me other than i am  and what is that  what is the name what is the character what is the temper of him who inhabits eternity  look on the cross and see  the cross at least will tell you what kind of a god your god is  a good god a god of love a god of boundless forbearance and long suffering  good god  the folly and madness of mens hearts who look on god dying on the cross for them and begin forthwith puzzling their brains as to how he died for them how christs blood washes away their sins how it is applied and to whom puzzling their brains with theories of the atonement and with predestination and satisfaction and forensic justification and particular redemption and long words which four out of five of them are not in the bible but are spun out of mens own minds as spiders webs are from spidersand like them mostly fit to hamper poor harmless flies  how christs death takes away thy sins thou wilt never know on earthperhaps not in heaven  it is a mystery which thou must believe and adore  but why he died thou canst see at the first glanceif thou hast a human heart and wilt look at what god means thee to look atchrist upon his cross  he died because he was love love itselflove boundless unconquerable unchangeablelove which inhabits eternity and therefore could not be hardened or foiled by any sin or rebellion of man but must love men still must go out to seek and save them must dare suffer any misery shame death itself for their sake just because it is absolute and perfect love which inhabits eternity  look at thatlook at the sight of gods character which the cross gives thee and then instead of being terrified at gods will and decree being unchangeable and eternal it will be the greatest possible comfort to thee that gods will is unchangeable and eternal because thou wilt see from the cross that it is a good willa will of mercy forbearance longsuffering towards thee and all mankind eternal in the heavens as god himself  then let those be afraid who are not afraid and let those who are afraid take heart  let those who think they stand take heed lest they fall  let those who think they see take care that they be not blind  let those be afraid who fancy themselves right and above all mistakes lest they should be full of ugly sins when they fancy themselves most religious and devout  let those be afraid who are fond of advising others lest they should be in more need of their own medicine than their patients are  let those fear who pride themselves on their cunning lest with all their cunning they only lead themselves into their own trap  but those who are afraid let them take heart  for what says the high and holy one who inhabits eternity  i dwell with him that is of a humble and contrite heart to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones  let them take heart  do you feel that you have lost your way in life  then god himself will show you your way  are you utterly helpless worn out body and soul  then gods eternal love is ready and willing to help you up and revive you  are you wearied with doubts and terrors  then gods eternal light is ready to show you your way gods eternal peace ready to give you peace  do you feel yourself full of sins and faults  then take heart for gods unchangeable will is to take away those sins and purge you from those faults  are you tormented as job was over and above all your sorrows by mistaken kindness and comforters in whom is no comfort who break the bruised reed and quench the smoking flax who tell you that you must be wicked and god must be angry with you or all this would not have come upon you  jobs comforters did so and spoke very righteoussounding words and took great pains to justify god and to break poor jobs heart and made him say many wild and foolish words in answer for which he was sorry afterwards but after all the lords answer was my wrath is kindled against you three for you have not spoken of me the thing which was right as my servant job hath  therefore my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept as he will accept every humble and contrite soul who clings amid all its doubts and fears and sorrows to the faith that god is just and not unjust merciful and not cruel condescending and not proudthat his will is a good will and not a bad willthat he hateth nothing that he hath made and willeth the death of no man and in that faith casts itself down like job in dust and ashes before the majesty of god content not to understand his ways and its own sorrows but simply submitting itself and resigning itself to the good will of that god who so loved the world that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for us    footnotes  75  compare rom iii 23 with i cor xi 7  let me entreat all young
