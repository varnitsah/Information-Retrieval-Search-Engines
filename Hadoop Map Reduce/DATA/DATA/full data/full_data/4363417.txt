4363417	eves diary   by mark twain   illustrated by lester ralph     translated from the original    saturdayi am almost a whole day old now  i arrived yesterday that is as it seems to me  and it must be so for if there was a daybeforeyesterday i was not there when it happened or i should remember it  it could be of course that it did happen and that i was not noticing very well i will be very watchful now and if any daybeforeyesterdays happen i will make a note of it it will be best to start right and not let the record get confused for some instinct tells me that these details are going to be important to the historian some day  for i feel like an experiment i feel exactly like an experiment it would be impossible for a person to feel more like an experiment than i do and so i am coming to feel convinced that that is what i aman experiment just an experiment and nothing more  then if i am an experiment am i the whole of it  no i think not i think the rest of it is part of it  i am the main part of it but i think the rest of it has its share in the matter  is my position assured or do i have to watch it and take care of it the latter perhaps  some instinct tells me that eternal vigilance is the price of supremacy  that is a good phrase i think for one so young  everything looks better today than it did yesterday  in the rush of finishing up yesterday the mountains were left in a ragged condition and some of the plains were so cluttered with rubbish and remnants that the aspects were quite distressing  noble and beautiful works of art should not be subjected to haste and this majestic new world is indeed a most noble and beautiful work  and certainly marvelously near to being perfect notwithstanding the shortness of the time there are too many stars in some places and not enough in others but that can be remedied presently no doubt  the moon got loose last night and slid down and fell out of the schemea very great loss it breaks my heart to think of it  there isnt another thing among the ornaments and decorations that is comparable to it for beauty and finish  it should have been fastened better if we can only get it back again  but of course there is no telling where it went to  and besides whoever gets it will hide it i know it because i would do it myself i believe i can be honest in all other matters but i already begin to realize that the core and center of my nature is love of the beautiful a passion for the beautiful and that it would not be safe to trust me with a moon that belonged to another person and that person didnt know i had it  i could give up a moon that i found in the daytime because i should be afraid some one was looking but if i found it in the dark i am sure i should find some kind of an excuse for not saying anything about it  for i do love moons they are so pretty and so romantic  i wish we had five or six i would never go to bed i should never get tired lying on the mossbank and looking up at them  stars are good too  i wish i could get some to put in my hair but i suppose i never can  you would be surprised to find how far off they are for they do not look it  when they first showed last night i tried to knock some down with a pole but it didnt reach which astonished me then i tried clods till i was all tired out but i never got one  it was because i am lefthanded and cannot throw good  even when i aimed at the one i wasnt after i couldnt hit the other one though i did make some close shots for i saw the black blot of the clod sail right into the midst of the golden clusters forty or fifty times just barely missing them and if i could have held out a little longer maybe i could have got one  so i cried a little which was natural i suppose for one of my age and after i was rested i got a basket and started for a place on the extreme rim of the circle where the stars were close to the ground and i could get them with my hands which would be better anyway because i could gather them tenderly then and not break them but it was farther than i thought and at last i had to give it up i was so tired i couldnt drag my feet another step and besides they were sore and hurt me very much  i couldnt get back home it was too far and turning cold but i found some tigers and nestled in among them and was most adorably comfortable and their breath was sweet and pleasant because they live on strawberries  i had never seen a tiger before but i knew them in a minute by the stripes  if i could have one of those skins it would make a lovely gown  today i am getting better ideas about distances  i was so eager to get hold of every pretty thing that i giddily grabbed for it sometimes when it was too far off and sometimes when it was but six inches away but seemed a footalas with thorns between i learned a lesson also i made an axiom all out of my own headmy very first one the scratched experiment shuns the thorn i think it is a very good one for one so young  i followed the other experiment around yesterday afternoon at a distance to see what it might be for if i could  but i was not able to make it out  i think it is a man  i had never seen a man but it looked like one and i feel sure that that is what it is i realize that i feel more curiosity about it than about any of the other reptiles  if it is a reptile and i suppose it is for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes and looks like a reptile it has no hips it tapers like a carrot when it stands it spreads itself apart like a derrick so i think it is a reptile though it may be architecture  i was afraid of it at first and started to run every time it turned around for i thought it was going to chase me but by and by i found it was only trying to get away so after that i was not timid any more but tracked it along several hours about twenty yards behind which made it nervous and unhappy at last it was a good deal worried and climbed a tree  i waited a good while then gave it up and went home  today the same thing over  ive got it up the tree again    sundayit is up there yet  resting apparently  but that is a subterfuge  sunday isnt the day of rest saturday is appointed for that  it looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting than in anything else  it would tire me to rest so much it tires me just to sit around and watch the tree  i do wonder what it is for i never see it do anything  they returned the moon last night and i was so happy  i think it is very honest of them  it slid down and fell off again but i was not distressed there is no need to worry when one has that kind of neighbors they will fetch it back  i wish i could do something to show my appreciation  i would like to send them some stars for we have more than we can use  i mean i not we for i can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things  it has low tastes and is not kind  when i went there yesterday evening in the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little speckled fishes that play in the pool and i had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone i wonder if that is what it is for  hasnt it any heart hasnt it any compassion for those little creature  can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work it has the look of it  one of the clods took it back of the ear and it used language  it gave me a thrill for it was the first time i had ever heard speech except my own  i did not understand the words but they seemed expressive  when i found it could talk i felt a new interest in it for i love to talk i talk all day and in my sleep too and i am very interesting but if i had another to talk to i could be twice as interesting and would never stop if desired  if this reptile is a man it isnt an it is it  that wouldnt be grammatical would it  i think it would be he  i think so in that case one would parse it thus  nominative he dative him possessive hisn well i will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out to be something else  this will be handier than having so many uncertainties    next week sundayall the week i tagged around after him and tried to get acquainted  i had to do the talking because he was shy but i didnt mind it  he seemed pleased to have me around and i used the sociable we a good deal because it seemed to flatter him to be included    wednesdaywe are getting along very well indeed now and getting better and better acquainted  he does not try to avoid me any more which is a good sign and shows that he likes to have me with him that pleases me and i study to be useful to him in every way i can so as to increase his regard  during the last day or two i have taken all the work of naming things off his hands and this has been a great relief to him for he has no gift in that line and is evidently very grateful  he cant think of a rational name to save him but i do not let him see that i am aware of his defect whenever a new creature comes along i name it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence  in this way i have saved him many embarrassments  i have no defect like this the minute i set eyes on an animal i know what it is  i dont have to reflect a moment the right name comes out instantly just as if it were an inspiration as no doubt it is for i am sure it wasnt in me half a minute before i seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts what animal it is  when the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcati saw it in his eye  but i saved him  and i was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt his pride  i just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleasing surprise and not as if i was dreaming of conveying information and said well i do declare if there isnt the dodo  i explainedwithout seeming to be explaininghow i know it for a dodo and although i thought maybe he was a little piqued that i knew the creature when he didnt it was quite evident that he admired me  that was very agreeable and i thought of it more than once with gratification before i slept how little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it    thursdaymy first sorrow  yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish i would not talk to him  i could not believe it and thought there was some mistake for i loved to be with him and loved to hear him talk and so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when i had not done anything  but at last it seemed true so i went away and sat lonely in the place where i first saw him the morning that we were made and i did not know what he was and was indifferent about him but now it was a mournful place and every little thing spoke of him and my heart was very sore i did not know why very clearly for it was a new feeling i had not experienced it before and it was all a mystery and i could not make it out  but when night came i could not bear the lonesomeness and went to the new shelter which he has built to ask him what i had done that was wrong and how i could mend it and get back his kindness again but he put me out in the rain and it was my first sorrow    sundayit is pleasant again now and i am happy but those were heavy days i do not think of them when i can help it  i tried to get him some of those apples but i cannot learn to throw straight  i failed but i think the good intention pleased him they are forbidden and he says i shall come to harm but so i come to harm through pleasing him why shall i care for that harm    mondaythis morning i told him my name hoping it would interest him but he did not care for it  it is strange  if he should tell me his name i would care  i think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any other sound  he talks very little  perhaps it is because he is not bright and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it  it is such a pity that he should feel so for brightness is nothing it is in the heart that the values lie  i wish i could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches and riches enough and that without it intellect is poverty  although he talks so little he has quite a considerable vocabulary this morning he used a surprisingly good word he evidently recognized himself that it was a good one for he worked in in twice afterward casually  it was good casual art still it showed that he possesses a certain quality of perception without a doubt that seed can be made to grow if cultivated  where did he get that word  i do not think i have ever used it  no he took no interest in my name  i tried to hide my disappointment but i suppose i did not succeed  i went away and sat on the mossbank with my feet in the water  it is where i go when i hunger for companionship some one to look at some one to talk to it is not enoughthat lovely white body painted there in the poolbut it is something and something is better than utter loneliness it talks when i talk it is sad when i am sad it comforts me with its sympathy it says do not be downhearted you poor friendless girl i will be your friend  it is a good friend to me and my only one it is my sister  that first time that she forsook me ah i shall never forget that never never  my heart was lead in my body  i said she was all i had and now she is gone  in my despair i said break my heart i cannot bear my life any more and hid my face in my hands and there was no solace for me  and when i took them away after a little there she was again white and shining and beautiful and i sprang into her arms  that was perfect happiness i had known happiness before but it was not like this which was ecstasy  i never doubted her afterward sometimes she stayed awaymaybe an hour maybe almost the whole day but i waited and did not doubt i said she is busy or she is gone on a journey but she will come  and it was so she always did  at night she would not come if it was dark for she was a timid little thing but if there was a moon she would come i am not afraid of the dark but she is younger than i am she was born after i was  many and many are the visits i have paid her she is my comfort and my refuge when my life is hardand it is mainly that    tuesdayall the morning i was at work improving the estate and i purposely kept away from him in the hope that he would get lonely and come  but he did not  at noon i stopped for the day and took my recreation by flitting all about with the bees and the butterflies and reveling in the flowers those beautiful creatures that catch the smile of god out of the sky and preserve it  i gathered them and made them into wreaths and garlands and clothed myself in them while i ate my luncheonapples of course then i sat in the shade and wished and waited but he did not come  but no matter  nothing would have come of it for he does not care for flowers  he called them rubbish and cannot tell one from another and thinks it is superior to feel like that  he does not care for me he does not care for flowers he does not care for the painted sky at eventideis there anything he does care for except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain and thumping the melons and sampling the grapes and fingering the fruit on the trees to see how those properties are coming along  i laid a dry stick on the ground and tried to bore a hole in it with another one in order to carry out a scheme that i had and soon i got an awful fright  a thin transparent bluish film rose out of the hole and i dropped everything and ran  i thought it was a spirit and i was so frightened  but i looked back and it was not coming so i leaned against a rock and rested and panted and let my limbs go on trembling until they got steady again then i crept warily back alert watching and ready to fly if there was occasion and when i was come near i parted the branches of a rosebush and peeped throughwishing the man was about i was looking so cunning and prettybut the sprite was gone i went there and there was a pinch of delicate pink dust in the hole i put my finger in to feel it and said ouch and took it out again  it was a cruel pain  i put my finger in my mouth and by standing first on one foot and then the other and grunting i presently eased my misery then i was full of interest and began to examine  i was curious to know what the pink dust was  suddenly the name of it occurred to me though i had never heard of it before  it was fire i was as certain of it as a person could be of anything in the world so without hesitation i named it thatfire  i had created something that didnt exist before i had added a new thing to the worlds uncountable properties i realized this and was proud of my achievement and was going to run and find him and tell him about it thinking to raise myself in his esteembut i reflected and did not do it  nohe would not care for it he would ask what it was good for and what could i answer for if it was not good for something but only beautiful merely beautiful  so i sighed and did not go  for it wasnt good for anything it could not build a shack it could not improve melons it could not hurry a fruit crop it was useless it was a foolishness and a vanity he would despise it and say cutting words but to me it was not despicable i said oh you fire i love you you dainty pink creature for you are beautifuland that is enough and was going to gather it to my breast but refrained then i made another maxim out of my head though it was so nearly like the first one that i was afraid it was only a plagiarism the burnt experiment shuns the fire  i wrought again and when i had made a good deal of firedust i emptied it into a handful of dry brown grass intending to carry it home and keep it always and play with it but the wind struck it and it sprayed up and spat out at me fiercely and i dropped it and ran when i looked back the blue spirit was towering up and stretching and rolling away like a cloud and instantly i thought of the name of itsmokethough upon my word i had never heard of smoke before  soon brilliant yellow and red flares shot up through the smoke and i named them in an instantflamesand i was right too though these were the very first flames that had ever been in the world  they climbed the trees then flashed splendidly in and out of the vast and increasing volume of tumbling smoke and i had to clap my hands and laugh and dance in my rapture it was so new and strange and so wonderful and so beautiful  he came running and stopped and gazed and said not a word for many minutes  then he asked what it was  ah it was too bad that he should ask such a direct question  i had to answer it of course and i did i said it was fire  if it annoyed him that i should know and he must ask that was not my fault i had no desire to annoy him after a pause he asked  how did it come  another direct question and it also had to have a direct answer  i made it  the fire was traveling farther and farther off  he went to the edge of the burned place and stood looking down and said  what are these  firecoals  he picked up one to examine it but changed his mind and put it down again  then he went away  nothing interests him  but i was interested  there were ashes gray and soft and delicate and prettyi knew what they were at once  and the embers i knew the embers too  i found my apples and raked them out and was glad for i am very young and my appetite is active but i was disappointed they were all burst open and spoiled spoiled apparently but it was not so they were better than raw ones fire is beautiful some day it will be useful i think    fridayi saw him again for a moment last monday at nightfall but only for a moment  i was hoping he would praise me for trying to improve the estate for i had meant well and had worked hard but he was not pleased and turned away and left me  he was also displeased on another account  i tried once more to persuade him to stop going over the falls  that was because the fire had revealed to me a new passion quite new and distinctly different from love grief and those others which i had already discoveredfear  and it is horriblei wish i had never discovered it it gives me dark moments it spoils my happiness it makes me shiver and tremble and shudder but i could not persuade him for he has not discovered fear yet and so he could not understand me                        extract from adams diary   perhaps i ought to remember that she is very young a mere girl and make allowances  she is all interest eagerness vivacity the world is to her a charm a wonder a mystery a joy she cant speak for delight when she finds a new flower she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk to it and pour out endearing names upon it and she is colormad brown rocks yellow sand gray moss green foliage blue sky the pearl of the dawn the purple shadows on the mountains the golden islands floating in crimson seas at sunset the pallid moon sailing through the shredded cloudrack the starjewels glittering in the wastes of spacenone of them is of any practical value so far as i can see but because they have color and majesty that is enough for her and she loses her mind over them if she could quiet down and keep still a couple minutes at a time it would be a reposeful spectacle  in that case i think i could enjoy looking at her indeed i am sure i could for i am coming to realize that she is a quite remarkably comely creature lithe slender trim rounded shapely nimble graceful and once when she was standing marblewhite and sundrenched on a boulder with her young head tilted back and her hand shading her eyes watching the flight of a bird in the sky i recognized that she was beautiful    monday noonif there is anything on the planet that she is not interested in it is not in my list  there are animals that i am indifferent to but it is not so with her  she has no discrimination she takes to all of them she thinks they are all treasures every new one is welcome  when the mighty brontosaurus came striding into camp she regarded it as an acquisition i considered it a calamity that is a good sample of the lack of harmony that prevails in our views of things she wanted to domesticate it i wanted to make it a present of the homestead and move out  she believed it could be tamed by kind treatment and would be a good pet i said a pet twentyone feet high and eightyfour feet long would be no proper thing to have about the place because even with the best intentions and without meaning any harm it could sit down on the house and mash it for any one could see by the look of its eye that it was absentminded  still her heart was set upon having that monster and she couldnt give it up  she thought we could start a dairy with it and wanted me to help milk it but i wouldnt it was too risky the sex wasnt right and we hadnt any ladder anyway  then she wanted to ride it and look at the scenery  thirty or forty feet of its tail was lying on the ground like a fallen tree and she thought she could climb it but she was mistaken when she got to the steep place it was too slick and down she came and would have hurt herself but for me  was she satisfied now  no nothing ever satisfies her but demonstration untested theories are not in her line and she wont have them it is the right spirit i concede it it attracts me i feel the influence of it if i were with her more i think i should take it up myself  well she had one theory remaining about this colossus she thought that if we could tame it and make him friendly we could stand in the river and use him for a bridge  it turned out that he was already plenty tame enoughat least as far as she was concernedso she tried her theory but it failed  every time she got him properly placed in the river and went ashore to cross over him he came out and followed her around like a pet mountain  like the other animals  they all do that    tuesdaywednesdaythursdayand today  all without seeing him  it is a long time to be alone still it is better to be alone than unwelcome    fridayi had to have companyi was made for it i thinkso i made friends with the animals  they are just charming and they have the kindest disposition and the politest ways they never look sour they never let you feel that you are intruding they smile at you and wag their tail if theyve got one and they are always ready for a romp or an excursion or anything you want to propose i think they are perfect gentlemen  all these days we have had such good times and it hasnt been lonesome for me ever  lonesome  no i should say not  why theres always a swarm of them aroundsometimes as much as four or five acresyou cant count them and when you stand on a rock in the midst and look out over the furry expanse it is so mottled and splashed and gay with color and frisking sheen and sunflash and so rippled with stripes that you might think it was a lake only you know it isnt and theres storms of sociable birds and hurricanes of whirring wings and when the sun strikes all that feathery commotion you have a blazing up of all the colors you can think of enough to put your eyes out  we have made long excursions and i have seen a great deal of the world almost all of it i think and so i am the first traveler and the only one  when we are on the march it is an imposing sighttheres nothing like it anywhere  for comfort i ride a tiger or a leopard because it is soft and has a round back that fits me and because they are such pretty animals but for long distance or for scenery i ride the elephant  he hoists me up with his trunk but i can get off myself when we are ready to camp he sits and i slide down the back way  the birds and animals are all friendly to each other and there are no disputes about anything  they all talk and they all talk to me but it must be a foreign language for i cannot make out a word they say yet they often understand me when i talk back particularly the dog and the elephant  it makes me ashamed it shows that they are brighter than i am for i want to be the principal experiment myselfand i intend to be too  i have learned a number of things and am educated now but i wasnt at first  i was ignorant at first  at first it used to vex me because with all my watching i was never smart enough to be around when the water was running uphill but now i do not mind it i have experimented and experimented until now i know it never does run uphill except in the dark  i know it does in the dark because the pool never goes dry which it would of course if the water didnt come back in the night it is best to prove things by actual experiment then you know whereas if you depend on guessing and supposing and conjecturing you never get educated  some things you cant find out but you will never know you cant by guessing and supposing  no you have to be patient and go on experimenting until you find out that you cant find out  and it is delightful to have it that way it makes the world so interesting if there wasnt anything to find out it would be dull  even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out and i dont know but more so the secret of the water was a treasure until i got it then the excitement all went away and i recognized a sense of loss  by experiment i know that wood swims and dry leaves and feathers and plenty of other things therefore by all that cumulative evidence you know that a rock will swim but you have to put up with simply knowing it for there isnt any way to prove itup to now but i shall find a waythen that excitement will go  such things make me sad because by and by when i have found out everything there wont be any more excitements and i do love excitements so the other night i couldnt sleep for thinking about it  at first i couldnt make out what i was made for but now i think it was to search out the secrets of this wonderful world and be happy and thank the giver of it all for devising it  i think there are many things to learn yeti hope so and by economizing and not hurrying too fast i think they will last weeks and weeks  i hope so  when you cast up a feather it sails away on the air and goes out of sight then you throw up a clod and it doesnt it comes down every time i have tried it and tried it and it is always so  i wonder why it is  of course it doesnt come down but why should it seem to i suppose it is an optical illusion  i mean one of them is i dont know which one  it may be the feather it may be the clod i cant prove which it is i can only demonstrate that one or the other is a fake and let a person take his choice  by watching i know that the stars are not going to last i have seen some of the best ones melt and run down the sky since one can melt they can all melt since they can all melt they can all melt the same night  that sorrow will comei know it i mean to sit up every night and look at them as long as i can keep awake and i will impress those sparkling fields on my memory so that by and by when they are taken away i can by my fancy restore those lovely myriads to the black sky and make them sparkle again and double them by the blur of my tears    after the fall  when i look back the garden is a dream to me  it was beautiful surpassingly beautiful enchantingly beautiful and now it is lost and i shall not see it any more  the garden is lost but i have found him and am content he loves me as well as he can i love him with all the strength of my passionate nature and this i think is proper to my youth and sex  if i ask myself why i love him i find i do not know and do not really much care to know so i suppose that this kind of love is not a product of reasoning and statistics like ones love for other reptiles and animals  i think that this must be so i love certain birds because of their song but i do not love adam on account of his singingno it is not that the more he sings the more i do not get reconciled to it  yet i ask him to sing because i wish to learn to like everything he is interested in i am sure i can learn because at first i could not stand it but now i can  it sours the milk but it doesnt matter i can get used to that kind of milk  it is not on account of his brightness that i love himno it is not that  he is not to blame for his brightness such as it is for he did not make it himself he is as god make him and that is sufficient there was a wise purpose in it that i know in time it will develop though i think it will not be sudden and besides there is no hurry he is well enough just as he is  it is not on account of his gracious and considerate ways and his delicacy that i love him  no he has lacks in this regard but he is well enough just so and is improving  it is not on account of his industry that i love himno it is not that  i think he has it in him and i do not know why he conceals it from me  it is my only pain  otherwise he is frank and open with me now  i am sure he keeps nothing from me but this it grieves me that he should have a secret from me and sometimes it spoils my sleep thinking of it but i will put it out of my mind it shall not trouble my happiness which is otherwise full to overflowing  it is not on account of his education that i love himno it is not that  he is selfeducated and does really know a multitude of things but they are not so  it is not on account of his chivalry that i love himno it is not that he told on me but i do not blame him it is a peculiarity of sex i think and he did not make his sex  of course i would not have told on him i would have perished first but that is a peculiarity of sex too and i do not take credit for it for i did not make my sex  then why is it that i love him  merely because he is masculine i think  at bottom he is good and i love him for that but i could love him without it  if he should beat me and abuse me i should go on loving him  i know it  it is a matter of sex i think  he is strong and handsome and i love him for that and i admire him and am proud of him but i could love him without those qualities if he were plain i should love him if he were a wreck i should love him and i would work for him and slave over him and pray for him and watch by his bedside until i died  yes i think i love him merely because he is mine and is masculine there is no other reason i suppose  and so i think it is as i first said  that this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and statistics  it just comesnone knows whenceand cannot explain itself  and doesnt need to  it is what i think  but i am only a girl the first that has examined this matter and it may turn out that in my ignorance and inexperience i have not got it right    forty years later  it is my prayer it is my longing that we may pass from this life togethera longing which shall never perish from the earth but shall have place in the heart of every wife that loves until the end of time and it shall be called by my name  but if one of us must go first it is my prayer that it shall be i for he is strong i am weak i am not so necessary to him as he is to me life without him would not be life how could i endure it this prayer is also immortal and will not cease from being offered up while my race continues  i am the first wife and in the last wife i shall be repeated    at eves grave  adam  wheresoever she was there was eden
