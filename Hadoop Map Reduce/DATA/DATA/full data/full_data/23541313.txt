literary civilservice examination in order that they might be grouped together as a representative class of the authors bestknown work in this line  several of these stories have points of peculiar interest to the author for instance negative gravity was composed in switzerland when the author was temporarily confined to the house in full view of unreachable alps  his wifes deceased sister was suggested by an editorial disposition to compare all the authors work with one previous production and to discard everything which did not accord exactly with the particular story which had been selected as a standard of merit  the lady or the tiger was printed in the hope that the author might receive the cheerful coöperation of some of his readers in a satisfactory solution of the problem contained in the little story but although he has had much valuable assistance in this direction he has also been the recipient of a great deal of scolding  after reading several stories by clark russell the authors mind was led to consider the possibility of inventing some sort of shipwreck which had never yet been made the subject of a story his efforts in this line resulted in the remarkable wreck of the thomas hyke  a piece of red calico is a description with exaggerated points of an actual experience     contents     a tale of negative gravity     from the christmas wreck    asaph     from the watchmakers wife    his wifes deceased sister     from the lady or the tiger    the lady or the tiger    the remarkable wreck of the thomas hyke     from the christmas wreck    old

  from the lady or the tiger     a tale of negative gravity   my wife and i were staying at a small town in northern italy and on a certain pleasant afternoon in spring we had taken a walk of six or seven miles to see the sun set behind some low mountains to the west of the town most of our walk had been along a hard smooth highway and then we turned into a series of narrower roads sometimes bordered by walls and sometimes by light fences of reed or cane nearing the mountain to a low spur of which we intended to ascend we easily scaled a wall about four feet high and found ourselves upon pastureland which led sometimes by gradual ascents and sometimes by bits of rough climbing to the spot we wished to reach we were afraid we were a little late and therefore hurried on running up the grassy hills and bounding briskly over the rough and rocky places i carried a knapsack strapped firmly to my shoulders and under my wifes arm was a large soft basket of a kind much used by tourists her arm was passed through the handles and around the bottom of the basket which she pressed closely to her side this was the way she always carried it the basket contained two bottles of wine one sweet for my wife and another a little acid for myself sweet wines give me a headache  when we reached the grassy bluff well known thereabouts to lovers of sunset views i stepped immediately to the edge to gaze upon the scene but my wife sat down to take a sip of wine for she was very thirsty and then leaving her basket she came to my side the scene was indeed one of great beauty beneath us stretched a wide valley of many shades of green with a little river running through it and redtiled houses here and there beyond rose a range of mountains pink pale green and purple where their tips caught the reflection of the setting sun and of a rich graygreen in shadows beyond all was the blue italian sky illumined by an especially fine sunset  my wife and i are americans and at the time of this story were middleaged people and very fond of seeing in each others company whatever there was of interest or beauty around us we had a son about twentytwo years old of whom we were also very fond but he was not with us being at that time a student in germany although we had good health we were not very robust people and under ordinary circumstances not much given to long country tramps i was of medium size without much muscular development while my wife was quite stout and growing stouter  the reader may perhaps be somewhat surprised that a middleaged couple not very strong or very good walkers the lady loaded with a basket containing two bottles of wine and a metal drinkingcup and the gentleman carrying a heavy knapsack filled with all sorts of odds and ends strapped to his shoulders should set off on a sevenmile walk jump over a wall run up a hillside and yet feel in very good trim to enjoy a sunset view this peculiar state of things i will proceed to explain  i had been a professional man but some years before had retired upon a very comfortable income i had always been very fond of scientific pursuits and now made these the occupation and pleasure of much of my leisure time our home was in a small town and in a corner of my grounds i built a laboratory where i carried on my work and my experiments i had long been anxious to discover the means not only of producing but of retaining and controlling a natural force really the same as centrifugal force but which i called negative gravity this name i adopted because it indicated better than any other the action of the force in question as i produced it positive gravity attracts everything toward the centre of the earth negative gravity therefore would be that power which repels everything from the centre of the earth just as the negative pole of a magnet repels the needle while the positive pole attracts it my object was in fact to store centrifugal force and to render it constant controllable and available for use the advantages of such a discovery could scarcely be described in a word it would lighten the burdens of the world  i will not touch upon the labors and disappointments of several years it is enough to say that at last i discovered a method of producing storing and controlling negative gravity  the mechanism of my invention was rather complicated but the method of operating it was very simple a strong metallic case about eight inches long and half as wide contained the machinery for producing the force and this was put into action by means of the pressure of a screw worked from the outside as soon as this pressure was produced negative gravity began to be evolved and stored and the greater the pressure the greater the force as the screw was moved outward and the pressure diminished the force decreased and when the screw was withdrawn to its fullest extent the action of negative gravity entirely ceased thus this force could be produced or dissipated at will to such degrees as might be desired and its action so long as the requisite pressure was maintained was constant  when this little apparatus worked to my satisfaction i called my wife into my laboratory and explained to her my invention and its value she had known that i had been at work with an important object but i had never told her what it was i had said that if i succeeded i would tell her all but if i failed she need not be troubled with the matter at all being a very sensible woman this satisfied her perfectly now i explained everything to herthe construction of the machine and the wonderful uses to which this invention could be applied i told her that it could diminish or entirely dissipate the weight of objects of any kind a heavily loaded wagon with two of these instruments fastened to its sides and each screwed to a proper force would be so lifted and supported that it would press upon the ground as lightly as an empty cart and a small horse could draw it with ease a bale of cotton with one of these machines attached could be handled and carried by a boy a car with a number of these machines could be made to rise in the air like a balloon everything in fact that was heavy could be made light and as a great part of labor all over the world is caused by the attraction of gravitation so this repellent force wherever applied would make weight less and work easier i told her of many many ways in which the invention might be used and would have told her of many more if she had not suddenly burst into tears  the world has gained something wonderful she exclaimed between her sobs but i have lost a husband  what do you mean by that i asked in surprise  i havent minded it so far she said because it gave you something to do and it pleased you and it never interfered with our home pleasures and our home life but now that is all over you will never be your own master again it will succeed i am sure and you may make a great deal of money but we dont need money what we need is the happiness which we have always had until now now there will be companies and patents and lawsuits and experiments and people calling you a humbug and other people saying they discovered it long ago and all sorts of persons coming to see you and youll be obliged to go to all sorts of places and you will be an altered man and we shall never be happy again millions of money will not repay us for the happiness we have lost  these words of my wife struck me with much force before i had called her my mind had begun to be filled and perplexed with ideas of what i ought to do now that the great invention was perfected until now the matter had not troubled me at all sometimes i had gone backward and sometimes forward but on the whole i had always felt encouraged i had taken great pleasure in the work but i had never allowed myself to be too much absorbed by it but now everything was different i began to feel that it was due to myself and to my fellowbeings that i should properly put this invention before the world and how should i set about it what steps should i take i must make no mistakes when the matter should become known hundreds of scientific people might set themselves to work how could i tell but that they might discover other methods of producing the same effect i must guard myself against a great many things i must get patents in all parts of the world already as i have said my mind began to be troubled and perplexed with these things a turmoil of this sort did not suit my age or disposition i could not but agree with my wife that the joys of a quiet and contented life were now about to be broken into  my dear said i i believe with you that the thing will do us more harm than good if it were not for depriving the world of the invention i would throw the whole thing to the winds and yet i added regretfully i had expected a great deal of personal gratification from the use of this invention  now listen said my wife eagerly dont you think it would be best to do this use the thing as much as you please for your own amusement and satisfaction but let the world wait it has waited a long time and let it wait a little longer when we are dead let herbert have the invention he will then be old enough to judge for himself whether it will be better to take advantage of it for his own profit or simply to give it to the public for nothing it would be cheating him if we were to do the latter but it would also be doing him a great wrong if we were at his age to load him with such a heavy responsibility besides if he took it up you could not help going into it too  i took my wifes advice i wrote a careful and complete account of the invention and sealing it up i gave it to my lawyers to be handed to my son after my death if he died first i would make other arrangements then i determined to get all the good and fun out of the thing that was possible without telling any one anything about it even herbert who was away from home was not to be told of the invention  the first thing i did was to buy a strong leathern knapsack and inside of this i fastened my little machine with a screw so arranged that it could be worked from the outside strapping this firmly to my shoulders my wife gently turned the screw at the back until the upward tendency of the knapsack began to lift and sustain me when i felt myself so gently supported and upheld that i seemed to weigh about thirty or forty pounds i would set out for a walk the knapsack did not raise me from the ground but it gave me a very buoyant step it was no labor at all to walk it was a delight an ecstasy with the strength of a man and the weight of a child i gayly strode along the first day i walked half a dozen miles at a very brisk pace and came back without feeling in the least degree tired these walks now became one of the greatest joys of my life when nobody was looking i would bound over a fence sometimes just touching it with one hand and sometimes not touching it at all i delighted in rough places i sprang over streams i jumped and i ran i felt like mercury himself  i now set about making another machine so that my wife could accompany me in my walks but when it was finished she positively refused to use it i cant wear a knapsack she said and there is no other good way of fastening it to me besides everybody about here knows i am no walker and it would only set them talking  i occasionally made use of this second machine but i will give only one instance of its application some repairs were needed to the foundationwalls of my barn and a twohorse wagon loaded with buildingstone had been brought into my yard and left there in the evening when the men had gone away i took my two machines and fastened them with strong chains one on each side of the loaded wagon then gradually turning the screws the wagon was so lifted that its weight became very greatly diminished we had an old donkey which used to belong to herbert and which was now occasionally used with a small cart to bring packages from the station i went into the barn and put the harness on the little fellow and bringing him out to the wagon i attached him to it in this position he looked very funny with a long pole sticking out in front of him and the great wagon behind him when all was ready i touched him up and to my great delight he moved off with the twohorse load of stone as easily as if he were drawing his own cart i led him out into the public road along which he proceeded without difficulty he was an opinionated little beast and sometimes stopped not liking the peculiar manner in which he was harnessed but a touch of the switch made him move on and i soon turned him and brought the wagon back into the yard this determined the success of my invention in one of its most important uses and with a satisfied heart i put the donkey into the stable and went into the house  our trip to europe was made a few months after this and was mainly on our son herberts account he poor fellow was in great trouble and so therefore were we he had become engaged with our full consent to a young lady in our town the daughter of a gentleman whom we esteemed very highly herbert was young to be engaged to be married but as we felt that he would never find a girl to make him so good a wife we were entirely satisfied especially as it was agreed on all hands that the marriage was not to take place for some time it seemed to us that in marrying janet gilbert herbert would secure for himself in the very beginning of his career the most important element of a happy life but suddenly without any reason that seemed to us justifiable mr gilbert the only surviving parent of janet broke off the match and he and his daughter soon after left the town for a trip to the west  this blow nearly broke poor herberts heart he gave up his professional studies and came home to us and for a time we thought he would be seriously ill then we took him to europe and after a continental tour of a month or two we left him at his own request in göttingen where he thought it would do him good to go to work again then we went down to the little town in italy where my story first finds us my wife had suffered much in mind and body on her sons account and for this reason i was anxious that she should take outdoor exercise and enjoy as much as possible the bracing air of the country i had brought with me both my little machines one was still in my knapsack and the other i had fastened to the inside of an enormous family trunk as one is obliged to pay for nearly every pound of his baggage on the continent this saved me a great deal of money everything heavy was packed into this great trunkbooks papers the bronze iron and marble relics we had picked up and all the articles that usually weigh down a tourists baggage i screwed up the negativegravity apparatus until the trunk could be handled with great ease by an ordinary porter i could have made it weigh nothing at all but this of course i did not wish to do the lightness of my baggage however had occasioned some comment and i had overheard remarks which were not altogether complimentary about people travelling around with empty trunks but this only amused me  desirous that my wife should have the advantage of negative gravity while taking our walks i had removed the machine from the trunk and fastened it inside of the basket which she could carry under her arm this assisted her wonderfully when one arm was tired she put the basket under the other and thus with one hand on my arm she could easily keep up with the free and buoyant steps my knapsack enabled me to take she did not object to long tramps here because nobody knew that she was not a walker and she always carried some wine or other refreshment in the basket not only because it was pleasant to have it with us but because it seemed ridiculous to go about carrying an empty basket  there were englishspeaking people stopping at the hotel where we were but they seemed more fond of driving than walking and none of them offered to accompany us on our rambles for which we were very glad there was one man there however who was a great walker he was an englishman a member of an alpine club and generally went about dressed in a knickerbocker suit with gray woollen stockings covering an enormous pair of calves one evening this gentleman was talking to me and some others about the ascent of the matterhorn and i took occasion to deliver in pretty strong language my opinion upon such exploits i declared them to be useless foolhardy and if the climber had any one who loved him wicked  even if the weather should permit a view i said what is that compared to the terrible risk to life under certain circumstances i added thinking of a kind of waistcoat i had some idea of making which set about with little negativegravity machines all connected with a conveniently handled screw would enable the wearer at times to dispense with his weight altogether such ascents might be divested of danger and be quite admissible but ordinarily they should be frowned upon by the intelligent public  the alpine club man looked at me especially regarding my somewhat slight figure and thinnish legs  its all very well for you to talk that way he said because it is easy to see that you are not up to that sort of thing  in conversations of this kind i replied i never make personal allusions but since you have chosen to do so i feel inclined to invite you to walk with me tomorrow to the top of the mountain to the north of this town  ill do it he said at any time you choose to name and as i left the room soon afterward i heard him laugh  the next afternoon about two oclock the alpine club man and myself set out for the mountain  what have you got in your knapsack he said  a hammer to use if i come across geological specimens a fieldglass a flask of wine and some other things  i wouldnt carry any weight if i were you he said  oh i dont mind it i answered and off we started  the mountain to which we were bound was about two miles from the town its nearest side was steep and in places almost precipitous but it sloped away more gradually toward the north and up that side a road led by devious windings to a village near the summit it was not a very high mountain but it would do for an afternoons climb  i suppose you want to go up by the road said my companion  oh no i answered we wont go so far around as that there is a path up this side along which i have seen men driving their goats i prefer to take that  all right if you say so he answered with a smile but youll find it pretty tough  after a time he remarked  i wouldnt walk so fast if i were you  oh i like to step along briskly i said and briskly on we went  my wife had screwed up the machine in the knapsack more than usual and walking seemed scarcely any effort at all i carried a long alpenstock and when we reached the mountain and began the ascent i found that with the help of this and my knapsack i could go uphill at a wonderful rate my companion had taken the lead so as to show me how to climb making a détour over some rocks i quickly passed him and went ahead after that it was impossible for him to keep up with me i ran up steep places i cut off the windings of the path by lightly clambering over rocks and even when i followed the beaten track my step was as rapid as if i had been walking on level ground  look here shouted the alpine club man from below youll kill yourself if you go at that rate thats no way to climb mountains  its my way i cried and on i skipped  twenty minutes after i arrived at the summit my companion joined me puffing and wiping his red face with his handkerchief  confound it he cried i never came up a mountain so fast in my life  you need not have hurried i said coolly  i was afraid something would happen to you he growled and i wanted to stop you i never saw a person climb in such an utterly absurd way  i dont see why you should call it absurd i said smiling with an air of superiority i arrived here in a perfectly comfortable condition neither heated nor wearied  he made no answer but walked off to a little distance fanning himself with his hat and growling words which i did not catch after a time i proposed to descend  you must be careful as you go down he said it is much more dangerous to go down steep places than to climb up  i am always prudent i answered and started in advance i found the descent of the mountain much more pleasant than the ascent it was positively exhilarating i jumped from rocks and bluffs eight and ten feet in height and touched the ground as gently as if i had stepped down but two feet i ran down steep paths and with the aid of my alpenstock stopped myself in an instant i was careful to avoid dangerous places but the runs and jumps i made were such as no man had ever made before upon that mountainside once only i heard my companions voice  youll break your  neck he yelled  never fear i called back and soon left him far above  when i reached the bottom i would have waited for him but my activity had warmed me up and as a cool evening breeze was beginning to blow i thought it better not to stop and take cold half an hour after my arrival at the hotel i came down to the court cool fresh and dressed for dinner and just in time to meet the alpine man as he entered hot dusty and growling  excuse me for not waiting for you i said but without stopping to hear my reason he muttered something about waiting in a place where no one would care to stay and passed into the house  there was no doubt that what i had done gratified my pique and tickled my vanity  i think now i said when i related the matter to my wife that he will scarcely say that i am not up to that sort of thing  i am not sure she answered that it was exactly fair he did not know how you were assisted  it was fair enough i said he is enabled to climb well by the inherited vigor of his constitution and by his training he did not tell me what methods of exercise he used to get those great muscles upon his legs i am enabled to climb by the exercise of my intellect my method is my business and his method is his business it is all perfectly fair  still she persisted  he thought that you climbed with your legs and not with your head  and now after this long digression necessary to explain how a middleaged couple of slight pedestrian ability and loaded with a heavy knapsack and basket should have started out on a rough walk and climb fourteen miles in all we will return to ourselves standing on the little bluff and gazing out upon the sunset view when the sky began to fade a little we turned from it and prepared to go back to the town  where is the basket i said  i left it right here answered my wife i unscrewed the machine and it lay perfectly flat  did you afterward take out the bottles i asked seeing them lying on the grass  yes i believe i did i had to take out yours in order to get at mine  then said i after looking all about the grassy patch on which we stood i am afraid you did not entirely unscrew the instrument and that when the weight of the bottles was removed the basket gently rose into the air  it may be so she said lugubriously the basket was behind me as i drank my wine  i believe that is just what has happened i said look up there i vow that is our basket  i pulled out my fieldglass and directed it at a little speck high above our heads it was the basket floating high in the air i gave the glass to my wife to look but she did not want to use it  what shall i do she cried i cant walk home without that basket its perfectly dreadful and she looked as if she was going to cry  do not distress yourself i said although i was a good deal disturbed myself we shall get home very well you shall put your hand on my shoulder while i put my arm around you then you can screw up my machine a good deal higher and it will support us both in this way i am sure that we shall get on very well  we carried out this plan and managed to walk on with moderate comfort to be sure with the knapsack pulling me upward and the weight of my wife pulling me down the straps hurt me somewhat which they had not done before we did not spring lightly over the wall into the road but still clinging to each other we clambered awkwardly over it the road for the most part declined gently toward the town and with moderate ease we made our way along it but we walked much more slowly than we had done before and it was quite dark when we reached our hotel if it had not been for the light inside the court it would have been difficult for us to find it a travellingcarriage was standing before the entrance and against the light it was necessary to pass around it and my wife went first i attempted to follow her but strange to say there was nothing under my feet i stepped vigorously but only wagged my legs in the air to my horror i found that i was rising in the air i soon saw by the light below me that i was some fifteen feet from the ground the carriage drove away and in the darkness i was not noticed of course i knew what had happened the instrument in my knapsack had been screwed up to such an intensity in order to support both myself and my wife that when her weight was removed the force of the negative gravity was sufficient to raise me from the ground but i was glad to find that when i had risen to the height i have mentioned i did not go up any higher but hung in the air about on a level with the second tier of windows of the hotel  i now began to try to reach the screw in my knapsack in order to reduce the force of the negative gravity but do what i would i could not get my hand to it the machine in the knapsack had been placed so as to support me in a wellbalanced and comfortable way and in doing this it had been impossible to set the screw so that i could reach it but in a temporary arrangement of the kind this had not been considered necessary as my wife always turned the screw for me until sufficient lifting power had been attained i had intended as i have said before to construct a negativegravity waistcoat in which the screw should be in front and entirely under the wearers control but this was a thing of the future  when i found that i could not turn the screw i began to be much alarmed here i was dangling in the air without any means of reaching the ground i could not expect my wife to return to look for me as she would naturally suppose i had stopped to speak to some one i thought of loosening myself from the knapsack but this would not do for i should fall heavily and either kill myself or break some of my bones i did not dare to call for assistance for if any of the simpleminded inhabitants of the town had discovered me floating in the air they would have taken me for a demon and would probably have shot at me a moderate breeze was blowing and it wafted me gently down the street if it had blown me against a tree i would have seized it and have endeavored so to speak to climb down it but there were no trees there was a dim streetlamp here and there but reflectors above them threw their light upon the pavement and none up to me on many accounts i was glad that the night was so dark for much as i desired to get down i wanted no one to see me in my strange position which to any one but myself and wife would be utterly unaccountable if i could rise as high as the roofs i might get on one of them and tearing off an armful of tiles so load myself that i would be heavy enough to descend but i did not rise to the eaves of any of the houses if there had been a telegraphpole or anything of the kind that i could have clung to i would have taken off the knapsack and would have endeavored to scramble down as well as i could but there was nothing i could cling to even the waterspouts if i could have reached the face of the houses were embedded in the walls at an open window near which i was slowly blown i saw two little boys going to bed by the light of a dim candle i was dreadfully afraid that they would see me and raise an alarm i actually came so near to the window that i threw out one foot and pushed against the wall with such force that i went nearly across the street i thought i caught sight of a frightened look on the face of one of the boys but of this i am not sure and i heard no cries i still floated dangling down the street what was to be done should i call out in that case if i were not shot or stoned my strange predicament and the secret of my invention would be exposed to the world if i did not do this i must either let myself drop and be killed or mangled or hang there and die when during the course of the night the air became more rarefied i might rise higher and higher perhaps to an altitude of one or two hundred feet it would then be impossible for the people to reach me and get me down even if they were convinced that i was not a demon i should then expire and when the birds of the air had eaten all of me that they could devour i should forever hang above the unlucky town a dangling skeleton with a knapsack on its back  such thoughts were not reassuring and i determined that if i could find no means of getting down without assistance i would call out and run all risks but so long as i could endure the tension of the straps i would hold out and hope for a tree or a pole perhaps it might rain and my wet clothes would then become so heavy that i would descend as low as the top of a lamppost  as this thought was passing through my mind i saw a spark of light upon the street approaching me i rightly imagined that it came from a tobaccopipe and presently i heard a voice it was that of the alpine club man of all people in the world i did not want him to discover me and i hung as motionless as possible the man was speaking to another person who was walking with him  he is crazy beyond a doubt said the alpine man nobody but a maniac could have gone up and down that mountain as he did he hasnt any muscles and one need only look at him to know that he couldnt do any climbing in a natural way it is only the excitement of insanity that gives him strength  the two now stopped almost under me and the speaker continued  such things are very common with maniacs at times they acquire an unnatural strength which is perfectly wonderful i have seen a little fellow struggle and fight so that four strong men could not hold him  then the other person spoke  i am afraid what you say is too true he remarked indeed i have known it for some time  at these words my breath almost stopped it was the voice of mr gilbert my townsman and the father of janet it must have been he who had arrived in the travellingcarriage he was acquainted with the alpine club man and they were talking of me proper or improper i listened with all my ears  it is a very sad case mr gilbert continued my daughter was engaged to marry his son but i broke off the match i could not have her marry the son of a lunatic and there could be no doubt of his condition he has been seena man of his age and the head of a familyto load himself up with a heavy knapsack which there was no earthly necessity for him to carry and go skipping along the road for miles vaulting over fences and jumping over rocks and ditches like a young calf or a colt i myself saw a most heartrending instance of how a kindly mans nature can be changed by the derangement of his intellect i was at some distance from his house but i plainly saw him harness a little donkey which he owns to a large twohorse wagon loaded with stone and beat and lash the poor little beast until it drew the heavy load some distance along the public road i would have remonstrated with him on this horrible cruelty but he had the wagon back in his yard before i could reach him  oh there can be no doubt of his insanity said the alpine club man and he oughtnt to be allowed to travel about in this way some day he will pitch his wife over a precipice just for the fun of seeing her shoot through the air  i am sorry he is here said mr gilbert for it would be very painful to meet him my daughter and i will retire very soon and go away as early tomorrow morning as possible so as to avoid seeing him  and then they walked back to the hotel  for a few moments i hung utterly forgetful of my condition and absorbed in the consideration of these revelations one idea now filled my mind everything must be explained to mr gilbert even if it should be necessary to have him called to me and for me to speak to him from the upper air  just then i saw something white approaching me along the road my eyes had become accustomed to the darkness and i perceived that it was an upturned face i recognized the hurried gait the form it was my wife as she came near me i called her name and in the same breath entreated her not to scream it must have been an effort for her to restrain herself but she did it  you must help me to get down i said without anybody seeing us  what shall i do she whispered  try to catch hold of this string  taking a piece of twine from my pocket i lowered one end to her but it was too short she could not reach it i then tied my handkerchief to it but still it was not long enough  i can get more string or handkerchiefs she whispered hurriedly  no i said you could not get them up to me but leaning against the hotel wall on this side in the corner just inside of the garden gate are some fishingpoles i have seen them there every day you can easily find them in the dark go please and bring me one of those  the hotel was not far away and in a few minutes my wife returned with a fishingpole she stood on tiptoe and reached it high in air but all she could do was to strike my feet and legs with it my most frantic exertions did not enable me to get my hands low enough to touch it  wait a minute she said and the rod was withdrawn  i knew what she was doing there was a hook and line attached to the pole and with womanly dexterity she was fastening the hook to the extreme end of the rod soon she reached up and gently struck at my legs after a few attempts the hook caught in my trousers a little below my right knee then there was a slight pull a long scratch down my leg and the hook was stopped by the top of my boot then came a steady downward pull and i felt myself descending gently and firmly the rod was drawn down carefully the lower end was kept free from the ground and in a few moments my ankle was seized with a vigorous grasp then some one seemed to climb up me my feet touched the ground an arm was thrown around my neck the hand of another arm was busy at the back of my knapsack and i soon stood firmly in the road entirely divested of negative gravity  oh that i should have forgotten sobbed my wife and that i should have dropped your arms and let you go up into the air at first i thought that you had stopped below and it was only a little while ago that the truth flashed upon me then i rushed out and began looking up for you i knew that you had wax matches in your pocket and hoped that you would keep on striking them so that you would be seen  but i did not wish to be seen i said as we hurried to the hotel and i can never be sufficiently thankful that it was you who found me and brought me down do you know that it is mr gilbert and his daughter who have just arrived i must see him instantly i will explain it all to you when i come upstairs  i took off my knapsack and gave it to my wife who carried it to our room while i went to look for mr gilbert fortunately i found him just as he was about to go up to his chamber he took my offered hand but looked at me sadly and gravely  mr gilbert i said i must speak to you in private let us step into this room there is no one here  my friend said mr gilbert it will be much better to avoid discussing this subject it is very painful to both of us and no good can come from talking of it  you cannot now comprehend what it is i want to say to you i replied come in here and in a few minutes you will be very glad that you listened to me  my manner was so earnest and impressive that mr gilbert was constrained to follow me and we went into a small room called the smokingroom but in which people seldom smoked and closed the door i immediately began my statement i told my old friend that i had discovered by means that i need not explain at present that he had considered me crazy and that now the most important object of my life was to set myself right in his eyes i thereupon gave him the whole history of my invention and explained the reason of the actions that had appeared to him those of a lunatic i said nothing about the little incident of that evening that was a mere accident and i did not care now to speak of it  mr gilbert listened to me very attentively  your wife is here he asked when i had finished  yes i said and she will corroborate my story in every item and no one could ever suspect her of being crazy i will go and bring her to you  in a few minutes my wife was in the room had shaken hands with mr gilbert and had been told of my suspected madness she turned pale but smiled  he did act like a crazy man she said but i never supposed that anybody would think him one and tears came into her eyes  and now my dear said i perhaps you will tell mr gilbert how i did all this  and then she told him the story that i had told  mr gilbert looked from the one to the other of us with a troubled air  of course i do not doubt either of you or rather i do not doubt that you believe what you say all would be right if i could bring myself to credit that such a force as that you speak of can possibly exist  that is a matter said i which i can easily prove to you by actual demonstration if you can wait a short time until my wife and i have had something to eatfor i am nearly famished and i am sure she must bei will set your mind at rest upon that point  i will wait here said mr gilbert and smoke a cigar dont hurry yourselves i shall be glad to have some time to think about what you have told me  when we had finished the dinner which had been set aside for us i went upstairs and got my knapsack and we both joined mr gilbert in the smokingroom i showed him the little machine and explained very briefly the principle of its construction i did not give any practical demonstration of its action because there were people walking about the corridor who might at any moment come into the room but looking out of the window i saw that the night was much clearer the wind had dissipated the clouds and the stars were shining brightly  if you will come up the street with me said i to mr gilbert i will show you how this thing works  that is just what i want to see he answered  i will go with you said my wife throwing a shawl over her head and we started up the street  when we were outside the little town i found the starlight was quite sufficient for my purpose the white roadway the low walls and objects about us could easily be distinguished  now said i to mr gilbert i want to put this knapsack on you and let you see how it feels and how it will help you to walk to this he assented with some eagerness and i strapped it firmly on him i will now turn this screw said i until you shall become lighter and lighter  be very careful not to turn it too much said my wife earnestly  oh you may depend on me for that said i turning the screw very gradually  mr gilbert was a stout man and i was obliged to give the screw a good many turns  there seems to be considerable hoist in it he said directly and then i put my arms around him and found that i could raise him from the ground  are you lifting me he exclaimed in surprise  yes i did it with ease i answered  uponmyword ejaculated mr gilbert  i then gave the screw a halfturn more and told him to walk and run he started off at first slowly then he made long strides then he began to run and then to skip and jump it had been many years since mr gilbert had skipped and jumped no one was in sight and he was free to gambol as much as he pleased could you give it another turn said he bounding up to me i want to try that wall i put on a little more negative gravity and he vaulted over a fivefoot wall with great ease in an instant he had leaped back into the road and in two bounds was at my side i came down as light as a cat he said there was never anything like it and away he went up the road taking steps at least eight feet long leaving my wife and me laughing heartily at the preternatural agility of our stout friend in a few minutes he was with us again take it off he said if i wear it any longer i shall want one myself and then i shall be taken for a crazy man and perhaps clapped into an asylum  now said i as i turned back the screw before unstrapping the knapsack do you understand how i took long walks and leaped and jumped how i ran uphill and downhill and how the little donkey drew the loaded wagon  i understand it all cried he i take back all i ever said or thought about you my friend  and herbert may marry janet cried my wife  may marry her cried mr gilbert indeed he shall marry her if i have anything to say about it my poor girl has been drooping ever since i told her it could not be  my wife rushed at him but whether she embraced him or only shook his hands i cannot say for i had the knapsack in one hand and was rubbing my eyes with the other  but my dear fellow said mr gilbert directly if you still consider it to your interest to keep your invention a secret i wish you had never made it no one having a machine like that can help using it and it is often quite as bad to be considered a maniac as to be one  my friend i cried with some excitement i have made up my mind on this subject the little machine in this knapsack which is the only one i now possess has been a great pleasure to me but i now know it has also been of the greatest injury indirectly to me and mine not to mention some direct inconvenience and danger which i will speak of another time the secret lies with us three and we will keep it but the invention itself is too full of temptation and danger for any of us  as i said this i held the knapsack with one hand while i quickly turned the screw with the other in a few moments it was high above my head while i with difficulty held it down by the straps look i cried and then i released my hold and the knapsack shot into the air and disappeared into the upper gloom  i was about to make a remark but had no chance for my wife threw herself upon my bosom sobbing with joy  oh i am so gladso glad she said and you will never make another  never another i answered  and now let us hurry in and see janet said my wife  you dont know how heavy and clumsy i feel said mr gilbert striving to keep up with us as we walked back if i had worn that thing much longer i should never have been willing to take it off  janet had retired but my wife went up to her room  i think she has felt it as much as our boy she said when she rejoined me but i tell you my dear i left a very happy girl in that little bedchamber over the garden  and there were three very happy elderly people talking together until quite late that evening i shall write to herbert tonight i said when we separated and tell him to meet us all in geneva it will do the young man no harm if we interrupt his studies just now  you must let me add a postscript to the letter said mr gilbert and i am sure it will require no knapsack with a screw in the back to bring him quickly to us  and it did not  there is a wonderful pleasure in tripping over the earth like a winged mercury and in feeling ones self relieved of much of that attraction of gravitation which drags us down to earth and gradually makes the movement of our bodies but weariness and labor but this pleasure is not to be compared i think to that given by the buoyancy and lightness of two young and loving hearts reunited after a separation which they had supposed would last forever  what became of the basket and the knapsack or whether they ever met in upper air i do not know if they but float away and stay away from ken of mortal man i shall be satisfied  and whether or not the world will ever know more of the power of negative gravity depends entirely upon the disposition of my son herbert whenafter a good many years i hopehe shall open the packet my lawyers have in keeping                                       noteit would be quite useless for any one to interview my wife on this subject for she has entirely forgotten how my machine was made and as for mr gilbert he never knew     asaph   about a hundred feet back from the main street of a village in new jersey there stood a very good white house halfway between it and the sidewalk was a large chestnuttree which had been the pride of mr himes who built the house and was now the pride of mrs himes his widow who lived there  under the tree was a bench and on the bench were two elderly men both smoking pipes and each one of them leaning forward with his elbows on his knees one of these thomas rooper by name was a small man with gray sidewhiskers a rather thin face and very good clothes his pipe was a meerschaum handsomely colored with a long amber tip he had bought that pipe while on a visit to philadelphia during the great centennial exposition and if any one noticed it and happened to remark what a fine pipe it was that person would be likely to receive a detailed account of the circumstances of its purchase with an appendix relating to the main building the art building the agricultural building and many other salient points of the great exposition which commemorated the centennial of our national independence  the other man asaph scantle was of a different type he was a little older than his companion but if his hair were gray it did not show very much as his rather long locks were of a sandy hue and his full face was clean shaven at least on wednesdays and sundays he was tall roundshouldered and his clothes were not good possessing very evident claims to a position on the retired list his pipe consisted of a common clay bowl with a long reed stem  for some minutes the two men continued to puff together as if they were playing a duet upon tobaccopipes and then asaph removing his reed from his lips remarked what you ought to do thomas is to marry money  theres sense in that replied the other but you wasnt the first to think of it  asaph who knew very well that mr rooper never allowed any one to suppose that he received suggestions from without took no notice of the last remark but went on lookin at the matter in a friendly way it seems to me it stands to reason that when the shingles on a mans house is so rotten that the rain comes through into every room on the top floor and when the plaster on the ceilin is tumblin down more or less all the time and the windowsashes is all loose and things generally in a condition that he cant let that house without spendin at least a years rent on it to git it into decent order and when a mans got to the time of life  theres nothin the matter with the time of life said thomas thats all right  what i was goin to say was continued asaph that when a man gits to the time of life when he knows what it is to be comfortable in his mind as well as his bodyand that time comes to sensible people as soon as they git fairly growed uphe dont want to give up his good room in the tavern and all the privileges of the house and go to live on his own property and have the plaster come down on his own head and the rain come down on the coverlet of his own bed  no he dont said thomas and what is more he isnt goin to do it but what i git from the rent of that house is what i have to live on theres no gittin around that pint  well then said asaph if you dont marry money what are you goin to do you cant go back to your old business  i never had but one business said thomas i lived with my folks until i was a good deal more than growed up and when the war broke out i went as sutler to the rigiment from this place and all the money i made i put into my property in the village here thats what ive lived on ever since theres no more war so theres no more sutlers except away out west where i wouldnt go and there are no more folks for they are all dead and if what mrs mcjimsey says is true therell be no more tenants in my house after the 1st of next november for when the mcjimseys go on account of want of general repairs it is not to be expected that anybody else will come there theres nobody in this place that can stand as much as the mcjimseys can  consequently said asaph deliberately filling his pipe it stands to reason that there aint nothin for you to do but marry money  thomas rooper took his pipe from his mouth and sat up straight gazing steadfastly at his companion he remarked if you think that is such a good thing to do why dont you do it yourself there cant be anybody much harder up than you are  the laws agin my doin it said asaph a man cant marry his sister  are you thinkin of marietta himes asked mr rooper  thats the one im thinkin of said asaph if you can think of anybody better id like you to mention her  mr rooper did not immediately speak he presently asked what do you call money  well said asaph with a little hesitation considerin the circumstances i should say that in a case like this about fifteen hundred a year a firstrate house with not a loose shingle on it nor a crack anywhere a good garden and an orchard two cows a piece of meadowland on the other side of the creek and all the clothes a woman need have is money  thomas shrugged his shoulders clothes he said if she marries shell go out of black and then shell have to have new ones and lots of em that would make a big hole in her money asaph  the other smiled i always knowed you was a farseein feller thomas but it stands to reason that mariettas got a lot of clothes that was on hand before she went into mournin and shes not the kind of woman to waste em shell be twistin em about and makin em over to suit the fashions and it wont be like her to be buyin new colored goods when shes got plenty of em already  there was now another pause in the conversation and then mr rooper remarked mrs himes must be gettin on pretty well in years  shes not a young woman said asaph but if she was much younger she wouldnt have you and if she was much older you wouldnt have her so it strikes me shes just about the right pint  how old was john himes when he died asked thomas  i dont exactly know that but he was a lot older than marietta  thomas shook his head it strikes me said he that john himes had a hearty constitution and hadnt ought to died as soon as he did he fell away a good deal in the last years of his life  and considerin that he died of consumption he had a right to fall away said asaph if what you are drivin at thomas is that marietta isnt a good housekeeper and hasnt the right sort of notions of feedin look at me ive lived with marietta just about a year and in that time i have gained fortytwo pounds now of course i aint unreasonable and dont mean to say that you would gain fortytwo pounds in a year cause you aint got the frame and bone to put it on but it wouldnt surprise me a bit if you was to gain twenty or even twentyfive pounds in eighteen months anyway and more than that you ought not to ask thomas considerin your height and general build  isnt marietta himes a good deal of a freethinker asked thomas  a what cried asaph you mean an infidel  no said thomas i dont charge nobody with nothin more than theres reason for but they do say that she goes sometimes to one church and sometimes to another and that if there was a catholic church in this village she would go to that and whos goin to say where a woman will turn up when she dont know her own mind better than that  asaph colored a little the place where marietta will turn up said he warmly is on a front seat in the kingdom of heaven and if the people that talk about her will mend their ways theyll see that i am right you need not trouble yourself about that thomas marietta himes is pious to the heel  mr rooper now shifted himself a little on the bench and crossed one leg over the other now look here asaph he said with a little more animation than he had yet shown supposin all you say is true have you got any reason to think that mrs himes aint satisfied with things as they are  yes i have said asaph and i dont mind tellin you that the thing shes least satisfied with is me she wants a man in the house that is nateral she wouldnt be marietta himes if she didnt when i come to live with her i thought the whole business was settled but it isnt i dont suit her i dont say shes lookin for another man but if another man was to come along and if he was the right kind of a man its my opinion shes ready for him i wouldnt say this to everybody but i say it to you thomas rooper cause i know what kind of a man you are  mr rooper did not return the compliment i dont wonder your sister aint satisfied with you he said for you go ahead of all the lazy men i ever saw yet they was sayin down at the tavern yesterdayonly yesterdaythat you could do less work in more time than anybody they ever saw before  theres two ways of workin said asaph some people work with their hands and some with their heads  thomas grimly smiled it strikes me said he that the most headwork you do is with your jaws  asaph was not the man to take offence readily especially when he considered it against his interest to do so and he showed no resentment at this remark taint so much my not makin myself more generally useful he said that marietta objects to though of course it could not be expected that a man that hasnt got any interest in property would keep workin at it like a man that has got an interest in it such as mariettas husband would have but its my general appearance that she dont like shes told me more than once she didnt so much mind my bein lazy as lookin lazy  i dont wonder she thinks that way said thomas but look here asaph do you suppose that if marietta himes was to marry a man he would really come into her property  there aint nobody that knows my sister better than i know her and i can say without any fear of bein contradicted that when she gives herself to a man the goodwill and fixtures will be included  thomas rooper now leaned forward with his elbows on his knees without smoking and asaph scantle leaned forward with his elbows on his knees without smoking and thus they remained saying nothing to each other for the space of some ten minutes  asaph was a man who truly used his head a great deal more than he used his hands he had always been a shiftless fellow but he was no fool and this his sister found out soon after she asked him to come and make his home with her she had not done this because she wanted a man in the house for she had lived two or three years without that convenience and had not felt the need of it but she heard that asaph was in very uncomfortable circumstances and she had sent for him solely for his own good the arrangement proved to be a very good one for her brother but not a good one for her she had always known that asaphs head was his main dependence but she was just beginning to discover that he liked to use his head so that other peoples hands should work for him  there aint nobody comin to see your sister is there asked thomas suddenly  not a livin soul said asaph except women married folk and children but it has always surprised me that nobody did come but just at this minute the fields clear and the gates open  well said mr rooper ill think about it  thats right said asaph rubbing his knees with his hands thats right but now tell me thomas rooper supposin you get marietta what are you goin to do for me  for you exclaimed the other what have you got to do with it  a good deal said asaph if you get marietta with her fifteen hundred a yearand it wouldnt surprise me if it was eighteen hundredand her house and her garden and her cattle and her field and her furniture with not a leg loose nor a scratch you will get her because i proposed her to you and because i backed you up afterward and now then i want to know what you are goin to do for me  what do you want asked thomas  the first thing i want said asaph is a suit of clothes these clothes is disgraceful  you are right there said mr rooper i wonder your sister lets you come around in front of the house but what do you mean by clotheswinter clothes or summer clothes  winter said asaph without hesitation i dont count summer clothes and when i say a suit of clothes i mean shoes and hat and underclothes  mr rooper gave a sniff i wonder you dont say overcoat he remarked  i do say overcoat replied asaph a suit of winter clothes is a suit of clothes that you can go out into the weather in without missin nothin  mr rooper smiled sarcastically is there anything else you want he asked  yes said asaph decidedly there is i want a umbrella  cotton or silk  asaph hesitated he had never had a silk umbrella in his hand in his life he was afraid to strike too high and he answered i want a good stout gingham  mr rooper nodded his head very good he said and is that all  no said asaph it aint all there is one more thing i want and that is a dictionary  the other man rose to his feet upon my word he exclaimed i never before saw a man that would sell his sister for a dictionary and what you want with a dictionary is past my conceivin  well it aint past mine said asaph for more than ten years i have wanted a dictionary if i had a dictionary i could make use of my head in a way that i cant now there is books in this house but amongst em there is no dictionary if there had been one id been a different man by this time from what i am now and like as not marietta wouldnt have wanted any other man in the house but me  mr rooper stood looking upon the ground and asaph who had also arisen waited for him to speak you are a graspin man asaph said thomas but there is another thing id like to know if i give you them clothes you dont want them before shes married  yes i do said asaph if i come to the weddin i cant wear these things i have got to have them first  mr rooper gave his head a little twist theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip said he  yes said asaph and theres different cups and different lips but whats more if i was to be best manwhich would be nateral considerin im your friend and her brotheryou wouldnt want me standin up in this rig and thats puttin it in your own point of view thomas  it strikes me said the other that i could get a best man that would furnish his own clothes but we will see about that theres another thing asaph he said abruptly what are mrs himess views concernin pipes  this question startled and frightened asaph he knew that his sister could not abide the smell of tobacco and that mr rooper was an inveterate smoker  that depends said he on the kind of tobacco i dont mind sayin that marietta isnt partial to the kind of tobacco i smoke but i aint a moneyed man and i cant afford to buy nothin but cheap stuff but when it comes to a meerschaum pipe and the very finest virginia or north carolina smokingtobacco such as a moneyed man would be likely to use  at this moment there came from the house the sound of a womans voice not loud but clear and distinct and it said asaph  this word sent through mr rooper a gentle thrill such as he did not remember ever having felt before there seemed to be in it a suggestion a sort of prophecy of what appeared to him as an undefined and chaotic bliss he was not a fanciful man but he could not help imagining himself standing alone under that chestnuttree and that voice calling thomas  upon asaph the effect was different the interruption was an agreeable one in one way because it cut short his attempted explanation of the tobacco question but in another way he knew that it meant the swinging of an axe and that was not pleasant  mr rooper walked back to the tavern in a cogitative state of mind that asaph scantle he said to himself has got a headpiece theres no denying it if it had not been for him i do not believe i should have thought of his sister at least not until the mcjimseys had left my house and then it might have been too late  marietta himes was a woman with a gentle voice and an appearance and demeanor indicative of a general softness of disposition but beneath this mild exterior there was a great deal of firmness of purpose asaph had not seen very much of his sister since she had grown up and married and when he came to live with her he thought that he was going to have things pretty much his own way but it was not long before he entirely changed his mind  mrs himes was of moderate height pleasant countenance and a figure inclined to plumpness her dark hair in which there was not a line of gray was brushed down smoothly on each side of her face and her dress while plain was extremely neat in fact everything in the house and on the place was extremely neat except asaph  she was in the bright little diningroom which looked out on the flowergarden preparing the table for supper placing every plate dish glass and cup with as much care and exactness as if a civil engineer had drawn a plan on the tablecloth with places marked for the position of each article  as she finished her work by placing a chair on each side of the table a quiet smile the result of a train of thought in which she had been indulging for the past halfhour stole over her face she passed through the kitchen with a glance at the stove to see if the teakettle had begun to boil and going out of the back door she walked over to the shed where her brother was splitting kindlingwood  asaph said mrs himes if i were to give you a good suit of clothes would you promise me that you would never smoke when wearing them  her brother looked at her in amazement clothes he repeated  mr himes was about your size said his sister and he left a good many clothes which are most of them very good and carefully packed away so that i am sure there is not a mothhole in any one of them i have several times thought asaph that i might give you some of his clothes but it did seem to me a desecration to have the clothes of such a man who was so particular and nice filled and saturated with horrible tobaccosmoke which he detested but now you are getting to be so awful shabby i do not see how i can stand it any longer but one thing i will not doi will not have mr himess clothes smelling of tobacco as yours do and not only your own tobacco but mr roopers  i think said asaph that you are not exactly right just there what you smell about me is my smoke thomas rooper never uses anything but the finestscented and delicatest brands i think that if you come to get used to his tobaccosmoke you would like it but as to my takin off my clothes and puttin on a different suit every time i want to light my pipe thats pretty hard lines it seems to me  it would be a good deal easier to give up the pipe said his sister  i will do that said asaph when you give up tea but you know as well as i do that theres no use of either of us atryin to change our comfortable habits at our time of life  i kept on hoping said mrs himes that you would feel yourself that you were not fit to be seen by decent people and that you would go to work and earn at least enough money to buy yourself some clothes but as you dont seem inclined to do that i thought i would make you this offer but you must understand that i will not have you smoke in mr himess clothes  asaph stood thinking the head of his axe resting upon the ground a position which suited him he was in a little perplexity mariettas proposition seemed to interfere somewhat with the one he had made to thomas rooper here was a state of affairs which required most careful consideration ive been arrangin about some clothes he said presently for i know very well i need em but i dont know just yet how it will turn out  i hope asaph said marietta quickly that you are not thinking of going into debt for clothing and i know that you havent been working to earn money what arrangements have you been making  thats my private affair said asaph but theres no debt in it it is all fair and squarecash down so to speak though of course its not cash but work but as i said before that isnt settled  i am afraid asaph said his sister that if you have to do the work first you will never get the clothes and so you might as well come back to my offer  asaph came back to it and thought about it very earnestly if by any chance he could get two suits of clothes he would then feel that he had a head worth having what would you say he said presently if when i wanted to smoke i was to put on a long dusteri guess mr himes had dustersand a nightcap and rubbers id agree to hang the duster and the cap in the shed here and never smoke without putting em on there was a deep purpose in this proposition for enveloped in the long duster he might sit with thomas rooper under the chestnuttree and smoke and talk and plan as long as he pleased and his companion would not know that he did not need a new suit of clothes  nonsense said mrs himes you must make up your mind to act perfectly fairly asaph or else say you will not accept my offer but if you dont accept it i cant see how you can keep on living with me  what do you mean by clothes marietta he asked  well i mean a complete suit of course said she  winter or summer  i hadnt thought of that mrs himes replied but that can be as you choose  overcoat asked asaph  yes said she and cane and umbrella if you like and pockethandkerchiefs too i will fit you out completely and shall be glad to have you looking like a decent man  at the mention of the umbrella another line of perplexity showed itself upon asaphs brow the idea came to him that if she would add a dictionary he would strike a bargain thomas rooper was certainly a very undecided and uncertain sort of man but then there came up the thought of his pipe and he was all at sea again giving up smoking was almost the same as giving up eating marietta said he i will think about this  very well she answered but its my opinion asaph that you ought not to take more than one minute to think about it however i will give you until tomorrow morning and then if you decide that you dont care to look like a respectable citizen i must have some further talk with you about our future arrangements  make it tomorrow night said asaph and his sister consented  the next day asaph was unusually brisk and active and very soon after breakfast he walked over to the village tavern to see mr rooper  hello exclaimed that individual surprised at his visitors early appearance at the business centre of the village whats started you out have you come after them clothes  a happy thought struck asaph he had made this visit with the intention of feeling his way toward some decision on the important subject of his sisters proposition and here a way seemed to be opened to him thomas said he taking his friend aside i am in an awful fix marietta cant stand my clothes any longer if she cant stand them she cant stand me and when it comes to that you can see for yourself that i cant help you  a shade settled upon mr roopers face during the past evening he had been thinking and puffing and puffing and thinking until everybody else in the tavern had gone to bed and he had finally made up his mind that if he could do it he would marry marietta himes he had never been very intimate with her or her husband but he had been to meals in the house and he remembered the fragrant coffee and the light puffy wellbaked rolls made by mariettas own hands and he thought of the many differences between living in that very good house with that gentle pleasantvoiced lady and his present life in the village tavern  and so having determined that without delay he would with the advice and assistance of asaph begin his courtship it was natural that he should feel a shock of discouragement when he heard asaphs announcement that his sister could not endure him in the house any longer to attack that house and its owner without the friendly offices upon which he depended was an undertaking for which he was not at all prepared  i dont wonder at her he said sharplynot a bit but this puts a mighty different face on the thing what we talked about yesterday  it neednt said asaph quietly the clothes you was goin to give me wouldnt cost a cent more today than they would in a couple of months say and when ive got em on marietta will be glad to have me around everything can go on just as we bargained for  thomas shook his head that would be a mighty resky piece of business he said you would be all right but thats not sayin that i would for it strikes me that your sister is about as much a bird in the bush as any flyin critter  asaph smiled if the bush was in the middle of a field said he and there was only one boy after the bird it would be a pretty tough job but if the bush is in the corner of two high walls and theres two boys and one of ems got a fishnet what he can throw clean over the bush why then the chances is a good deal better but droppin figgers thomas and speakin plain and straightforward as i always do  about things you want to git interrupted thomas  about everything resumed asaph ill just tell you this if i dont git decent clothes now today or perhaps tomorrow i have got to travel out of mariettas house i can do it and she knows it i can go back to drummondville and git my board for keepin books in the store and nobody there cares what sort of clothes i wear but when that happens your chance of gittin marietta goes up higher than a kite  to the mind of mr rooper this was most conclusive reasoning but he would not admit it and he did not like it why dont your sister give you clothes he said old himes must have left some  a thin chill like a needleful of frozen thread ran down asaphs back mr himess clothes he exclaimed what in the world are you talkin about thomas rooper taint likely he had many cept what he was buried in and whats left if there is any marietta would no more think of givin away than she would of hangin up his funeral wreath for the canarybird to perch on theres a room up in the garret where she keeps his special thingsfor shes awful particularand if there is any of his clothes up there i expect shes got em framed  if she thinks as much of him as that muttered mr rooper  now dont git any sech ideas as them into your head thomas said asaph quickly marietta aint a woman to rake up the past and you never need be afraid of her rakin up mr himes all of the premises will be hern and yourn except that room in the garret and it aint likely shell ever ask you to go in there  the lord knows i dont want to ejaculated mr rooper  the two men walked slowly to the end of a line of wellused or rather badly used wooden armchairs which stood upon the tavern piazza and seated themselves mr roopers mind was in a highly perturbed condition if he accepted asaphs present proposition he would have to make a considerable outlay with a very shadowy prospect of return  if you havent got the ready money for the clothes said asaph after having given his companion some minutes for silent consideration there aint a man in this village what they would trust sooner at the store for clothes and then after a pause he added or books which of course they can order from town  at this mr rooper simply shrugged his shoulders the question of ready money or credit did not trouble him  at this moment a man in a low phaeton drawn by a stout gray horse passed the tavern  whos that asked asaph who knew everybody in the village  thats doctor wicker said thomas he lives over at timberley he tended john himes in his last sickness  he dont practise here does he said asaph i never see him  no but he was called in to consult and then the speaker dropped again into cogitation  after a few minutes asaph rose he knew that thomas rooper had a slowworking mind and thought it would be well to leave him to himself for a while ill go home said he and tend to my chores and by the time you feel like comin up and takin a smoke with me under the chestnuttree i reckon you will have made up your mind and well settle this thing fer if i have got to go back to drummondville i spose ill have to pack up this afternoon  if youd say pack off instead of pack up remarked the other youd come nearer the facts considerin the amount of your personal property but ill be up there in an hour or two  when asaph came within sight of his sisters house he was amazed to see a phaeton and a gray horse standing in front of the gate from this it was easy to infer that the doctor was in the house what on earth could have happened was anything the matter with marietta and if so why did she send for a physician who lived at a distance instead of doctor mcilvaine the village doctor in a very anxious state of mind asaph reached the gate and irresolutely went into the yard his impulse was to go to the house and see what had happened but he hesitated he felt that marietta might object to having a comparative stranger know that such an exceedingly shabby fellow was her brother and besides his sister could not have been overtaken by any sudden illness she had always appeared perfectly well and there would have been no time during his brief absence from the house to send over to timberley for a doctor  so he sat down under the chestnuttree to consider this strange condition of affairs whatever it is he said to himself its nothin suddint and its bound to be chronic and thatll skeer thomas i wish i hadnt asked him to come up here the best thing for me to do will be to pretend that i have been sent to git somethin at the store and go straight back and keep him from comin up  but asaph was a good deal quicker to think than to move and he still sat with brows wrinkled and mind beset by doubts for a moment he thought that it might be well to accept mariettas proposition and let thomas go but then he remembered the conditions and he shut his mental eyes at the prospect  at that moment the gate opened and in walked thomas rooper he had made up his mind and had come to say so but the sight of the phaeton and gray horse caused him to postpone his intended announcement whats doctor wicker doin here he asked abruptly  dunno said asaph as carelessly as he could speak i dont meddle with household matters of that kind i expect its somethin the matter with that gal betsey that marietta hires to help her shes always wrong some way or other so that she cant do her own proper work which i know havin to do a good deal of it myself i expect its rickets like as not gals do have that sort of thing dont they  never had anything to do with sick gals said thomas or sick people of any sort and dont want to but it must be somethin pretty deepseated for your sister to send all the way to timberley for a doctor  asaph knew very well that mrs himes was too economical a person to think of doing such a thing as that and he knew also that betsey was as good a specimen of rustic health as could be found in the county and therefore his companions statement that he wanted to have nothing to do with sick people had for him a saddening import  i settled that business of yourn said mr rooper pretty soon after you left me i thought i might as well come straight around and tell you about it ill make you a fair and square offer ill give you them clothes though it strikes me that winter goods will be pretty heavy for this time of year but it will be on this condition if i dont get marietta you have got to give em back  asaph smiled  i know what you are grinnin at said thomas but you neednt think that you are goin to have the wearin of them clothes for two or three months and then give em back i dont go in for any long courtships what i do in that line will be short and sharp  how short asked asaph  well this is thursday replied the other and i calculate to ask her on monday  asaph looked at his companion in amazement by george he exclaimed that wont work why it took marietta moren five days to make up her mind whether she would have the chickenhouse painted green or red and you cant expect her to be quicker than that in takin a new husband shed say no just as certain as she would now if you was to go in and ask her right before the doctor and betsey and ill just tell you plain that it wouldnt pay me to do all the hustlin around and talkin and argyin and recommendin that id have to do just for the pleasure of wearin a suit of warm clothes for four july days i tell you what it is it wont do to spring that sort of thing on a woman especially when shes what you might call a trained widder you got to give em time to think over the matter and to look up your references theres no use talkin about it you must give em time especially when the offer comes from a person that nobody but me has ever thought of as a marryin man  humph said thomas thats all you know about it  facts is facts and you cant git around em there isnt a woman in this village what wouldnt take at least two weeks to git it into her head that you was really courtin her she would be just as likely to think that you was tryin to git a tenant in place of the mcjimseys but a month of your courtin and a month of my workin would just about make the matter all right with marietta and then you could sail in and settle it  very good said mr rooper rising suddenly i will court your sister for one month and if on the 17th day of august she takes me you can go up to the store and git them clothes but you cant do it one minute afore goodmornin  asaph left alone heaved a sigh he did not despair but truly fate was heaping a great many obstacles in his path he thought it was a very hard thing for a man to get his rights in this world  mrs himes sat on one end of a black haircovered sofa in the parlor and doctor wicker sat on a black haircovered chair opposite to her and not far away the blinds of the window opening upon the garden were drawn up but those on the front window which commanded a view of the chestnuttree were down doctor wicker had just made a proposal of marriage to mrs himes and at that moment they were both sitting in silence  the doctor a bluff heartylooking man of about fortyfive had been very favorably impressed by mrs himes when he first made her acquaintance during her husbands sickness and since that time he had seen her occasionally and had thought about her a great deal latterly letters had passed between them and now he had come to make his declaration in person  it was true as her brother had said that marietta was not quick in making up her mind but in this case she was able to act more promptly than usual because she had in a great measure settled this matter before the arrival of the doctor she knew he was going to propose and she was very much inclined to accept him this it was which had made her smile when she was setting the table the afternoon before and this it was which had prompted her to make her proposition to her brother in regard to his better personal appearance  but now she was in a condition of nervous trepidation and made no answer the doctor thought this was natural enough under the circumstances but he had no idea of the cause of it the cause of it was sitting under the chestnuttree the bright sunlight streaming through a break in the branches above illuminating and emphasizing and exaggerating his extreme shabbiness the doctor had never seen asaph and it would have been a great shock to mariettas selfrespect to have him see her brother in his present aspect  through a crack in the blind of the front window she had seen asaph come in and sit down and she had seen mr rooper arrive and had noticed his departure and now with an anxiety which made her chin tremble she sat and hoped that asaph would get up and go away for she knew that if she should say to the doctor what she was perfectly willing to say then and there he would very soon depart being a man of practical mind and pressing business and that going to the front door with him she would be obliged to introduce him to a prospective brotherinlaw whose appearance she truly believed would make him sick for the doctor was a man she well knew who was quite as nice and particular about dress and personal appearance as the late mr himes had been  doctor wicker aware that the ladys perturbation was increasing instead of diminishing thought it wise not to press the matter at this moment he felt that he had been perhaps a little overprompt in making his proposition madam said he rising i will not ask you to give me an answer now i will go away and let you think about it and will come again tomorrow  through the crack in the windowblind marietta saw that asaph was still under the tree what could she do to delay the doctor she did not offer to take leave of him but stood looking upon the floor it seemed a shame to make so good a man go all the way back to timberley and come again next day just because that ragged dirty asaph was sitting under the chestnuttree  the doctor moved toward the door and as she followed him she glanced once more through the crack in the windowblind and to her intense delight she saw asaph jump up from the bench and run around to the side of the house he had heard the doctors footsteps in the hallway and had not wished to meet him the unsatisfactory condition of his outward appearance had been so strongly impressed upon him of late that he had become a little sensitive in regard to it when strangers were concerned but if he had only known that his exceedingly unattractive garments had prevented his sister from making a compact which would have totally ruined his plans in regard to her matrimonial disposition and his own advantage he would have felt for those old clothes the respect and gratitude with which a roman soldier regarded the shield and sword which had won him a battle  down the middle of the garden at the back of the house there ran a path and along this path asaph walked meditatively with his hands in his trousers pockets it was a discouraging place for him to walk for the beds on each side of him were full of weeds which he had intended to pull out as soon as he should find time for the work but which had now grown so tall and strong that they could not be rooted up without injuring the plants which were the legitimate occupants of the garden  asaph did not know it but at this moment there was not one person in the whole world who thought kindly of him his sister was so mortified by him that she was in tears in the house his crony thomas had gone away almost angry with him and even betsey whom he had falsely accused of rickets and who had often shown a pity for him simply because he looked so forlorn had steeled her heart against him that morning when she found he had gone away without providing her with any fuel for the kitchen fire  but he had not made a dozen turns up and down the path before he became aware of the feeling of marietta she looked out of the back door and then walked rapidly toward him asaph said she i hope you are considering what i said to you yesterday for i mean to stick to my word if you dont choose to accept my offer i want you to go back to drummondville early tomorrow morning and i dont feel in the least as if i were turning you out of the house for i have given you a chance to stay here and have only asked you to act like a decent christian i will not have you here disgracing my home when doctor wicker came today and i looked out and saw you with that miserable little coat with the sleeves halfway up to the elbows and great holes in it which you will not let anybody patch because you are too proud to wear patches and those wretched faded trousers out at the knees and which have been turned up and hemmed at the bottom so often that they are six inches above your shoes and your whole scarecrow appearance i was so ashamed of you that i could not keep the tears out of my eyes to tell a respectable gentleman like doctor wicker that you were my brother was more than i could bear and i was glad when i saw you get up and sneak out of the way i hate to talk to you in this way asaph but you have brought it on yourself  her brother looked at her a moment do you want me to go away before breakfast he said  no answered marietta but immediately afterward and in her mind she resolved that breakfast should be very early the next morning  if asaph had any idea of yielding he did not intend to show it until the last moment and so he changed the subject whats the matter with betsey said he if shes out of health youd better get rid of her  theres nothing the matter with betsey answered his sister doctor wicker came to see me  came to see you exclaimed her brother what in the world did he do that for you never told me that you were ailin is it that sprain in your ankle  nonsense said marietta i had almost recovered from that sprain when you came here theres nothing the matter with my ankle the trouble is probably with my heart  the moment she said this she regretted it for asaph had so good a head and could catch meanings so quickly  im sorry to hear that marietta said asaph thats a good deal more serious  yes said she and she turned and went back to the house  asaph continued to walk up and down the path he had not done a stroke of work that morning but he did not think of that his sisters communication saddened him he liked marietta and it grieved him to hear that she had anything the matter with her heart he knew that that often happened to people who looked perfectly well and there was no reason why he should have suspected any disorder in her of course in this case there was good reason for her sending for the very best doctor to be had it was all plain enough to him now  but as he walked and walked and walked and looked at the garden and looked at the little orchard and looked at the house and the top of the big chestnuttree which showed itself above the roof a thought came into his mind which had never been there beforehe was mariettas heir it was a dreadful thing to think of his sisters possible early departure from this world but after all life is life reality is reality and business is business he was mariettas only legal heir  of course he had known this before but it had never seemed to be of any importance he was a good deal older than she was and he had always looked upon her as a marrying woman when he made his proposition to mr rooper the thought of his own heirship never came into his mind in fact if any one had offered him ten dollars for said heirship he would have asked fifteen and would have afterward agreed to split the difference and take twelve and a half  but now everything had changed if marietta had anything the matter with her heart there was no knowing when all that he saw might be his own no sooner had he walked and thought long enough for his mind to fully appreciate the altered aspects of his future than he determined to instantly thrust out mr rooper from all connection with that future he would go and tell him so at once  to the dismay of betsey who had been watching him expecting that he would soon stop walking about and go and saw some wood with which to cook the dinner he went out of the front gate and strode rapidly into the village he had some trouble in finding mr rooper who had gone off to take a walk and arrange a conversation with which to begin his courtship of mrs himes but he overtook him under a tree by the side of the creek thomas said he i have changed my mind about that business between us you have been very hard on me and im not goin to stand it i can get the clothes and things i need without makin myself your slave and workin myself to death and perhaps settin my sister agin me for life by tryin to make her believe that blacks white that you are the kind of husband she ought to have and that you hate pipes and never touch spirits it would be a mean thing for me to do and i wont do it i did think you were a generousminded man with the right sort of feeling for them as wanted to be your friends but i have found out that i was mistook and im not goin to sacrifice my sister to any such person now thats my state of mind plain and square  thomas rooper shrunk two inches in height asaph scantle he said in a voice which seemed also to have shrunk i dont understand you i wasnt hard on you i only wanted to make a fair bargain if id got her id paid up cash on delivery you couldnt expect a man to do more than that but i tell you asaph that i am mighty serious about this the more i have thought about your sister the more i want her and when i tell you that ive been athinkin about her pretty much all night you may know that i want her a good deal and i was intendin to go tomorrow and begin to court her  well you neednt said asaph it wont do no good if you dont have me to back you up you might as well try to twist that tree as to move her you cant do it  but you dont mean to go agin me do you asaph asked thomas ruefully  taint necessary replied the other you will go agin yourself  for a few moments mr rooper remained silent he was greatly discouraged and dismayed by what had been said to him but he could not yet give up what had become the great object of his life asaph said he presently it cuts me to the inards to think that you have gone back on me but i tell you what ill do if you will promise not to say anything agin me to mrs himes and not to set yourself in any way between me and her ill go along with you to the store now and you can git that suit of clothes and the umbrella and ill tell em to order the dictionary and hand it over to you as soon as it comes id like you to help me but if you will only promise to stand out of the way and not hinder ill do the fair thing by you and pay in advance  humph said asaph i do believe you think you are the only man that wants marietta  a pang passed through the heart of mr rooper he had been thinking a great deal of mrs himes and everything connected with her and he had even thought of that visit of doctor wickers that gentleman was a widower and a welltodo and wellappearing man and it would have been a long way for him to come just for some trifling rickets in a servantgirl being really in love his imagination was in a very capering mood and he began to fear that the doctor had come to court mrs himes asaph he said quickly thats a good offer i make you if you take it in less than an hour you can walk home looking like a gentleman  asaph had taken his reed pipe from his coat pocket and was filling it as he pushed the coarse tobacco into the bowl he considered thomas said he that aint enough things have changed and it wouldnt pay me but i wont be hard on you im a good friend of yourn and ill tell you what ill do if you will give me now all the things we spoke of between usand i forgot to mention a cane and pockethandkerchiefsand give me besides that meerschaum pipe of yourn ill promise not to hinder you but let you go ahead and git marietta if you kin i must say its a good deal for me to do knowin how much youll git and how little youll give and knowin too the other chances shes got if she wanted em but ill do it for the sake of friendship  my meerschaum pipe groaned mr rooper my centennial exhibition pipe his tones were so plaintive that for a moment asaph felt a little touch of remorse but then he reflected that if thomas really did get marietta the pipe would be of no use to him for she would not allow him to smoke it and besides realities were realities and business was business that pipe may be very dear to you he said thomas but i want you to remember that mariettas very dear to me  this touched mr rooper whose heart was sensitive as it had never been before come along asaph he said you shall have everything meerschaum pipe included if anybody but me is goin to smoke that pipe id like it to be my brotherinlaw thus with ambertipped guile mr rooper hoped to win over his friend to not only not hinder but to help him  as the two men walked away asaph thought that he was not acting an unfraternal part toward marietta for it would not be necessary for him to say or do anything to induce her to refuse so unsuitable a suitor as thomas rooper  about fifteen minutes before dinnerwhich had been cooked with bits of wood which betsey had picked up here and therewas ready asaph walked into the front yard of his sisters house attired in a complete suit of new clothes thick and substantial in texture pepperandsalt in color and as long in the legs and arms as the most fastidious could desire he had on a new shirt and a clean collar with a handsome black silk cravat tied in a great bow and a new felt hat was on his head on his left arm he carried an overcoat carefully folded with the lining outside and in his right hand an umbrella and a cane in his pockets were half a dozen new handkerchiefs and the case containing mr roopers centennial meerschaum  marietta who was in the hallway when he opened the front door scarcely knew him as he approached  asaph she exclaimed what has happened to you why you actually look like a gentleman  asaph grinned do you want me to go to drummondville right after breakfast tomorrow he asked  my dear brother said marietta dont crush me by talking about that but if you could have seen yourself as i saw you and could have felt as i felt you would not wonder at me you must forget all that i should be proud now to introduce you as my brother to any doctor or king or president but tell me how you got those beautiful clothes  asaph was sometimes beset by an absurd regard for truth which much annoyed him he could not say that he had worked for the clothes and he did not wish his sister to think that he had run in debt for them theyre paid for every thread of em he said i got em in trade these things is mine and i dont owe no man a cent for em and it seems to me that dinner must be ready  and proud i am said marietta who never before had shown such enthusiastic affection for her brother to sit down to the table with such a nicelooking fellow as you are  the next morning mr rooper came into mrs himess yard and there beheld asaph in all the glory of his new clothes sitting under the chestnuttree smoking the centennial meerschaum pipe mr rooper himself was dressed in his very best clothes but he carried with him no pipe  sit down said asaph and have a smoke  no replied the other i am goin in the house i have come to see your sister  goin to begin already said asaph  yes said the other i told you i was goin to begin today  very good said his friend crossing his pepperandsalt legs and you will finish the 17th of august thats a good reasonable time  but mr rooper had no intention of courting mrs himes for a month he intended to propose to her that very morning he had been turning over the matter in his mind and for several reasons had come to this conclusion in the first place he did not believe that he could trust asaph even for a single day not to oppose him furthermore his mind was in such a turmoil from the combined effect of the constantly present thought that asaph was wearing his clothes his hat and his shoes and smoking his beloved pipe and of the perplexities and agitations consequent upon his sentiments toward mrs himes that he did not believe he could bear the mental strain during another night  five minutes later marietta himes was sitting on the horsehair sofa in the parlor with mr rooper on the horsehair chair opposite to her and not very far away and he was delivering the address which he had prepared  madam said he i am a man that takes things in this world as they comes and is content to wait until the time comes for them to come i was well acquainted with john himes i knowed him in life and i helped lay him out as long as there was reason to suppose that the late mr himesi mean that the grass over the grave of mr himes had remained unwithered i am not the man to take one step in the direction of his shoes nor even to consider the size of em in connection with the measure of my own feet but time will pass on in nater as well as in real life and while i know very well mrs himes that certain feelins toward them that was is like the leaves of the oaktree and cant be blowed off even by the fiercest tempests of affliction still them leaves will wither in the fall and turn brown and curl up at the edges though they dont depart but stick on tight as wax all winter until in the springtime they is pushed off gently without knowin it by the green leaves which come out in real life as well as nater  when he had finished this opening mr rooper breathed a little sigh of relief he had not forgotten any of it and it pleased him  marietta sat and looked at him she had a good sense of humor and while she was naturally surprised at what had been said to her she was greatly amused by it and really wished to hear what else thomas rooper had to say to her  now madam he continued i am not the man to thrash a tree with a pole to knock the leaves off before their time but when the young leaves is pushin and the old leaves is droppin not to make any allusion of course to any shrivellin of proper respect then i come forward madam not to take the place of anybody else but jest as the nateral consequence of the seasons which everybody ought to expect even such as you madam which i may liken to a hemlockspruce which keeps straight on in the same general line of appearance without no reference to the fall of the year nor winter nor summer and so mrs himes i come here today to offer to lead you agin to the altar i have never been there myself and there aint no woman in the world that id go with but you im a straightforward person and when ive got a thing to say i say it and now i have said it and so i set here awaitin your answer  at this moment the shutters of the front window which had been closed were opened and asaph put in his head look here thomas rooper he said these shoes is pegged i didnt bargain for no pegged shoes i wanted em sewed everything was to be firstclass  mr rooper who had been leaning forward in his chair his hands upon his knees and his face glistening with his expressed feelings as brightly as the oldfashioned but shining silk hat which stood on the floor by his side turned his head grew red to the ears and then sprang to his feet asaph scantle he cried with extended fist you have broke your word you hindered  no i didnt said asaph sulkily but pegged shoes is too much for any man to stand and he withdrew from the window closing the shutters again  what does this mean asked mrs himes who had also risen  it means said thomas speaking with difficulty his indignation was so great that your brother is a person of tricks and meanders beyond the reach of common human calculation i dont like to say this of a man who is more or less likely to be my brotherinlaw but i cant help sayin it so entirely upset am i at his goin back on me at such a minute  going back on you asked mrs himes what do you mean what has he promised  thomas hesitated he did not wish to interrupt his courtship by the discussion of any new question especially this question if we could settle what we have been talkin about mrs himes he said and if you would give me my answer then i could git my mind down to commoner things but swingin on a hook as i am i dont know whether my head or my heels is uppermost or whats revolvin around me  oh i can give you your answer quickly enough she said it is impossible for me to marry you so thats all settled  impossible is a big word said mr rooper has anybody else got afore me  i am not bound to answer that question said marietta slightly coloring but i cannot accept you mr rooper  then theres somebody else of course said thomas gazing darkly upon the floor and whats more asaph knew it thats just as clear as daylight thats what made him come to me yesterday and go back on his first bargain  now then said mrs himes speaking very decidedly i want to know what you mean by this talk about bargains  mr rooper knit his brows this is mighty different talk he said from the kind i expected when i come here but you have answered my question now ill answer yours asaph scantle no longer ago than day before yesterday after hearin that things wasnt goin very well with me recommended me to marry you and agreed that he would do his level best by day and by night to help me git you if i would give him a suit of clothes an umbrella and a dictionary  at this mrs himes gave a little gasp and sat down  now i hadnt no thoughts of tradin for a wife continued thomas especially in woollen goods and books but when i considered and turned the matter over in my mind and thought what a woman you was and what a life there was afore me if i got you i agreed to do it then he wanted pay aforehand and that i wouldnt agree to not because i thought you wasnt wuth it but because i couldnt trust him if anybody offered him more before i got you but that aint the wust of it yesterday he come down to see me and went back on his bargain and that after i had spent the whole night thinkin of you and what i was goin to say and he put on such highcockalorum airs that i bein as soft as mush around the heart jest wilted and agreed to give him everything he bargained for if he would promise not to hinder but he wasnt satisfied with that and wouldnt come to no terms until id give him my centennial pipe whats been like a child to me this many a year and when he saw how disgruntled i was at sich a loss he said that my pipe might be very dear to me but his sister was jest as dear to him and then on top of the whole thing he pokes his head through the shutters and hinders jest at the most ticklish moment  a dictionary and a pipe ejaculated poor marietta her eyes fixed upon the floor  but im goin to make him give em all back exclaimed thomas they was the price of not hinderin and he hindered  he shall give them back said marietta rising but you must understand mr rooper that in no way did asaph interfere with your marrying me that was a matter with which he did have and could have nothing to do and now i wish you could get away without speaking to him i do not want any quarrelling or high words here and i will see him and arrange the matter better than you can do it  oh i can git away without speakin to him said mr rooper with reddened face and so saying he strode out of the house through the front yard and out of the gate without turning his head toward asaph still sitting under the tree  oh ho said the latter to himself shes bounced him short and sharp and it serves him right too after playin that trick on me pegged shoes indeed  at this moment the word asaph came from the house in tones shriller and sharper and higher than any in which he had ever heard it pronounced before he sprang to his feet and went to the house his sister took him into the parlor and shut the door her eyes were red and her face was pale asaph said she mr rooper has told me the whole of your infamous conduct now i know what you meant when you said that you were making arrangements to get clothes you were going to sell me for them and when you found out that i was likely to marry doctor wicker you put up your price and wanted a dictionary and a pipe  no marietta said asaph the dictionary belonged to the first bargain if you knew how i need a dictionary  be still she cried i do not want you to say a word you have acted most shamefully toward me and i want you to go away this very day and before you go you must give back to mr rooper everything that you got from him i will fit you out with some of mr himess clothes and make no conditions at all only that you shall go away come upstairs with me and i will get the clothes  the room in the garret was opened and various garments which had belonged to the late mr himes were brought out  this is pretty hard on me marietta said asaph as he held up a coat to give up new allwool goods for things what has been worn and is part cotton if i am a judge  marietta said very little she gave him what clothes he needed and insisted on his putting them on making a package of the things he had received from mr rooper and returning them to that gentleman asaph at first grumbled but he finally obeyed with a willingness which might have excited the suspicions of marietta had she not been so angry  with an enormous package wrapped in brown paper in one hand and a cane an umbrella and a very small handbag in the other asaph approached the tavern mr rooper was sitting on the piazza alone he was smoking a very commonlooking clay pipe and gazing intently into the air in front of him when his old crony came and stood before the piazza he did not turn his head nor his eyes  thomas rooper said asaph you have got me into a very bad scrape i have been turned out of doors on account of what you said about me and where i am goin i dont know for i cant walk to drummondville and whats more i kept my word and you didnt i didnt hinder you for how could i suppose that you was goin to pop the question the very minute you got inside the door and that dictionary you promised ive not got  thomas rooper answered not a word but looked steadily in front of him and theres another thing said asaph what are you goin to allow me for that suit of clothes what ive been wearin what i took off in your room and left there  at this mr rooper sprang to his feet with such violence that the fire danced out of the bowl of his pipe what is the fare to drummondville he cried  asaph reflected a moment three dollars and fifty cents includin supper  ill give you that for them clothes said the other and counted out the money  asaph took it and sighed youve been hard on me thomas said he but i bear you no grudge goodby  as he walked slowly toward the station mr scantle stopped at the store has that dictionary come that was ordered for me he said and when told that it could not be expected for several days he did not despair for it was possible that thomas rooper might be so angry that he would forget to countermand the order in that case he might yet hope to obtain the coveted book  the package containing the rooper winter suit was heavy and asaph walked slowly he did not want to go to drummondville for he hated bookkeeping and his year of leisure and good living had spoiled him for work and poor fare in this moody state he was very glad to stop and have a little chat with mrs mcjimsey who was sitting at her front window  this good lady was the principal dressmaker of the village and by hard work and attention to business she made a very comfortable living she was a widow small of stature thin of feature very neatly dressed and pleasant to look at asaph entered the little front yard put his package on the doorstep and stood under the window to talk to her dressed in the clothes of the late mr himes her visitor presented such a respectable appearance that mrs mcjimsey was not in the least ashamed to have people see him standing there which she would have been a few days ago indeed she felt complimented that he should want to stop the conversation soon turned upon her removal from her present abode  im awfully sorry to have to go she said for my time is up just in the middle of my busy season and thats goin to throw me back dreadfully he hasnt done right by me that mr rooper in lettin things go to rack and ruin in this way and me payin his rent so regular  thats true said asaph thomas rooper is a hard mana hard man mrs mcjimsey i can see how he would be overbearin with a lone woman like you neither your son nor your daughter bein of age yet to take your part  yes mr scantle its very hard  asaph stood for a moment looking at a little bed of zinnias by the side of the doorstep what you want mrs mcjimsey said he is a man in the house  in an instant mrs mcjimsey flushed pink it was such a strange thing for a gentleman to say to her  asaph saw the flush he had not expected that result from his remark but he was quick to take advantage of it mrs mcjimsey said he you are a widow and you are imposed upon and you need somebody to take care of you if you will put that job into my hands i will do it i am a man what works with his head and if you will let me ill work for you to put it square i ask you to marry me my sisters goin to be married and im on the pint of goin away for i could not abear to stay in her house when strangers come into it but if you say the word ill stay here and be yours for ever and ever more  mrs mcjimsey said not a word but her head drooped and wild thoughts ran through her brain thoughts not wild but well trained and broken ran through asaphs brain the idea of going to drummondville and spending for the journey thither a dollar and seventyfive cents of the money he had received from mr rooper now became absolutely repulsive to him  mrs mcjimsey said he i will say more not only do i ask you to marry me but i ask you to do it now the evenin sun is settin the evenin birds is singin and it seems to me mrs mcjimsey that all nater pints to this softenin hour as a marryin moment you say your son wont be home from his work until suppertime and your daughter has gone out for a walk come with me to mr parkers the methodist minister and let us join hands at the altar there the gardener and his wife is always ready to stand up as witnesses and when your son and your daughter comes home to supper they can find their mother here afore em married and settled  but mr scantle exclaimed mrs mcjimsey its so suddint what will the neighbors say  as for bein suddint mrs mcjimsey ive knowed you for nearly a year and now bein on the way to leave whats been my happy home i couldnt keep the truth from you no longer and as for the neighbors they neednt know that we haint been engaged for months  its so queer so very queer said the little dressmaker and her face flushed again and there were tears not at all sorrowful ones in her eyes and her somewhat needlepricked left hand accidentally laid itself upon the windowsill in easy reach of any one outside  the next morning mr rooper being of a practical way of thinking turned his thoughts from love and resentment to the subject of his income and he soon became convinced that it would be better to keep the mcjimseys in his house if it could be done without too great an outlay for repairs so he walked over to his property when he reached the house he was almost stupefied to see asaph in a chair in the front yard dressed in the new suit of clothes which he thomas rooper had paid for and smoking the centennial pipe  goodmorning mr rooper said asaph in a loud and cheery voice i suppose youve come to talk to mrs mcjimsey about the work youve got to do here to make this house fit to live in but there aint no mrs mcjimsey shes mrs scantle now and im your tenant you can talk to me  doctor wicker came to see mrs himes in the afternoon of the day he had promised to come and early in the autumn they were married since asaph scantle had married and settled he had not seen his sister nor spoken to her but he determined that on so joyful an occasion as this he would show no resentment so he attended the wedding in the village church dressed in the suit of clothes which had belonged to the late mr himes     his wifes deceased sister   it is now five years since an event occurred which so colored my life or rather so changed some of its original colors that i have thought it well to write an account of it deeming that its lessons may be of advantage to persons whose situations in life are similar to my own  when i was quite a young man i adopted literature as a profession and having passed through the necessary preparatory grades i found myself after a good many years of hard and often unremunerative work in possession of what might be called a fair literary practice my articles grave gay practical or fanciful had come to be considered with a favor by the editors of the various periodicals for which i wrote on which i found in time i could rely with a very comfortable certainty my productions created no enthusiasm in the reading public they gave me no great reputation or very valuable pecuniary return but they were always accepted and my receipts from them at the time to which i have referred were as regular and reliable as a salary and quite sufficient to give me more than a comfortable support  it was at this time i married i had been engaged for more than a year but had not been willing to assume the support of a wife until i felt that my pecuniary position was so assured that i could do so with full satisfaction to my own conscience there was now no doubt in regard to this position either in my mind or in that of my wife i worked with great steadiness and regularity i knew exactly where to place the productions of my pen and could calculate with a fair degree of accuracy the sums i should receive for them we were by no means rich but we had enough and were thoroughly satisfied and content  those of my readers who are married will have no difficulty in remembering the peculiar ecstasy of the first weeks of their wedded life it is then that the flowers of this world bloom brightest that its sun is the most genial that its clouds are the scarcest that its fruit is the most delicious that the air is the most balmy that its cigars are of the highest flavor that the warmth and radiance of early matrimonial felicity so rarefies the intellectual atmosphere that the soul mounts higher and enjoys a wider prospect than ever before  these experiences were mine the plain claret of my mind was changed to sparkling champagne and at the very height of its effervescence i wrote a story the happy thought that then struck me for a tale was of a very peculiar character and it interested me so much that i went to work at it with great delight and enthusiasm and finished it in a comparatively short time the title of the story was his wifes deceased sister and when i read it to hypatia she was delighted with it and at times was so affected by its pathos that her uncontrollable emotion caused a sympathetic dimness in my eyes which prevented my seeing the words i had written when the reading was ended and my wife had dried her eyes she turned to me and said this story will make your fortune there has been nothing so pathetic since lamartines history of a servantgirl  as soon as possible the next day i sent my story to the editor of the periodical for which i wrote most frequently and in which my best productions generally appeared in a few days i had a letter from the editor in which he praised my story as he had never before praised anything from my pen it had interested and charmed he said not only himself but all his associates in the office even old gibson who never cared to read anything until it was in proof and who never praised anything which had not a joke in it was induced by the example of the others to read this manuscript and shed as he asserted the first tears that had come from his eyes since his final paternal castigation some forty years before the story would appear the editor assured me as soon as he could possibly find room for it  if anything could make our skies more genial our flowers brighter and the flavor of our fruit and cigars more delicious it was a letter like this and when in a very short time the story was published we found that the reading public was inclined to receive it with as much sympathetic interest and favor as had been shown to it by the editors my personal friends soon began to express enthusiastic opinions upon it it was highly praised in many of the leading newspapers and altogether it was a great literary success i am not inclined to be vain of my writings and in general my wife tells me think too little of them but i did feel a good deal of pride and satisfaction in the success of his wifes deceased sister if it did not make my fortune as my wife asserted that it would it certainly would help me very much in my literary career  in less than a month from the writing of this story something very unusual and unexpected happened to me a manuscript was returned by the editor of the periodical in which his wifes deceased sister had appeared it is a good story he wrote but not equal to what you have just done you have made a great hit and it would not do to interfere with the reputation you have gained by publishing anything inferior to his wifes deceased sister which has had such a deserved success  i was so unaccustomed to having my work thrown back on my hands that i think i must have turned a little pale when i read the letter i said nothing of the matter to my wife for it would be foolish to drop such grains of sand as this into the smoothly oiled machinery of our domestic felicity but i immediately sent the story to another editor i am not able to express the astonishment i felt when in the course of a week it was sent back to me the tone of the note accompanying it indicated a somewhat injured feeling on the part of the editor i am reluctant he said to decline a manuscript from you but you know very well that if you sent me anything like his wifes deceased sister it would be most promptly accepted  i now felt obliged to speak of the affair to my wife who was quite as much surprised though perhaps not quite as much shocked as i had been  let us read the story again she said and see what is the matter with it when we had finished its perusal hypatia remarked it is quite as good as many of the stories you have had printed and i think it very interesting although of course it is not equal to his wifes deceased sister  of course not said i that was an inspiration that i cannot expect every day but there must be something wrong about this last story which we do not perceive perhaps my recent success may have made me a little careless in writing it  i dont believe that said hypatia  at any rate i continued i will lay it aside and will go to work on a new one  in due course of time i had another manuscript finished and i sent it to my favorite periodical it was retained some weeks and then came back to me it will never do the editor wrote quite warmly for you to go backward the demand for the number containing his wifes deceased sister still continues and we do not intend to let you disappoint that great body of readers who would be so eager to see another number containing one of your stories  i sent this manuscript to four other periodicals and from each of them was it returned with remarks to the effect that although it was not a bad story in itself it was not what they would expect from the author of his wifes deceased sister  the editor of a western magazine wrote to me for a story to be published in a special number which he would issue for the holidays i wrote him one of the character and length he asked for and sent it to him by return mail it came back to me i had hoped the editor wrote when i asked for a story from your pen to receive something like his wifes deceased sister and i must own that i am very much disappointed  i was so filled with anger when i read this note that i openly objurgated his wifes deceased sister you must excuse me i said to my astonished wife for expressing myself thus in your presence but that confounded story will be the ruin of me yet until it is forgotten nobody will ever take anything i write  and you cannot expect it ever to be forgotten said hypatia with tears in her eyes  it is needless for me to detail my literary efforts in the course of the next few months the ideas of the editors with whom my principal business had been done in regard to my literary ability had been so raised by my unfortunate story of his wifes deceased sister that i found it was of no use to send them anything of lesser merit and as to the other journals which i tried they evidently considered it an insult for me to send them matter inferior to that by which my reputation had lately risen the fact was that my successful story had ruined me my income was at end and want actually stared me in the face and i must admit that i did not like the expression of its countenance it was of no use for me to try to write another story like his wifes deceased sister i could not get married every time i began a new manuscript and it was the exaltation of mind caused by my wedded felicity which produced that story  its perfectly dreadful said my wife if i had had a sister and she had died i would have thought it was my fault  it could not be your fault i answered and i do not think it was mine i had no intention of deceiving anybody into the belief that i could do that sort of thing every time and it ought not to be expected of me suppose raphaels patrons had tried to keep him screwed up to the pitch of the sistine madonna and had refused to buy anything which was not as good as that in that case i think he would have occupied a much earlier and narrower grave than that on which mr morris moore hangs his funeral decorations  but my dear said hypatia who was posted on such subjects the sistine madonna was one of his latest paintings  very true said i but if he had married as i did he would have painted it earlier  i was walking homeward one afternoon about this time when i met barbela man i had known well in my early literary career he was now about fifty years of age but looked older his hair and beard were quite gray and his clothes which were of the same general hue gave me the idea that they like his hair had originally been black age is very hard on a mans external appointments barbel had an air of having been to let for a long time and quite out of repair but there was a kindly gleam in his eye and he welcomed me cordially  why what is the matter old fellow said he i never saw you look so woebegone  i had no reason to conceal anything from barbel in my younger days he had been of great use to me and he had a right to know the state of my affairs i laid the whole case plainly before him  look here he said when i had finished come with me to my room i have something i would like to say to you there  i followed barbel to his room it was at the top of a very dirty and wellworn house which stood in a narrow and lumpy street into which few vehicles ever penetrated except the ash and garbage carts and the rickety wagons of the venders of stale vegetables  this is not exactly a fashionable promenade said barbel as we approached the house but in some respects it reminds me of the streets in italian towns where the palaces lean over toward each other in such a friendly way  barbels room was to my mind rather more doleful than the street it was dark it was dusty and cobwebs hung from every corner the few chairs upon the floor and the books upon a greasy table seemed to be afflicted with some dorsal epidemic for their backs were either gone or broken a little bedstead in the corner was covered with a spread made of new york heralds with their edges pasted together  there is nothing better said barbel noticing my glance toward this novel counterpane for a bedcovering than newspapers they keep you as warm as a blanket and are much lighter i used to use tribunes but they rattled too much  the only part of the room which was well lighted was at one end near the solitary window here upon a table with a spliced leg stood a little grindstone  at the other end of the room said barbel is my cookstove which you cant see unless i light the candle in the bottle which stands by it but if you dont care particularly to examine it i wont go to the expense of lighting up you might pick up a good many odd pieces of bricàbrac around here if you chose to strike a match and investigate but i would not advise you to do so it would pay better to throw the things out of the window than to carry them downstairs the particular piece of indoor decoration to which i wish to call your attention is this and he led me to a little wooden frame which hung against the wall near the window behind a dusty piece of glass it held what appeared to be a leaf from a small magazine or journal there said he you see a page from the grasshopper a humorous paper which flourished in this city some halfdozen years ago i used to write regularly for that paper as you may remember  oh yes indeed i exclaimed and i shall never forget your conundrum of the anvil which appeared in it how often have i laughed at that most wonderful conceit and how often have i put it to my friends  barbel gazed at me silently for a moment and then he pointed to the frame that printed page he said solemnly contains the conundrum of the anvil i hang it there so that i can see it while i work that conundrum ruined me it was the last thing i wrote for the grasshopper how i ever came to imagine it i cannot tell it is one of those things which occur to a man but once in a lifetime after the wild shout of delight with which the public greeted that conundrum my subsequent efforts met with hoots of derision the grasshopper turned its hind legs upon me i sank from bad to worsemuch worseuntil at last i found myself reduced to my present occupation which is that of grinding points to pins by this i procure my bread coffee and tobacco and sometimes potatoes and meat one day while i was hard at work an organgrinder came into the street below he played the serenade from trovatore and the familiar notes brought back visions of old days and old delights when the successful writer wore good clothes and sat at operas when he looked into sweet eyes and talked of italian airs when his future appeared all a succession of bright scenery and joyous acts without any provision for a dropcurtain and as my ear listened and my mind wandered in this happy retrospect my every faculty seemed exalted and without any thought upon the matter i ground points upon my pins so fine so regular and smooth that they would have pierced with ease the leather of a boot or slipped among without abrasion the finest threads of rare old lace when the organ stopped and i fell back into my real world of cobwebs and mustiness i gazed upon the pins i had just ground and without a moments hesitation i threw them into the street and reported the lot as spoiled this cost me a little money but it saved me my livelihood  after a few moments of silence barbel resumed  i have no more to say to you my young friend all i want you to do is to look upon that framed conundrum then upon this grindstone and then to go home and reflect as for me i have a gross of pins to grind before the sun goes down  i cannot say that my depression of mind was at all relieved by what i had seen and heard i had lost sight of barbel for some years and i had supposed him still floating on the sunsparkling stream of prosperity where i had last seen him it was a great shock to me to find him in such a condition of poverty and squalor and to see a man who had originated the conundrum of the anvil reduced to the souldepressing occupation of grinding pinpoints as i walked and thought the dreadful picture of a totally eclipsed future arose before my mind the moral of barbel sank deep into my heart  when i reached home i told my wife the story of my friend barbel she listened with a sad and eager interest  i am afraid she said if our fortunes do not quickly mend that we shall have to buy two little grindstones you know i could help you at that sort of thing  for a long time we sat together and talked and devised many plans for the future i did not think it necessary yet for me to look out for a pincontract but i must find some way of making money or we should starve to death of course the first thing that suggested itself was the possibility of finding some other business but apart from the difficulty of immediately obtaining remunerative work in occupations to which i had not been trained i felt a great and natural reluctance to give up a profession for which i had carefully prepared myself and which i had adopted as my lifework it would be very hard for me to lay down my pen forever and to close the top of my inkstand upon all the bright and happy fancies which i had seen mirrored in its tranquil pool we talked and pondered the rest of that day and a good deal of the night but we came to no conclusion as to what it would be best for us to do  the next day i determined to go and call upon the editor of the journal for which in happier days before the blight of his wifes deceased sister rested upon me i used most frequently to write and having frankly explained my condition to him to ask his advice the editor was a good man and had always been my friend he listened with great attention to what i told him and evidently sympathized with me in my trouble  as we have written to you he said the only reason why we did not accept the manuscripts you sent us was that they would have disappointed the high hopes that the public had formed in regard to you we have had letter after letter asking when we were going to publish another story like his wifes deceased sister we felt and we still feel that it would be wrong to allow you to destroy the fair fabric which yourself has raised but he added with a kind smile i see very plainly that your welldeserved reputation will be of little advantage to you if you should starve at the moment that its genial beams are so to speak lighting you up  its beams are not genial i answered they have scorched and withered me  how would you like said the editor after a short reflection to allow us to publish the stories you have recently written under some other name than your own that would satisfy us and the public would put money in your pocket and would not interfere with your reputation  joyfully i seized that noble fellow by the hand and instantly accepted his proposition of course said i a reputation is a very good thing but no reputation can take the place of food clothes and a house to live in and i gladly agree to sink my overillumined name into oblivion and to appear before the public as a new and unknown writer  i hope that need not be for long he said for i feel sure that you will yet write stories as good as his wifes deceased sister  all the manuscripts i had on hand i now sent to my good friend the editor and in due and proper order they appeared in his journal under the name of john darmstadt which i had selected as a substitute for my own permanently disabled i made a similar arrangement with other editors and john darmstadt received the credit of everything that proceeded from my pen our circumstances now became very comfortable and occasionally we even allowed ourselves to indulge in little dreams of prosperity  time passed on very pleasantly one year another and then a little son was born to us it is often difficult i believe for thoughtful persons to decide whether the beginning of their conjugal career or the earliest weeks in the life of their firstborn be the happiest and proudest period of their existence for myself i can only say that the same exaltation of mind the same rarefication of idea and invention which succeeded upon my weddingday came upon me now as then my ecstatic emotions crystallized themselves into a motive for a story and without delay i set myself to work upon it my boy was about six weeks old when the manuscript was finished and one evening as we sat before a comfortable fire in our sittingroom with the curtains drawn and the soft lamp lighted and the baby sleeping soundly in the adjoining chamber i read the story to my wife  when i had finished my wife arose and threw herself into my arms i was never so proud of you she said her glad eyes sparkling as i am at this moment that is a wonderful story it isindeed i am sure it isjust as good as his wifes deceased sister  as she spoke these words a sudden and chilling sensation crept over us both all her warmth and fervor and the proud and happy glow engendered within me by this praise and appreciation from one i loved vanished in an instant we stepped apart and gazed upon each other with pallid faces in the same moment the terrible truth had flashed upon us both  this story was as good as his wifes deceased sister  we stood silent the exceptional lot of barbels superpointed pins seemed to pierce our very souls a dreadful vision rose before me of an impending fall and crash in which our domestic happiness should vanish and our prospects for our boy be wrecked just as we had begun to build them up  my wife approached me and took my hand in hers which was as cold as ice be strong and firm she said a great danger threatens us but you must brace yourself against it be strong and firm  i pressed her hand and we said no more that night  the next day i took the manuscript i had just written and carefully infolded it in stout wrappingpaper then i went to a neighboring grocerystore and bought a small strong tin box originally intended for biscuit with a cover that fitted tightly in this i placed my manuscript and then i took the box to a tinsmith and had the top fastened on with hard solder when i went home i ascended into the garret and brought down to my study a ships cashbox which had once belonged to one of my family who was a seacaptain this box was very heavy and firmly bound with iron and was secured by two massive locks calling my wife i told her of the contents of the tin case which i then placed in the box and having shut down the heavy lid i doubly locked it  this key said i putting it in my pocket i shall throw into the river when i go out this afternoon  my wife watched me eagerly with a pallid and firm set countenance but upon which i could see the faint glimmer of returning happiness  wouldnt it be well she said to secure it still further by sealingwax and pieces of tape  no said i i do not believe that any one will attempt to tamper with our prosperity and now my dear i continued in an impressive voice no one but you and in the course of time our son shall know that this manuscript exists when i am dead those who survive me may if they see fit cause this box to be split open and the story published the reputation it may give my name cannot harm me then     the lady or the tiger   in the very olden time there lived a semibarbaric king whose ideas though somewhat polished and sharpened by the progressiveness of distant latin neighbors were still large florid and untrammelled as became the half of him which was barbaric he was a man of exuberant fancy and withal of an authority so irresistible that at his will he turned his varied fancies into facts he was greatly given to selfcommuning and when he and himself agreed upon anything the thing was done when every member of his domestic and political systems moved smoothly in its appointed course his nature was bland and genial but whenever there was a little hitch and some of his orbs got out of their orbits he was blander and more genial still for nothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush down uneven places  among the borrowed notions by which his barbarism had become semified was that of the public arena in which by exhibitions of manly and beastly valor the minds of his subjects were refined and cultured  but even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy asserted itself the arena of the king was built not to give the people an opportunity of hearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators nor to enable them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and hungry jaws but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop the mental energies of the people this vast amphitheatre with its encircling galleries its mysterious vaults and its unseen passages was an agent of poetic justice in which crime was punished or virtue rewarded by the decrees of an impartial and incorruptible chance  when a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to interest the king public notice was given that on an appointed day the fate of the accused person would be decided in the kings arenaa structure which well deserved its name for although its form and plan were borrowed from afar its purpose emanated solely from the brain of this man who every barleycorn a king knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance than pleased his fancy and who ingrafted on every adopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism  when all the people had assembled in the galleries and the king surrounded by his court sat high up on his throne of royal state on one side of the arena he gave a signal a door beneath him opened and the accused subject stepped out into the amphitheatre directly opposite him on the other side of the enclosed space were two doors exactly alike and side by side it was the duty and the privilege of the person on trial to walk directly to these doors and open one of them he could open either door he pleased he was subject to no guidance or influence but that of the aforementioned impartial and incorruptible chance if he opened the one there came out of it a hungry tiger the fiercest and most cruel that could be procured which immediately sprang upon him and tore him to pieces as a punishment for his guilt the moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided doleful iron bells were clanged great wails went up from the hired mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena and the vast audience with bowed heads and downcast hearts wended slowly their homeward way mourning greatly that one so young and fair or so old and respected should have merited so dire a fate  but if the accused person opened the other door there came forth from it a lady the most suitable to his years and station that his majesty could select among his fair subjects and to this lady he was immediately married as a reward of his innocence it mattered not that he might already possess a wife and family or that his affections might be engaged upon an object of his own selection the king allowed no such subordinate arrangements to interfere with his great scheme of retribution and reward the exercises as in the other instance took place immediately and in the arena another door opened beneath the king and a priest followed by a band of choristers and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns and treading an epithalamic measure advanced to where the pair stood side by side and the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized then the gay brass bells rang forth their merry peals the people shouted glad hurrahs and the innocent man preceded by children strewing flowers on his path led his bride to his home  this was the kings semibarbaric method of administering justice its perfect fairness is obvious the criminal could not know out of which door would come the lady he opened either he pleased without having the slightest idea whether in the next instant he was to be devoured or married on some occasions the tiger came out of one door and on some out of the other the decisions of this tribunal were not only fair they were positively determinate the accused person was instantly punished if he found himself guilty and if innocent he was rewarded on the spot whether he liked it or not there was no escape from the judgments of the kings arena  the institution was a very popular one when the people gathered together on one of the great trialdays they never knew whether they were to witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding this element of uncertainty lent an interest to the occasion which it could not otherwise have attained thus the masses were entertained and pleased and the thinking part of the community could bring no charge of unfairness against this plan for did not the accused person have the whole matter in his own hands  this semibarbaric king had a daughter as blooming as his most florid fancies and with a soul as fervent and imperious as his own as is usual in such cases she was the apple of his eye and was loved by him above all humanity among his courtiers was a young man of that fineness of blood and lowness of station common to the conventional heroes of romance who love royal maidens this royal maiden was well satisfied with her lover for he was handsome and brave to a degree unsurpassed in all this kingdom and she loved him with an ardor that had enough of barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and strong this loveaffair moved on happily for many months until one day the king happened to discover its existence he did not hesitate nor waver in regard to his duty in the premises the youth was immediately cast into prison and a day was appointed for his trial in the kings arena this of course was an especially important occasion and his majesty as well as all the people was greatly interested in the workings and development of this trial never before had such a case occurred never before had a subject dared to love the daughter of a king in afteryears such things became commonplace enough but then they were in no slight degree novel and startling  the tigercages of the kingdom were searched for the most savage and relentless beasts from which the fiercest monster might be selected for the arena and the ranks of maiden youth and beauty throughout the land were carefully surveyed by competent judges in order that the young man might have a fitting bride in case fate did not determine for him a different destiny of course everybody knew that the deed with which the accused was charged had been done he had loved the princess and neither he she nor any one else thought of denying the fact but the king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere with the workings of the tribunal in which he took such great delight and satisfaction no matter how the affair turned out the youth would be disposed of and the king would take an æsthetic pleasure in watching the course of events which would determine whether or not the young man had done wrong in allowing himself to love the princess  the appointed day arrived from far and near the people gathered and thronged the great galleries of the arena and crowds unable to gain admittance massed themselves against its outside walls the king and his court were in their places opposite the twin doorsthose fateful portals so terrible in their similarity  all was ready the signal was given a door beneath the royal party opened and the lover of the princess walked into the arena tall beautiful fair his appearance was greeted with a low hum of admiration and anxiety half the audience had not known so grand a youth had lived among them no wonder the princess loved him what a terrible thing for him to be there  as the youth advanced into the arena he turned as the custom was to bow to the king but he did not think at all of that royal personage his eyes were fixed upon the princess who sat to the right of her father had it not been for the moiety of barbarism in her nature it is probable that lady would not have been there but her intense and fervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an occasion in which she was so terribly interested from the moment that the decree had gone forth that her lover should decide his fate in the kings arena she had thought of nothing night or day but this great event and the various subjects connected with it possessed of more power influence and force of character than any one who had ever before been interested in such a case she had done what no other person had doneshe had possessed herself of the secret of the doors she knew in which of the two rooms that lay behind those doors stood the cage of the tiger with its open front and in which waited the lady through these thick doors heavily curtained with skins on the inside it was impossible that any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who should approach to raise the latch of one of them but gold and the power of a womans will had brought the secret to the princess  and not only did she know in which room stood the lady ready to emerge all blushing and radiant should her door be opened but she knew who the lady was it was one of the fairest and loveliest of the damsels of the court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth should he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far above him and the princess hated her often had she seen or imagined that she had seen this fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon the person of her lover and sometimes she thought these glances were perceived and even returned now and then she had seen them talking together it was but for a moment or two but much can be said in a brief space it may have been on most unimportant topics but how could she know that the girl was lovely but she had dared to raise her eyes to the loved one of the princess and with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly barbaric ancestors she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind that silent door  when her lover turned and looked at her and his eye met hers as she sat there paler and whiter than any one in the vast ocean of anxious faces about her he saw by that power of quick perception which is given to those whose souls are one that she knew behind which door crouched the tiger and behind which stood the lady he had expected her to know it he understood her nature and his soul was assured that she would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing hidden to all other lookerson even to the king the only hope for the youth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the success of the princess in discovering this mystery and the moment he looked upon her he saw she had succeeded as in his soul he knew she would succeed  then it was that his quick and anxious glance asked the question which it was as plain to her as if he shouted it from where he stood there was not an instant to be lost the question was asked in a flash it must be answered in another  her right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before her she raised her hand and made a slight quick movement toward the right no one but her lover saw her every eye but his was fixed on the man in the arena  he turned and with a firm and rapid step he walked across the empty space every heart stopped beating every breath was held every eye was fixed immovably upon that man without the slightest hesitation he went to the door on the right and opened it                                       now the point of the story is this did the tiger come out of that door or did the lady  the more we reflect upon this question the harder it is to answer it involves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious mazes of passion out of which it is difficult to find our way think of it fair reader not as if the decision of the question depended upon yourself but upon that hotblooded semibarbaric princess her soul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and jealousy she had lost him but who should have him  how often in her waking hours and in her dreams had she started in wild horror and covered her face with her hands as she thought of her lover opening the door on the other side of which waited the cruel fangs of the tiger  but how much oftener had she seen him at the other door how in her grievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth and torn her hair when she saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the lady how her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to meet that woman with her flushing cheek and sparkling eye of triumph when she had seen him lead her forth his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life when she had heard the glad shouts from the multitude and the wild ringing of the happy bells when she had seen the priest with his joyous followers advance to the couple and make them man and wife before her very eyes and when she had seen them walk away together upon their path of flowers followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned  would it not be better for him to die at once and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semibarbaric futurity  and yet that awful tiger those shrieks that blood  her decision had been indicated in an instant but it had been made after days and nights of anguished deliberation she had known she would be asked she had decided what she would answer and without the slightest hesitation she had moved her hand to the right  the question of her decision is one not to be lightly considered and it is not for me to presume to set myself up as the one person able to answer it and so i leave it with all of you which came out of the opened doorthe lady or the tiger     the remarkable wreck of the thomas hyke   it was halfpast one by the clock in the office of the registrar of woes the room was empty for it was wednesday and the registrar always went home early on wednesday afternoons he had made that arrangement when he accepted the office he was willing to serve his fellowcitizens in any suitable position to which he might be called but he had private interests which could not be neglected he belonged to his country but there was a house in the country which belonged to him and there were a great many things appertaining to that house which needed attention especially in pleasant summer weather it is true he was often absent on afternoons which did not fall on the wednesday but the fact of his having appointed a particular time for the furtherance of his outside interests so emphasized their importance that his associates in the office had no difficulty in understanding that affairs of such moment could not always be attended to in a single afternoon of the week  but although the large room devoted to the especial use of the registrar was unoccupied there were other rooms connected with it which were not in that condition with the suite of offices to the left we have nothing to do but will confine our attention to a moderatesized room to the right of the registrars office and connected by a door now closed with that large and handsomely furnished chamber this was the office of the clerk of shipwrecks and it was at present occupied by five persons one of these was the clerk himself a man of goodly appearance somewhere between twentyfive and fortyfive years of age and of a demeanor such as might be supposed to belong to one who had occupied a high position in state affairs but who by the cabals of his enemies had been forced to resign the great operations of statesmanship which he had been directing and who now stood with a quite resigned air pointing out to the populace the futile and disastrous efforts of the incompetent one who was endeavoring to fill his place the clerk of shipwrecks had never fallen from such a position having never occupied one but he had acquired the demeanor referred to without going through the preliminary exercises  another occupant was a very young man the personal clerk of the registrar of woes who always closed all the doors of the office of that functionary on wednesday afternoons and at other times when outside interests demanded his principals absence after which he betook himself to the room of his friend the shipwreck clerk  then there was a middleaged man named mathers also a friend of the clerk and who was one of the eight who had made application for a subposition in this department which was now filled by a man who was expected to resign when a friend of his a gentleman of influence in an interior county should succeed in procuring the nomination as congressional representative of his district of an influential politician whose election was considered assured in case certain expected action on the part of the administration should bring his party into power the person now occupying the subposition hoped then to get something better and mathers consequently was very willing while waiting for the place to visit the offices of the department and acquaint himself with its duties  a fourth person was j george watts a juryman by profession who had brought with him his brotherinlaw a stranger in the city  the shipwreck clerk had taken off his good coat which he had worn to luncheon and had replaced it by a lighter garment of linen much bespattered with ink and he now produced a cigarbox containing six cigars  gents said he here is the fag end of a box of cigars its not like having the pick of a box but they are all i have left  mr mathers j george watts and the brotherinlaw each took a cigar with that careless yet deferential manner which always distinguishes the treatee from the treator and then the box was protruded in an offhand way toward harry covare the personal clerk of the registrar but this young man declined saying that he preferred cigarettes a package of which he drew from his pocket he had very often seen that cigarbox with a havana brand which he himself had brought from the other room after the registrar had emptied it passed around with six cigars no more nor less and he was wise enough to know that the shipwreck clerk did not expect to supply him with smokingmaterial if that gentleman had offered to the friends who generally dropped in on him on wednesday afternoon the paper bag of cigars sold at five cents each when bought singly but half a dozen for a quarter of a dollar they would have been quite as thankfully received but it better pleased his deprecative soul to put them in an empty cigarbox and thus throw around them the halo of the presumption that ninetyfour of their imported companions had been smoked  the shipwreck clerk having lighted a cigar for himself sat down in his revolving chair turned his back to his desk and threw himself into an easy crosslegged attitude which showed that he was perfectly at home in that office harry covare mounted a high stool while the visitors seated themselves in three wooden armchairs but few words had been said and each man had scarcely tossed his first tobaccoashes on the floor when some one wearing heavy boots was heard opening an outside door and entering the registrars room harry covare jumped down from his stool laid his halfsmoked cigarette thereon and bounced into the next room closing the door after him in about a minute he returned and the shipwreck clerk looked at him inquiringly  an old cock in a peajacket said mr covare taking up his cigarette and mounting his stool i told him the registrar would be here in the morning he said he had something to report about a shipwreck and i told him the registrar would be here in the morning had to tell him that three times and then he went  school dont keep wednesday afternoons said mr j george watts with a knowing smile  no sir said the shipwreck clerk emphatically changing the crossing of his legs a man cant keep grinding on day in and out without breaking down outsiders may say what they please about it but it cant be done weve got to let up sometimes people who do the work need the rest just as much as those who do the looking on  and more too i should say observed mr mathers  our little letup on wednesday afternoons modestly observed harry covare is like deathit is sure to come while the letups we get other days are more like the diseases which prevail in certain areasyou cant be sure whether youre going to get them or not  the shipwreck clerk smiled benignantly at this remark and the rest laughed mr mathers had heard it before but he would not impair the pleasantness of his relations with a future colleague by hinting that he remembered it  he gets such ideas from his beastly statistics said the shipwreck clerk  which come pretty heavy on him sometimes i expect observed mr mathers  they neednt said the shipwreck clerk if things were managed here as they ought to be if john j laylormeaning thereby the registrarwas the right kind of a man youd see things very different here from what they are now thered be a larger force  thats so said mr mathers  and not only that but thered be better buildings and more accommodations were any of you ever up to anster well take a run up there some day and see what sort of buildings the department has there william q green is a very different man from john j laylor you dont see him sitting in his chair and picking his teeth the whole winter while the representative from his district never says a word about his department from one end of a session of congress to the other now if i had charge of things here id make such changes that you wouldnt know the place id throw two rooms off here and a corridor and entrancedoor at that end of the building id close up this doorpointing toward the registrars roomand if john j laylor wanted to come in here he might go round to the end door like other people  the thought struck harry covare that in that case there would be no john j laylor but he would not interrupt  and what is more continued the shipwreck clerk id close up this whole department at twelve oclock on saturdays the way things are managed now a man has no time to attend to his own private business suppose i think of buying a piece of land and want to go out and look at it or suppose any one of you gentlemen were here and thought of buying a piece of land and wanted to go out and look at it what are you going to do about it you dont want to go on sunday and when are you going to go  not one of the other gentlemen had ever thought of buying a piece of land nor had they any reason to suppose that they ever would purchase an inch of soil unless they bought it in a flowerpot but they all agreed that the way things were managed now there was no time for a man to attend to his own business  but you cant expect john j laylor to do anything said the shipwreck clerk  however there was one thing which that gentleman always expected john j laylor to do when the clerk was surrounded by a number of persons in hours of business and when he had succeeded in impressing them with the importance of his functions and the necessity of paying deferential attention to himself if they wished their business attended to john j laylor would be sure to walk into the office and address the shipwreck clerk in such a manner as to let the people present know that he was a clerk and nothing else and that he the registrar was the head of that department these humiliations the shipwreck clerk never forgot  there was a little pause here and then mr mathers remarked  i should think youd be awfully bored with the long stories of shipwrecks that the people come and tell you  he hoped to change the conversation because although he wished to remain on good terms with the subordinate officers it was not desirable that he should be led to say much against john j laylor  no sir said the shipwreck clerk i am not bored i did not come here to be bored and as long as i have charge of this office i dont intend to be the longwinded old salts who come here to report their wrecks never spin out their prosy yarns to me the first thing i do is to let them know just what i want of them and not an inch beyond that does a man of them go at least while i am managing the business there are times when john j laylor comes in and puts in his oar and wants to hear the whole story which is pure stuff and nonsense for john j laylor doesnt know anything more about a shipwreck than he does about  the endemies in the lake george area suggested harry covare  yes or any other part of his business said the shipwreck clerk and when he takes it into his head to interfere all business stops till some second mate of a coalschooner has told his whole story from his sighting land on the morning of one day to his getting ashore on it on the afternoon of the next now i dont put up with any such nonsense theres no man living that can tell me anything about shipwrecks ive never been to sea myself but thats not necessary and if i had gone its not likely id been wrecked but ive read about every kind of shipwreck that ever happened when i first came here i took care to post myself upon these matters because i knew it would save trouble i have read robinson crusoe the wreck of the grosvenor the sinking of the royal george and wrecks by waterspouts tidal waves and every other thing which would knock a ship into a cocked hat and ive classified every sort of wreck under its proper head and when ive found out to what class a wreck belongs i know all about it now when a man comes here to report a wreck the first thing he has to do is just to shut down on his story and to stand up square and answer a few questions that i put to him in two minutes i know just what kind of shipwreck hes had and then when he gives me the name of his vessel and one or two other points he may go i know all about that wreck and i make a much better report of the business than he could have done if hed stood here talking three days and three nights the amount of money thats been saved to our taxpayers by the way ive systematized the business of this office is not to be calculated in figures  the brotherinlaw of j george watts knocked the ashes from the remnant of his cigar looked contemplatively at the coal for a moment and then remarked  i think you said theres no kind of shipwreck you dont know about  thats what i said replied the shipwreck clerk  i think said the other i could tell you of a shipwreck in which i was concerned that wouldnt go into any of your classes  the shipwreck clerk threw away the end of his cigar put both his hands into his trousers pockets stretched out his legs and looked steadfastly at the man who had made this unwarrantable remark then a pitying smile stole over his countenance and he said well sir id like to hear your account of it and before you get a quarter through i can stop you just where you are and go ahead and tell the rest of the story myself  thats so said harry covare youll see him do it just as sure pop as a spread rail bounces the engine  well then said the brotherinlaw of j george watts ill tell it and he began                                       it was just two years ago the 1st of this month that i sailed for south america in the thomas hyke  at this point the shipwreck clerk turned and opened a large book at the letter t  that wreck wasnt reported here said the other and you wont find it in your book  at anster perhaps said the shipwreck clerk closing the volume and turning round again  cant say about that replied the other ive never been to anster and havent looked over their books  well you neednt want to said the clerk theyve got good accommodations at anster and the registrar has some ideas of the duties of his post but they have no such system of wreck reports as we have here  very like said the brotherinlaw and he went on with his story the thomas hyke was a small iron steamer of six hundred tons and she sailed from ulford for valparaiso with a cargo principally of pigiron  pigiron for valparaiso remarked the shipwreck clerk and then he knitted his brows thoughtfully and said go on  she was a new vessel continued the narrator and built with watertight compartments rather uncommon for a vessel of her class but so she was i am not a sailor and dont know anything about ships i went as passenger and there was another one named william anderson and his son sam a boy about fifteen years old we were all going to valparaiso on business i dont remember just how many days we were out nor do i know just where we were but it was somewhere off the coast of south america when one dark nightwith a fog besides for aught i know for i was asleepwe ran into a steamer coming north how we managed to do this with room enough on both sides for all the ships in the world to pass i dont know but so it was when i got on deck the other vessel had gone on and we never saw anything more of her whether she sunk or got home is something i cant tell but we pretty soon found that the thomas hyke had some of the plates in her bow badly smashed and she took in water like a thirsty dog the captain had the forward watertight bulkhead shut tight and the pumps set to work but it was no use that forward compartment just filled up with water and the thomas hyke settled down with her bow clean under her deck was slanting forward like the side of a hill and the propeller was lifted up so that it wouldnt have worked even if the engine had been kept going the captain had the masts cut away thinking this might bring her up some but it didnt help much there was a pretty heavy sea on and the waves came rolling up the slant of the deck like the surf on the seashore the captain gave orders to have all the hatches battened down so that water couldnt get in and the only way by which anybody could go below was by the cabin door which was far aft this work of stopping up all openings in the deck was a dangerous business for the decks sloped right down into the water and if anybody had slipped away hed have gone into the ocean with nothing to stop him but the men made a line fast to themselves and worked away with a good will and soon got the deck and the house over the engine as tight as a bottle the smokestack which was well forward had been broken down by a spar when the masts had been cut and as the waves washed into the hole that it left the captain had this plugged up with old sails well fastened down it was a dreadful thing to see the ship alying with her bows clean under water and her stern sticking up if it hadnt been for her watertight compartments that were left uninjured she would have gone down to the bottom as slick as a whistle on the afternoon of the day after the collision the wind fell and the sea soon became pretty smooth the captain was quite sure that there would be no trouble about keeping afloat until some ship came along and took us off our flag was flying upside down from a pole in the stern and if anybody saw a ship making such a guy of herself as the thomas hyke was then doing theyd be sure to come to see what was the matter with her even if she had no flag of distress flying we tried to make ourselves as comfortable as we could but this wasnt easy with everything on such a dreadful slant but that night we heard a rumbling and grinding noise down in the hold and the slant seemed to get worse pretty soon the captain roused all hands and told us that the cargo of pigiron was shifting and sliding down to the bow and that it wouldnt be long before it would break through all the bulkheads and then wed fill and go to the bottom like a shot he said we must all take to the boats and get away as quick as we could it was an easy matter launching the boats they didnt lower them outside from the davits but they just let em down on deck and slid em along forward into the water and then held em there with a rope till everything was ready to start they launched three boats put plenty of provisions and water in em and then everybody began to get aboard but william anderson and me and his son sam couldnt make up our minds to get into those boats and row out on the dark wide ocean they were the biggest boats we had but still they were little things enough the ship seemed to us to be a good deal safer and more likely to be seen when day broke than those three boats which might be blown off if the wind rose nobody knew where it seemed to us that the cargo had done all the shifting it intended to for the noise below had stopped and altogether we agreed that wed rather stick to the ship than go off in those boats the captain he tried to make us go but we wouldnt do it and he told us if we chose to stay behind and be drowned it was our affair and he couldnt help it and then he said there was a small boat aft and wed better launch her and have her ready in case things should get worse and we should make up our minds to leave the vessel he and the rest then rowed off so as not to be caught in the vortex if the steamer went down and we three stayed aboard we launched the small boat in the way wed seen the others launched being careful to have ropes tied to us while we were doing it and we put things aboard that we thought we should want then we went into the cabin and waited for morning it was a queer kind of a cabin with a floor inclined like the roof of a house but we sat down in the corners and were glad to be there the swinging lamp was burning and it was a good deal more cheerful in there than it was outside but about daybreak the grinding and rumbling down below began again and the bow of the thomas hyke kept going down more and more and it wasnt long before the forward bulkhead of the cabin which was what you might call its front wall when everything was all right was under our feet as level as a floor and the lamp was lying close against the ceiling that it was hanging from you may be sure that we thought it was time to get out of that there were benches with arms to them fastened to the floor and by these we climbed up to the foot of the cabin stairs which being turned bottom upward we went down in order to get out when we reached the cabin door we saw part of the deck below us standing up like the side of a house that is built in the water as they say the houses in venice are we had made our boat fast to the cabin door by a long line and now we saw her floating quietly on the water which was very smooth and about twenty feet below us we drew her up as close under us as we could and then we let the boy sam down by a rope and after some kicking and swinging he got into her and then he took the oars and kept her right under us while we scrambled down by the ropes which we had used in getting her ready as soon as we were in the boat we cut her rope and pulled away as hard as we could and when we got to what we thought was a safe distance we stopped to look at the thomas hyke you never saw such a ship in all your born days two thirds of the hull was sunk in the water and she was standing straight up and down with the stern in the air her rudder up as high as the topsail ought to be and the screw propeller looking like the wheel on the top of one of these windmills that they have in the country for pumping up water her cargo had shifted so far forward that it had turned her right upon end but she couldnt sink owing to the air in the compartments that the water hadnt got into and on the top of the whole thing was the distress flag flying from the pole which stuck out over the stern it was broad daylight but not a thing did we see of the other boats wed supposed that they wouldnt row very far but would lay off at a safe distance until daylight but they must have been scared and rowed farther than they intended well sir we stayed in that boat all day and watched the thomas hyke but she just kept as she was and didnt seem to sink an inch there was no use of rowing away for we had no place to row to and besides we thought that passing ships would be much more likely to see that stern sticking high in the air than our little boat we had enough to eat and at night two of us slept while the other watched dividing off the time and taking turns to this in the morning there was the thomas hyke standing stern up just as before there was a long swell on the ocean now and shed rise and lean over a little on each wave but shed come up again just as straight as before that night passed as the last one had and in the morning we found wed drifted a good deal farther from the thomas hyke but she was floating just as she had been like a big buoy thats moored over a sandbar we couldnt see a sign of the boats and we about gave them up we had our breakfast which was a pretty poor meal being nothing but hardtack and what was left of a piece of boiled beef after wed sat for a while doing nothing but feeling mighty uncomfortable william anderson said look here do you know that i think we would be three fools to keep on shivering all night and living on hardtack in the daytime when theres plenty on that vessel for us to eat and to keep us warm if shes floated that way for two days and two nights theres no knowing how much longer shell float and we might as well go on board and get the things we want as not all right said i for i was tired doing nothing and sam was as willing as anybody so we rowed up to the steamer and stopped close to the deck which as i said before was standing straight up out of the water like the wall of a house the cabin door which was the only opening into her was about twenty feet above us and the ropes which we had tied to the rails of the stairs inside were still hanging down sam was an active youngster and he managed to climb up one of these ropes but when he got to the door he drew it up and tied knots in it about a foot apart and then he let it down to us for neither william anderson nor me could go up a rope hand over hand without knots or something to hold on to as it was we had a lot of bother getting up but we did it at last and then we walked up the stairs treading on the front part of each step instead of the top of it as we would have done if the stairs had been in their proper position when we got to the floor of the cabin which was now perpendicular like a wall we had to clamber down by means of the furniture which was screwed fast until we reached the bulkhead which was now the floor of the cabin close to this bulkhead was a small room which was the stewards pantry and here we found lots of things to eat but all jumbled up in a way that made us laugh the boxes of biscuits and the tin cans and a lot of bottles in wicker covers were piled up on one end of the room and everything in the lockers and drawers was jumbled together william anderson and me set to work to get out what we thought wed want and we told sam to climb up into some of the stateroomsof which there were four on each side of the cabinand get some blankets to keep us warm as well as a few sheets which we thought we could rig up for an awning to the boat for the days were just as hot as the nights were cool when wed collected what we wanted william anderson and me climbed into our own rooms thinking wed each pack a valise with what we most wanted to save of our clothes and things and while we were doing this sam called out to us that it was raining he was sitting at the cabin door looking out i first thought to tell him to shut the door sos to keep the rain from coming in but when i thought how things really were i laughed at the idea there was a sort of little house built over the entrance to the cabin and in one end of it was the door and in the way the ship now was the open doorway was underneath the little house and of course no rain could come in pretty soon we heard the rain pouring down beating on the stern of the vessel like hail we got to the stairs and looked out the rain was falling in perfect sheets in a way you never see except round about the tropics its a good thing were inside said william anderson for if wed been out in this rain wed been drowned in the boat i agreed with him and we made up our minds to stay where we were until the rain was over well it rained about four hours and when it stopped and we looked out we saw our little boat nearly full of water and sunk so deep that if one of us had stepped on her shed have gone down sure heres a pretty kittle of fish said william anderson theres nothing for us to do now but to stay where we are i believe in his heart he was glad of that for if ever a man was tired of a little boat william anderson was tired of that one wed been in for two days and two nights at any rate there was no use talking about it and we set to work to make ourselves comfortable we got some mattresses and pillows out of the staterooms and when it began to get dark we lighted the lampwhich we had filled with sweetoil from a flask in the pantry not finding any other kindand we hung it from the railing of the stairs we had a good nights rest and the only thing that disturbed me was william anderson lifting up his head every time he turned over and saying how much better this was than that blasted little boat the next morning we had a good breakfast even making some tea with a spiritlamp we found using brandy instead of alcohol william anderson and i wanted to get into the captains roomwhich was near the stern and pretty high upso as to see if there was anything there that we ought to get ready to save when a vessel should come along and pick us up but we were not good at climbing like sam and we didnt see how we could get up there sam said he was sure he had once seen a ladder in the compartment just forward of the bulkhead and as william was very anxious to get up to the captains room we let the boy go and look for it there was a sliding door in the bulkhead under our feet and we opened this far enough to let sam get through and he scrambled down like a monkey into the next compartment which was light enough although the lower half of it which was next to the engineroom was under the waterline sam actually found a ladder with hooks at one end of it and while he was handing it up to uswhich was very hard to do for he had to climb up on all sorts of thingshe let it topple over and the end with the iron hooks fell against the round glass of one of the portholes the glass was very thick and strong but the ladder came down very heavy and shivered it as bad luck would have it this window was below the waterline and the water came rushing in in a big spout we chucked blankets down to sam for him to stop up the hole but twas of no use for it was hard for him to get at the window and when he did the water came in with such force that he couldnt get a blanket into the hole we were afraid hed be drowned down there and told him to come out as quick as he could he put up the ladder again and hooked it on to the door in the bulkhead and we held it while he climbed up looking down through the doorway we saw by the way the water was pouring in at the opening that it wouldnt be long before that compartment was filled up so we shoved the door to and made it all tight and then said william anderson the shipll sink deeper and deeper as that fills up and the water may get up to the cabin door and we must go and make that as tight as we can sam had pulled the ladder up after him and this we found of great use in getting to the foot of the cabin stairs we shut the cabin door and locked and bolted it and as it fitted pretty tight we didnt think it would let in much water if the ship sunk that far but over the top of the cabin stairs were a couple of folding doors which shut down horizontally when the ship was in its proper position and which were only used in very bad cold weather these we pulled to and fastened tight thus having a double protection against the water well we didnt get this done any too soon for the water did come up to the cabin door and a little trickled in from the outside door and through the cracks in the inner one but we went to work and stopped these up with strips from the sheets which we crammed well in with our pocketknives then we sat down on the steps and waited to see what would happen next the doors of all the staterooms were open and we could see through the thick plateglass windows in them which were all shut tight that the ship was sinking more and more as the water came in sam climbed up into one of the after staterooms and said the outside water was nearly up to the stern and pretty soon we looked up to the two portholes in the stern and saw that they were covered with water and as more and more water could be seen there and as the light came through less easily we knew that we were sinking under the surface of the ocean its a mighty good thing said william anderson that no water can get in here william had a hopeful kind of mind and always looked on the bright side of things but i must say that i was dreadfully scared when i looked through those stern windows and saw water instead of sky it began to get duskier and duskier as we sank lower and lower but still we could see pretty well for its astonishing how much light comes down through water after a little while we noticed that the light remained about the same and then william anderson he sings out hooray weve stopped sinking what difference does that make says i we must be thirty or forty feet under water and more yet for aught i know yes that may be said he but it is clear that all the water has got into that compartment that can get in and we have sunk just as far down as we are going but that dont help matters said i thirty or forty feet under water is just as bad as a thousand as to drowning a man drowning said william how are you going to be drowned no water can get in here nor no air either said i and people are drowned for want of air as i take it it would be a queer sort of thing said william to be drowned in the ocean and yet stay as dry as a chip but its no use being worried about air weve got air enough here to last us for ever so long this stern compartment is the biggest in the ship and its got lots of air in it just think of that hold it must be nearly full of air the stern compartment of the hold has got nothing in it but sewingmachines i saw em loading her the pigiron was mostly amidships or at least forward of this compartment now theres no kind of a cargo thatll accommodate as much air as sewingmachines theyre packed in wooden frames not boxes and dont fill up half the room they take theres air all through and around em its a very comforting thing to think the hold isnt filled up solid with bales of cotton or wheat in bulk it might be comforting but i couldnt get much good out of it and now sam whod been scrambling all over the cabin to see how things were going on sung out that the water was leaking in a little again at the cabin door and around some of the iron frames of the windows its a lucky thing said william anderson that we didnt sink any deeper or the pressure of the water would have burst in those heavy glasses and what weve got to do now is to stop up all the cracks the more we work the livelier well feel we tore off more strips of sheets and went all round stopping up cracks wherever we found them its fortunate said william anderson that sam found that ladder for we would have had hard work getting to the windows of the stern staterooms without it but by resting it on the bottom step of the stairs which now happens to be the top one we can get to any part of the cabin i couldnt help thinking that if sam hadnt found the ladder it would have been a good deal better for us but i didnt want to damp williams spirits and i said nothing  and now i beg your pardon sir said the narrator addressing the shipwreck clerk but i forgot that you said youd finish this story yourself perhaps youd like to take it up just here  the shipwreck clerk seemed surprised and had apparently forgotten his previous offer oh no said he tell your own story this is not a matter of business  very well then said the brotherinlaw of j george watts ill go on we made everything as tight as we could and then we got our supper having forgotten all about dinner and being very hungry we didnt make any tea and we didnt light the lamp for we knew that would use up air but we made a better meal than three people sunk out of sight in the ocean had a right to expect what troubles me most said william anderson as he turned in is the fact that if we are forty feet under water our flagpole must be covered up now if the flag was sticking out upside down a ship sailing by would see it and would know there was something wrong if thats all that troubles you said i i guess youll sleep easy and if a ship was to see the flag i wonder how theyd know we were down here and how theyd get us out if they did oh theyd manage it said william anderson trust those seacaptains for that and then he went to sleep the next morning the air began to get mighty disagreeable in the part of the cabin where we were and then william anderson he says what weve got to do is to climb up into the stern staterooms where the air is purer we can come down here to get our meals and then go up again to breathe comfortable and what are we going to do when the air up there gets foul says i to william who seemed to be making arrangements for spending the summer in our present quarters oh thatll be all right said he it dont do to be extravagant with air any more than with anything else when weve used up all there is in this cabin we can bore holes through the floor into the hold and let in air from there if were economical therell be enough to last for dear knows how long we passed the night each in a stateroom sleeping on the end wall instead of the berth and it wasnt till the afternoon of the next day that the air of the cabin got so bad we thought wed have some fresh so we went down on the bulkhead and with an auger that we found in the pantry we bored three holes about a yard apart in the cabin floor which was now one of the walls of the room just as the bulkhead was the floor and the stern end where the two round windows were was the ceiling or roof we each took a hole and i tell you it was pleasant to breathe the air which came in from the hold isnt this jolly said william anderson and we ought to be mighty glad that that hold wasnt loaded with codfish or soap but theres nothing that smells better than new sewingmachines that havent ever been used and this air is pleasant enough for anybody by williams advice we made three plugs by which we stopped up the holes when we thought wed had air enough for the present and now says he we neednt climb up into those awkward staterooms any more we can just stay down here and be comfortable and let in air when we want it and how long do you suppose that air in the hold is going to last said i oh ever so long said he using it so economically as we do and when it stops coming out lively through these little holes as i suppose it will after a while we can saw a big hole in this flooring and go into the hold and do our breathing if we want to that evening we did saw a hole about a foot square so as to have plenty of air while we were asleep but we didnt go into the hold it being pretty well filled up with machines though the next day sam and i sometimes stuck our heads in for a good sniff of air though william anderson was opposed to this being of the opinion that we ought to put ourselves on short rations of breathing so as to make the supply of air hold out as long as possible but whats the good said i to william of trying to make the air hold out if weve got to be suffocated in this place after all whats the good says he havent you enough biscuits and canned meats and plenty of other things to eat and a barrel of water in that room opposite the pantry not to speak of wine and brandy if you want to cheer yourself up a bit and havent we good mattresses to sleep on and why shouldnt we try to live and be comfortable as long as we can what i want said i is to get out of this box the idea of being shut up in here down under the water is more than i can stand id rather take my chances going up to the surface and swimming about till i found a piece of the wreck or something to float on you neednt think of anything of that sort said william for if we were to open a door or a window to get out the waterd rush in and drive us back and fill up this place in no time and then the whole concern would go to the bottom and what would you do if you did get to the top of the water its not likely youd find anything there to get on and if you did you wouldnt live very long floating about with nothing to eat no sir says he what weve got to do is to be content with the comforts we have around us and something will turn up to get us out of this you see if it dont there was no use talking against william anderson and i didnt say any more about getting out as for sam he spent his time at the windows of the staterooms alooking out we could see a good way into the waterfarther than you would thinkand we sometimes saw fishes especially porpoises swimming about most likely trying to find out what a ship was doing hanging bows down under the water what troubled sam was that a swordfish might come along and jab his sword through one of the windows in that case it would be all up or rather down with us every now and then hed sing out here comes one and then just as id give a jump hed say no it isnt its a porpoise i thought from the first and i think now that it would have been a great deal better for us if that boy hadnt been along that night there was a good deal of motion to the ship and she swung about and rose up and down more than she had done since wed been left in her there must be a big sea running on top said william anderson and if we were up there wed be tossed about dreadful now the motion down here is just as easy as a cradle and whats more we cant be sunk very deep for if we were there wouldnt be any motion at all about noon the next day we felt a sudden tremble and shake run through the whole ship and far down under us we heard a rumbling and grinding that nearly scared me out of my wits i first thought wed struck bottom but william he said that couldnt be for it was just as light in the cabin as it had been and if wed gone down it would have grown much darker of course the rumbling stopped after a little while and then it seemed to grow lighter instead of darker and sam who was looking up at the stern windows over our heads he sung out sky and sure enough we could see the blue sky as clear as daylight through those windows and then the ship she turned herself on the slant pretty much as she had been when her forward compartment first took in water and we found ourselves standing on the cabin floor instead of the bulkhead i was near one of the open staterooms and as i looked in there was the sunlight coming through the wet glass in the window and more cheerful than anything i ever saw before in this world william anderson he just made one jump and unscrewing one of the stateroom windows he jerked it open we had thought the air inside was good enough to last some time longer but when that window was open and the fresh air came rushing in it was a different sort of thing i can tell you william put his head out and looked up and down and all around shes nearly all out of water he shouted and we can open the cabin door then we all three rushed at those stairs which were nearly right side up now and we had the cabin doors open in no time when we looked out we saw that the ship was truly floating pretty much as she had been when the captain and crew left her though we all agreed that her deck didnt slant as much forward as it did then do you know whats happened sung out william anderson after hed stood still for a minute to look around and think that bobbing up and down that the vessel got last night shook up and settled down the pigiron inside of her and the iron plates in the bow that were smashed and loosened by the collision have given way under the weight and the whole cargo of pigiron has burst through and gone to the bottom then of course up we came didnt i tell you something would happen to make us all right  well i wont make this story any longer than i can help the next day after that we were taken off by a sugarship bound north and we were carried safe back to ulford where we found our captain and the crew who had been picked up by a ship after theyd been three or four days in their boats this ship had sailed our way to find us which of course she couldnt do as at that time we were under water and out of sight  and now sir said the brotherinlaw of j george watts to the shipwreck clerk to which of your classes does this wreck of mine belong  gents said the shipwreck clerk rising from his seat its four oclock and at that hour this office closes     old pipes and the dryad   a mountain brook ran through a little village over the brook there was a narrow bridge and from the bridge a footpath led out from the village and up the hillside to the cottage of old pipes and his mother for many many years old pipes had been employed by the villagers to pipe the cattle down from the hills every afternoon an hour before sunset he would sit on a rock in front of his cottage and play on his pipes then all the flocks and herds that were grazing on the mountains would hear him wherever they might happen to be and would come down to the villagethe cows by the easiest paths the sheep by those not quite so easy and the goats by the steep and rocky ways that were hardest of all  but now for a year or more old pipes had not piped the cattle home it is true that every afternoon he sat upon the rock and played upon his familiar instrument but the cattle did not hear him he had grown old and his breath was feeble the echoes of his cheerful notes which used to come from the rocky hill on the other side of the valley were heard no more and twenty yards from old pipes one could scarcely tell what tune he was playing he had become somewhat deaf and did not know that the sound of his pipes was so thin and weak and that the cattle did not hear him the cows the sheep and the goats came down every afternoon as before but this was because two boys and a girl were sent up after them the villagers did not wish the good old man to know that his piping was no longer of any use so they paid him his little salary every month and said nothing about the two boys and the girl  old pipess mother was of course a great deal older than he was and was as deaf as a gateposts latch hinges and alland she never knew that the sound of her sons pipe did not spread over all the mountainside and echo back strong and clear from the opposite hills she was very fond of old pipes and proud of his piping and as he was so much younger than she was she never thought of him as being very old she cooked for him and made his bed and mended his clothes and they lived very comfortably on his little salary  one afternoon at the end of the month when old pipes had finished his piping he took his stout staff and went down the hill to the village to receive the money for his months work the path seemed a great deal steeper and more difficult than it used to be and old pipes thought that it must have been washed by the rains and greatly damaged he remembered it as a path that was quite easy to traverse either up or down but old pipes had been a very active man and as his mother was so much older than he was he never thought of himself as aged and infirm  when the chief villager had paid him and he had talked a little with some of his friends old pipes started to go home but when he had crossed the bridge over the brook and gone a short distance up the hillside he became very tired and sat down upon a stone he had not been sitting there half a minute when along came two boys and a girl  children said old pipes im very tired tonight and i dont believe i can climb up this steep path to my home i think i shall have to ask you to help me  we will do that said the boys and the girl quite cheerfully and one boy took him by the right hand and the other by the left while the girl pushed him in the back in this way he went up the hill quite easily and soon reached his cottage door old pipes gave each of the three children a copper coin and then they sat down for a few minutes rest before starting back to the village  im sorry that i tired you so much said old pipes  oh that would not have tired us said one of the boys if we had not been so far today after the cows the sheep and the goats they rambled high up on the mountain and we never before had such a time in finding them  had to go after the cows the sheep and the goats exclaimed old pipes what do you mean by that  the girl who stood behind the old man shook her head put her hand on her mouth and made all sorts of signs to the boy to stop talking on this subject but he did not notice her and promptly answered old pipes  why you see good sir said he that as the cattle cant hear your pipes now somebody has to go after them every evening to drive them down from the mountain and the chief villager has hired us three to do it generally it is not very hard work but tonight the cattle had wandered far  how long have you been doing this asked the old man  the girl shook her head and clapped her hand on her mouth more vigorously than before but the boy went on  i think it is about a year now he said since the people first felt sure that the cattle could not hear your pipes and from that time weve been driving them down but we are rested now and will go home goodnight sir  the three children then went down the hill the girl scolding the boy all the way home old pipes stood silent a few moments and then he went into his cottage  mother he shouted did you hear what those children said  children exclaimed the old woman i did not hear them i did not know there were any children here  then old pipes told his mothershouting very loudly to make her hearhow the two boys and the girl had helped him up the hill and what he had heard about his piping and the cattle  they cant hear you cried his mother why whats the matter with the cattle  ah me said old pipes i dont believe theres anything the matter with the cattle it must be with me and my pipes that there is something the matter but one thing is certain if i do not earn the wages the chief villager pays me i shall not take them i shall go straight down to the village and give back the money i received today  nonsense cried his mother im sure youve piped as well as you could and no more can be expected and what are we to do without the money  i dont know said old pipes but im going down to the village to pay it back  the sun had now set but the moon was shining very brightly on the hillside and old pipes could see his way very well he did not take the same path by which he had gone before but followed another which led among the trees upon the hillside and though longer was not so steep  when he had gone about halfway the old man sat down to rest leaning his back against a great oaktree as he did so he heard a sound like knocking inside the tree and then a voice distinctly said  let me out let me out  old pipes instantly forgot that he was tired and sprang to his feet this must be a dryadtree he exclaimed if it is ill let her out  old pipes had never to his knowledge seen a dryadtree but he knew there were such trees on the hillsides and the mountains and that dryads lived in them he knew too that in the summertime on those days when the moon rose before the sun went down a dryad could come out of her tree if any one could find the key which locked her in and turn it old pipes closely examined the trunk of the tree which stood in the full moonlight if i see that key he said i shall surely turn it before long he perceived a piece of bark standing out from the tree which appeared to him very much like the handle of a key he took hold of it and found he could turn it quite around as he did so a large part of the side of the tree was pushed open and a beautiful dryad stepped quickly out  for a moment she stood motionless gazing on the scene before herthe tranquil valley the hills the forest and the mountainside all lying in the soft clear light of the moon oh lovely lovely she exclaimed how long it is since i have seen anything like this and then turning to old pipes she said how good of you to let me out i am so happy and so thankful that i must kiss you you dear old man and she threw her arms around the neck of old pipes and kissed him on both cheeks you dont know she then went on to say how doleful it is to be shut up so long in a tree i dont mind it in the winter for then i am glad to be sheltered but in summer it is a rueful thing not to be able to see all the beauties of the world and its ever so long since ive been let out people so seldom come this way and when they do come at the right time they either dont hear me or they are frightened and run away but you you dear old man you were not frightened and you looked and looked for the key and you let me out and now i shall not have to go back till winter has come and the air grows cold oh it is glorious what can i do for you to show you how grateful i am  i am very glad said old pipes that i let you out since i see that it makes you so happy but i must admit that i tried to find the key because i had a great desire to see a dryad but if you wish to do something for me you can if you happen to be going down toward the village  to the village exclaimed the dryad i will go anywhere for you my kind old benefactor  well then said old pipes i wish you would take this little bag of money to the chief villager and tell him that old pipes cannot receive pay for the services which he does not perform it is now more than a year that i have not been able to make the cattle hear me when i piped to call them home i did not know this until tonight but now that i know it i cannot keep the money and so i send it back and handing the little bag to the dryad he bade her goodnight and turned toward his cottage  goodnight said the dryad and i thank you over and over and over again you good old man  old pipes walked toward his home very glad to be saved the fatigue of going all the way down to the village and back again to be sure he said to himself this path does not seem at all steep and i can walk along it very easily but it would have tired me dreadfully to come up all the way from the village especially as i could not have expected those children to help me again when he reached home his mother was surprised to see him returning so soon  what she exclaimed have you already come back what did the chief villager say did he take the money  old pipes was just about to tell her that he had sent the money to the village by a dryad when he suddenly reflected that his mother would be sure to disapprove such a proceeding and so he merely said he had sent it by a person whom he had met  and how do you know that the person will ever take it to the chief villager cried his mother you will lose it and the villagers will never get it oh pipes pipes when will you be old enough to have ordinary common sense  old pipes considered that as he was already seventy years of age he could scarcely expect to grow any wiser but he made no remark on this subject and saying that he doubted not that the money would go safely to its destination he sat down to his supper his mother scolded him roundly but he did not mind it and after supper he went out and sat on a rustic chair in front of the cottage to look at the moonlit village and to wonder whether or not the chief villager really received the money while he was doing these two things he went fast asleep  when old pipes left the dryad she did not go down to the village with the little bag of money she held it in her hand and thought about what she had heard this is a good and honest old man she said and it is a shame that he should lose this money he looked as if he needed it and i dont believe the people in the village will take it from one who has served them so long often when in my tree have i heard the sweet notes of his pipes i am going to take the money back to him she did not start immediately because there were so many beautiful things to look at but after a while she went up to the cottage and finding old pipes asleep in his chair she slipped the little bag into his coat pocket and silently sped away  the next day old pipes told his mother that he would go up the mountain and cut some wood he had a right to get wood from the mountain but for a long time he had been content to pick up the dead branches which lay about his cottage today however he felt so strong and vigorous that he thought he would go and cut some fuel that would be better than this he worked all the morning and when he came back he did not feel at all tired and he had a very good appetite for his dinner  now old pipes knew a good deal about dryads but there was one thing which although he had heard he had forgotten this was that a kiss from a dryad made a person ten years younger the people of the village knew this and they were very careful not to let any child of ten years or younger go into the woods where the dryads were supposed to be for if they should chance to be kissed by one of these treenymphs they would be set back so far that they would cease to exist a story was told in the village that a very bad boy of eleven once ran away into the woods and had an adventure of this kind and when his mother found him he was a little baby of one year old taking advantage of her opportunity she brought him up more carefully than she had done before and he grew to be a very good boy indeed  now old pipes had been kissed twice by the dryad once on each cheek and he therefore felt as vigorous and active as when he was a hale man of fifty his mother noticed how much work he was doing and told him that he need not try in that way to make up for the loss of his piping wages for he would only tire himself out and get sick but her son answered that he had not felt so well for years and that he was quite able to work in the course of the afternoon old pipes for the first time that day put his hand in his coat pocket and there to his amazement he found the little bag of money well well he exclaimed i am stupid indeed i really thought that i had seen a dryad but when i sat down by that big oaktree i must have gone to sleep and dreamed it all and then i came home thinking i had given the money to a dryad when it was in my pocket all the time but the chief villager shall have the money i shall not take it to him today but tomorrow i wish to go to the village to see some of my old friends and then i shall give up the money  toward the close of the afternoon old pipes as had been his custom for so many years took his pipes from the shelf on which they lay and went out to the rock in front of the cottage  what are you going to do cried his mother if you will not consent to be paid why do you pipe  i am going to pipe for my own pleasure said her son i am used to it and i do not wish to give it up it does not matter now whether the cattle hear me or not and i am sure that my piping will injure no one  when the good man began to play upon his favorite instrument he was astonished at the sound that came from it the beautiful notes of the pipes sounded clear and strong down into the valley and spread over the hills and up the sides of the mountain beyond while after a little interval an echo came back from the rocky hill on the other side of the valley  ha ha he cried what has happened to my pipes they must have been stopped up of late but now they are as clear and good as ever  again the merry notes went sounding far and wide the cattle on the mountain heard them and those that were old enough remembered how these notes had called them from their pastures every evening and so they started down the mountainside the others following  the merry notes were heard in the village below and the people were much astonished thereby why who can be blowing the pipes of old pipes they said but as they were all very busy no one went up to see one thing however was plain enough the cattle were coming down the mountain and so the two boys and the girl did not have to go after them and had an hour for play for which they were very glad  the next morning old pipes started down to the village with his money and on the way he met the dryad oh ho he cried is that you why i thought my letting you out of the tree was nothing but a dream  a dream cried the dryad if you only knew how happy you have made me you would not think it merely a dream and has it not benefited you do you not feel happier yesterday i heard you playing beautifully on your pipes  yes yes cried he i did not understand it before but i see it all now i have really grown younger i thank you i thank you good dryad from the bottom of my heart it was the finding of the money in my pocket that made me think it was a dream  oh i put it in when you were asleep she said laughing because i thought you ought to keep it goodby kind honest man may you live long and be as happy as i am now  old pipes was greatly delighted when he understood that he was really a younger man but that made no difference about the money and he kept on his way to the village as soon as he reached it he was eagerly questioned as to who had been playing his pipes the evening before and when the people heard that it was himself they were very much surprised thereupon old pipes told what had happened to him and then there was greater wonder with hearty congratulations and handshakes for old pipes was liked by every one the chief villager refused to take his money and although old pipes said that he had not earned it every one present insisted that as he would now play on his pipes as before he should lose nothing because for a time he was unable to perform his duty  so old pipes was obliged to keep his money and after an hour or two spent in conversation with his friends he returned to his cottage  there was one individual however who was not at all pleased with what had happened to old pipes this was an echodwarf who lived on the hills on the other side of the valley and whose duty it was to echo back the notes of the pipes whenever they could be heard there were a great many other echodwarfs on these hills some of whom echoed back the songs of maidens some the shouts of children and others the music that was often heard in the village but there was only one who could send back the strong notes of the pipes of old pipes and this had been his sole duty for many years but when the old man grew feeble and the notes of his pipes could not be heard on the opposite hills this echodwarf had nothing to do and he spent his time in delightful idleness and he slept so much and grew so fat that it made his companions laugh to see him walk  on the afternoon on which after so long an interval the sound of the pipes was heard on the echohills this dwarf was fast asleep behind a rock as soon as the first notes reached them some of his companions ran to wake him rolling to his feet he echoed back the merry tune of old pipes naturally he was very much annoyed and indignant at being thus obliged to give up his life of comfortable leisure and he hoped very much that this pipeplaying would not occur again the next afternoon he was awake and listening and sure enough at the usual hour along came the notes of the pipes as clear and strong as they ever had been and he was obliged to work as long as old pipes played the echodwarf was very angry he had supposed of course that the pipeplaying had ceased forever and he felt that he had a right to be indignant at being thus deceived he was so much disturbed that he made up his mind to go and try to find out whether this was to be a temporary matter or not he had plenty of time as the pipes were played but once a day and he set off early in the morning for the hill on which old pipes lived it was hard work for the fat little fellow and when he had crossed the valley and had gone some distance into the woods on the hillside he stopped to rest and in a few minutes the dryad came tripping along  ho ho exclaimed the dwarf what are you doing here and how did you get out of your tree  doing cried the dryad i am being happy thats what i am doing and i was let out of my tree by a good old man who plays the pipes to call the cattle down from the mountain and it makes me happier to think that i have been of service to him i gave him two kisses of gratitude and now he is young enough to play his pipes as well as ever  the echodwarf stepped forward his face pale with passion am i to believe he said that you are the cause of this great evil that has come upon me and that you are the wicked creature who has again started this old man upon his career of pipeplaying what have i ever done to you that you should have condemned me for years and years to echo back the notes of those wretched pipes  at this the dryad laughed loudly  what a funny little fellow you are she said any one would think you had been condemned to toil from morning till night while what you really have to do is merely to imitate for half an hour every day the merry notes of old pipess piping fie upon you echodwarf you are lazy and selfish and that is what is the matter with you instead of grumbling at being obliged to do a little wholesome workwhich is less i am sure than that of any other echodwarf upon the rocky hillsideyou should rejoice at the good fortune of the old man who has regained so much of his strength and vigor go home and learn to be just and generous and then perhaps you may be happy goodby  insolent creature shouted the dwarf as he shook his fat little fist at her ill make you suffer for this you shall find out what it is to heap injury and insult upon one like me and to snatch from him the repose that he has earned by long years of toil and shaking his head savagely he hurried back to the rocky hillside  every afternoon the merry notes of the pipes of old pipes sounded down into the valley and over the hills and up the mountainside and every afternoon when he had echoed them back the little dwarf grew more and more angry with the dryad each day from early morning till it was time for him to go back to his duties upon the rocky hillside he searched the woods for her he intended if he met her to pretend to be very sorry for what he had said and he thought he might be able to play a trick upon her which would avenge him well one day while thus wandering among the trees he met old pipes the echodwarf did not generally care to see or speak to ordinary people but now he was so anxious to find the object of his search that he stopped and asked old pipes if he had seen the dryad the piper had not noticed the little fellow and he looked down on him with some surprise  no he said i have not seen her and i have been looking everywhere for her  you cried the dwarf what do you wish with her  old pipes then sat down on a stone so that he should be nearer the ear of his small companion and he told what the dryad had done for him  when the echodwarf heard that this was the man whose pipes he was obliged to echo back every day he would have slain him on the spot had he been able but as he was not able he merely ground his teeth and listened to the rest of the story  i am looking for the dryad now old pipes continued on account of my aged mother when i was old myself i did not notice how very old my mother was but now it shocks me to see how feeble and decrepit her years have caused her to become and i am looking for the dryad to ask her to make my mother younger as she made me  the eyes of the echodwarf glistened here was a man who might help him in his plans  your idea is a good one he said to old pipes and it does you honor but you should know that a dryad can make no person younger but one who lets her out of her tree however you can manage the affair very easily all you need do is to find the dryad tell her what you want and request her to step into her tree and be shut up for a short time then you will go and bring your mother to the tree she will open it and everything will be as you wish is not this a good plan  excellent cried old pipes and i will go instantly and search more diligently for the dryad  take me with you said the echodwarf you can easily carry me on your strong shoulders and i shall be glad to help you in any way that i can  now then said the little fellow to himself as old pipes carried him rapidly along if he persuades the dryad to get into a treeand she is quite foolish enough to do itand then goes away to bring his mother i shall take a stone or a club and i will break off the key of that tree so that nobody can ever turn it again then mistress dryad will see what she has brought upon herself by her behavior to me  before long they came to the great oaktree in which the dryad had lived and at a distance they saw that beautiful creature herself coming toward them  how excellently well everything happens said the dwarf put me down and i will go your business with the dryad is more important than mine and you need not say anything about my having suggested your plan to you i am willing that you should have all the credit of it yourself  old pipes put the echodwarf upon the ground but the little rogue did not go away he concealed himself between some low mossy rocks and he was so much of their color that you would not have noticed him if you had been looking straight at him  when the dryad came up old pipes lost no time in telling her about his mother and what he wished her to do at first the dryad answered nothing but stood looking very sadly at old pipes  do you really wish me to go into my tree again she said i should dreadfully dislike to do it for i dont know what might happen it is not at all necessary for i could make your mother younger at any time if she would give me the opportunity i had already thought of making you still happier in this way and several times i have waited about your cottage hoping to meet your aged mother but she never comes outside and you know a dryad cannot enter a house i cannot imagine what put this idea into your head did you think of it yourself  no i cannot say that i did answered old pipes a little dwarf whom i met in the woods proposed it to me  oh cried the dryad now i see through it all it is the scheme of that vile echodwarfyour enemy and mine where is he i should like to see him  i think he has gone away said old pipes  no he has not said the dryad whose quick eyes perceived the echodwarf among the rocks there he is seize him and drag him out i beg of you  old pipes perceived the dwarf as soon as he was pointed out to him and running to the rocks he caught the little fellow by the arm and pulled him out  now then cried the dryad who had opened the door of the great oak just stick him in there and we will shut him up then i shall be safe from his mischief for the rest of the time i am free  old pipes thrust the echodwarf into the tree the dryad pushed the door shut there was a clicking sound of bark and wood and no one would have noticed that the big oak had ever had an opening in it  there said the dryad now we need not be afraid of him and i assure you my good piper that i shall be very glad to make your mother younger as soon as i can will you not ask her to come out and meet me  of course i will cried old pipes and i will do it without delay  and then the dryad by his side he hurried to his cottage but when he mentioned the matter to his mother the old woman became very angry indeed she did not believe in dryads and if they really did exist she knew they must be witches and sorceresses and she would have nothing to do with them if her son had ever allowed himself to be kissed by one of them he ought to be ashamed of himself as to its doing him the least bit of good she did not believe a word of it he felt better than he used to feel but that was very common she had sometimes felt that way herself and she forbade him ever to mention a dryad to her again  that afternoon old pipes feeling very sad that his plan in regard to his mother had failed sat down upon the rock and played upon his pipes the pleasant sounds went down the valley and up the hills and mountain but to the great surprise of some persons who happened to notice the fact the notes were not echoed back from the rocky hillside but from the woods on the side of the valley on which old pipes lived the next day many of the villagers stopped in their work to listen to the echo of the pipes coming from the woods the sound was not as clear and strong as it used to be when it was sent back from the rocky hillside but it certainly came from among the trees such a thing as an echo changing its place in this way had never been heard of before and nobody was able to explain how it could have happened old pipes however knew very well that the sound came from the echodwarf shut up in the great oaktree the sides of the tree were thin and the sound of the pipes could be heard through them and the dwarf was obliged by the laws of his being to echo back those notes whenever they came to him but old pipes thought he might get the dryad in trouble if he let any one know that the echodwarf was shut up in the tree and so he wisely said nothing about it  one day the two boys and the girl who had helped old pipes up the hill were playing in the woods stopping near the great oaktree they heard a sound of knocking within it and then a voice plainly said  let me out let me out  for a moment the children stood still in astonishment and then one of the boys exclaimed  oh it is a dryad like the one old pipes found lets let her out  what are you thinking of cried the girl i am the oldest of all and i am only thirteen do you wish to be turned into crawling babies run run run  and the two boys and the girl dashed down into the valley as fast as their legs could carry them there was no desire in their youthful hearts to be made younger than they were and for fear that their parents might think it well that they should commence their careers anew they never said a word about finding the dryadtree  as the summer days went on old pipess mother grew feebler and feebler one day when her son was awayfor he now frequently went into the woods to hunt or fish or down into the valley to workshe arose from her knitting to prepare the simple dinner but she felt so weak and tired that she was not able to do the work to which she had been so long accustomed alas alas she said the time has come when i am too old to work my son will have to hire some one to come here and cook his meals make his bed and mend his clothes alas alas i had hoped that as long as i lived i should be able to do these things but it is not so i have grown utterly worthless and some one else must prepare the dinner for my son i wonder where he is and tottering to the door she went outside to look for him she did not feel able to stand and reaching the rustic chair she sank into it quite exhausted and soon fell asleep  the dryad who had often come to the cottage to see if she could find an opportunity of carrying out old pipess affectionate design now happened by and seeing that the muchdesired occasion had come she stepped up quietly behind the old woman and gently kissed her on each cheek and then as quietly disappeared  in a few minutes the mother of old pipes awoke and looking up at the sun she exclaimed why it is almost dinnertime my son will be here directly and i am not ready for him and rising to her feet she hurried into the house made the fire set the meat and vegetables to cook laid the cloth and by the time her son arrived the meal was on the table  how a little sleep does refresh one she said to herself as she was bustling about she was a woman of very vigorous constitution and at seventy had been a great deal stronger and more active than her son was at that age the moment old pipes saw his mother he knew that the dryad had been there but while he felt as happy as a king he was too wise to say anything about her  it is astonishing how well i feel today said his mother and either my hearing has improved or you speak much more plainly than you have done of late  the summer days went on and passed away the leaves were falling from the trees and the air was becoming cold  nature has ceased to be lovely said the dryad and the night winds chill me it is time for me to go back into my comfortable quarters in the great oak but first i must pay another visit to the cottage of old pipes  she found the piper and his mother sitting side by side on the rock in front of the door the cattle were not to go to the mountain any more that season and he was piping them down for the last time loud and merrily sounded the pipes of old pipes and down the mountainside came the cattle the cows by the easiest paths the sheep by those not quite so easy and the goats by the most difficult ones among the rocks while from the great oaktree were heard the echoes of the cheerful music  how happy they look sitting there together said the dryad and i dont believe it will do them a bit of harm to be still younger and moving quietly up behind them she first kissed old pipes on his cheek and then his mother  old pipes who had stopped playing knew what it was but he did not move and said nothing his mother thinking that her son had kissed her turned to him with a smile and kissed him in return and then she arose and went into the cottage a vigorous woman of sixty followed by her son erect and happy and twenty years younger than herself  the dryad sped away to the woods shrugging her shoulders as she felt the cool evening wind  when she reached the great oak she turned the key and opened the door come out she said to the echodwarf who sat blinking within winter is coming on and i want the comfortable shelter of my tree for myself the cattle have come down from the mountain for the last time this year the pipes will no longer sound and you can go to your rocks and have a holiday until next spring  upon hearing these words the dwarf skipped quickly out and the dryad entered the tree and pulled the door shut after her now then she said to herself he can break off the key if he likes it does not matter to me another will grow out next spring and although the good piper made me no promise i know that when the warm days arrive next year he will come and let me out again  the echodwarf did not stop to break the key of the tree he was too happy to be released to think of anything else and he hastened as fast as he could to his home on the rocky hillside                                       the dryad was not mistaken when she trusted in the piper when the warm days came again he went to the oaktree to let her out but to his sorrow and surprise he found the great tree lying upon the ground a winter storm had blown it down and it lay with its trunk shattered and split and what became of the dryad no one ever knew     the transferred ghost   the country residence of mr john hinckman was a delightful place to me for many reasons it was the abode of a genial though somewhat impulsive hospitality it had broad smoothshaven lawns and towering oaks and elms there were bosky shades at several points and not far from the house there was a little rill spanned by a rustic bridge with the bark on there were fruits and flowers pleasant people chess billiards rides walks and fishing these were great attractions but none of them nor all of them together would have been sufficient to hold me to the place very long i had been invited for the trout season but should probably have finished my visit early in the summer had it not been that upon fair days when the grass was dry and the sun was not too hot and there was but little wind there strolled beneath the lofty elms or passed lightly through the bosky shades the form of my madeline  this lady was not in very truth my madeline she had never given herself to me nor had i in any way acquired possession of her but as i considered her possession the only sufficient reason for the continuance of my existence i called her in my reveries mine it may have been that i would not have been obliged to confine the use of this possessive pronoun to my reveries had i confessed the state of my feelings to the lady  but this was an unusually difficult thing to do not only did i dread as almost all lovers dread taking the step which would in an instant put an end to that delightful season which may be termed the anteinterrogatory period of love and which might at the same time terminate all intercourse or connection with the object of my passion but i was also dreadfully afraid of john hinckman this gentleman was a good friend of mine but it would have required a bolder man than i was at that time to ask him for the gift of his niece who was the head of his household and according to his own frequent statement the main prop of his declining years had madeline acquiesced in my general views on the subject i might have felt encouraged to open the matter to mr hinckman but as i said before i had never asked her whether or not she would be mine i thought of these things at all hours of the day and night particularly the latter  i was lying awake one night in the great bed in my spacious chamber when by the dim light of the new moon which partially filled the room i saw john hinckman standing by a large chair near the door i was very much surprised at this for two reasons in the first place my host had never before come into my room and in the second place he had gone from home that morning and had not expected to return for several days it was for this reason that i had been able that evening to sit much later than usual with madeline on the moonlit porch the figure was certainly that of john hinckman in his ordinary dress but there was a vagueness and indistinctness about it which presently assured me that it was a ghost had the good old man been murdered and had his spirit come to tell me of the deed and to confide to me the protection of his dear my heart fluttered at what i was about to think but at this instant the figure spoke  do you know he said with a countenance that indicated anxiety if mr hinckman will return tonight  i thought it well to maintain a calm exterior and i answered  we do not expect him  i am glad of that said he sinking into the chair by which he stood during the two years and a half that i have inhabited this house that man has never before been away for a single night you cant imagine the relief it gives me  and as he spoke he stretched out his legs and leaned back in the chair his form became less vague and the colors of his garments more distinct and evident while an expression of gratified relief succeeded to the anxiety of his countenance  two years and a half i exclaimed i dont understand you  it is fully that length of time said the ghost since i first came here mine is not an ordinary case but before i say anything more about it let me ask you again if you are sure mr hinckman will not return tonight  i am as sure of it as i can be of anything i answered he left today for bristol two hundred miles away  then i will go on said the ghost for i am glad to have the opportunity of talking to some one who will listen to me but if john hinckman should come in and catch me here i should be frightened out of my wits  this is all very strange i said greatly puzzled by what i had heard are you the ghost of mr hinckman  this was a bold question but my mind was so full of other emotions that there seemed to be no room for that of fear  yes i am his ghost my companion replied and yet i have no right to be and this is what makes me so uneasy and so much afraid of him it is a strange story and i truly believe without precedent two years and a half ago john hinckman was dangerously ill in this very room at one time he was so far gone that he was really believed to be dead it was in consequence of too precipitate a report in regard to this matter that i was at that time appointed to be his ghost imagine my surprise and horror sir when after i had accepted the position and assumed its responsibilities that old man revived became convalescent and eventually regained his usual health my situation was now one of extreme delicacy and embarrassment i had no power to return to my original unembodiment and i had no right to be the ghost of a man who was not dead i was advised by my friends to quietly maintain my position and was assured that as john hinckman was an elderly man it could not be long before i could rightfully assume the position for which i had been selected but i tell you sir he continued with animation the old fellow seems as vigorous as ever and i have no idea how much longer this annoying state of things will continue i spend my time trying to get out of that old mans way i must not leave this house and he seems to follow me everywhere i tell you sir he haunts me  that is truly a queer state of things i remarked but why are you afraid of him he couldnt hurt you  of course he couldnt said the ghost but his very presence is a shock and terror to me imagine sir how you would feel if my case were yours  i could not imagine such a thing at all i simply shuddered  and if one must be a wrongful ghost at all the apparition continued it would be much pleasanter to be the ghost of some man other than john hinckman there is in him an irascibility of temper accompanied by a facility of invective which is seldom met with and what would happen if he were to see me and find out as i am sure he would how long and why i had inhabited his house i can scarcely conceive i have seen him in his bursts of passion and although he did not hurt the people he stormed at any more than he would hurt me they seemed to shrink before him  all this i knew to be very true had it not been for this peculiarity of mr hinckman i might have been more willing to talk to him about his niece  i feel sorry for you i said for i really began to have a sympathetic feeling toward this unfortunate apparition your case is indeed a hard one it reminds me of those persons who have had doubles and i suppose a man would often be very angry indeed when he found that there was another being who was personating himself  oh the cases are not similar at all said the ghost a double or doppelgänger lives on the earth with a man and being exactly like him he makes all sorts of trouble of course it is very different with me i am not here to live with mr hinckman i am here to take his place now it would make john hinckman very angry if he knew that dont you know it would  i assented promptly  now that he is away i can be easy for a little while continued the ghost and i am so glad to have an opportunity of talking to you i have frequently come into your room and watched you while you slept but did not dare to speak to you for fear that if you talked with me mr hinckman would hear you and come into the room to know why you were talking to yourself  but would he not hear you i asked  oh no said the other there are times when any one may see me but no one hears me except the person to whom i address myself  but why did you wish to speak to me i asked  because replied the ghost i like occasionally to talk to people and especially to some one like yourself whose mind is so troubled and perturbed that you are not likely to be frightened by a visit from one of us but i particularly wanted to ask you to do me a favor there is every probability so far as i can see that john hinckman will live a long time and my situation is becoming insupportable my great object at present is to get myself transferred and i think that you may perhaps be of use to me  transferred i exclaimed what do you mean by that  what i mean said the other is this now that i have started on my career i have got to be the ghost of somebody and i want to be the ghost of a man who is really dead  i should think that would be easy enough i said opportunities must continually occur  not at all not at all said my companion quickly you have no idea what a rush and pressure there is for situations of this kind whenever a vacancy occurs if i may express myself in that way there are crowds of applications for the ghostship  i had no idea that such a state of things existed i said becoming quite interested in the matter there ought to be some regular system or order of precedence by which you could all take your turns like customers in a barbers shop  oh dear that would never do at all said the other some of us would have to wait forever there is always a great rush whenever a good ghostship offers itselfwhile as you know there are some positions that no one would care for and it was in consequence of my being in too great a hurry on an occasion of the kind that i got myself into my present disagreeable predicament and i have thought that it might be possible that you would help me out of it you might know of a case where an opportunity for a ghostship was not generally expected but which might present itself at any moment if you would give me a short notice i know i could arrange for a transfer  what do you mean i exclaimed do you want me to commit suicide or to undertake a murder for your benefit  oh no no no said the other with a vapory smile i mean nothing of that kind to be sure there are lovers who are watched with considerable interest such persons having been known in moments of depression to offer very desirable ghostships but i did not think of anything of that kind in connection with you you were the only person i cared to speak to and i hoped that you might give me some information that would be of use and in return i shall be very glad to help you in your loveaffair  you seem to know that i have such an affair i said  oh yes replied the other with a little yawn i could not be here so much as i have been without knowing all about that  there was something horrible in the idea of madeline and myself having been watched by a ghost even perhaps when we wandered together in the most delightful and bosky places but then this was quite an exceptional ghost and i could not have the objections to him which would ordinarily arise in regard to beings of his class  i must go now said the ghost rising but i will see you somewhere tomorrow night and rememberyou help me and ill help you  i had doubts the next morning as to the propriety of telling madeline anything about this interview and soon convinced myself that i must keep silent on the subject if she knew there was a ghost about the house she would probably leave the place instantly i did not mention the matter and so regulated my demeanor that i am quite sure madeline never suspected what had taken place for some time i had wished that mr hinckman would absent himself for a day at least from the premises in such case i thought i might more easily nerve myself up to the point of speaking to madeline on the subject of our future collateral existence and now that the opportunity for such speech had really occurred i did not feel ready to avail myself of it what would become of me if she refused me  i had an idea however that the lady thought that if i were going to speak at all this was the time she must have known that certain sentiments were afloat within me and she was not unreasonable in her wish to see the matter settled one way or the other but i did not feel like taking a bold step in the dark if she wished me to ask her to give herself to me she ought to offer me some reason to suppose that she would make the gift if i saw no probability of such generosity i would prefer that things should remain as they were                                       that evening i was sitting with madeline in the moonlit porch it was nearly ten oclock and ever since suppertime i had been working myself up to the point of making an avowal of my sentiments i had not positively determined to do this but wished gradually to reach the proper point when if the prospect looked bright i might speak my companion appeared to understand the situationat least i imagined that the nearer i came to a proposal the more she seemed to expect it it was certainly a very critical and important epoch in my life if i spoke i should make myself happy or miserable forever and if i did not speak i had every reason to believe that the lady would not give me another chance to do so  sitting thus with madeline talking a little and thinking very hard over these momentous matters i looked up and saw the ghost not a dozen feet away from us he was sitting on the railing of the porch one leg thrown up before him the other dangling down as he leaned against a post he was behind madeline but almost in front of me as i sat facing the lady it was fortunate that madeline was looking out over the landscape for i must have appeared very much startled the ghost had told me that he would see me sometime this night but i did not think he would make his appearance when i was in the company of madeline if she should see the spirit of her uncle i could not answer for the consequences i made no exclamation but the ghost evidently saw that i was troubled  dont be afraid he said i shall not let her see me and she cannot hear me speak unless i address myself to her which i do not intend to do  i suppose i looked grateful  so you need not trouble yourself about that the ghost continued but it seems to me that you are not getting along very well with your affair if i were you i should speak out without waiting any longer you will never have a better chance you are not likely to be interrupted and so far as i can judge the lady seems disposed to listen to you favorably that is if she ever intends to do so there is no knowing when john hinckman will go away again certainly not this summer if i were in your place i should never dare to make love to hinckmans niece if he were anywhere about the place if he should catch any one offering himself to miss madeline he would then be a terrible man to encounter  i agreed perfectly to all this  i cannot bear to think of him i ejaculated aloud  think of whom asked madeline turning quickly toward me  here was an awkward situation the long speech of the ghost to which madeline paid no attention but which i heard with perfect distinctness had made me forget myself  it was necessary to explain quickly of course it would not do to admit that it was of her dear uncle that i was speaking and so i mentioned hastily the first name i thought of  mr vilars i said  this statement was entirely correct for i never could bear to think of mr vilars who was a gentleman who had at various times paid much attention to madeline  it is wrong for you to speak in that way of mr vilars she said he is a remarkably welleducated and sensible young man and has very pleasant manners he expects to be elected to the legislature this fall and i should not be surprised if he made his mark he will do well in a legislative body for whenever mr vilars has anything to say he knows just how and when to say it  this was spoken very quietly and without any show of resentment which was all very natural for if madeline thought at all favorably of me she could not feel displeased that i should have disagreeable emotions in regard to a possible rival the concluding words contained a hint which i was not slow to understand i felt very sure that if mr vilars were in my present position he would speak quickly enough  i know it is wrong to have such ideas about a person i said but i cannot help it  the lady did not chide me and after this she seemed even in a softer mood as for me i felt considerably annoyed for i had not wished to admit that any thought of mr vilars had ever occupied my mind  you should not speak aloud that way said the ghost or you may get yourself into trouble i want to see everything go well with you because then you may be disposed to help me especially if i should chance to be of any assistance to you which i hope i shall be  i longed to tell him that there was no way in which he could help me so much as by taking his instant departure to make love to a young lady with a ghost sitting on the railing near by and that ghost the apparition of a muchdreaded uncle the very idea of whom in such a position and at such a time made me tremble was a difficult if not an impossible thing to do but i forbore to speak although i may have looked my mind  i suppose continued the ghost that you have not heard anything that might be of advantage to me of course i am very anxious to hear but if you have anything to tell me i can wait until you are alone i will come to you tonight in your room or i will stay here until the lady goes away  you need not wait here i said i have nothing at all to say to you  madeline sprang to her feet her face flushed and her eyes ablaze  wait here she cried what do you suppose i am waiting for nothing to say to me indeedi should think so what should you have to say to me  madeline i exclaimed stepping toward her let me explain  but she had gone  here was the end of the world for me i turned fiercely to the ghost  wretched existence i cried you have ruined everything you have blackened my whole life had it not been for you  but here my voice faltered i could say no more  you wrong me said the ghost i have not injured you i have tried only to encourage and assist you and it is your own folly that has done this mischief but do not despair such mistakes as these can be explained keep up a brave heart goodby  and he vanished from the railing like a bursting soapbubble  i went gloomily to bed but i saw no apparitions that night except those of despair and misery which my wretched thoughts called up the words i had uttered had sounded to madeline like the basest insult of course there was only one interpretation she could put upon them  as to explaining my ejaculations that was impossible i thought the matter over and over again as i lay awake that night and i determined that i would never tell madeline the facts of the case it would be better for me to suffer all my life than for her to know that the ghost of her uncle haunted the house mr hinckman was away and if she knew of his ghost she could not be made to believe that he was not dead she might not survive the shock no my heart could bleed but i would never tell her  the next day was fine neither too cool nor too warm the breezes were gentle and nature smiled but there were no walks or rides with madeline she seemed to be much engaged during the day and i saw but little of her when we met at meals she was polite but very quiet and reserved she had evidently determined on a course of conduct and had resolved to assume that although i had been very rude to her she did not understand the import of my words it would be quite proper of course for her not to know what i meant by my expressions of the night before  i was downcast and wretched and said but little and the only bright streak across the black horizon of my woe was the fact that she did not appear to be happy although she affected an air of unconcern the moonlit porch was deserted that evening but wandering about the house i found madeline in the library alone she was reading but i went in and sat down near her i felt that although i could not do so fully i must in a measure explain my conduct of the night before she listened quietly to a somewhat labored apology i made for the words i had used  i have not the slightest idea what you meant she said but you were very rude  i earnestly disclaimed any intention of rudeness and assured her with a warmth of speech that must have made some impression upon her that rudeness to her would be an action impossible to me i said a great deal upon the subject and implored her to believe that if it were not for a certain obstacle i could speak to her so plainly that she would understand everything  she was silent for a time and then she said rather more kindly i thought than she had spoken before  is that obstacle in any way connected with my uncle  yes i answered after a little hesitation it is in a measure connected with him  she made no answer to this and sat looking at her book but not reading from the expression of her face i thought she was somewhat softened toward me she knew her uncle as well as i did and she may have been thinking that if he were the obstacle that prevented my speaking and there were many ways in which he might be that obstacle my position would be such a hard one that it would excuse some wildness of speech and eccentricity of manner i saw too that the warmth of my partial explanations had had some effect on her and i began to believe that it might be a good thing for me to speak my mind without delay no matter how she should receive my proposition my relations with her could not be worse than they had been the previous night and day and there was something in her face which encouraged me to hope that she might forget my foolish exclamations of the evening before if i began to tell her my tale of love  i drew my chair a little nearer to her and as i did so the ghost burst into the room from the doorway behind her i say burst although no door flew open and he made no noise he was wildly excited and waved his arms above his head the moment i saw him my heart fell within me with the entrance of that impertinent apparition every hope fled from me i could not speak while he was in the room  i must have turned pale and i gazed steadfastly at the ghost almost without seeing madeline who sat between us  do you know he cried that john hinckman is coming up the hill he will be here in fifteen minutes and if you are doing anything in the way of lovemaking you had better hurry it up but this is not what i came to tell you i have glorious news at last i am transferred not forty minutes ago a russian nobleman was murdered by the nihilists nobody ever thought of him in connection with an immediate ghostship my friends instantly applied for the situation for me and obtained my transfer i am off before that horrid hinckman comes up the hill the moment i reach my new position i shall put off this hated semblance goodby you cant imagine how glad i am to be at last the real ghost of somebody  oh i cried rising to my feet and stretching out my arms in utter wretchedness i would to heaven you were mine  i am yours said madeline raising to me her tearful eyes     the philosophy of relative existences   in a certain summer not long gone my friend bentley and i found ourselves in a little hamlet which overlooked a placid valley through which a river gently moved winding its way through green stretches until it turned the end of a line of low hills and was lost to view beyond this river far away but visible from the door of the cottage where we dwelt there lay a city through the mists which floated over the valley we could see the outlines of steeples and tall roofs and buildings of a character which indicated thrift and business stretched themselves down to the opposite edge of the river the more distant parts of the city evidently a small one lost themselves in the hazy summer atmosphere  bentley was young fairhaired and a poet i was a philosopher or trying to be one we were good friends and had come down into this peaceful region to work together although we had fled from the bustle and distractions of the town the appearance in this rural region of a city which so far as we could observe exerted no influence on the quiet character of the valley in which it lay aroused our interest no craft plied up and down the river there were no bridges from shore to shore there were none of those scattered and halfsqualid habitations which generally are found on the outskirts of a city there came to us no distant sound of bells and not the smallest wreath of smoke rose from any of the buildings  in answer to our inquiries our landlord told us that the city over the river had been built by one man who was a visionary and who had a great deal more money than common sense it is not as big a town as you would think sirs he said because the general mistiness of things in this valley makes them look larger than they are those hills for instance when you get to them are not as high as they look to be from here but the town is big enough and a good deal too big for it ruined its builder and owner who when he came to die had not money enough left to put up a decent tombstone at the head of his grave he had a queer idea that he would like to have his town all finished before anybody lived in it and so he kept on working and spending money year after year and year after year until the city was done and he had not a cent left during all the time that the place was building hundreds of people came to him to buy houses or to hire them but he would not listen to anything of the kind no one must live in his town until it was all done even his workmen were obliged to go away at night to lodge it is a town sirs i am told in which nobody has slept for even a night there are streets there and places of business and churches and public halls and everything that a town full of inhabitants could need but it is all empty and deserted and has been so as far back as i can remember and i came to this region when i was a little boy  and is there no one to guard the place we asked no one to protect it from wandering vagrants who might choose to take possession of the buildings  there are not many vagrants in this part of the country he said and if there were they would not go over to that city it is haunted  by what we asked  well sirs i scarcely can tell you queer beings that are not flesh and blood and that is all i know about it a good many people living hereabouts have visited that place once in their lives but i know of no one who has gone there a second time  and travellers i said are they not excited by curiosity to explore that strange uninhabited city  oh yes our host replied almost all visitors to the valley go over to that queer citygenerally in small parties for it is not a place in which one wishes to walk about alone sometimes they see things and sometimes they dont but i never knew any man or woman to show a fancy for living there although it is a very good town  this was said at suppertime and as it was the period of full moon bentley and i decided that we would visit the haunted city that evening our host endeavored to dissuade us saying that no one ever went over there at night but as we were not to be deterred he told us where we would find his small boat tied to a stake on the riverbank we soon crossed the river and landed at a broad but low stone pier at the land end of which a line of tall grasses waved in the gentle night wind as if they were sentinels warning us from entering the silent city we pushed through these and walked up a street fairly wide and so well paved that we noticed none of the weeds and other growths which generally denote desertion or little use by the bright light of the moon we could see that the architecture was simple and of a character highly gratifying to the eye all the buildings were of stone and of good size we were greatly excited and interested and proposed to continue our walks until the moon should set and to return on the following morningto live here perhaps said bentley what could be so romantic and yet so real what could conduce better to the marriage of verse and philosophy but as he said this we saw around the corner of a crossstreet some forms as of people hurrying away  the spectres said my companion laying his hand on my arm  vagrants more likely i answered who have taken advantage of the superstition of the region to appropriate this comfort and beauty to themselves  if that be so said bentley we must have a care for our lives  we proceeded cautiously and soon saw other forms fleeing before us and disappearing as we supposed around corners and into houses and now suddenly finding ourselves upon the edge of a wide open public square we saw in the dim lightfor a tall steeple obscured the moonthe forms of vehicles horses and men moving here and there but before in our astonishment we could say a word one to the other the moon moved past the steeple and in its bright light we could see none of the signs of life and traffic which had just astonished us  timidly with hearts beating fast but with not one thought of turning back nor any fear of vagrantsfor we were now sure that what we had seen was not flesh and blood and therefore harmlesswe crossed the open space and entered a street down which the moon shone clearly here and there we saw dim figures which quickly disappeared but approaching a low stone balcony in front of one of the houses we were surprised to see sitting thereon and leaning over a book which lay open upon the top of the carved parapet the figure of a woman who did not appear to notice us  that is a real person whispered bentley and she does not see us  no i replied it is like the others let us go near it  we drew near to the balcony and stood before it at this the figure raised its head and looked at us it was beautiful it was young but its substance seemed to be of an ethereal quality which we had never seen or known of with its full soft eyes fixed upon us it spoke  why are you here it asked i have said to myself that the next time i saw any of you i would ask you why you come to trouble us cannot you live content in your own realms and spheres knowing as you must know how timid we are and how you frighten us and make us unhappy in all this city there is i believe not one of us except myself who does not flee and hide from you whenever you cruelly come here even i would do that had not i declared to myself that i would see you and speak to you and endeavor to prevail upon you to leave us in peace  the clear frank tones of the speaker gave me courage we are two men i answered strangers in this region and living for the time in the beautiful country on the other side of the river having heard of this quiet city we have come to see it for ourselves we had supposed it to be uninhabited but now that we find that this is not the case we would assure you from our hearts that we do not wish to disturb or annoy any one who lives here we simply came as honest travellers to view the city  the figure now seated herself again and as her countenance was nearer to us we could see that it was filled with pensive thought for a moment she looked at us without speaking men she said and so i have been right for a long time i have believed that the beings who sometimes come here filling us with dread and awe are men  and you i exclaimedwho are you and who are these forms that we have seen these strange inhabitants of this city  she gently smiled as she answered we are the ghosts of the future we are the people who are to live in this city generations hence but all of us do not know that principally because we do not think about it and study about it enough to know it and it is generally believed that the men and women who sometimes come here are ghosts who haunt the place  and that is why you are terrified and flee from us i exclaimed you think we are ghosts from another world  yes she replied that is what is thought and what i used to think  and you i asked are spirits of human beings yet to be  yes she answered but not for a long time generations of meni know not how manymust pass away before we are men and women  heavens exclaimed bentley clasping his hands and raising his eyes to the sky i shall be a spirit before you are a woman  perhaps she said again with a sweet smile upon her face you may live to be very very old  but bentley shook his head this did not console him for some minutes i stood in contemplation gazing upon the stone pavement beneath my feet and this i ejaculated is a city inhabited by the ghosts of the future who believe men and women to be phantoms and spectres  she bowed her head  but how is it i asked that you discovered that you are spirits and we mortal men  there are so few of us who think of such things she answered so few who study ponder and reflect i am fond of study and i love philosophy and from the reading of many books i have learned much from the book which i have here i have learned most and from its teachings i have gradually come to the belief which you tell me is the true one that we are spirits and you men  and what book is that i asked  it is the philosophy of relative existences by rupert vance  ye gods i exclaimed springing upon the balcony that is my book and i am rupert vance i stepped toward the volume to seize it but she raised her hand  you cannot touch it she said it is the ghost of a book and did you write it  write it no i said i am writing it it is not yet finished  but here it is she said turning over the last pages as a spirit book it is finished it is very successful it is held in high estimation by intelligent thinkers it is a standard work  i stood trembling with emotion high estimation i said a standard work  oh yes she replied with animation and it well deserves its great success especially in its conclusion i have read it twice  but let me see these concluding pages i exclaimed let me look upon what i am to write  she smiled and shook her head and closed the book i would like to do that she said but if you are really a man you must not know what you are going to do  oh tell me tell me cried bentley from below do you know a book called stellar studies by arthur bentley it is a book of poems  the figure gazed at him no it said presently i never heard of it  i stood trembling had the youthful figure before me been flesh and blood had the book been a real one i would have torn it from her  o wise and lovely being i exclaimed falling on my knees before her be also benign and generous let me but see the last page of my book if i have been of benefit to your world more than all if i have been of benefit to you let me see i implore youlet me see how it is that i have done it  she rose with the book in her hand you have only to wait until you have done it she said and then you will know all that you could see here i started to my feet and stood alone upon the balcony  i am sorry said bentley as we walked toward the pier where we had left our boat that we talked only to that ghost girl and that the other spirits were all afraid of us persons whose souls are choked up with philosophy are not apt to care much for poetry and even if my book is to be widely known it is easy to see that she may not have heard of it  i walked triumphant the moon almost touching the horizon beamed like red gold my dear friend said i i have always told you that you should put more philosophy into your poetry that would make it live  and i have always told you said he that you should not put so much poetry into your philosophy it misleads people  it didnt mislead that ghost girl said i  how do you know said bentley perhaps she is wrong and the other inhabitants of the city are right and we may be the ghosts after all such things you know are only relative anyway he continued after a little pause i wish i knew that those ghosts were now reading the poem which i am going to begin tomorrow     a piece of red calico   i was going into town one morning from my suburban residence when my wife handed me a little piece of red calico and asked me if i would have time during the day to buy her two yards and a half of calico like that i assured her that it would be no trouble at all and putting the sample in my pocket i took the train for the city  at lunchtime i stopped in at a large drygoods store to attend to my wifes commission i saw a welldressed man walking the floor between the counters where long lines of girls were waiting on much longer lines of customers and asked him where i could see some red calico  this way sir and he led me up the store miss stone said he to a young lady show this gentleman some red calico  what shade do you want asked miss stone  i showed her the little piece of calico that my wife had given me she looked at it and handed it back to me then she took down a great roll of red calico and spread it out on the counter  why that isnt the shade said i  no not exactly said she but it is prettier than your sample  that may be said i but you see i want to match this piece there is something already made of this kind of calico which needs to be enlarged or mended or something i want some calico of the same shade  the girl made no answer but took down another roll  thats the shade said she  yes i replied but its striped  stripes are more worn than anything else in calicoes said she  yes but this isnt to be worn its for furniture i think at any rate i want perfectly plain stuff to match something already in use  well i dont think you can find it perfectly plain unless you get turkey red  what is turkey red i asked  turkey red is perfectly plain in calicoes she answered  well let me see some  we havent any turkeyred calico left she said but we have some very nice plain calicoes in other colors  i dont want any other color i want stuff to match this  its hard to match cheap calico like that she said and so i left her  i next went into a store a few doors farther up the street when i entered i approached the floorwalker and handing him my sample said  have you any calico like this  yes sir said he third counter to the right  i went to the third counter to the right and showed my sample to the salesman in attendance there he looked at it on both sides then he said  we havent any of this  i was told you had said i  we had it but were out of it now youll get that goods at an upholsterers  i went across the street to an upholsterers  have you any stuff like this i asked  no said the salesman we havent is it for furniture  yes i replied  then turkey red is what you want  is turkey red just like this i asked  no said he but its much better  that makes no difference to me i replied i want something just like this  but they dont use that for furniture he said  i should think people could use anything they wanted for furniture i remarked somewhat sharply  they can but they dont he said quite calmly they dont use red like that they use turkey red  i said no more but left the next place i visited was a very large drygoods store of the first salesman i saw i inquired if they kept red calico like my sample  youll find that on the second story said he  i went upstairs there i asked a man  where will i find red calico  in the far room to the left over there and he pointed to a distant corner  i walked through the crowds of purchasers and salespeople and around the counters and tables filled with goods to the far room to the left when i got there i asked for red calico  the second counter down this side said the man  i went there and produced my sample calicoes downstairs said the man  they told me they were up here i said  not these plain goods youll find em downstairs at the back of the store over on that side  i went downstairs to the back of the store  where will i find red calico like this i asked  next counter but one said the man addressed walking with me in the direction pointed out  dunn show red calicoes  mr dunn took my sample and looked at it  we havent this shade in that quality of goods he said  well have you it in any quality of goods i asked  yes weve got it finer and he took down a piece of calico and unrolled a yard or two of it on the counter  thats not this shade i said  no said he the goods is finer and the colors better  i want it to match this i said  i thought you werent particular about the match said the salesman you said you didnt care for the quality of the goods and you know you cant match goods without you take into consideration quality and color both if you want that quality of goods in red you ought to get turkey red  i did not think it necessary to answer this remark but said  then youve got nothing to match this  no sir but perhaps they may have it in the upholstery department in the sixth story  so i got in the elevator and went up to the top of the house  have you any red stuff like this i said to a young man  red stuff upholstery departmentother end of this floor  i went to the other end of the floor  i want some red calico i said to a man  furniture goods he asked  yes said i  fourth counter to the left  i went to the fourth counter to the left and showed my sample to a salesman he looked at it and said  youll get this down on the first floorcalico department  i turned on my heel descended in the elevator and went out on the street i was thoroughly sick of red calico but i determined to make one more trial my wife had bought her red calico not long before and there must be some to be had somewhere i ought to have asked her where she obtained it but i thought a simple little thing like that could be bought anywhere  i went into another large drygoods store as i entered the door a sudden tremor seized me i could not bear to take out that piece of red calico if i had had any other kind of a rag about mea penwiper or anything of the sorti think i would have asked them if they could match that  but i stepped up to a young woman and presented my sample with the usual question  back room counter on the left she said  i went there  have you any red calico like this i asked of the saleswoman behind the counter  no sir she said but we have it in turkey red  turkey red again i surrendered  all right i said give me turkey red  how much sir she asked  i dont knowsay five yards  she looked at me rather strangely but measured off five yards of turkeyred calico then she rapped on the counter and called out cash a little girl with yellow hair in two long plaits came slowly up the lady wrote the number of yards the name of the goods her own number the price the amount of the banknote i handed her and some other matters probably the color of my eyes and the direction and velocity of the wind on a slip of paper she then copied all this into a little book which she kept by her then she handed the slip of paper the money and the turkey red to the yellowhaired girl this young person copied the slip into a little book she carried and then she went away with the calico the paper slip and the money  after a very long timeduring which the little girl probably took the goods the money and the slip to some central desk where the note was received its amount and number entered in a book change given to the girl a copy of the slip made and entered girls entry examined and approved goods wrapped up girl registered plaits counted and entered on a slip of paper and copied by the girl in her book girl taken to a hydrant and washed number of towel entered on a paper slip and copied by the girl in her book value of my note and amount of change branded somewhere on the child and said process noted on a slip of paper and copied in her bookthe girl came to me bringing my change and the package of turkeyred calico  i had time for but very little work at the office that afternoon and when i reached home i handed the package of calico to my wife she unrolled it and exclaimed  why this dont match the piece i gave you  match it i cried oh no it dont match it you didnt want that matched you were mistaken what you wanted was turkey redthird counter to the left i mean turkey red is what they use  my wife looked at me in amazement and then i detailed to her my troubles  well said she this turkey red is a great deal prettier than what i had and youve got so much of it that i neednt use the other at all i wish i had thought of turkey red before  i wish from the bottom of my heart you had said i     cameo edition   reveries of a bachelor or a book of the heart by donald g mitchell with an etching by percy moran  dream life a fable of
