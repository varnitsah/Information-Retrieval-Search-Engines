exposureconclusion         251     the young bridge tender     chapter i  a question of property   its a shame mother the property belonged to father and the village has no right to its use without paying for it  i agree with you ralph replied mrs nelson but what are we to do in the matter  why dont you speak to squire paget he is the president of the village board  i have spoken to him but he will give me no satisfaction he claims that the village has the right to nearly all the water front within its limits replied mrs nelson with a sigh  it hasnt a right to the land father bought and paid for  that is what i said  and what did he answer to that questioned ralph nelson with increasing interest  he said he doubted if your father had really bought the land he asked me to show him the papers in the case  and those you havent got  no i cannot find them your father placed them away and when he died so suddenly he said nothing about where they had been placed i have an idea he gave them to somebody for safe keeping  its a pity we havent the papers mother the property on which this end of the swinging bridge rests and the land right around it is going to be very valuable some day i heard mr hooker say so at the post office only yesterday  i have no doubt of it ralph when westville becomes a city instead of a village but that is many years off i imagine  i suppose it isthe village folks are so slow to make improvements its a wonder they ever put up the bridge across to eastport  they wouldnt have done it had it not been for eastport capitalists who furnished nearly all of the money  and now that the bridge has been up several years and the tolls are coming in daily i suppose they are glad they let the structure go up  to be sure folks like to see a paying improvement  well about this property business mother do you think we can find those missing papers went on ralph after a pause  i am sure i hope so my son but where to start to look for them i havent the least idea  we might advertise for them  yes we might but i doubt if it would do any good if any one around here had them they would give them to us without the advertising  they would unless they hoped to make something out of it replied ralph suddenly struck with a new idea  make something ralph what do you mean  perhaps the one holding the papers intends to keep them and some day claim the land as his own  oh i do not believe any one would be so dishonest cried mrs nelson  i do mother there are just as mean folks in westville as anywhere else  but they would not dare to defraud us openly  some folks would dare do anything for money replied ralph nelson with a decided nod of his curly head  ralph was the only son of his widowed mother his father randolph nelson had been in former years a boatman on keniscot lake when the swinging bridge had been built between westville and eastport mr nelson had been appointed bridge tender  the old boatman had occupied his position at the bridge taking tolls and opening the structure for passing vessels for exactly two years then one blustery and rainy day he had slipped into the water and before he could manage to save himself had been struck by the bow of a steamboat and seriously hurt  mr nelson had been taken from the water almost immediately after being wounded and all that could be done was done for him but without avail he was unconscious and only came to himself long enough to bid his weeping wife and only child a tender farewell thirtysix hours after the accident he was dead and his funeral occurred three days later  for a time mrs nelson and ralph were nearly prostrated by the calamity that had taken place but stern necessity soon compelled them to put aside their grief although mr nelson owned a small cottage close to the bridge he had left but a small amountless than a hundred dollarsin cash behind him they must work to support themselves  ralphs father had been appointed bridge tender for a period of three years and the son applied for the balance of his parents term his application was objected to by squire paget who wished to put dan pickley a village idler in the place but the bridge board overruled him and mrs nelson was appointed to fill her husbands situationevery one knowing that ralph was to do the work  the pay was not largeonly six dollars per weekbut as the nelsons had no rent to pay they managed to get along quite comfortably there was a vegetable garden attached to the cottage and during his spare time ralph worked in this his mother also took in sewing and they had now saved sixty dollars for a rainy day  westville and eastport were situated on the two sides of a narrow channel which united big silver lake sometimes called keniscot lake on the north with silver lake on the south the upper lake was several miles long while the lower sheet of water which emptied into the ramapo river at chambersburgh was less than half the size  westville had always been a backward town due mostly to the shortsightedness of squire paget mr hooker the postmaster and other narrowminded leading men who never saw fit to offer any inducements to manufacturers and others to locate there the village consisted of halfadozen stores a blacksmith shop a tavern and less than seventyfive houses there was one hat factory there but this was closed more than half the time  eastport on the other hand was booming it had two hat factories three planing mills a furniture works and a foundry there were several blocks of stores lit up at night by electric lights and several hundred houses real estate too was advancing rapidly  the nelsons had owned their cottage and the land upon which it stood for many years but a year previous to the building of the bridge mr nelson had added nearly half an acre to his ground purchasing it very cheaply from a fellowboatman who had left westville and struck out for some place in the west this was the ground which was now in dispute the papers in reference to it were missing and as the sale had never been recorded it was likely that mrs nelson and ralph would have much trouble in obtaining their rights     chapter ii  the smash at the bridge   during the conversation recorded above ralph had been at work in the dooryard of the cottage while his mother was busy tying up the honeysuckle vines which grew over the porch it was a bright summer day with a stiff breeze blowing from the southwest  theres a sloop coming up silver lake ralph cried his mother presently as she looked across the water from the cottage porch i guess you will have to open the bridge  i havent heard any horn returned ralph as he dropped his rake and ran up to look at the craft  nor i but the boat is heading for the draw  perhaps its one of those summerboarder pleasure parties that dont know anything about blowing for a bridge tender said the son after a few seconds of silence ill go down and make sure  ralph was as good as his word leaving the door he walked rapidly along a footpath which led directly to the bridge arriving there in less than a minute and a half  as he walked on the bridge a carriage from eastport containing several ladies came over they paid the toll to bob sanderson an old man who helped ralph in this way during the slack hours of the day in return for the work sanderson was allowed an attic room and board at the nelson cottage  sixteen cents since you went away ralph said sanderson as he handed over the amount in pennies aint many folks out this morning  there will be more toward noon mr sanderson travel is always light between nine and eleven  thats so my but theres a stiff breeze ablowin aint there  yes if it keeps on well have a regular gale by night  what brought you back so soon i thought you was goin to whitewash your side fence  i came down to see if that sloop wanted to go through its sailing right for the draw  they didnt blow no horn  perhaps they dont know enough for that i declare whats he up to now went on ralph a second later  he had espied a single man standing in the stern of the sloop the man had commenced to work at the mainsail the managing of which appeared to bother him not a little  he dont seem to know the ropes returned bob sanderson i guess hes tryin to lower sail and cant  he is carrying too much canvas for this breeze  i agree with you ralph but most of them chaps with sloops are a daring set they always want to sail at racing speed  he wants to go through that draw thats certain responded ralph  going into the little house at the end of the bridge he got out the key and the handlebar he unlocked the chain which held the end of the bridge in position and then inserting the bar into the turnpost or capstan began to walk around with it  slowly but surely the bridge began to swing loose from the side which connected with the permanent portion on the eastport end and moved toward the solid foundation which was built directly in front of where the nelson dooryard ran down to the waters edge  it was hard work to move the bridge around but ralph was used to it and he did not mind as he walked around with the bar before him he kept his eyes on the sloop and the man sailing her  the bridge was threequarters open when the boy noted with some surprise that the man on the sloop had thrown over the mainsail half against the wind instantly the sloop began to swing around heading full for the stone pier upon which the bridge swung  why whats the matter with him he cried in dismay  guess he dont know how to manage his boat replied bob sanderson hes comin chuckablock for this place  hi hi what are you up to cried ralph as he dropped the bar and rushed over to the side of the bridge do you want to run into the stonework  i cant manage the sail replied the man on the sloop my arm is lame and the ropes are all twisted  well throw your tiller over and be quick or  ralph had not time to say more nor was the man able to profit by his advice an extra heavy puff of wind caught the mainsail of the boat and with a loud crash she clashed into the stone pier bow first  the shock was so great that the bowsprit was smashed to pieces as was also the woodwork around it the man who had been standing partly on the stern sheets was thrown overboard by the accident and he disappeared beneath the water  fearful that the fellow who was evidently a city person might not be able to swim ralph leaped down from the bridge into the sloop and went to his assistance  save me save me called out the man frantically and he threw his hands up over his head  catch hold of the boathook replied ralph and he reached out with the article as he spoke  the man grasped the curved iron nervously and ralph at once drew him to the side of the sloop  now give me your hand and i will help you up  and without waiting he caught the man by the right arm  dont dont take the other arm please that was broken less than six weeks ago  oh then give me the left replied ralph and by his aid the man was soon aboard the sloop once more  he was a fellow not over twentyfive years of age and his clothing and general appearance indicated that he was welltodo  phew but that was a narrow escape he ejaculated as he brushed the water from his face i was afraid i was a goner sure  couldnt you keep away from the stonework questioned ralph curiously  no the ropes got twisted into a knot and my right arm hurt so i could only use my left hand besides i am not much of a sailor  i seen you wasnt put in bob sanderson who did not hesitate at times to speak out bluntly if it hadnt been for ralph you would have been drowned  i dont doubt it for i cannot swim  how came you to be out in such a blow and all alone asked ralph as he began to lower the ships sails  it didnt blow so when i started from chambersburgh and i fancied i could manage the magic without half trying but i have found out my mistake now and the man gave a sorry little laugh are you the bridge tender  yes sir  and what is your name  ralph nelson  mine is horace kelsey you are rather young for this position are you not  it was my fathers before he died i am serving the rest of the time for which he was appointed  i see does it pay you  i earn six dollars a week at it thats considered pretty good here in westville there are many who would like to get the job  i came up here from new york to spend a few weeks boating and fishing said horace kelsey during a pause in which he dried off his face and hands and wrung the water from his coat this is my first day out and it has ended rather disastrously  i guess your sloop can easily be repaired replied ralph  i suppose it can is there any one here in the village who does such work  thats in my line put in bob sanderson promptly  yes mr sanderson repairs boats replied ralph he will give you a good job at a reasonable price  then you can go to work at once said horace kelsey turning to the old fisherman do your best and i will pay whatever it is worth  i will sir  when can you have the work completed  not before tomorrow night ill have to paint the parts you know  i am in no hurry i wished to spend a day or two around westville and eastport before going up into big silver lake  then ill take the sloop around to my boathouse right now replied bob sanderson and off he went with the craft leaving ralph and the newcomer on the bridge     chapter iii  ralph makes a friend   youll catch cold if you stand around in this wind remarked ralph to horace kelsey especially as you are not used to it  that is true returned the young man i wish i had some place where i might dry myself  you can go over to our cottage if you wish mother is at home and she will willingly let you dry yourself at the kitchen fire i would lend you one of my suits but i imagine it wouldnt be large enough  hardly laughed the young man do you live far from here  no sir that is the cottage right there see my mother is in the garden looking this way  thanks ill take up with your kind offer i am beginning to get chilled in spite of the sunshine  saying that he would be back later horace kelsey left the bridge and took the path leading to the cottage ralph saw him speak to his mother and a moment later both passed into the cottage  it was now drawing toward noon and the people began to cross the bridge in both directions on their way to dinner each one either paid a cent or passed over a ticket sixtyfive of which could be had for fifty cents at a quarter to one the same passengers began to go back to their work and this was kept up for half an hour at the end of which the young bridge tender had collected twentyone cents and fortythree tickets  several horns now began to blow from both big silver and silver lakes showing that the boats wished to pass through the draw the bridge which had been closed by ralph immediately after the rescue of horace kelsey was opened for their accommodation  while the young bridge tender was waiting for the last vessel to clear the draw the young man from new york came back from the cottage bringing with him the lunch mrs nelson usually brought herself there was no time for dinner during the middle of the day and so the family had their principal meal at night when the draw was closed for the day and bob sanderson went on to collect the toll  your mother gave me the lunch said horace kelsey as he handed the basket to ralph i told her i was coming down to see you  is your clothing dry  oh yes she was kind enough to lend me some which had belonged to your father and built up an extra hot fire to dry my own she also pressed out my suit as you can see your mother is a very accommodating lady  horace kelsey did not add that he had paid mrs nelson liberally for her kindness for he was not one to brag in that direction nevertheless ralph heard of it later on  in the basket were several sandwiches of cold corned beef and halfadozen peaches ralph offered one of the peaches to the young man which he took and both sat down to eat  you will find a tavern up the main road a two minutes walk from here began the youth thinking that horace kelsey might wish for something more substantial in the way of food  thank you but your mother supplied me with a very good lunch while i was waiting ralph returned the young man dont mind me but go ahead and enjoy your lunch  ralph at once set to for he was hungry his companion looked up the lake for a moment in silence and then went on  i came down here to reward you ralph he said hesitatingly  reward me what for mr kelsey  for saving my life  i dont think i did as much as that anybody could have pulled you from the water  they might not have been as quick as you were i feel i owe you something for your prompt aid  i dont want anything sir i would have done as much for any one  i do not doubt it and it is to your credit to say so but i feel i ought to do something for you will you accept thisnot as payment for what was done for i could not pay for that in this waybut as a gift from a friend  and horace kelsey drew from his vest pocket a new and crisp twentydollar bill  i dont see as i ought to take it hesitated ralph  but you will here dont let it blow overboard and the young man from new york thrust it into ralphs hand directly between a sandwich he was holding  indeed i wont let it blow away i thank you verhallo you have made a big mistake  how  this is a twentydollar bill  i see no mistake about that and horace kelsey smiled quietly  you dont mean to say you meant to give me twenty dollars  i did it is little enough for such a service  its too much i thought it was a onedollar bill sir  i would not be mean enough to offer you only a dollar ralph a man isnt pulled from a watery grave as the poets call it every day  i dont think i ought to take all this money returned the young bridge tender slowly  i do so put it into your pocket and say no more about it  ralph continued to argue the point but was finally persuaded to place the bill in his private purse  your mother has been telling me a little about your family affairs went on horace kelsey its a pity you havent a clear title to this land about here  we have a clear enough title if only we can find the papers in this case returned ralph promptly  i understand a syndicate from chambersburgh are thinking of locating a big shoe factory here if they do that westville will have a boom  it would have boomed long ago if it hadnt been for squire paget and some others they hold their land so high and keep the taxes on the hat factory up so the manufacturers are scared away  that is true especially when other places donate them land free and exempt them from all taxation for from five to ten years  do they do that  certainly and in many cases it pays very well for the factories employ hundreds of hands who receive fair wages and that is spent in the place where it is earned  its a wonder that shoe factory would come here if such inducements are offered elsewhere said ralph thoughtfully  i understand several men including squire paget and the postmaster of this place have received stock in the concern i do not know much about the deal i only heard it talked over at the hotel  where are they going to locate the factory  somewhere along the water front i believe  then it will be around here cried ralph that is our land over there he pointed with his hand i wish we could prove our title to it  so do i ralph and i wish i could help you you havent any idea who had the papers last  no sir  too bad i would advertise for them and even offer a reward for them  i will returned ralph quickly ill use this twenty dollars you have given me for that very purpose  horace kelsey remained with ralph the best part of an hour longer and then started for a walk through the village stating that he would call on bob sanderson and see how the boat repairing was progressing  when he was out of sight ralph pulled the twentydollar bill from his purse to make sure that he had not been dreaming but there was the money true enough there was a grease spot on one corner of the bill left by the butter on the sandwich but this did no harm  hallo there ralph nelson counting your fortune cried a rude voice from the shore and looking up ralph saw a loudlydressed youth approaching he hastily slipped the twentydollar bill into his pocket     chapter iv  the quarrel on the bridge   the boy on the shore was percy paget the squires only son he was a year older than ralph and somewhat taller and heavier his ways were arrogant to the last degree and in the village he had but few friends and these only because he generally had pocket money to spend  on several occasions ralph had had sharp words with percy because the latter wished to do as he pleased on the bridge against the printed rules that were posted up because his parent was squire percy imagined he could do almost anything and it would be all right  i say are you counting your fortune repeated percy throwing as much of a sneer into his tones as possible  unfortunately i havent any fortune to count percy returned the young bridge tender goodnaturedly  humph i suppose you mean that for a pun dont you growled the son of the squire if you do let me tell you its a mighty poor one  i hadnt intended to pun percy  i didnt think so for you havent the brains didnt i see you counting some money just now  i was looking at a bank bill  that you got on the bridge i suppose  no it was a bill of my own  oh i thought you had to use all the money you made here  i have to use the most of it my pay isnt any too large as you know  yes but i guess you make enough besides returned percy suggestively  what do you mean  youve got plenty of chance on the bridge with so many odd pennies coming in  do you mean to insinuate i steal the toll money demanded ralph angered at the insinuation  i didnt say so sneered the other more suggestively than ever  but you meant it  well what if i did  its mean of you percy paget i never stole a cent in my life  its easy enough for you to say so  and its true you must think that every one is a thief just because somebody was caught stealing tarts out of the bakery  ralph was angry or he would not have spoken as he did as percy had been discovered taking tarts and cakes from the counters of a pastry shop in eastport only a few weeks before and as he had been threatened with arrest for so doing the squires son reddened at once  see here ralph nelson dont you dare to talk to me like that he stormed  i have more grounds to talk than you percy paget  no you havent you low upstart  hold on percy i am no upstart  yes you are what was your father only a poor boatman on the lakes  he was a hardworking man and an honest one returned ralph warmly  oh of course and you were all next door to beggars until my father took pity on him and gave him the job on the bridge  it was the committee and not your father who gave him the situation  well it was the same thing for the committee have to do as my father says  i doubt it  i dont care for your opinion i know one thing they ought to have somebody else to mind the bridge and perhaps they will have before long  why what do you mean asked ralph in quick alarm  ha ha i thought that would wake you up  is somebody trying to undermine me  youll hear of it soon enough never fear  and with this parting shot which was not without its effect percy started to cross the bridge  hold on cried ralph  what do you want now  the toll money  im only going to the eastport end of the bridge ill be back in a couple of minutes  that makes no difference every one who crosses the bridge has to pay toll  but im coming right back  i dont care if you return as soon as you strike the last plank you have got to pay or you cant cross returned ralph firmly  i wont pay a cent blustered percy angrily  then you cant cross  and who will stop me id like to know  i will  you cant do it  perhaps i can anyway if you dont pay ill try you know the rules just as well as i do  there aint any fellow in westville can stop me from going where i please howled the squires son and once more he started to walk on  with a quick movement ralph stepped in front of the aristocratic bully  not another step until you pay the toll he exclaimed his eyes flashing their determination  out of my way you upstart roared percy  and raising his fist he aimed a heavy blow at ralphs face  the young bridge tender caught the blow on the arm and the next moment had percy jammed up against the iron railing to one side  now you either pay your way or go back just as quick as you can he said firmly i want no more trouble with you  let go of me  not until you promise to do one thing or the other  im not going to pay fumed percy  then you cant cross thats settled  well see take that and that  percy began to strike out wildly ralph warded off most of the blows and then upset the aristocratic bully on his back and came down on top of him they rolled over together and at length percy set up a howl of pain  oh my shoulder you have twisted it out of place  have you had enough demanded ralph  yes yes  will you pay the toll  i dont want to go over now  all right then you can go back to shore  ralph arose to his feet and the aristocratic bully slowly followed several persons were coming across the bridge now and the young bridge tender ran to collect their tolls leaving his late antagonist to brush off his sadlysoiled clothes  ill fix you for this cried percy after the passengers had passed out of hearing well see if the village will allow a ruffian like you to tend bridge much longer  and off he stalked with his face full of dark and bitter hatred  ralph looked after him anxiously would percys threat amount to anything it would be a real calamity to lose his situation on the bridge  then ralph started to brush off his own clothes while he was doing so he felt in his pocket to see if his twenty dollars was still safe the bill was gone  with great eagerness he began a search for the missing banknote it was all to no purpose the money could not be found     chapter v  a hunt for the missing bill   ralph was deeply chagrined to think that the twentydollar bill could not be found he had calculated that with it he might advertise for the missing papers and even offer a small reward  he was loath to give up the search and after his first hasty hunt went over every foot of the plank walk of the bridge and even under it  it must have slipped from my pocket and the wind must have blown it into the water he thought bitterly that was a pretty dear quarrel especially as it was not in the least of my making  thinking he might possibly find the bill floating on the water the young bridge tender sprang into his rowboat the martha which was tied up to the ironwork under the bridge and pulled around the stonework and some distance down into silver lake  he found nothing and inside of ten minutes had to go back to his post of duty and collect toll from several people who were coming over from eastport  im out twenty dollars and thats all there is to it he muttered to himself its too bad why cant percy paget stay away and mind his own business  the remainder of the afternoon passed quietly saving for the mild excitement of the working folks going and coming after factory hours and at dark bob sanderson came on duty  the sloop is gettin on finely said the old fellow in response to ralphs inquiry the woodwork is about done and ill paint her first thing in the morning  you want to make a firstclass job of it mr sanderson i know mr kelsey will pay the price  im agoing to ralph what did he give you for hauling him from the water  twenty dollars  shoo he must be rich  i imagine he is  what are you going to do with the money  nothing ive lost it  lost it  yes  and ralph related the particulars of his encounter with percy paget and how the money had disappeared during the fracas  its a tarnal shame ralph thet air dude aint worth your twentydollar bill nohow  i am sorry he came here i hope he stays away hereafter  i wouldnt take none of his talk grumbled bob sanderson with a shake of his grizzled head i reckon what he said about gettin you into trouble is all nonsense  i hope it is for i couldnt afford to lose my place here  squire paget isnt so powerful as his son thinks there are lots of folks in this village gettin tired of his domineerin ways  i know he is not as powerful now as he was but still he is squire and that counts  why dont you go on another hunt for the bill maybe it has floated away down the lake  i will go out it will do no harm said ralph  and neither did it do any good for a halfhours search on the lake and along the shore brought nothing of interest to light the young bridge tender tied his boat up at the foot of the garden and walked up to the cottage  mrs nelson had the evening meal all prepared and the two at once sat down  you sent a very profitable visitor to the cottage this morning ralph began his mother as she poured the tea while he cut up the meat  you mean mr kelsey  yes he came here to get dry and told me how you had rescued him from the lake he said you had acted very bravely  it was not much to do but why do you say he was a profitable visitor mother did he pay you anything for what you did  yes he paid me two dollars i didnt want a cent but he insisted on it  then he is certainly rich mother for he gave me twenty dollars in addition  why ralph  but hold on mother dont be too pleased i have already lost the money so his generosity will do me no good  and ralph told his mother the story just as he had told it to old bob sanderson their boarder  that paget boy is a bad egg i am afraid said mrs nelson with a grave look on her face i am sorry you got into trouble with him  so am i but it couldnt be helped the bridge rules say that no person is to cross without paying toll percy knows the rules too  i understand he has caused the squire a lot of trouble but for all that he is his fathers pet  its strange if percy gives him so much trouble  well the two are alone in the world and that may make a difference have we not been drawn closer together since your father died  that is true mother but i try to do right and  you do what is right ralph as much as i love you i would not stand by you were you to do a deliberate wrong  i dont believe percy will do much said ralph after a long pause i was sticking up for the rules and that is what i am put there to do  after the supper dishes were cleared away mrs nelson put on her bonnet and took a basket to do a little trading at one of the stores leaving ralph to take care of the cottage while she was gone  ill go along and carry the things for you if you wish said her son  i am going to get a few things ralph which will not be heavy and i wish to see mr dicks about the calico he sold me which is not as good as he represented you may stay home and read  ill study my school books mother i want to master commercial arithmetic if i can maybe one of these days i can become a bookkeeper in one of the eastport factories  i trust so my son that or something even better i would not wish you to remain a bridge tender all your life  a moment later mrs nelson was on her way to the village center ralph lit the sittingroom lamp and got out his books and his slate soon he had forgotten all about the exciting scenes of the day in an earnest endeavor to do a complicated example in profit and loss  he worked out the problem and then tackled something harder still not having anyone to guide him he made numerous mistakes but he kept on without becoming disheartened and at last the second example was solved as correctly as the first  he was just about to begin a third when his mother entered the cottage almost breathlessly from the look on her face it was plain to see she had something to tell that was of great importance     chapter vi  mrs nelsons story   what is it mother cried ralph as mrs nelson placed her basket on the floor and dropped into a chair  oh ralph i can hardly believe it possible exclaimed the good woman catching her breath  believe what possible  that percy paget would be so wicked  why what has he done now mother  ralph i believe he took your twentydollar bill  what makes you think that  and in his excitement the boy shoved back his books and slate and sprang to his feet  from what i overheard down to mr dicks store while i was doing my trading  what did you overhear  his son william waited on me and while he was doing it his father began to count the money in the drawer and then asked who had paid in the twentydollar bill  and what did will dicks say questioned ralph eagerly  he said he had got the bill from percy paget  he did it must be my bill  so i thought and came home as quickly as i could to tell you  percy has lots of spending money but i doubt if he has twenty dollars at a time went on ralph walking up and down the sittingroom in his thoughtfulness but to think he would turn pickpocket  maybe the money fell from your pocket during the quarrel and he picked it up  it would be just as bad as stealing he knew it was my money he saw me put the money in my pocket when he came on the bridge  it would certainly seem that it was your bill  ill go down and question will dicks about it or perhaps you did so  no i only listened to what he told his father and then came home if you go down ralph be careful and avoid more trouble  if it is really my bill i am not going to stand being cheated  remember squire paget is an influential man  i dont believe his influence will count in this case but i will be careful ralph added to overcome his mothers anxiety  without further words he put on his coat and hurried down into the village when he reached uriah dicks general store he found father and son in the act of putting up the shutters for the night  i would like to see you a minute will ralph said to the son  all right returned will dicks and leaving his father to place the last of the shutters up he led the way inside the store  i believe percy paget paid you a twentydollar bill this afternoon began ralph hardly knowing how to open the conversation  he paid it to me just before supper time  did he say anything about where he got it  why no why do you ask  i have my reasons will will you let me see the bill  whats the trouble asked will dicks and his father stepped into the doorway to hear what the young bridge tender might have to say  i would like to see the bill that is all  but cant you tell me what the trouble is insisted will dicks  maybe ralph intends to accuse percy of obtaining it feloniously put in uriah dicks cautiously speak up boy and let us know whats in your mind  i would rather not say mr dicks i wish to look at the bill that is all  well if you cant tell me of the trouble i dont know as i will let you see that bill returned uriah sourly  and what is your objection  i aint agoing to be accommodating to a boy that puts me off in the dark  it may save you some trouble mr dicks  what me what do you mean and the general storekeeper turned slightly pale  just what i say if you wont let me see the bill ill have to go further for my information  oh of course i aint scared to show you this bill ralph returned uriah hurriedly say he burst out excitedly its a good bill aint it  it ought to be if its the one i think it is replied the young bridge tender  going to his desk in the rear of the store uriah brought out a tin box and unlocked it from a long flat wallet he drew several bills  theres the bill percy paget gave to will he said as he handed over the banknote  there was but a single oillamp left burning in the store and to this ralph walked and examined the bill there was his banknote true enough with the grease spot from the sandwich in one corner  well what do you make out questioned uriah with breathless interest  i make out that this bill belongs to me returned ralph boldly  to you exclaimed both father and son in one voice  yes sir to me  but percy gave me this bill said will dicks he didnt steal it from you did he  i havent anything to say about that but its my bill just the same  you cant have the bill snarled uriah snatching it from ralphs hand why i never heard tell of such highhanded proceedings in my life before he went on  you can keep the bill for the present mr dicks  of course i will do you suppose im going to lose twenty dollars  but you must promise me not to give it out until you hear from me again  i dont see what right you have to dictate to me what i should do an what i shouldnt do  i am not dictating the bill is mine and i intend to have it sooner or later  but where do we come in asked will dicks who was cooler than his parent  you will have to look to percy paget to make the loss good  if he has cheated me ill have him locked up cried uriah drawing down his sharp face but you havent proved the bill yours yet  i know that all i am asking is that you keep the bill for the present and not pay it out to any one  well ill do that responded uriah after some meditation  youll hear from me again soon concluded ralph as he walked from the store  well he carries a high hand i must say growled uriah as he put his money and the tin box away again i wonder what the trouble is  i thought it was queer percy had so big a bill commented his son  did you well if you did what did you want to change it for  he bought half a dozen packages of cigarettes  humph hardly any profit in em and the bill likely to get us into trouble william you must be more careful  percy said i could hang up the account if i didnt want to change the bill and you said you didnt want to trust any of the young fellows  no more i dont but i aint goin to lose twenty dollars ill make that nelson boy prove its his or he shant tech it no sir  and with a thump of his hard and skinny fist on the counter uriah dicks resumed the labor of closing up his establishment for the night  nelson looked as if he had it in for percy soliloquized will dicks as he brought in the few boxes and barrels that remained outside i would like to know what is in the wind  his father also wished to know it was not long before they were enlightened     chapter vii  percys home   for a few minutes ralph stood outside of the general store undecided what was best to do next  it was true that the bill in uriah dicks possession was his own yet how could he prove it and thus get it once more into his possession  ill call on percy paget and see what he has to say he thought perhaps i can make him confess how he obtained the bill and make the amount good to mr dicks  with this object in view the young bridge tender hurried through the village toward the hill upon which the few handsome residences of the place were situated  in the most prominent spot was located the mansion of squire paget a queen anne structure surrounded by a garden full of fancy shrubs and plants which during her life had been mrs pagets pride  passing through the gate ralph walked up the gravel path to the front piazza and rang the bell  he had to wait a short time then a slow step was heard through the hallway and the door was opened by mrs hanson the squires housekeeper  goodevening said ralph politely is percy at home  i dont really know returned mrs hanson come in and i will find out  she ushered ralph into the hallway and motioned him to a seat then she passed upstairs  i guess it will be all right squire ralph heard a voice say in a nearby side roomthe library and you are perfectly safe in making the deal  i trust so pickley came the reply in squire pagets wellknown sharp tones its worth the trouble you know  of course i get pay for my trouble went on pickley as he stepped to the doorway  ill pay what i promised returned the squire and then both men stepped into the hallway  they started back on seeing ralph as though they had imagined no one was around the young bridge tender made up his mind they had not noted his ring  whyahwhat brings you here nelson demanded the squire as soon as he could recover  i called to see percy sir  i believe percy is out  ralphs hope fell at this announcement  can you tell me where i can find him sir he asked  he is somewhere about the village i presume he said he would be back by nine oclock or halfpast  ralph glanced at the tall clock which stood at the end of the hall and saw that it lacked but ten minutes of nine percy might be in in a few minutes  if you please i will wait for him he said politely  very well  squire paget moved toward the door and opened it for dan pickley his visitor  goodnight pickley he said  goodnight squire was the reply and then pickley moved down the steps  the squire watched him go out of the gate and then closed the front door once more  how long have you been waiting he asked rather abruptly  only a minute or two sir  no longer than that and the squire bent his searching eyes full upon ralphs honest features  no sir mrs hanson just let me in  squire paget seemed relieved to hear this his conversation with dan pickley had been both important and private and he was afraid ralph might have overheard more than he wished to become public  so you wish to see percy he went on after a short pause is there anything special  yes sir  what is it  excuse me but i would like to speak to percy first  the squire drew up his lower lip and looked plainly annoyed  i do not allow my son to have any secrets from me so you might as well speak out nelson he observed abruptly  i came to see percy about a twentydollar bill which belonged to me and which he obtained returned ralph boldly  a twentydollar bill of yours percy obtained why nelson what do you mean come into the library  i mean what i say squire paget said the young bridge tender following the great man of the village into the apartment mentioned percy had a twentydollar bill belonging to me and he passed it off on mr dicks the storekeeper  but he could not have known it was your bill if he spent it  he ought to have known it was mine sir  give me the particulars of this matter was squire pagets short response  in as few words as possible the young bridge tender told of the row on the bridge and of what had followed while he was speaking the squire grew excited and paced up and down nervously he could hardly wait for ralph to finish  see here nelson this is preposterous absurd my son is above such a thing he cried  so i hoped sir but i have only stated the plain facts  it is a tissue of falsehoods young man wait till i hear percys side of the story the idea my son has enough spending money without resorting toto such unlawful means of obtaining more  well it is my twentydollar bill that he gave to mr dicks said ralph doggedly  where did you obtain the bill  a gentleman gave it to me for assisting him out of the water after his sloop had been wrecked against the stonework of the bridge  that is a likely story as if twentydollar bills were flying around so thickly  i am telling the truth sir  who is the gentleman  he is from new york and is up here on a vacation  i can hardly believe he gave you so much money  he did and i can prove it  well be that as it may i am certain percy did not take your bill  did you give him a twentydollar bill  i give him all the spending money he needs returned squire paget evasively he has probably saved the amount and had some one change his small money for one big bill  he didnt have it changed into my billthe one mr dicks holds that he got at the bridgehow i dont knowand i am going to have it back  ha do you threaten my son cried squire paget wrathfully  i am going to make him do what is right sir i cant afford to lose twenty dollars and say nothing  instantly squire paget flared up and shook his fist in ralphs face  if you dare to make trouble for my son ill have you discharged as bridge tender he fumed understand that nelson i am not going to have percys fair name ruined  at that moment before ralph could reply a key was heard to turn in the front door and a second later the squires son strode into the house     chapter viii  squire paget makes a move   percy paget had not expected to see ralph and he was very much disconcerted when brought thus unexpectedly face to face with the young bridge tender  whyeryou here he stammered as he flung aside his hat  he has been telling a fine string of falsehoods against you my son put in the squire ere ralph could speak  and what has he been saying demanded the aristocratic bully coolly has he been telling you how i had to polish him off for insulting me  no he tells me that you stole a twentydollar bill from him  percy was about to burst out into violent language that would have astonished even his indulgent parent but suddenly he changed his mind and allowed an injured look to cross his face  i hope father you dont believe any such outrageous story about me he said plaintively  of course i dont returned the squire promptly i know my son will not steal  ralph is mad because i gave him a good thrashing went on the only son  i imagine the boot is on the other foot put in ralph it is percy who got the worst of the encounter  he says you refused to pay the toll went on squire paget  i only refused after he had called me all sorts of names retorted the only son i was going over to eastport but after i had to teach him a lesson i concluded to remain on this side  you are not telling the truth cried ralph indignantly it was you who insulted me and i gave you a good deal less than you deserved in the shape of a whipping for doing it  stop stop stormed the squire i will have no quarrel in my house nelson dont you know it is all wrong to fight on the bridge  i didnt fight i stopped your son when he refused to pay toll that was all  i do not believe it  believe it or not its true but i came here for another purpose than to speak of the quarrel as you know i want percy to make good the twenty dollars which belonged to me  i aint got your twenty dollarsnever had them blustered the aristocratic bully if you say i have ill pitch you out of the house  gently percy  i dont care father it makes me mad to have this upstart speak to me in this fashion  i know it does but control yourself my son we will find a way to punish him at another time  cant you have him discharged he aint fit to be the tender of the bridge hes so insulting  perhaps returned the squire a sudden idea flashing across his mind  it would assist his schemes wonderfully to have ralph nelson discharged  you had my twentydollar bill and you paid it over to mr dicks said ralph you cant deny it  at these words percy staggered back for the unexpected shot had struck home  whowho says i paid the bill over to mr dicks  will dicks himself you bought cigarettes and gave him the bill to change  i gave him a twentydollar bill but it wasnt yours  it was and i can prove it  how  by a grease spot in one corner made by the butter on a sandwich i had  is that all sneered percy  i think thats enough  well hardly i guess there are a good many bills with grease spots on them floating around  for the moment ralph was nonplussed the aristocratic bully saw it and went on  you are afraid you are going to lose your place and you want to get me and my father in your power so we can help you keep it but it wont work will it father  hardly my son we are not to be browbeaten in this style remarked squire paget pompously  then you do not intend to make good the amount asked ralph shortly disgusted at the way in which the squire stood up for percy  i shall not give you twenty dollars when i dont owe it to you said percy  will you tell me where you got that twentydollar bill  i got it in chambersburgh last week a man asked me to change it for him and i did so  percy had thought out this falsehood before and now he uttered it with the greatest of ease  i believe my son speaks the truth added squire paget you had better be going and hunt for your money elsewhere  i dont believe he ever had twenty dollars excepting he saved it out of the toll money sneered percy and he walked from the room  burning with indignation but unable to help himself toward obtaining his rights ralph arose and without another word left the squires mansion it was too late to attempt to do more that night and after some hesitation he went home  squire paget watched him leave the garden and then locked the front door and went back to the library  ralph nelson is getting too important in his own estimation he mused i thought he was a mere youngster who could be twisted around ones finger but i was mistaken i must get him out of his situation and compel him to leave westville if possible i cant do much while he is around here  squire paget sat for half an hour in his easy chair thinking over his plans then he went to bed  after breakfast he started out to pay a visit to benjamin hooker the village postmaster hooker dicks and the squire were close friends and they constituted a majority of the village board which controlled the bridge and other local matters  well squire what brings you around this morning so early questioned the postmaster for it was an hour before regular mail time  i come to see you about committee matters returned squire paget i have got to report against ralph nelson our bridge tender  whats he been adoing squire  he insulted and assaulted my only son yesterday in a most outrageous fashion without provocation  you dont say so exclaimed the postmaster i thought nelson was quite a gentlemanly boy  i never did benjamin never he is nothing but a young tough  its too bad  he isnt fit to have on the bridge any longer and i move we give him a weeks notice went on the squire we dont want passengers on the bridge insulted on their way over  thats so squire but what caused the row  nothing at all excepting that nelson has taken a dislike to my son and he is such a wicked boy too benjamin why when he heard that my son was going to proceed against him what do you suppose he did  what did he do questioned the postmaster eagerly  actually accused my son of stealing twenty dollars from him  gracious  isnt that enough to provoke a saint benjamin do you wonder i wish to take him in hand  not at all squire not at all  and you will vote to remove him wont you  certainlyif you wish it replied benjamin hooker who was under obligation to the squire for money loaned but we cant remove him without another vote in the board  i know that come with me to uriah dicks and ill tell him about the matter uriah will stand by us i know in a case like this  as there would be nothing to do in the office for at least half an hour the postmaster readily consented to accompany the squire leaving the place in charge of the clerk  five minutes later the two stepped into uriah dicks general store they found the old man talking earnestly to ralph and a stranger who was none other than horace kelsey     chapter ix  at the general store   both squire paget and the postmaster were surprised to see ralph in conversation with uriah dicks and the young gentleman who was a stranger to them  the squire had expected to hold a quiet talk with the keeper of the general store and he was much disappointed to learn that this was to be denied to him  however he put on a bold front and approached uriah without hesitation just as the latter looked up  why here is squire paget now exclaimed uriah dicks squire you are just the man i want to see  i can say the same for you returned the squire with a sharp glance at ralph  i got a twentydollar bill from your son yesterday and it looks like it was going to make trouble for me went on the storekeeper  it has already made enough trouble for me retorted the squire pointedly  squire paget this is mr kelsey the gentleman that gave me the twentydollar bill put in ralph  humph he might have given you a twentydollar bill but this is not the one growled the squire  i believe it is sir said horace kelsey  you do  yes sir it is as you see a new one issued by the first national bank of chambersburgh that is the bank at which i drew it  its all rot roared the squire my son percy received that bill and in chambersburgh too he added suddenly he said so last night  again ralphs hopes fell he had felt almost certain that his city friend would be able to prove the property but now this supposed proof amounted to little or nothing  but that grease spot he began  a story invented by yourself interrupted squire paget it is more than likely that the grease spot was on the bill when my son received it  did your son receive the bill at the bank questioned horace kelsey  i dont knowi suppose he did stammered the squire  there was an awkward pause uriah dicks drummed uneasily upon the counter where lay the bill in dispute  one thing is certain said uriah i took the bill in good faith and i aint agoin to lose on it mind that  you shant lose on it uriah replied the squire my son gave it to you and it was his bill you keep it and ill take young nelson in hand he has concocted this story for a purpose  a purpose eh queried the storekeeper  exactly he knows that he is in danger of losing his situation and it is his endeavor to get me and my son in his power so we will influence others to help him keep him in his place  i dont see what i have done to lose the job on the bridge said ralph his cheeks growing red  i thought he was doin well enough put in uriah  he is a regular rough burst out the squire with a fine appearance of wrath he insulted my son on the bridge and knocked him down and he insults every one he dares  that is a gross untruth squire paget burst out ralph i insult nobody  hes a very impulsive youth put in postmaster hooker thinking it time to bolster up the squires remarks he is i am afraid too hotheaded to have on the bridge not to say anything about this attempt toahemcast an unworthy reflection on the fair name of our squires son  and the postmaster looked as important as possible as he spoke  uriah dicks caught the drift of the talk and looked perplexed not knowing exactly upon which side to cast his opinion  but he soon made up his mind ralph was a poor boy with little or no influence while the squire was rich and powerful  i dont know but what you are right gentlemen he said he certainly talked putty sharplike about percy last night  i shall make him suffer for that never fear said the squire pointedly he shall not insult my son with impunity  ralph was about to speak but horace kelsey checked him  it will do you no good to talk he said in a low tone they are against you and we can prove nothing better drop the matter at least until something more in your favor turns up  but i am certain the bill is mine  so am i but it is one thing to know it and quite another to prove it  hadnt you ought to be on the bridge now asked uriah sourly  bob sanderson is tending for me  who give him that right asked squire paget  certainly not the town committee  mr foley said i might have him help me during slack hours returned the young bridge tender mentioning the name of another of the committeemen  he aint got no power put in uriah it wasnt never put to a vote  i must have some help  a young man that was really willing to work wouldnt need no help grumbled the miserly storekeeper it is only on account of laziness you need help  thats so added the postmaster willing to pile it on when there was such a good chance better get back to work at once  i will replied ralph and not wishing to lose his job on the spot he left the store followed by horace kelsey  its a shame the way they treat you burst out the young man as the two walked toward the bridge i dont really see how they can do it  i suppose they will discharge me now returned ralph bitterly and all because i claim a bill that i am positive is my own  if they discharge you i would make that percy paget prove where he got the bill if he cannot prove it that will be one point in your favor  the two walked down to the bridge and here the young man from the city left ralph and went off with bob sanderson to see how the repairs to the sloop were coming on  ralph was in no happy frame of mind when left alone he had tried only to assert his rights but the future looked black in consequence  presently his mother came down from the cottage to talk matters over with him she knew her son had gone off with horace kelsey to uriah dicks store  the squire is certainly very unreasonable she said after ralph had told his story every one around westville knows that percy is arrogant to the last degree  that is so mother but to the squire percy is perfection i do not see how he can be so blind  if you lose your position on the bridge ralph what in the world will we do times are so hard in westville  ill have to look for work in eastport or chambersburgh i suppose returned the son but i havent lost the job yet he added as cheerfully as he could  but if uriah dicks and the postmaster and the squire are against you they can put you out there are only five in the committee and three are a majority  ralph was about to reply but several passengers had to be waited on and he went on to collect the tolls then a whistle sounded from up big silver lake notifying him that a steamboat wished to pass through the draw and the opening and closing of the bridge took ten minutes or more  if i were only bookkeeper enough to strike a job in one of the factories i wouldnt care whether i lost the place here or not said ralph when he was again at leisure this is a lazy sort of a job and i would much prefer office work  that is true my son but one must be thankful to get work of any kind now returned mrs nelson  oh i know that and i am not grumbling mother but thewhats that  ralph broke off suddenly a crash of glass coming from the neighborhood of the cottage sounded in their ears the first crash was followed by halfadozen others in rapid succession  what in the world can that mean cried mrs nelson and without waiting she ran from the bridge  ralph looked up and down to see if any one was coming across and sighting none followed  on a run it did not take long to reach the little home by the side path as they neared it ralph pointed excitedly to the sittingroom windows  look mother he cried in deep indignation some vandal has broken nearly every pane of glass in the house  perhaps there are thieves around returned mrs nelson quickly  no they wouldnt break glass needlessly this was done out of pure meanness  they hurried around to the door and into the cottage alas a single glance around was enough fully half the panes of glass in the cottage were smashed and on the floors of the various rooms lay a dozen stones as big as a mans hand  i know who did this ejaculated ralph in high anger percy paget and no one else  would he dare faltered mrs nelson  yes and it is just in line with his sneaklike character i am going to see if i can find him  ralph dashed out of the cottage as rapidly as he had entered it he made a strict search about the grounds up the road and in the wood on the other side but it was of no avail the person who had committed the contemptible act had disappeared     chapter x  ralph is given notice   had it not been for his duties on the bridge ralph would have continued his search still farther but already several persons had passed over and dropped their pennies on the counter of the little office and now a horn was blowing from the deck of the little schooner sailing up silver lake  so telling his mother that he would be back as soon as possible he hurried to the bridge halfadozen boats wished to go through the draw including a string of canal boats and it was nearly noon before he could leave the spot  then bob sanderson came around the cove in the sloop magic beside him sat horace kelsey the repairs to the magic were now completed and the little craft was practically as good as new  hallo bob come up here and tend for me will you shouted ralph as soon as he caught sight of the old man  all right ralph whats up  i must go home returned the young bridge tender and when the sloop was tied up near by he told the two occupants of what had occurred  i never heard the like burst out bob sanderson if it was really that paget boy he ought to have a whip across his back  horace kelsey accompanied ralph to the cottage to see the extent of the damage done the young man from new york was also of the opinion that the guilty party ought to be brought to swift justice  but no one saw percy and we cannot prove anything said mrs nelson  perhaps we can said ralph im going to hunt him up if that is possible  horace kelsey did not feel able to remain longer at westville and so he left when ralph did before he went however he insisted on presenting ralph with another twentydollar bill to replace the one lost  here is my card he said on leaving if you ever come to new york drop in and see me  thank you i shall be very much pleased to replied ralph  he noted that horace kelsey was in the insurance business with an office on broadway and then he placed the address carefully away in a drawer of the oldfashioned desk in the sittingroom  who knows but if i am discharged here i may some day go to new york thought the young bridge tender  after taking another look about the cottage and through the wood ralph started up the road leading to the center of the village presently he came across a young man named edgar steiner who was one of percy pagets intimate friends  steiner do you know where percy paget is he asked  percy has gone to silver cove returned steiner  when did he go  went early this morning he drove down to see about a dog he is going to buy from a sport who lives there  silver cove was several miles below westville and the road to the place would not have brought the aristocratic bully near the cottage by the bridge  you are sure he went  yes i saw him drive off he wanted me to go along but i couldnt very well do you wish to see him  yes  i understand you and he had some trouble yesterday  we did have some trouble yesterday but i want to see him about something else now  steiner stared at ralph then thinking he had spent enough time on such a poor lad as the bridge tender he turned away and walked off whistling a merry concerthall air  ralph stood still undecided what to do next if percy had really gone to silver cove somebody else must be guilty of breaking the cottage windows but who ralph could not remember of having any other enemy  while the boy was deliberating he saw three men coming toward him they were the squire the postmaster and uriah dicks  why aint you at the bridge asked uriah sourly  we have had trouble at the cottage sir replied ralph some vandal has broken nearly all of our windows  its a wonder you do not blame it on my son percy sneered the squire  i do blame it on him retorted ralph he is the only enemy who would do such a thing  more of the scheme to get my son into trouble you see how it is gentlemen he is a thorough young rascal exclaimed the squire  its awful murmured postmaster hooker its a good thing we intend to act on this matter squire  yes we cant let it rest another minute returned squire paget  and on the three men passed leaving ralph more bitter in heart than ever  the young bridge tender returned to work sending bob sanderson to the cottage with instructions to buy what glass was needed and put it in taking the money out of the twentydollar bill horace kelsey had given him that morning  the afternoon slipped by quietly and at sundown sanderson came back to relieve ralph as usual  the glass is all in and here is the change said he and handed over sixteen dollars and a half had to pay three dollars and a half for glass tacks and putty  but your pay mr sanderson  thats all right ralph i wont ask none on this job exceptin you catch the chap as did it and make him pony up as the sayin goes  you are very kind i doubt if i am able to do anything in the matter returned ralph hopelessly  he had hardly reached home when a knock was heard on the cottage door they opened it to admit squire pagets hired man  a letter for ralph nelson the man said and handed it over i dont think there is any answer he added and bowed his way out  it must be from the squire cried mrs nelson perhaps he has relented of his harsh treatment  not he exclaimed ralph it isnt in him  the boy broke the seal of the letter and drew out the document which read as follows   mrs randolph nelsonowing to circumstances of which you are as well aware as ourselves we shall not require your services or those of your son as bridge tender for westville after the week ending july 19                             the westville township committee                             per hon thomas paget chairman   what is it ralph asked his mother anxiously  just as i thought mother my services as bridge tender will not be required after this week returned ralph bitterly  let me see the letter mrs nelson took and read the epistle it is too bad  its an outrage mother thats what it is and all on account of that aristocratic sneak percy paget  do not call harsh names ralph  i cant help it mother he is a sneak and worse he brought on the row took that money and i am certain he broke our windows into the bargain  mrs nelson did not reply she thought in silence for a moment and the look of anxiety on her face deepened  what shall we do when you are out of work ralph  i must try to obtain another job mother  but if you are not successful  let us not anticipate mother i am sure to strike something in the meantime we will have a little money to fall back onthe balance of that twentydollar bill for instance  yes and we will have the other money we have saved added mrs nelson but i would not like to touch that if it could be helped  we wont touch it ill find work before my weeks wages and the sixteen dollars and a half are gone the one pity is well feel too poor just now to advertise for those missing papers and offer any reward for their return  that is so and mrs nelson gave a long sigh  perhaps she saw the many disappointments in store for her son when he should seek employment elsewhere     chapter xi  the runaway   by the next morning ralph felt better he was able to take the matter of his discharge philosophically and he was even hopeful that the next week would see him in a better situation than he now occupied  he went at his duties with a willing spirit resolved that there should be no cause for complaint during his last days on the bridge only one thing made him feel bad and that was that he could not prove that percy and not himself had been to blame for the row  but ralph soon learned that many of the village folks who used the bridge daily sided with him some of these were very outspoken in their opinion of the committees actions  under the squires thumb all of em said bart haycock the village blacksmith we ought to have a new committee and maybe we will have at the coming election  but all this talk did not help ralph he had received notice and in three days his duties on the bridge would come to an end and the change would also hurt bob sanderson who would now have either to pay for his board or go elsewhere  who is to take your place asked sanderson when he came to relieve ralph in the evening  i dont know mr sanderson returned the young bridge tender but i hope whoever it is he keeps you as helper  well that depends returned the old man i wouldnt care to work for everybody say dan pickley for instance  do you think dan pickley is after the job questioned ralph quickly  he was after it before and he aint doing much now  i imagine squire paget will give him the position if he wishes it mused ralph he and the squire are quite thick  thats because dan is willing to do any work the squire wishes done responded bob sanderson that fellow will do anything for pay  that evening ralph and his mother had a talk in which it was decided that old bob sanderson should be allowed to remain at the cottage at the nominal amount of a dollar per week for board until he managed to obtain another situation or until jobs in his line became more numerous  when sanderson was told of this he was very grateful as he had no other boardingplace in view he gladly accepted the offer and promised that the widow and her son should lose nothing by their kindness  on the following morning ralph was collecting toll when a man approached the bridge and began to watch proceedings the man was dan pickley  what brings you pickley asked ralph after the latter had been watching him for some time  came down to get the run of things returned pickley  then you are to have the job after i leave  reckon i am the squire said as much  the squire and you are rather thick remarked the young bridge tender coolly  oh i dont know returned the man uneasily he knows a good hand to hire when he wants him  it was you who were at the squires house when i called a few nights ago  yes i had an errand for him  as he uttered the last words dan pickley looked at ralph closely he was wondering if the boy had overheard much of the conversation which had passed between squire paget and himself that night in the library  pickley sat down on the end of the bridge and began to count the folks as they passed over ralph saw that he was keeping track of the toll but said nothing  let me help you turn the bridge said pickley when a horn sounded for the draw to be opened  no thank you i can do it alone replied ralph  dont you want me to take hold  it is not needed you will get enough of the work after i leave  you dont want to be a bit sociable growled pickley and he turned away but still kept on counting the passengers as they crossed  i suppose he wants to make sure that i am not going to cheat the bridge board out of its cash mused ralph somewhat bitterly no doubt squire paget fancies that now i have my walkingpapers i will steal every penny i can  during his odd moments ralph threw several fishinglines over and the catching of a mess of fish served to occupy his thoughts to a considerable extent  pickley watched him fish for a while but did not offer to resume the conversation but he kept a close tally of every cent taken in as toll  at noon bob sanderson brought over ralphs lunch  well im lucky anyway he said ive got a job at building hotbed frames for mr ford that will give me steady work for nigh onto three weeks at good pay  i am glad to hear it replied ralph with a smile three weeks is a long time and something is sure to turn up in the meantime  im glad you have a job too put in pickley for i am going to have andy wilson help me  then youve got the job said sanderson  yes i go on as soon as ralph quits  while the young bridge tender was eating his lunch a steamboat whistle sounded and he had to leave it to open the draw the steamboat passed through and then he noticed another boat coming down the lake although some distance off  as there were just then no passengers wishing passage over the bridge ralph decided to leave the draw open for a few minutes until the boat had time to go through  he sat down to finish his lunch he had just raised a bit of homemade berry pie to his mouth when a clatter on the westville turnpike startled him  my gracious a runaway cried old bob sanderson  ralph leaped to his feet and saw that his old helper was right there tearing along the road that led from the village center was an elegant team of black horses attached to a large open carriage  its mrs carringtons team cried pickley and blame me if the old lady and her daughter aint in the carriage  the team is coming this way put in bob sanderson i wonder if we cant stop them  not much roared pickley get out of the way or youll be knocked down and killed  sanderson was too old a man to attempt to subdue the fiery steeds and he quickly followed pickley out of harms way  in the meantime ralph stood undecided as to what to do should he run forward and try to bring the horses to a standstill before the bridge was reached  it wont do he muttered halfaloud i might miss them and then  he thought no further but with a bound sprang to the capstan bar and with might and main strove to swing the heavy bridge around into place thus closing the draw  it was hard work and the sweat poured from his face and down his chin but he kept at it noting at each turn how close the steeds and the elegant turnout were drawing  at last with a shock and a quiver the drawbridge reached its resting piers as it did so ralph gave the bar and capstan a jerk from the hole in which it worked he threw it aside just as the front hoofs of the runaways struck the long planking at the end of the bridge  illustration coming on at breakneck speed see page 72  help help came in a female voice from the carriage and the young bridge tender saw that both mrs carrington and her daughter were preparing to leap out  dont jump he screamed and then made a dash for the horses heads  the fact that they had struck the bridge caused the team to slacken their pace a bit taking advantage of this ralph caught them by both bridles they lifted him off his feet but he clung fast and by the time the eastport side was reached the team was conquered  hold them hold them please cried mrs carrington who by the way was one of the richest residents of westville i will get out  they are all right now returned ralph but i will hold them if you wish  and he did so while the lady and her daughter alighted  oh how thankful i am to you said the lady  and i too added her daughter with a grateful glance that caused ralph to blush oh mamma she went on i wonder what became of mr paget  its hard to tell returned mrs carrington coldly  mr paget cried ralph do you mean percy paget  yes replied julia carrington  was he with you  he was answered mrs carrington but at the first signs of danger he sprang out of the carriage and left us to our fate     chapter xii  ralphs reward   ralph was much surprised to learn that percy paget had been in the carriage  was he hurt when he sprang out he asked of mrs carrington  i am sure i do not know returned the lady  i dont think so put in her daughter a beautiful miss of sixteen he landed in the middle of a blackberry bush when he sprang from the front seat  then he was driving  yes and it was his fault that the team ran away returned mrs carrington i told him that they were very spirited but in order to make them do their best as he thought he used the whip upon them  such a team as that dont need the whip much put in old bob sanderson who had come up during the conversation followed by dan pickley theyre too highminded  that is just it said the lady  it was gritty of ralph to shut the bridge and stop em for you went on the old man  indeed it was cried julia carrington i shall never forget your bravery she went on to ralph you have done what many a man would be afraid to undertake  so he has put in her mother you are ralph nelson the bridge tender i believe  yes maam  i used to know your father fairly well you have taken his place since he died  yes maamup to the end of this week then mr pickley takes it and ralph pointed to the fellow he had mentioned  and what are you going to do  i dont know yet i am going to look for work somewhere  i trust you find something suitable  ill take anything that pays fair wages  and how is it you are going to leave here went on the lady curiously  i got into a row with percy paget and his father is chairman of the village board and he sided with his son  i see mrs carrington bit her lip well we must be going julia she said to her daughter i shall not forget you for your bravery ralph nelson  thank you maam i only did what was my duty  it is more than that i shall not forget you remember  the lady reentered her carriage and ralph assisted the daughter to a seat beside her  in a moment more they continued on their way leaving ralph sanderson and pickley to gaze after them  my but theyre swell was pickleys comment i wish i was in your shoes ralph  she wont forget you thats certain said sanderson shell reward you handsomelike see if she dont ralph  they dont seem to care much about percy pagets condition returned the boy by way of changing the subject  well who wouldunder the circumstances exclaimed the old man in deep disgust  perhaps they dont give him the credit he deserves said pickley thinking he must say something in favor of the squires son  ralph and sanderson had their own opinion of percy and they did not care to argue with pickley on the subject the young bridge tender went back to his work and sanderson shuffled off to go at an odd job of boatmending pickley sat down to count the tolls as before  three minutes later percy paget came into sight his hands and face were scratched and his clothing torn  see anything of a runaway he cried as he came up to pickley  yes the team was stopped right here replied the man  who stopped em  ralph nelson  you dont mean it gasped the young aristocrat  yes i do  was he hurt  not a bit  i dont see how he could do it grumbled percy that team was going like mad  so it was ralph not only stopped the team but before that he worked like lightning to close the draw so that they wouldnt go overboard  humph mused percy he must have done it in hopes of a reward most likely he knew who was in the carriage  he did  what did mrs carrington give him  nothing but she said she would not forget him  shell send him five dollars or something like that i guess did sheshe say anything about me went on percy hesitatingly  she said you leaped from the carriage as soon as the team started  that isnt so replied the aristocratic bully glibly i didnt jump at all  you didnt  no i was pitched out i stood up to get a better hold on the reins and just then the carriage lurched and out i went  oh well then thats different replied dan pickley who did not think it to his advantage to question the veracity of percys explanation mrs carrington seemed to think you had jumped out because you were scared  and did her daughter seem to think so too asked percy his anxiety increasing  i dont know but what she did you had better hunt them up and explain matters  i will i suppose the reason they didnt come back for me is because they were in a hurry to get to eastport and see mr carrington before he went off to chambersburgh  they didnt say what they were in a hurry about returned dan pickley  percy saw that ralph was now approaching and not wishing for various reasons to encounter the young bridge tender while in such a woebegone condition he turned on his heel and walked back toward westville  ralph could not help but laugh at the discomfiture of the young bully he had overheard a good part of the conversation and he was satisfied that percy was for once at least more than taken down  on the other hand percy was greatly chagrined to learn that ralph had played the part of the hero his face drew dark and his eyes flashed their bitter hatred  its too bad that low upstart to stop the team he muttered to himself i wonder if julia carrington spoke to him most likely she did and now hell look at her as a special friend its a great shame ill have to teach him his place if he tries to get too intimate with her  all of which went to prove that percys hopes in the direction of julia were more than of the ordinary kind  percy would have been more bitter than ever could he have witnessed the scene in the nelson cottage that evening shortly after eight oclock  five minutes before that time ralph was sitting in the kitchen telling his mother of the stirring event of the day to which the fond parent listened with keen interest  the son had just finished when there came a timid knock at the front door  somebodys knocking ralph said mrs nelson go and light the sittingroom lamp and see who it is  ralph lit the lamp and then opened the door before him stood mrs carrington and her daughter  goodevening ralph you did not expect to see me quite so soon i imagine said mrs carrington with a smile as she stepped in  well no stammered the youth wont you have a chair and he pushed a seat forward for the lady and another for her daughter  thank you yes returned mrs carrington is this mrs nelson she went on as ralphs mother appeared  yes madam said the widow pray make yourself comfortable perhaps you would prefer a rocker  no we wont stay but a minute has ralph told you of his bravery this noon  he said he stopped your runaway team  he did nobly and my daughter and i have come to offer him a slight reward for his gallant deed  i was not looking for a reward put in ralph  but you deserve one ralph and i trust you will accept what we have brought julia  yes mamma here it is and from beneath her dress folds julia carrington produced a small moroccocovered box allow me to present this ralph nelson with the compliments of my mother and myself she said turning to the young bridge tender  she held out the box  thank you but ii really didnt expect anything stammered ralph as he took the offering  open it and let us see the kind gift mrs carrington and her daughter have made said his mother  there was a catch on one side of the small box ralph pressed upon this and up flew the lid revealing to his astonished and pleased gaze a small but neatly engraved gold watch with chain and charm attached  a gold watch cried ralph  and chain and all added mrs nelson  really ii cant accept this and ralph blushed furiously ii  oh yes you can laughed julia carrington it is not as much as we think you ought to have but  it is more miss carrington  do you like it ralph questioned the older lady  very much indeed i have always wanted a good watch i have been using fathers old one but that is about worn out and cant be made to run with much regularity     chapter xiii  on big silver lake   the carringtons remained at the nelson cottage much longer than they originally intended it was ten oclock when ralph lit the way to where their carriage was standing in charge of a colored coachman during the visit the rich folks asked mrs nelson and ralph much about themselves julia carrington proved herself a very nice young lady and when she went away ralph and his new acquaintances were warm friends  they are not stuck up a bit mother said the young bridge tender as he returned to the cottage after seeing them off  no they are very kindhearted as well as rich returned mrs nelson would westville had more of such  what a difference between such folks and the pagets and the steiners why mrs steiner and her daughter maud wouldnt look at us if they stumbled over us on the street and neither would mrs paget when she was alive  well we must remember that we do not belong to fashionable society ralph we belong to the poorer classes  so we do but that doesnt make it right for some folks to look at us as if we were the dust under their feet i shall not forget the carringtons kind ways nor the beautiful present they made me and ralph fell to examining the gold watch and chain anew  it was truly a valuable gift and the boy was more than delighted he resolved to wear it only when he needed a timepiece or when he was dressed up it was too good to have about his old clothes constantly  ralphs remaining time as bridge tender went swiftly by and on the day set by the committee he was paid off by squire paget and dan pickley was duly installed in his place  what are you going to do now asked the squire as he handed over ralphs salary  i dont know yet returned the boy  guess youll find it rather hard to find work around westville  i dont know i havent had any chance of looking around  well im sorry for you went on squire paget hypocritically i dont like to see any one out of work  really it was yourself got me out of the job retorted ralph  no it wasnt nelson it was your own hasty temper if you hadnt attacked percybut let that pass  percy was in the wrongi shall always say so interrupted ralph  there you go snarled the squire i was going to offer you a situation on one of my canal boats but i shant do it now you dont deserve it  i do not want any situation from you replied the boy with a sudden show of spirit i would rather find my own employment  going to be pigheaded eh  you can call it what you please you did not treat me fairly and i guess i can get along without your aid  and without another word ralph pocketed his pay and walked off  a regular young tartar mused the squire as he gazed after him he wont be easy to manage thats certain too bad i couldnt get him on the canal boat i must find some way of getting him out of westvilleand his mother too i cant do much while they are around  ralph had been paid off at the squires office in the village and now he made his way to uriah dicks store to settle up the family account  how much do we owe you mr dicks he asked as he walked up to uriah who was poring over a very dirty ledger  oh so its you ralph exclaimed the storekeeper been up to the squires yet  yes  did you get your pay  yes  and now you want to settle up  yes replied ralph for a third time  i hope you aint agoin to quit tradin with me cried uriah in some alarm  we are mr dicks what can you expect after the way you have treated me  ii couldnt help votin in the committee with the squire and ben hooker returned the storekeeper lamely they said it was a clear case against you  and therefore you wouldnt give me a chance to clear myself said ralph bitterly how much is the bill  three dollars and nineteen cents ill call it three dollars if youll keep on buying here went on uriah desperately  it made his heart fairly ache to see trade going to one of the rival stores  i prefer to settle in full rejoined the boy coolly take the three dollars and nineteen cents out of this fivedollar bill  with an inward groan uriah took out the amount handed back the change and crossed the account from the book  got anything to do he asked a sudden idea flashing through his head  not yet  i might take you on herei need a boy  and what would you pay questioned ralph although he knew about what to expect from the miserly man he was addressing  well id be willin to pay a big boy like you two dollars and a half a week i wouldnt pay a small boy so much  thank you but i wouldnt work for that even if i cared to work for you mr dicks two dollars and a half wouldnt run our house  i would let you have your groceries at cost said uriah as an extra inducement  the truth was many of his customers had upbraided him for aiding in the discharge of ralph as bridge tender and he wished to set himself right with these folks  i do not care to work for you sir i think i can get work i will like better and which will pay more elsewhere  the storekeepers face fell and he closed the dirty ledger with a slam  all right ralph suit yourself but if you starve to death dont lay it at my door mind that  no fear of my starving returned the boy lightly and he left the store  uriah watched him from behind the dirty windows of his place he heaved a big sigh as he saw ralph enter the opposition store just across the way and groaned aloud when the youth came out with halfadozen packages under his arm and started for home  i guess i put my foot into it when i sided with the squire he meditated but it had to be done anyway the squires trade is bigger than the nelsons so im better off than i might be and thus consoling himself he went back to his accounts  to uriah dicks all such matters were questions of dollars and cents not of justice  when ralph arrived home he told his mother of the storekeepers offer  do you think i did wrong in refusing he asked  no ralph i would have done the same  i fancy i can strike a job that will pay betteranyway i am going to try  sunday of the week passed quietly enough and on monday morning ralph brushed up his everyday clothes took along the lunch his mother put up for him and left the cottage to try his luck among the stores and factories in eastport  dont be alarmed if i am not home until night mother he said i may strike a situation in which they wish me at once  all right ralph she returned good luck to you  but ralph did not get to eastport that day as he was crossing the bridge a young man on a small sailboat hailed him it was roy parkhurst a fellow ralph knew well  hallo ralph he called out the job on the bridge and you have parted company i am told  yes roy  doing anything today  no i was just bound for eastport to look for work  then you are just the fellow i am looking for said parkhurst  what for  i want to sail down to martinton and have this boat taken back here if youll undertake the job ill give you a dollar  ill go you returned ralph promptly i can put off looking for another situation until tomorrow  then jump in  parkhurst ran his boat close to the bridge and ralph sprang down on one of the seats soon the two were moving down silver lake at all the speed the little craft commanded  it was a splendid day with a stiff breeze blowing and by noon martinton was reached then giving ralph directions as to where the boat was to be left in westville roy parkhurst quit the boat and having eaten the lunch the boy started on the return never dreaming of the excitement in store for him     chapter xiv  a stormy time   like his father before him ralph had always liked the water he was perfectly familiar with the handling of all manner of small craft and had it paid would have liked nothing better than to follow a life on the lakes  but situations on the water which brought in a fair remuneration were scarce in the vicinity of westville and so the boy did not attempt a search for employment in that direction  the halfdays job before him suited him exactly and after leaving martinton he settled back with his hand on the tiller and his eyes on the sails in great satisfaction  i wouldnt mind owning a boat like this he thought as the swift little craft cut along through the water perhaps i might do very well taking out pleasure parties during the summer  inside of half an hour martinton was left far behind then ralph noted that the fair sky was gradually becoming overcast  i wonder if we are going to have a blow he soliloquized it more than half looks like it  about quarter of an hour later the breeze died out utterly this was a bad sign and the boy prudently lowered the jib and took a couple of reefs in the mainsail  presently came a low rumble of thunder from the southeast and the sky grew darker and darker there was no longer any doubt that a severe thunderstorm preceded possibly by a squall was close at hand  unwilling to take any risks in a boat not his own ralph lowered the mainsail entirely hardly had he done so when a fierce wind swept up the lakea wind that presently raised itself almost to a hurricane  the lightning began to flash all around him followed by crash after crash of thunder the water was churned up in great violence and he was compelled to crouch low in the craft lest he be swept overboard and drowned  driven by the wind the boat moved across the lake until ralph grew fearful that she would be driven up on the rocks and made a complete wreck at the risk of losing some canvas he let out the mainsail a bit and steered from the shore  the rain came down by the bucketful and it did not take much to soak him to the skin there was no way of protecting himself he must take it as it came fortunately it was warm so he did not suffer so much as he might otherwise have done  a halfhour passed and ralph was just congratulating himself that the worst was over when a cry came out of the gloom to his left  he strained his eyes in the direction and after a few moments caught sight of an immense hay barge bearing down upon him the hay barge had been towed by a steam tug but the rope had parted and the barge was now drifting at the mercy of the wind and current  there was a man on the hay barge thoroughly frightened and it was he who was crying for assistance  hullo there whats the matter cried ralph as he steered clear of the moving mass for the hay barge was loaded to the waters edge  help me cried the man i am all alone on this barge  where is the tug  i dont know i fancy she struck on a rock for we lost our reckoning and ran too close to shore  i dont see how i can help you returned ralph my boat wont budge that big barge  then take me on board will you returned the man with a shiver i aint used to being out in the wind and rain  yes ill take you in wait till i run up behind  as best he could ralph swung his own craft around and came up under the stern of the hay barge the man ran from the side and lowered himself onto the bow seat  there im all right now he said as he stumbled back to ralphs side what a beastly storm he went on  it is what are you going to do about the barge  i dont care what becomes of her growled the man i was only a passenger on the tug and went on the barge for fun let the captain pick her up as best he can  but you want to find the tug dont you asked ralph in some surprise  not if you will put me ashore where are you bound  westville  that will suit me first rate take me there and ill pay you the passage money instead of the tug captain  ill take you there without pay said ralph  at that moment a steam whistle sounded close at hand and presently they beheld the steam tug with the captain on the forward deck gazing anxiously ahead  there she is cried the man ralph had picked up  well call to the captain and let him know where his hay barge is replied ralph  he accordingly hailed those on the steam tug soon the craft was close beside him  your barge is off in that direction said ralph pointing with his hand  and i am here captain and going to stay here put in ralphs passenger no more hay barges for me  dont you want to come on the tug  no  all right then suit yourself  and the next moment the steam tug shot out of sight in the direction in which the hay barge was drifting  the storm now let up a bit and ralph was able to take a good look at the fellow beside him he was a tall stronglooking chap with sharp black eyes and a heavy head of dark hair he wore a long mustache and there was a slight scar directly in the center of his forehead  whats your name youngster he asked presently as ralph let out the mainsail  ralph told him  mine is dock brady i am a surveyor from utica do you follow this sort of thing for a living  no sir  just out for pleasure eh  hardly that i am returning the boat to westville for a friend  oh i see dock brady mused for a moment westville is quite a place i believe he went on  not so very large sir  larger than silver cove though  oh yestwice as large  quite a few summer boarders eh  back of the village yes there are no folks stopping in the village itself  no but that helps to liven up things of coursebuying stuff and mailing letters  he paused again  yes they have to come there for goods and that makes the stores do very well and the post office is a lively enough place at mail times  always is when there are summer boarders around the man laughed lightly can i help you with the boat he went on changing the subject  you can hold the tiller while i hoist the jib said ralph the storm is over i guess  the jib was unfurled and the mainsail let out full and once again the little craft went bounding on her way  ralph did not take to his passengers appearance and said very little during the remainder of the trip the man also relapsed into silence as if resolving some scheme in his mind  before sundown westville was reached at the bridge the man got off and tossed ralph a silver dollar in a moment more he was out of sight  little did ralph imagine under what exciting circumstances he and dock brady were to meet again     chapter xv  looking for work   mrs nelson was surprised to see ralph come in almost soaked to the skin from the rain  why ralph why didnt you go under shelter she cried  because i couldnt get under he laughed and then he explained that he had been on the lake instead of over to eastport  and ive earned two dollars by the operation he added  i am thankful you escaped injury by the storm she shuddered it must have been fearful out on the water  it was pretty rough i admit he said but it is over now and no harm done  you had better change your clothes before you sit down to eat  i will said ralph and went upstairs for that purpose  when he came down again he found the evening meal on the table and being hungry he ate his full share  mother and son spent a quiet evening at home and retired early in the morning ralph was up before sunrise putting things in order around the house  by eight oclock he was on his way to eastport as he was crossing the bridge dan pickley stopped him  aint you got an extra key to the bridge lock he asked i want one for myself and one for andy wilson who is going to help me  there is but one key returned ralph i always left that in a safe place in the office and whoever was here used it  then you aint got a duplicate  no i tell you  oh all right responded dan pickley and he pursed his lips he was about to say more but suddenly changed his mind  somewhat perplexed by pickleys strange manner the boy continued on his way and a few minutes later found himself in the thriving town for which he had been bound  ralph had no definite place in view but he knew that the best thing to do was to seek employment systematically he resolved to walk to the extreme end of the town and apply at every store and factory that presented itself  then if there is any vacancy at all i am bound to locate it he said to himself  his first visit was paid to a large shoe factory located directly by the lakeside  i am looking for a place he began to the foreman when that individual waved him away and pointed to a sign over the door which the boy had not seen and which read    no more hands wanted  excuse me but i did not see the sign said ralph politely and walked off  after this came another shoe factory at which the boy fared no better indeed he fared worse for the foreman a burly irishman ordered him out very rudely  they dont believe in being very civil thought ralph however one must expect some hard knocks in this world  at a planingmill the boy fell in with a young man whom he knew quite well the young mans name was harry ford and he treated ralph kindly  very sorry ralph but there is no opening he said only last week we discharged two young fellows because we could not keep them going orders are rather slack  then there is nothing at all open  harry ford shook his head  ill ask the boss if hell take you on but i am certain it will do no good  the owner of the mill came in just then and he was appealed to he at once said he could not possibly take on a new hand  if an opening occurs ill keep you in mind said harry ford and with this promise ralph had to be content  after leaving the planingmill the boy came to several stores at the first and second no help of any kind was needed at the third they wanted a boy to distribute circulars  the job will last for a week said the storekeeper for i want the circulars distributed in every place in eastport westville and all the summer boardinghouses and hotels in the neighborhood  and how much are you willing to pay asked ralph  ill give you four dollars for the week if you do the work properly i wont have any circulars wasted  ralph hesitated four dollars was not much but it was better than nothing  i am looking for a steady place he said but if i cant find it ill take the job he said  i want the circulars to go out as soon as possible they advertise my summer sporting goods and the season is now pretty well advanced  will you keep the place open for me until this evening  what is your name  ralph nelson i used to be the bridge tender  oh yes i thought i had seen you before all right nelson ill wait until six oclock to hear from you  thank you mr dunham ill let you know one way or the other by that time said ralph  when the boy left the store he found it was already noon he had a lunch with him and strolling down to the waters edge he sat on a little dock and ate it  he had just about finished when a rowboat came into view there was a single occupant at the oars it was percy paget  hallo there what are you doing here cried the young bully as he ran up to the dock and leaped ashore  taking it easy returned ralph coolly  indeed said percy sarcastically plenty of time for that now i suppose  yes i have more time on my hands than i care to have percy  dont call me percy i am not an intimate of yours ralph nelson  all right just as you please  if you had treated me like a gentleman on the bridge you wouldnt be out of a job now went on the fashionable bully  we wont talk about that returned ralph sharply  and then to see how late it was he drew out his new watch and consulted it  where did you get that watch questioned percy on catching sight of the golden timepiece  it was made a present to me replied ralph and he smiled at the young aristocrats evident wonder  a present to you  yes  when  a couple of days ago  for your faithful work on the bridge i suppose sneered the rich youth  partly for that and partly for something else  who gave it to you  a rich lady and her daughter  you are talking in riddles ralph nelson cried percy more than half angry at ralphs short replies  well then since you are so curious let me tell you that the watch chain and charm were presented to me by miss julia carrington and her mother now are you satisfied  the shot told percy colored to the roots of his reddish hair and drew down the corners of his mouth  do you mean to tell me that julia carrington really gave you that as a present he ejaculated  yes  because you stopped their team for them  yes they were very thankful to me for what they called my bravery  humph anybody could have done as much that team wasnt much to stop  its a pity you didnt stop them then you were in the carriage i understand  i was thrown out or there wouldnt have been any trouble growled percy  they said you sprang out as soon as you imagined there was danger  it isnt so ill bet you asked them for the watchor for some reward went on the young aristocrat maliciously  not by a good deal it is not my style percy paget  humph a low upstart like you  stop right there cried ralph  i wont you are  if you dont stop ill pitch you into the lake  you cant do it ralph nelson you are nothing but a miserable beggar not fit for decent folks to associate with if i had my say  percy got no further with doubledup fists ralph advanced upon him the rich young bully saw his danger and in sudden alarm for his personal safety began to retreat  he did not notice where he was going and his heel struck upon a board which stuck up above the rest of the flooring of the dock he tripped backward and went with a splash into the lake     chapter xvi  percy hears something   ralph was not much alarmed when percy paget went over and disappeared beneath the waters of the lake he knew the young aristocrat could swim moreover the end of the rowboat was within easy reach  percy let out one yell and then went under the yell was not one of fright over his safety but over the thought that all of his elegant clothing would be wet through and through  he made a great splashing when he came up and soon grasped the gunwale of his boat  you rascal he spluttered just wait till i settle with you  its your own fault that you went overboard retorted ralph i sincerely hope that it cures your fiery temper  dont talk to me  all right i wont and without another word ralph walked off leaving percy to get out of his predicament as best he could  the young aristocrat was fearfully angry when he at last drew himself out of the lake his hat had floated off and he was compelled to row away from shore for it by the time he came back ralph had disappeared  ill fix him for that muttered the young bully hotly ill fix him see if i dont  it made percy doubly angry to think that ralph had been so richly rewarded for stopping the runaway team percy thought a good deal of julia carrington and he fondly hoped that the young and beautiful girl regarded him with equal favor he would have been disagreeably surprised had he known the exact truth  percy had rowed over to eastport intending to call at mr dunhams sporting goods store for a new fishingrod with which to go fishing up the lake but now he was out of the humor for this and instead of landing again he turned back toward westville  it was a bright sunshiny day and by spreading out his coat on the seats he soon had it fairly dry he also pressed the water from his cap and from his vest and trousers as best he could  yes sir ill get square with him just as sure as my name is percy paget he muttered over and over to himself  percy was just about to tie up at one of the little wharves some distance above the bridge when he espied two young ladies walking along the shore they were julia carrington and her intimate friend carrie baker  goodmorning cried percy raising his cap with what he imagined was a decidedly graceful flourish  goodmorning mr paget returned carrie baker coldly while julia carrington merely bowed  i trust you are quite over the excitement of a couple of mornings ago went on the rich young man to julia  oh yes she returned shortly  i guess i got the worst of that went on percy i got pitched out in doublequick order didnt i  indeed i fancied you jumped out rejoined julia stiffly  what do you suppose i would jump and leave you and your mother to your fate demanded the young aristocrat in wellassumed surprise oh no julia you ought to know me better than that  i know you well enough mr paget returned the girl goodmorning and she touched her companion on the arm to go  hold on please urged percy its a splendid morning on the lake wont you go out for a row  thank you i dont care to  oh yes both of you come urged the young bully  no rowing for me put in carrie baker you might get a fright and tumble overboard and leave us to our fate she added mischievously her friend had told her all the particulars of the incident on the road  percy could not help but feel the cut thickheaded as he was he tried to frame some fitting reply but could not and so rowed away feeling in a worse humor than ever  its all the fault of that ralph nelson he said to himself he has set julia against me ill fix him see if i dont  in the meantime ralph had resumed his search for employment throughout eastport he could not help thinking of the ludicrous picture percy had presented while floundering in the water and he laughed several times over the recollection  ralph visited three stores and two factories without the first signs of a situation then he came to a place where all sorts of novelties relating to the stationery trade were turned out  i cant give you a job in the factory said the superintendent but i might start you on the road  on the road  yes to sell to small dealers you could take several satchels and a trunk and go from village to village there is a good bit of money to be made in that way but you would have to leave a deposit on the goods you took out  and supposing i did not sell them  you can return what remains unsold at the end of each trip  how much of a deposit would you require  the wholesale price of the goods taken outsay about fifty dollars up  and how about the cost of getting around  well i allow a dollar a day to experienced agents for expenses but a green hand would have to pay his own way i have to protect myself in that way or otherwise some loafers would just start out to get the dollar without doing anything for it  i suppose that is so returned ralph thoughtfully i will think over the matter and perhaps ill come back later on  all right i can lend you an outfit on security so if you do not make a go of the business you will not be out of pocket a great deal  thank you returned the boy  it was now halfpast four and the list of factories was about exhausted three more stores remained ralph visited them in quick succession only to receive the old answerno new help wanted  ill go back to mr dunhams and tell him ill go to work distributing those circulars in the morning said ralph to himself and after that job is done if nothing more definite turns up ill try peddling those goods to the small stationery and general stores  he hurried back to the store where sporting goods were sold as he entered he saw dock brady at the back counter  brady was busy buying some powder and did not at first see him but on turning he nodded pleasantly  i wonder what he wants with powder thought ralph i did not know surveyors used it  but then it crossed his mind that perhaps the man used it for firearms when surveying in wild parts of the country and he did not give the matter a second thought he waited until dock brady had paid for his purchase and left and then told the storekeeper of his decision  all right nelson said mr dunham you can go to work at seven oclock tomorrow morning let me see you live in westville dont you  yes sir  some of the circulars are to go there and also back to hopeville supposing you take them with you now and start out distributing them from your home instead of coming here it will save time  to this ralph readily agreed and after some few instructions concerning the work to be done quitted the store with a big package of the circulars under his arm  although he had struck no regular employment he was not as disappointed as he might have been there was a weeks work to do and then the peddling to try and that was something  i knew it would be difficult to obtain an opening said mrs nelson on hearing his story times are hard and you can be thankful that you have even a little  i am thankful mother replied ralph  in distributing the circulars you may be able to hear of some opening she went on although you must not waste mr dunhams time in hunting it up  if i waste any time i will make it up to him i believe in working on the square no matter what i do rejoined ralph flatly  that is right my son treat every person with whom you have dealings honestly and you are bound to succeed in life  during the evening ralph told his mother of percy pagets mishap at the dock she shook her head sadly  he is a headstrong boy and i am sorry he comes so often in your path she said he will be more down on you now than ever  i shall watch out for him returned ralph he shall not cause me more trouble if i can help it     chapter xvii  a midnight crime   on the following morning bright and early ralph started out to distribute mr dunhams circulars he carried the bulk of them in a canvas bag over his shoulder and took his lunch with him in case he was not near home during the noon hour  after leaving a circular at each of a dozen cottages he came to the stores  hallo in a new business eh remarked uriah dicks as he placed one of the bills on the latters front counter  yes sir  i guess that dont pay much sniffed uriah  it pays better than nothing laughed ralph  you might better have come here to work for me  that is a matter of opinion mr dicks  no it haint its the truth grumbled the storekeeper how long is that makeshift job goin to last  a week  exactly an then youll be out again  perhaps something else will turn up in the meantime  taint likely a job in the store would be more respectable than carting around sech trash which everybody sticks in the fire soon as they get em  the truth was that uriah was hard pressed for help his son having gone away on a business trip to chambersburgh and new york he had tried to get a boy in vain all of those in the village knowing his mean ways too well to undertake to work for him  this is honest work and thats enough for me said ralph i am not ashamed of it  well suit yourself only i wont hold my offer to you open long warned uriah  dont hold it open at all if you can get any one else said ralph and fearing he was wasting his employers time he hurried off to the next place  seems he dont care for a steady place nohow growled uriah sourly some boys dont know whats good for them  ralph visited all of the stores and even left a number of the circulars in the post office tying them up on a string where the people coming in for letters might tear one off mr dunham had told him to do this and had given him a special package for that purpose  while he was at work the clerk in the office henry bott came out to see what he was doing  a little talk ensued regarding the circulars it appeared that mr hooker did not approve of circulars about the place  but you leave them there said henry bott and i wont take them down unless he especially orders it  ralph was about to leave the post office when he brushed against a man who had just come in the man was dock brady  the boy was about to say something about meeting once more but brady gave him no chance as soon as he saw he was recognized he turned on his heel and walked away again  he acts mighty queer thought the boy what can make him wish to avoid me  ralph wondered if he would meet percy on the hill among the fashionable houses but he saw nothing of the aristocratic bully although he even left a circular on the pagets front piazza  by noon the boy had gone through the entire town then after taking lunch he started on foot for hopeville a mile away  the road was uphill leading directly from the lake shore but soon ralph was overtaken by a man in a farm wagon it was some one he knew fairly well and the man asked him up on the seat  thank you mr gillup i wouldnt mind riding as it is warm said ralph  going to hopeville with them bills asked mr gillup a farmer  yes  got into a new business since you left the bridge  for a time it wont last long  it is a pity they took the bridge job from you i jest told ben hooker the postmaster so  they acted as they thought best i presume  i understand squire paget was at the bottom of it he appears to be very much down on you  its on account of his son percy he wouldnt do the right thing and we had a row  cant tell me nuthin about that boy didnt i catch him stealin my choicest pears last summer if he comes around my place again ill fill him full of shot see if i dont  you had better not mr gillup the squire will have you arrested he wont let any one do the first thing against percy  i aint afeared of him ralph if he comes around hell get the shot sure pop but i aint calkerlatin hell come because i give him warnin and hes too precious scared o his hide  i cant understand how the squire can put up with percys ways said ralph after a pause he seems to ride right over his father  squire paget will rue it one of these days returned mr gillup with a grave shake of his head boys as is allowed their own way like that never amount to much  the conversation helped to pass the time and almost before they knew it hopeville was reached ralph thanked the farmer and left the wagon  after leaving a bill in every store and house in the village ralph walked around to the various summer boardingplaces this took time and ere he had finished it was dark  there i imagine that is one fair days work done he said at last as he reached his final handful of bills ive covered a good many miles since i left home this morning  he was fortunate enough to catch a ride back with a man who was carting a load of garden truck down to the lake for shipment and he entered the cottage just as the clock was striking seven  done for the day and glad of it mother he cried  you are not used to tramping around ralph she returned as she kissed him  thats a fact i dont believe i would make a very good tramp anyway he went on  i trust you will never be reduced to that she shuddered  no im going to be something better than a tramp  where have you been asked mrs nelson  sitting down ralph told the story of his days work like the true mother she was mrs nelson was thoroughly interested in all he had to say  tomorrow i shall go to silver cove and ricksons corners he said and the day after to the hotels up at the head of the lake  i shouldnt think it would pay mr dunham to advertise in this way  i think it will up at hopeville i met a gentleman who read the circular eagerly he said he had been hunting for a store where he might buy some toys and games for his children and he is going to visit mr dunhams place tomorrow halfadozen good customers would pay for the bills and for the distributing too  if mr dunham gets such an increase in trade perhaps he will give you a place in the store suggested mrs nelson  thats so ill speak to him about it  during the evening meal ralph noticed that his mother did not appear to be very well and presently he asked her about it  i have a pain in my side ralph she said but i imagine it will get better by morning  the two retired early ralph worn out by his days travels soon fell asleep  it was nearly two oclock in the morning when mrs nelson called him  it is too bad ralph she said but i cannot stand it any longer  what is it mother the pain in your side he asked springing up  yes it is growing worse and i must have something for it  shall i go for dr foley  you may go to his house tell him what is the trouble and ask him to give you a plaster or some liniment for it  i will you are not afraid to stay alone while i am gone  oh no only hurry as fast as you can  i will replied ralph quickly  in a few minutes he was in his clothes and on the way dr foley lived on the other side of the village and the boy ran in the direction as rapidly as he could  ralph had to pass the building in which the post office was located he was within a hundred feet of the place when suddenly a muffled explosion reached his ears  hallo whats that he cried to himself and stopped short  at first no sound followed the explosion then came hasty footsteps and in the semidarkness of the early morning he saw two men and a boy run from the post office building and hurry in the direction of the lake  it was too dark to distinguish more than the forms of the persons and note that they each carried a satchel in a few seconds they were out of sight  something is wrong thought ralph what had i best do  half a minute later several men rushed out on the street and toward the post office building ralph mingled with the crowd it was not long before the truth of the matter was revealed the post office safe had been blown open and robbed     chapter xviii  about a pocketknife   ralph was as much interested as any one else in the fact that the westville post office had been robbed he mingled with the crowd in his eagerness to learn the particulars  but being a boy he was pushed aside by the men and no attention was paid to the story he had to tell about the two men and the boy he had seen running away  then the thought of his mother suffering at home rushed into ralphs mind what would she think of his long absence  robbery or no robbery i must go to the doctors and get back home as fast as i can he said to himself  and five minutes after the excitement began he was once more on his way to dr foleys residence  when he reached the physicians place it was several minutes before he could arouse the doctor and make him understand what was wanted then it took ten minutes more for the doctor to fix up a plaster and some medicine  ralph had lost so much time that although he wished to learn more of the robbery he decided to go home by a short cut across the fields instead of by the village streets  he set out on a run through the darkness he knew the path well and did not mind the rough places which had to be crossed or the spots where the bushes grew thickly  when he reached the little woods just in front of the house he fancied he heard a footstep near at hand he stopped short wondering what it could be  there cant be any animals about he thought perhaps its luke jacksons doghe comes about here occasionally  he heard the steps again coming from toward the cottage then before he could locate them closely they ceased altogether  tige tige he called for that was the name of the dog to which he had referred  no answer came back nor did any dog put in an appearance ralph waited a few seconds longer and then made straight for the house  he found his mother sitting in the kitchen nursing her pain as best she could  you have been quite long ralph she said or else it is my pain makes the time seem longer  i lost a little time at the post office mother  at the post office why what were you doing there at this time of night  the safe has been blown open and robbed it happened just as i came along  you dont say did you learn the particulars  i did not wait for that there was a crowd gathering and everybody was as excited as could be but i think i saw the robbers  you did  i saw two men and a boy running and each had a satchel  that was certainly suspicious returned mrs nelson she was in too much pain to say more just then and set about making use of the things ralph had brought from the doctors fortunately these did her much good and inside of half an hour she was considerably better  i thought i heard you coming a quarter of an hour before you did remarked mrs nelson presently i certainly heard somebody walking in the dooryard  ralph was interested at once  i heard footsteps too he said somebody must have been prowling about who could it have been  perhaps the post office robbers suggested mrs nelson somewhat nervously  i dont see what they would be doing about here rejoined ralph seriously  did they come in this direction  they came down the main street yes  mrs nelson sighed deeply she did not like the idea of any one prowling about her home after dark  i am going to take a look around again said ralph noticing her uneasiness perhaps it was a sneakthief who has stolen the ax or the saw from the woodshed  ralph walked outside it was now growing lighter in the east for it was after four oclock in the morning he looked about the woodshed and the cottage but everything appeared to be all right certainly nothing had been stolen  the boy was about to return to the kitchen when he heard several men coming down the road from the village he halted in the dooryard to see who they were  there is somebody now one of the men exclaimed and ralph recognized uriah dicks voice  it is ralph nelson himself replied bart haycock the blacksmith who was one of the party  hallo there nelson called out the third man it was jack rodman the district constable  hallo rodman returned the boy as he ran down to the gate are you after the post office robbers  i guess we are that put in uriah dicks an we aint far from one of em  hush put in jack rodman hastily wait till i have a talk with the boy  it aint no use for to talk insisted uriah theres the evidence plain enough  there may be a mistake suggested bart haycock i cannot believe ralph would do anything wrong  why whatwhat do you mean stammered the boy hardly catching the drift of their talk  is this your knife ralph asked the constable producing a buckhandle pocketknife  why yes it is returned ralph promptly where did you get it he went on in surprise for he had thought the blade safe in his own pocket  jess where you dropped it a couple of hours ago returned uriah dicks eagerly in the post office  the post office i havent been in the post office since yesterday  what are you doing out so early in the morning asked the constable  my mother is sick and i have been over to dr foleys for medicine for her  and you werent near the post office  oh yes i was only a few hundred feet away when the explosion took place  there didnt i say i saw him in the crowd exclaimed uriah eagerly  what were you doing in the crowd  i wanted to see what was up  you didnt stay very long said the constable dryly  i couldnt mother was waiting for me  you are quite sure you werent in the post office just before the explosion occurred  why of course i wasnt in the place what are you driving at  we found the pocketknife in the buildingfound it not ten feet from the wrecked safe it had been used evidently for ripping open some sealed packages  my knife ejaculated ralph  exactly ralph put in bart haycock but dont think i believe you guilty my boy he went on feelingly  guilty of what  robbin the post office cried uriah dicks he is guilty to my way of thinkin  robbing the post office ejaculated ralph  thats it ralph said the constable seriously it has been discovered that there were two men and a boy and they think you were the boy  me ralph could hardly believe his ears oh rodman you dont mean it  he does mean it said uriah sharply wasnt your knife found there  i must have dropped the knife in the office yesterday when i was hanging up mr dunhams circulars  did you use the knife then asked bart haycock  ralph thought for a moment  yes i did the cord was too long and i remember taking out my knife and cutting it  that wouldnt put the knife inside the postmasters office said uriah  ralph looked at the knife again it was really hiswith his name carved on the handle there was no disputing that point  i cant understand it he said but i can give you my word of honor that i was not inside the building tonight  i guess benjamin hooker aint taking your word for it grumbled uriah dicks he is responsible to the government an hes goin to find out who robbed him thats what hes goin to do  you had better come with me said jack rodman you can tell your story to mr hooker and to squire paget  better make a search around here first suggested uriah the men that helped do the robbin may be hiding here bart and i can hold ralph so he dont run away     chapter xix  about the robbery   if ralph had been astonished before he was doubly so now he looked from one to another of the men in amazement  do you really think i am one of the thieves he gasped  its mighty suspicious responded jack rodman you were seen in the neighborhood of the post office tonight and then this knife business is a clew  i dont think ralph will run away said bart haycock i myself think he is innocent  thank you for those words said the boy i am innocent  then you have no objections to our making a search about here said the constable  not any objection whatever said ralph promptly search where you please  ill help you said uriah to the constable  hadnt you better hold me tight suggested ralph with a sarcasm which was entirely lost on the miserly storekeeper  well i dunno hesitated uriah  i will see to it that he doesnt run away said the blacksmith this makes me sick ralph he added in a low tone i know you are as innocent as a babe that post office was robbed by professionals  the constable and uriah knocked on the cottage door and mrs nelson let them in she was greatly surprised when jack rodman declared his errand  ralph is indeed innocent she exclaimed you may search the premises all you please  the constable and uriah took a lamp and the search began every nook and corner of the cottage was gone over but nothing that looked like what had been takenmoney and registered letterscame to light  i hope you are satisfied now said mrs nelson in a tone of halftriumph ralph hasnt a grain of dishonesty in him  lets take a look outside suggested uriah maybe he knew better than to bring it in the house  so outside he and the constable went they looked around under the stoops and around the woodshed  not a thing murmured jack rodman  uriah did not reply to this his sharp eyes had caught sight of a leather bag halfconcealed under a clump of raspberry bushes he ran forward and dragged the bag out  look here he cried what did i tell you  a leather valise true enough exclaimed the constable but it may be one belonging to the family  would they leave a good valise out under them bushes growled uriah not much  i shouldnt think they would  and besides this looks like the one benjamin hooker kept in the post office for his trips to the chambersburgh bank  the constable began to examine the bag soon he ran across a tag inside upon which was printed in ink    property of benjamin hooker   postmaster westville  that settles it he said in a harder tone than he had before employed  i guess it looks black enough against ralph nelson now said uriah  so it does  i positively know nothing of that bag cried ralph when confronted with it i never saw it before  you will have to go with me returned jack rodman  do you place me under arrest ejaculated ralph  hardly that but you must go with me to the post office there we will see what mr hooker has to say it is his affairand the governments  oh ralph cried mrs nelson in alarm they think you are really one of the robbers  i know it mother but i am not and i do not see how they can hold me  you wont go along asked uriah quickly  oh yes i will i am not afraid of the consequences  it was now drawing toward daylight and after completing his hastilymade toilet ralph accompanied the constable and the others to the westville post office  here they found all in confusion the safe doors had been blown open with gunpowder and the explosion had damaged the entire office the plaster from the ceiling had come down and this lay over a mass of letters papers and wrecked furniture  in the midst of the mass was the postmaster and his clerk henry bott doing what they could to straighten matters out and ascertain the exact loss sustained  squire paget was also present he seemed particularly anxious about the registered letters which had been ready for the morning mail and groaned aloud when he heard that all of them had disappeared  not one of them left he asked of henry bott you dont see anything of the one i addressed to new york  no squire all have disappeared together replied the clerk  too bad that letter was worth a small fortune to me  what did it contain asked the clerk  the squire did not answer but walked away in deep perplexity  there was an additional excitement when ralph was brought in by jack rodman soon it became whispered about that the boy was one of the robbers  who is it questioned several  easy to see that its ralph nelson  say is he really guilty do you think  thats what uriah dicks says  rather guess uriah is mistaken  and thats what i think uriah is down on the boy  thats so ralph is honest enough  eddy harmes saw ralph around the post office  maybe he is mistaken  eddy is willing to swear to it  yes i saw him said eddy harmes a teamster  eddy was driving over to the eastport market for garden truck  randolph newell saw him too put in another in the crowd saw him not over five minutes after the explosion  and so the talk ran on while ralph was taken inside of the building there to be examined by postmaster hooker and squire paget  the squire grew pale when he heard what jack rodman had to say  didnt you find anyany registered letters he asked of the constable  only found the valise sir  but thats enough put in uriah dicks that and the knife clew  seems to me you are mighty anxious to have the boy found guilty cried bart haycock angrily what makes you so down on the boy  he is down on me because we have stopped trading with him and because i wont work for him for starvation wages retorted ralph he is a mean skinflint and half the village knows it  whawhat spluttered uriah thisto me  yes to you cried ralph boldly now dont say any more or it may be the worse for you i dont see why folks shouldnt believe you were one of the men who robbed the post office  well i never gasped uriah aint he thoroughly bad though next thing hell be settin my barn on fire  unless you do it yourself for the insurance put in a voice in the rear of the crowd and then there was a laugh that made uriah furious  but he knew that many could tell things to his disadvantage should they choose to speak so he sneaked out of sight without making any reply to his tormentors  no time was lost by the postmaster and squire paget in listening to what jack rodman had to say then mr hooker turned to ralph  nelson what have you to say in answer to this  simply that i am innocent mr hooker i believe that there was a boy mixed up in this affair but that boy was not myself  then ralph was called on to tell his story which he did in a straightforward manner after this he was severely crossquestioned  i cant understand about that valise and knife mused benjamin hooker if you left the knife in the outer office how did it get inside  that i cannot answer sir perhaps somebody saw it outside and carried it in  there was nobody in the office yesterday except henry bott and myself  well i cannot explain it but as i said before i am innocent     chapter xx  out on bail   did you get a look at the faces of the men and the boy you say you saw asked the postmaster after a pause  no sir i saw them but it was too dark to distinguish faces  and you say each carried a handbag  yes sir  can you prove that you were not around the post office at the time of the explosion  i cannot sir i was just coming from home to go to dr foleys for my mother who was taken sick during the night  and you went to dr foleys afterward  yes sir he will tell you the same thing  what of the valise found in your back doorward  i know nothing of it excepting that both my mother and i fancied we heard somebody around the house just a short while before the constable and the others came  postmaster hooker turned to squire paget  what do you think of this squire he asked  very queer responded the squire briefly i think you had better have him held until we can investigate further remember we have not heard from the other parties who went out yet  illustration here they found all in confusion see page 122  yes well have to hold you nelson said mr hooker its too bad if you are innocent but it cant be helped  do you mean to say you will lock me up exclaimed ralph in horror  well have tofor a whileunless you can furnish satisfactory bail  how much bail do you wish asked the boy faintly  a consultation was held between the postmaster and squire paget and finally bail was fixed at three hundred dollars  that will hold him tight enough whispered the squire no one will go bail to that amount for him  but squire paget was mistaken while ralph was being taken to the village lockup a gentleman stepped up in him ralph recognized mr leander carrington julia carringtons father  i will go that boys bail said the rich man  you carrington cried the squire in some astonishment  yes  you are running a mighty big risk sniffed the squire  i reckon i can stand it laughed leander carrington i do not believe the boy is guilty  i do  besides he did my wife and daughter a service that i shall ever remember went on mr carrington warmly he stopped my team when your son let them run away from him  the squire did not relish this remark and he turned away with some saying on his lips to the effect that if a man wanted to make a fool of himself why it was a free country  you are very kind mr carrington said ralph to the gentleman i did not expect this  its all right i dont expect youll run away  you can rest assured that i will not  so i wont be anything out of pocket and let me thank you personally for what you did for my wife and daughter i just heard of it as i have been away  the party walked over to squire pagets office and here the necessary papers were made out and signed the squire wished to put off the question of bail until more news should come in but he had once fixed the amount and mr carrington would not let him go back on his word  it was nearly nine oclock when ralph returned home and told his mother of all that had happened a dozen men were out hunting for the robbers but no news concerning them had yet come in  it was kind of mr carrington to go your bail said mrs nelson  it was indeed mother now i only hope they catch the robbers then i will easily be able to clear myself  breakfast was on the table and the two sat down while they ate ralph revolved the question of the robbers in his mind and set to thinking of one who might have accomplished it  by christopher columbus he cried suddenly leaping from his chair in his intense excitement he did it ill bet a million dollars  why ralph whats the matter exclaimed mrs nelson halfbelieving her son had suddenly gone crazy  i know one of the men who robbed the post office motherat least i think i do he added cooling down somewhat  and who is it  dock brady  dock brady i never heard of him before  he is the man i rescued from the hay barge during the storm  oh i remember now but what makes you think he is one of the men  because i remember he asked me something about the post office while we were out sailing then i saw him sneaking about the place when i was putting up circulars there and that is not all i saw him buying powder at mr dunhams store  that certainly looks suspicious returned mrs nelson its a pity you didnt think to tell mr hooker of this  i was too excited to remember it ill go off right after breakfast and let him know  ralph was as good as his word half an hour later the postmaster was in possession of all the facts then a call was made upon mr dunham who stated that he remembered dock brady very well  it was thought by the constable and the postmaster that ralph was right and an extra party was organized to hunt for dock brady  the information was gained before nightfall that brady and a man named gaston had been stopping at a secondrate hotel in eastport for two days they had settled their bills the evening before and left stating that they were going to chambersburgh on the night boat  on the following morning the captain of the night boat was seen and he emphatically denied that he had had any such passengers as dock brady and gaston he had had only seven men on board and all of these had been known to him  i guess ralph nelson tells the truth said jack rodman those men did the job and now the old harry only knows where they have gone to  but the boy said squire paget who was the boy that helped them if it wasnt ralph nelson  i give it up squire said the constable and so did many others  there being nothing else to do ralph went back to his work of distributing circulars for mr dunham he spent three days at this and was then called upon to stand an investigation before the united states postal authorities  this investigation lasted one whole day and every one who was interested in the case was present  ralph answered all questions clearly and truthfully and told all he knew concerning dock brady  whether the government detectives found any more clews at the post office was not made public but the next day ralph was informed that his bail was withdrawn and that he was absolutely free  the reader can well imagine his joy and also the joy of his mother who shed tears when the news was brought to her  thank heaven for it ralph she said as she kissed him oh what a relief now it is all over  but it is not over he said sturdily i want to find out the secret of that valise and how my pocketknife got into the office and i shall not rest until i have found out  although the boy and his fond parent did not know it this remark was overheard by a detective who had been sent to the nelson homestead to spy upon the boy he at once left the place and informed his superior that the lad was innocent and to watch further in that direction would be merely a waste of time  but although the majority of the people in westville and vicinity believed ralph innocent there were some who thought him guilty and among these was squire paget  and thinking him guilty the squire was much worried  id give a good deal to know if that registered letter fell into his hands he said to himself one night as he sat in his library perhaps he got it and is waiting for this affair to blow over before he makes it public  and then he groaned aloud and began to pace up and down nervously it was plain to see that he was more put out than he had been for years  ill pay the nelsons a visit tonight he said at last ill face the boy and his mother alone and see what they have to say i am not going to stand this suspense any longer  and sneaking out of the house without percy or the housekeeper becoming aware of it he set off on a swift walk for the little cottage by the lakeside     chapter xxi  squire pagets visit   it was not a very long walk from squire pagets elegant mansion on the hill to the humble cottage occupied by mrs nelson and ralph but the squire made it longer by taking numerous back roads it was easy to imagine that he wished to be seen by no outsider in making his proposed visit  it was nearly eight oclock when he came within sight of the cottage he saw that the lamp was lit in the sittingroom and near it sat the widow reading the latest copy of the county weekly newspaper ralph was nowhere in sight  the boy must be upstairs thought the squire most likely he is dressing to go out for the evening he went on thinking of his own sons ways percy rarely spent an evening at home  the squire entered the garden by a side gate and hurrying to the front door knocked sharply  the loud summons startled mrs nelson and made her break off abruptly in her reading with the lamp in her hand she opened the door to see who her late visitor was  goodevening mrs nelson said the squire stiffly  why goodevening squire she returned in great surprise  never before had the great man condescended to visit her humble abode  i called on a little matter of business he added rather awkwardly for he had expected an invitation to enter  indeed wont you come in then  i will  the squire stepped in and after closing the door the widow led the way into the parlor she placed the lamp down and offered the squire the easiest chair in the room he threw himself into it with a loud ahem and dropped his silk hat on a stand near by  you came on a little matter of business you say she began hesitatingly as he remained silent for a minute  yes i did he cleared his throat again mrs nelson where is your son ralph  he has gone to the store on an errand for me he will be back shortly  mrs nelson do you know that that boy is going to get both himself and you into a good deal of trouble went on the great man pompously  oh i hope not squire she cried in alarm  if he keeps on he will end in state prison  why what has he done now  i do not refer to any new action on his part i refer to this post office affair  mrs nelson breathed easier for the moment she had feared some new difficulty between ralph and percy  i thought that matter had passed she said  passed i rather imagine not madam  i mean so far as my son is concerned they had him up for examination and he was honorably discharged  that committee of post office officials didnt know its business growled squire paget wrathfully it was worse than a lot of old hens getting together  that may be your opinion squire it is not the opinion of all the folks however  madam your son had something to do with that robbery ejaculated the great man springing to his feet he cannot fool me no matter how much he fools the other westville people  ralph had absolutely nothing to do with it returned the widow warmly you might as well say your own son was implicated  nonsense does ralph deny that he was seen on the streets of westville that night  he went to dr foleys for me i was sick  was he not seen right in front of the post office directly after the explosion  he had to pass the post office to get to dr foleys  of course sneered squire paget but if he was innocent why did he not remain in the crowd instead of leaving in such a hurry inside of a minute or two  he was afraid i might get worse had i not been sick he would have remained without a doubt  you dont look very sick now madam with another sneer  no thanks to the plaster and the medicine dr foley gave ralph i have quite recovered again  humph sniffed the great man and drew up his lips  you do not believe that i was sick do you  it was a very accommodating sickness to my mind  why what do you mean squire  it gave your son a good excuse to be abroad at that time of the night when all honest folks are in bed  squire your words are nothing less than insult cried mrs nelson stung deeply by his insinuation  i am only dealing in facts madam i called here tonight to help you keep clear from trouble  you are not helping me now she replied cuttingly  at that moment a merry whistle was heard outside and a light step ascended the back stoop  there is ralph i will let him in said mrs nelson and she left the parlor  squire paget is here she said to the boy as he entered the kitchen and deposited a basketful of groceries on the table  squire paget what does he want  come in and see rejoined mrs nelson and she led the way into the best room  goodevening sir said ralph respectfully but with no degree of warmth  we have been waiting for you young man said the squire without returning the salutation  what is it you want of me  he came about that post office affair put in mrs nelson he declares that you are one of the guilty parties  instantly ralphs eyes flashed dangerously he felt under no obligations to the squire rich as he was to swallow any insult  so you think i am guilty he said as calmly as he could  yes i do returned the great man bluntly  what makes you think so  because you were around the post office said mrs nelson he even insinuates that my sickness was not real but was put on so that you might have an excuse for being out at that time of night  again ralphs eyes flashed it was bad enough to have insults heaped upon his own head but when they touched his mother  squire paget you are no gentleman he burst out you havent the least spark of a gentleman in your whole composition  whawhat stammered the village dignitary  oh ralph began his mother  hush mother i will handle him as he deserves let me alone  you young rascal what do you mean burst out the squire in a rage  i mean just what i say you may be rich and influential but you cant come here and insult my mother understand that  whywhy you young vagabond spluttered the squire  for the moment he could not find words to express himself  i am no vagabond squire paget not half as much a one as your son who drinks smokes cigarettes and keeps company with all sorts of questionable village sports  stop stop roared the great man how dare you speak to me in this fashion  how dare you insult my mother if i had an outside witness i would prosecute you for libel  the squire winced this was an attack he had never once dreamed of he had thought to bulldoze the widow and her son but he was getting decidedly the worse of the encounter  i know what i am talking about he began lamely but ralph cut him short  so do i know what i am talking about squire paget you are down on us for some reason i have not yet found out what but i will some day and you are doing your best to make endless trouble for us but i am not going to stand it we are poor but we have our rights as well as the rich  you rascal ill  i want you to stop calling me a rascal and a vagabond i might as well call you a woodenhead a shyster lawyer and a lot more  oh ralph pleaded mrs nelson  no mother he shall not come here to worry and insult you i will give him fair warning now if he does it again ill pitch him out of the house  youyou spluttered the squire  he was so mad he could get no further  there is the front door went on the boy walking forward and opening it the best thing you can do is to get on the other side of it just as quick as you can  the squire was livid he wanted to say something awful something that would crush the fearless lad before himbut the words would not come he caught up his silk hat and waved it fiercely in the face of ralph and his mother  youll rue this both of you mark my words he fairly hissed and the next moment he had disappeared into the darkness of the night     chapter xxii  ralphs new situation   after the squire had vanished ralph closed the front door and locked it he returned to the sittingroom to find his mother pale and trembling unable to stand the poor woman had sunk back on the lounge  oh ralph was all she could say just then  dont look so scared mother he replied soothingly he has gone now  oh my boy how could you she went on half in reproach and yet secretly admiring his courage  i wouldnt have done it had he not cast a slur on your fair name mother i might have stood what he said against me but ill never allow any one to say one word against you never  and the look he gave her out of his honest eyes showed that he meant what he said  but the squire what will he do now  i dont care what he does we havent done wrong so what can he do  he is influential  so is mr carrington and bart haycock and a halfdozen others that are our friends  he evidently feels certain that you had something to with the post office robbery  he is down on us mother just as i told him i wish i knew why and ralph grew more calm and more thoughtful as he spoke  he was not that way when your father was alive your father and he were quite friendly  i guess that was only because father did lots of work for him and always accepted the squires price he is very miserly you know outside of the allowance he makes percy  i cannot imagine what brought him here tonight i fancied the post office matter was past so far as you were concerned  so did i ill tell you what keeps it in the squires mind went on ralph suddenly he lost a valuable registered letter that was in the mail i heard henry bott speak of it  one that was coming to him  no one that he had sent out it was to go in the morning mail henry bott said the squire wouldnt have lost the letter for a small mint of money  what did it contain  he said the squire wouldnt say it was addressed to some party in new york i believe  it is strange the squire wouldnt mention the contents of the letter the authorities ought to know if they are to trace it  so i should think but squire paget said it was strictly private  maybe he imagines you have his letter mused mrs nelson i suppose i am foolish for thinking so but i fancied he had something on his mind when he first began to speak of the robbery  you may be right mother that would explain why he was so persistent in getting after me  you have not seen percy  no i understood from dan pickley that he had gone to chambersburgh for a few days on a visit  then the squire cannot be influenced by what his son can say  no this is solely his own doings returned ralph  they talked the matter over at some length but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion regarding squire pagets bitter enmity time must solve the mystery for them  ralph had been out distributing circulars for mr dunham on the following morning he went across the lake to put in his last day at the work  he had thought the matter over and finding the sporting goods dealer at leisure asked him if there was any opening in the store  i am sorry to say there is not ralph said mr dunham  i am willing to do anything both in the place and out if you can only employ me steadily  i know that ralph but the truth of the matter is my brother has asked me to take his son in just for his board and clothing and i have consented i couldnt do less  i suppose not sir  if there is an opening i will let you know i like you and i am well satisfied with the way in which you are putting out the handbills  you do not know of anybody that needs help  the storekeeper thought a moment  i do not he said  ralph then told him of the offer he had had to sell novelties on the road to stationery dealers  i would not advise you to go into that ralph it is only those who have had considerable experience in the line that make even a fair living by it the likelihood is that you would make little or nothing for a month or two perhaps the first year get a regular job if you can at certain wages  that is my idea sir i must do something  i am sorry i cannot help you at present  in a few minutes more ralph was on his way to glen arbor as a fishing resort a mile above eastport was called he was to put in half a day there and the balance of the time around eastport itself that done the entire territory for five miles about mr dunhams store would be billed  ralph set out in a very thoughtful frame of mind he was wondering what the following week would bring forth would he strike other work or be forced to remain idle  ralph knew a number of fishermen at glen arbor who let out boats to the summer tourists and while he was among them he met one bill franchard who gave him some information that was a delightful surprise  hallo ralph nelson sang out franchard on seeing him what brings you here  im distributing circulars bill returned the boy how is the boating season  very good just now better than i expected  you havent got an opening for me asked ralph quickly  why aint you working  this job ends today  well i dunno franchard scratched his head i do need somebody most every day for the minnie i take out the ariel and bob the washington and very often i cant let the minnie go outnot when they want a skipper for the sloop  i would like the job replied ralph promptly  tell you what ill do ralph ill give you a dollar and a half a day for your services every day i can use you and that will be at least four or five days a week even if it aint the whole six  ill take the job and thank you said the boy reflecting that even four days work would bring in six dollars as much as he had before earned while a full weeks work would mean nine dollars  all right i know i can trust you with the sloop even if she is kind of mulish at times  she needs constant watching thats all when can i come on  most likely monday morning there was a man coming to see me about her this morning if hehere he comes now  franchard referred to a well dressed gentleman who was walking toward the dock accompanied by a young gentleman and a young lady  the gentleman whose name was larkins entered into conversation with franchard and then turned to ralph  do you think you can sail that sloop all right my lad  i know that i can sir returned ralph confidently  he knows small boats as well as i do sir put in franchard his father was a boatman before him and he used to row when he was only five years old  then i will take the minnie for monday and tuesday sure and possibly for wednesday too said mr larkins and the bargain was settled on the spot  what time do you wish me on hand asked ralph  we will be ready to go out about ten oclock was the reply after the young lady and the young gentleman had been consulted  now you see i couldnt have made that bargain if you hadnt turned up said franchard to ralph after the party had gone ill be in pocket and so will you  and that will be a job that will suit me laughed ralph for once i am in luck  he spent a few more minutes with franchard in completing arrangements and then hurried off to make up the time he had lost in the distribution of the circulars     chapter xxiii  strange passengers   mrs nelson was glad to hear that ralph had procured employment at glen arbor she knew her son understood boats thoroughly so she was not alarmed over the prospects even though he had had such a thrilling experience at the time of dock bradys rescue  it will bring us in money steadily mother ralph said and that is what we need  i do not know what i would do without you ralph she returned fondly you have been the supporter of the family since your poor father was taken away  ive been thinking mother went on the son after a spell of silence i have a great mind to use fifteen dollars of that money i have in advertising for those missing property papers  do you think it will do any good  it wont do any harm i hate to put out the money but i guess we can stand it now the boating season will last for two months and more yet  yes ralph and we can save all you earn over six dollars a week of course the money is yours  no more mine than my dear mothers he interrupted i think we ought to save what we can  it is best so that we shall not have to touch what is in the bank should you not strike another situation at once after the boating season closes  but you are willing i should advertise are you not mother  oh yes ralph we must obtain the papers if possible if there is really a boom in westville real estate this lake shore property ought to become valuable  i thought of putting an advertisement in the county record and also one in the chambersburgh leader those are the principal papers read around here  that is so ralph but do you know their rates  i will write and find out  on monday night after a pleasant day on the lake with mr larkins and his young friends ralph sat down and wrote the letters two days later the replies came back he found the advertising rates of both journals quite moderate and at once sent each an advertisement to appear in the lost and found column several issues  mr larkins liked the sailing and fishing so well as well as the efforts of the young skipper to please him and his party that he hired the sloop for both wednesday and thursday additional ralph took them up and down big silver lake several times and also through the draw and down silver lake  on the latter trip ralph saw percy paget who sat on the bridge talking earnestly to dan pickley the young aristocrat stared hard at ralph  in a new business eh he sneered as the sloop ran through the draw  ralph paid no attention to him and soon they were too far away from the bridge for percy to attempt to say more  who is that young man asked mr larkins with a considerable show of interest  that is percy paget the son of the village squire returned ralph  a friend of yours  no sir and there was a decided ring in the boys tones if anything he is my worst enemy  i imagine he is not a very nice youth went on the gentleman  he is not sir he is very overbearing and will do anything no matter how mean if he cant have his own way  i believe you ralph i met him once before at a hotel back of westville with a chum of his and he was telling how he was going to get square with somebody who had done something he did not like  did he say what he was going to do asked ralph with not a little curiosity  he said something about smashing some glass  he did ralph was all attention now and did he mention any names sir  i did not hear the whole talk i believe he spoke of scaring the widow to death  i thought so returned ralph bitterly  why ralph do you know anything of this affair  indeed i do sir the widow he spoke of was my mother less than two weeks ago he smashed nearly every pane of glass in our cottage  really is it possible ejaculated mr larkins he must be a thoroughly bad boy  he is sir  did you suspect him  i did but i had no proofs and he is rich while we are poor  that doesnt make it right to smash windows said the young lady mr larkins niece  i know it but it makes it harder for one to obtain justice especially as in this case when the boys father is squire  i suppose that is so said mr larkins what was the trouble  its rather a long story sir but ill tell it if you care to listen  all were more than willing and ralph related his trials as the boat sped on its way he had three close listeners  its too bad cried the young lady uncle will cannot you help mr nelson recover damages from the paget boy  i dont know but what i can still my evidence may not be sufficient to prove him guilty  i wont bother you to do it said ralph the glass is in again and paid for so let it rest but if he ever tries to do us harm again ill tell him what i know  do so and i will give you my address in case you need my testimony returned ralphs patron  on friday ralph was idle so far as boating was concerned but he put in a full day in the vegetable garden attached to the cottage and as the place needed attention on account of the many weeds the day was far from lost on saturday he went out with several gentlemen and they liked his treatment so well that they gave him a dollar extra which with what mr larkins had given him and his regular wages made his income for the week nine dollars and a half  thats not bad is it mother he said as he placed the money in his parents lap  it is very good indeed ralph she replied at this rate you will be getting rich  hardly he laughed but we will be able to save more than we expected  on that day the boy procured both of the papers in which they had advertised there was the notice ralph had written and so unaccustomed were they to seeing their name in print that they read each notice over several times  the papers circulated through the district so many saw the advertisement they asked both ralph and his mother numerous questions to which the two answered briefly but politely they did not wish to say much until the missing papers were brought to light  squire paget also saw the notice at first he was both surprised and perplexed then a shrewd cunning look came over his face  its that boys scheme he muttered to himself oh but he is sharp no doubt of that of course hell soon obtain the papers and then he gave a long sigh my plan to make a fortune will fall to pieces  all day sunday when he ought to have been at church the squire remained in his library scheming and plotting that night he left on the evening boat for chambersburgh  ill find somebody to help me get rid of them he said its the only way  on monday ralph took out a party of young ladies and gentlemen he got in at seven oclock and found two rather roughlooking men awaiting his arrival  we understand that boat isnt hired for tomorrow said one of them i suppose we can get her cant we  yes sir if you pay the price  you are ralph nelson  yes sir  i heard you was trustworthy you can be on hand here at eight oclock tomorrow morning to take me and my friend out went on the man  yes sir do you want any bait for fishing sir  no well go for a sail and possibly for a little hunting up on the island  all right sir ill be ready for you  the men walked off toward a neighboring saloon ralph did not much fancy their looks he made up his mind that he would not have a very agreeable day with them  but he was on hand promptly in the morning and after telling franchard of the engagement took aboard the two men who appeared each with a shotgun and a gamebag  sail to the upper end of the lake toward the big islands said the spokesman and ralph steered in the direction never dreaming of what that eventful trip was to bring forth     chapter xxiv  ralphs rough experience   its a fine day for sport remarked ralph to his two new passengers as the sloop skimmed along up keniscot lake  yes returned the elder of the two men whose name was martin it couldnt be better  you dont want to try fishing suggested the boy for he knew that a good catch could be had with but little trouble  no put in the younger man called toglet we want to get up among the islands  very well sir ill have you up there just as fast as the breeze will take us  there was a slight pause after this during which both of the men examined their shotguns and other things which they carried  you live around here i suppose remarked martin at length looking at ralph sharply with his coalblack eyes  yes sir i live at westville  lived there long  all my life  then you must know the folks there pretty well  i know nearly everybody sir  any rich folks live in the town  i dont know what you would call rich laughed the young boatman there are no millionaires but there are several people quite welltodo  who are they  there is mr carrington and the widow pennover for two and then squire paget is pretty well fixed i imagine  squire paget eh is he the squire of the place  yes sir  rules it pretty well i suppose if hes rich and martin laughed in a style that had little of reality in it  i dont know what you mean by that returned ralph in perplexity he is squire that is all he owns quite a deal of property and he lives on the rent money  pretty nice town put in toglet i wouldnt mind owning a place there myself do you own a place he went on with assumed indifference while he listened eagerly for the reply  yes we own a small place close to the eastport bridge  oh yes thats a valuable spot  we own more of the land from the bridge up but we cant prove our right to it added ralph  thats too bad toglet and martin exchanged glances what seems to be the trouble went on the former  the papers my father had are missing and we can do nothing without them  you do not know what has become of the papers  no sir we are advertising for them but so far we have not received any information concerning them  but cant you get duplicates from the former owners of the ground  no sir the former owners are all dead and the property fell into my fathers hands in a roundabout way you see when he got it the land was worth but very little and no great care was taken of the papers in consequence  toglet nodded as though to indicate he understood then while ralph was busy starting the sloop on another tack toglet leaned over and whispered to his companion  thats the bottom of it sam  i shouldnt wonder returned martin in an equally low tone  ralph heard the whisper but paid no attention to it thinking the men were discussing something not meant for his ears he turned over on the new tack and once more the sloop went along on her course throwing up the fine spray over the bow  well be able to get home faster than we are now sailing remarked ralph well have a good wind all the way  unless it dies out returned martin and there was just a trace of nervousness in his tone  it wont die out replied the young boatman confidently as he cast his eyes about the sky this breeze is good until some time after dark  when will we be able to reach the islands asked toglet  ralph looked at watch  it is now quarter to ten well reach the lowest of them by eleven oclock and the big ones quarter of an hour or so later  on and on up the lake sped the sloop the villages on the shores had been left far behind and now nothing but trees and bushes appeared upon either bank  rather lonely observed martin as he gazed eagerly about not a house in sight  no sir there is no settlement within a mile and a half of here returned ralph  are there any settlements near the islands  no sir  i understand there are a number of great cliffs and ravines about the islands observed martin i would like to see them  i will show you all there are said ralph  at the time he had named they reached several small islands and passed them then two of larger proportions appeared in sight  one of the latter was quite flat while the other was rocky and mountainous  there is the best island for hunting said ralph we call it three top island because there are three tops to the mountain on it shall we land now  yes replied toglet after an exchange of glances with martin  ralph at once lowered the jib and took a reef in the mainsail then the tiller was thrown over and in two minutes more they ran into a tiny cove and came to anchor close beside a grassy bank fringed with meadow brush  of course you will go with us said martin as he sprang out  if you wish replied ralph otherwise i can remain here until your return  no come along by all means put in toglet we want you to show us the points of interest you knowthose high cliffs and the big ravines  all right sir just wait till i make everything secure  ralph at once set to work and inside of five minutes he was ready to accompany the two men he had found them quite agreeable on the trip and never for an instant did he dream of the foul plot that they were expecting to carry out  ralph offered to carry the gamebags but this offer was declined so with nothing in his hands but a thin stick he had picked up on the bank he led the way away from the sloop and up among the rocks that formed the base of the mountain of which the island was composed  its the best kind of a place for the work whispered martin to toglet as they trudged on behind ralph not a soul will guess the truth after the deed is done  dont let the boy suspect or he will be on his guard was the low reply he looks as if he could show fight if he wished  well take him unawares and then  theres a good shot cried ralph pointing to a number of wild water fowls which just then arose from a hollow close by  he fully expected one or the other of the men to take hasty aim and fire but neither did so  well wait for something better said martin  well take a look around before we begin to waste our powder put in toglet  in truth neither of them had come to do any shooting they were afraid that a shot might attract attention should other sportsmen be in the vicinity  ralph was rather disappointed had he had a gun he could easily have brought down one or more of the fowls he considered it a most excellent chance losta chance that might not occur again that day  still it was not his place to pass any remark concerning the decision of his two passengers so he remained silent and plodded along over the rocks and through the brush until half an hour later he came out on a grassy plateau overlooking a magnificent stretch of water  here we are at the top of one end of the mountain he said you can see a good many miles from here  thats so said martin what is below at the base of this cliff  rocks and water returned toglet as he peered over it must be a hundred feet to the bottom  it is more than that replied ralph  martin and toglet exchanged glances and both nodded this was as good a place as any for the accomplishment of their purpose  hallo whats that suddenly cried martin pointing across the lake  ralph looked in the direction stepping close to the edge of the cliff as he did so  i dont see anything unusual he began  he got no further the two men pushed up against him roughly and before he could save himself he was hurled into space a second later he disappeared from the sight of the two men  hes gone cried martin easily done eh tom  it was sam let us look to make sure he went down  they peered over the edge of the cliff nothing was to be seen of ralph  theres his cap down on the rocks by the water said toglet he has gone clean out of sight come on away the job is finished  and without another word these two villains in crime hurried from the spot down to the other side of the island where the sloop had been left     chapter xxv  squire pagets news   martin and toglet were very white when they reached the sloop and the younger man trembled from head to foot  whats the matter with you asked martin with a forced laugh as they got on board  nonothing stammered toglet  youve got a bad case of the shakes  well to tell the truth thats the worst job i ever tackled although ive accomplished many that were tough enough  humph youll get over that feeling when you are as old as i am replied martin heartlessly whats the boy to us  oh i aint squealing only he looked so innocent  bah dont give me any more of that stuff here have something to brace you up  martin pulled a black flask from his pocket and thrust it forward toglet drank copiously as if to drown out the memory of what had occurred martin followed with an equally liberal dose  it was done easier than i at first imagined it would be said the latter had he suspected the least thing we would have had a nasty struggle with him  the anchor was hoisted and the sails set and in a few minutes the sloop had left the island and was on her way down the lake  we wont go near glen arbor said martin let them find out about the affair in the natural way if we report it we may get ourselves into trouble  but the squire began toglet  thats none of our affair well land near westville and watch our chance to report  it was about four oclock when the two rascals beached the sloop in an outoftheway spot just north of the village in which ralph lived no one had seen their coming and as quickly as they could they left the craft and then sent her adrift  both of the men had worn wigs and these they now cast aside altering their appearance slightly their guns and gamebags were hidden behind a pile of decayed logs and then they sneaked through the woods toward the hill at the extremity of westville  they waited about squire pagets house for nearly an hour and at last saw that gentleman come out and start up the country road which led away from the village center  presently the squire came to an old disused cottage which years previous had been used as a road tavern here he halted and the two men at once joined him  its done squire said martin  hush not here cried paget in a scared voice come inside  he took from his pocket a key and with it unlocked the cottage door the two men passed inside and the squire of westville immediately followed  take a look about before you say anything he said we must not be overheard  martins lip curled but he did as requested and toglet did the same not a soul but themselves was anywhere in sight  were all right squire said martin so well get to business without delay  exactly exactly and did youis heis he gone asked squire paget breathing hard  yes hes gone returned martin boldly he went over the top of the big cliff and that is the end of him  you are sure it was the right boy  yes he said his name was ralph nelson put in toglet  you saw him gogo down all right asked the squire hesitatingly there was no failure  not a bit of it said martin he went over into the rocks below and into the water he gave one scream and that was all he added dramatically  the squire shuddered it must really be true ralph nelson was dead  very good he said in a hoarse voice here is the hundred dollars each i promised you you shall have the other five hundred whenthe body is found  all right but youll have to do the finding said martin its at the bottom of the big cliff on the west side of three top island his cap is among the rocks close by  and his boat  we sent that adrift if we are traced up we want to shield ourselves by saying we went off hunting and when we got back could find nothing of him and the boat and had to get a stranger to take us ashore  ah i see very good  now we want to be going well look for you in chambersburgh inside of a week dont fail us if you value your secret  i will be on hand  you ought to pay us more than five hundred put in toglet you are going to make a pile out of this  how do you know anything about what i am going to make asked the squire in great surprise  the boy told us about his property and the papers that were missing  i know nothing of that  humph we can put two and two together youll make a fortune out of that land no doubt  i know nothing of that land you mention  maybe you dont  and i havent his missing papers went on squire paget and for once he spoke the truth  then whats your aim in getting him out of the way  that is my affair  of course it is broke in martin but you might make it a bit more than five hundred  i am poor gentlemen i had to do what has been done to keep me from ruin  both of the rascals laughed at his words but they could get nothing more out of the squire and a few minutes later after a little more conversation concerning poor ralph they separated the two villains who had pushed the boy over the cliff went back for their guns and gamebags and then set out for a town at the north of the lake  squire paget watched them out of sight and then hurried back to his mansion somehow he did not feel safe until he had locked himself in his library  at last the boy is out of the way he murmured to himself as he sank into an easychair it was accomplished much easier than i imagined it would be thanks to my intimate knowledge of the character of that rascal martin and toglet his tool now what is to be done next it will not do to get the widow out of the waythat would excite suspicion i had better wait and watch her closely maybe shell be unable to hold her cottage with her son no longer at hand to earn enough to keep them and shell be forced to sell out at a low figure and thenby jove he exclaimed suddenly thats a grand idea its a wonder i didnt think of it before  the new idea made the squire walk up and down the library rapidly he was a great schemer and could evolve a whole transaction no matter how intricate much more rapidly than most men  ill do it he said to himself ill offer her a good price for the cottage and the land and when the papers are drawn up for her signature ill take good care that all the other land is included in the plot mentioned i can make the papers so confusing that she wont know the difference and shell sign them without knowing their real contents glorious  then came a knock on the door  dinner is ready sir said the housekeeper  very well i will be there in a few minutes he returned  then he gazed out of the window thoughtfully  but what if those papers should turn up i must watch out for them and get the land in my name before that occursif it ever does occur what a fool i was to trust them in the mails to have them certified to by that old woman in new york     chapter xxvi  on the island   meanwhile what of poor ralph was it true that he had been dashed to his death over the high cliff  happily it was not true yet for a long while after he was pushed over the boy knew nothing of what had happened  he went down and down clutching vainly at rocks and bushes as he passed then his head struck a stone and he was knocked senseless  how long he remained in this state he did not know when he came to all was dark around him and silent  putting his hand to his face he found it covered with blood there was a large bruise on his left temple and his head ached as it never had before  where am i was his first thought what has hap oh  with something akin to a shock he remembered the truthhow he had stood on the edge of the cliff and how martin and toglet had bumped up against him and shoved him over  i believe they did it on purpose he thought the villains what was their object  by the darkness ralph knew it was night but what time of night he could not tell luckily he had not worn his new watch the old one was battered and had stopped  presently the bruised and bewildered boy was able to take note of his surroundings and then he shuddered to think how narrowly he had escaped death  he had caught in a small tree which grew half way down the side of the cliff and his head struck on a stone resting between two of the limbs of the tree below him was a dark space many feet in depth above him was a projecting wall of the cliff which hid the top from view  what to do he did not know he wished to get either to the top or the bottom of the wall as soon as possible but he did not dare make the effort in his feeble condition and without the aid of daylight  i must remain here until dawn he concluded i can do nothing until i can see my way  to prevent himself from falling should he grow faint or doze off he tied himself to the limbs of the tree with several bits of cord he happened to have in his pocket  hour after hour went by and he sat there alternately nursing his wounds and clutching his aching head and wondering why the two men had treated him so cruelly never once did he suspect that they were the hirelings of squire paget  they did not rob me he said to himself after he had searched his pockets and found his money and other valuables safe and yet i am positive that it was not an accident  at last the morning dawned with the first rays of light ralph looked about for some manner of releasing himself from his perilous position  to climb up to the top of the cliff was impossible there was nothing but the bare rocks to clutch and they would afford no hold worth considering  therefore he must go down but such a course was nearly as hazardous  with great care he lowered himself to the cleft from which the tree that had saved his life sprung having gained this he scrambled down along a fringe of brush then it was necessary to drop a distance of ten feet and crawl on hands and knees around a sharp corner to where a slope of dirt led to the bottom on the dirt he slipped and he could not stop himself until he had rolled into a clump of bushes directly at the base of the cliff  illustration it was necessary to drop a distance of ten feet see page 168  still more bruised he picked himself up with a thankful feeling at last he was free from the danger which had hung over him so grimly he breathed a long sigh of relief  water was at his feet and his first task was to bathe his face and hands then he bound his handkerchief over his bruised temple he looked about for his cap and was not long in finding it  i suppose those fellows have left the island and if so they have doubtless taken the sloop he thought dismally ill make certain though and be on my guard while i am doing it  he walked slowly and painfully to the cove where the boat had been left but as we already know it was gone  they have taken themselves off and left me behind for dead ralph said to himself well thank fortune i am alive  the boy was in a sad situation he was without food and with no means of communication with the mainland on either side of the lake  i must see if i cant signal some passing boat he thought it is impossible to swim to the shore especially now when i feel as weak as a rag  ralph had just struck out for the opposite side of the island that upon which all of the regular lake boats passed when the report of a gun reached his ears  it came from some distance to the north and was soon followed by several other shots  he wondered if it could be martin and toglet or some sportsmen determined to find out he set out as rapidly as he could in the direction of the sound  after passing through a patch of woods and over a hill of rough stones he came to a thicket of blueberry bushes as he entered it there came another shot not a hundred feet away  in a moment more the boy espied a sportsman dressed in a regular hunting garb  hallo there he called out  hallo boy returned the man cheerily out hunting like myself  no sir replied ralph yes i am too he added with a faint smilei am hunting for help  help the sportsman put down his gun why whats the matter with your head  ive had a bad tumble two men pushed me over the cliff on the other side of the island  the dickens you say pushed you over  yes sir  what for did they rob you  no sir  oh then it was an accident perhaps  i dont think so i dont see how it could have been accidental  well you arouse my curiosity tell me your storyor you said you wanted help what can i do for you  if you have a boat you can put me ashore the two men took my boat  then they robbed you after all  but they didnt go through my pockets returned ralph  sitting down on a soft knoll of grass the boy told his story to carter franklin for such was the sportsmans name the latter listened with interest  certainly an odd occurrence to say the least my young friend what could have been the object of the two villains  i cannot say sir  it is impossible to imagine they wished to murder you merely for your boat  that is true sir  depend upon it they were up to something more it may be that they were hired to do the deed  ralph started  that may be he cried  have you any great enemies  i have enemies but none so bad as to wish to take my life returned ralph and he thought he told the truth  humph well its strange i suppose you would like to be set ashore as soon as possible  yes sir  you say you came from glen arbor i have only a rowboat at hand  you can land me anywhere interrupted ralph i can easily tramp it or catch a ride back to where i belong  very well follow me  the boy followed the sportsman down the hill to the shore here lay a trimlooking boat with a pair of oars on the seats both at once sprang in ralph was about to take up the blades but the man stopped him  you are too broke up to row he said sit down and take it easy  you are very kind sir  dont mention it i only trust you are able to catch those rascals and bring them to justice  the main shore was soon gained at a point about six miles above glen arbor and ralph sprang out he thanked carter franklin again for his kindness and then started off for home thinking soon to be able to tell his mother and his friends his strange tale and start out a party to search for his assailants he did not know that he was destined to have many strange adventures ere he should reach westville again     chapter xxvii  the meeting in the woods   ralph was so sore and stiff from his fall that he walked very slowly toward westville it seemed to him that he ached in every joint and it was not long before he sought a soft grassy bank upon which to rest  if only somebody would come along with a wagon he thought as he gazed up and down the rather rough woodland road i would willingly pay a halfdollar for a lift as much as i need my money  the boy was much exercised over his mother he knew that she would be greatly worried over his prolonged absence never before had he remained away from home over night  no wagon or any other vehicle appeared and ralph was forced to resume his journey on foot dragging his tired and bruised body along as best he could  presently he came to a tiny stream that flowed into big silver lake here he stopped again not only to rest but also to bathe his temples and obtain a drink for the water was both pure and cold  he could not help but think of the strange manner in which he had been attacked what had been the purpose of martin and toglet  if i did not know better i would be almost forced to believe it was accidental he thought but in that case they would have come to my assistance instead of taking the sloop and hurrying off with her  it was so comfortable a spot at the brook that ralph rested there longer than he had originally intended but at last he arose and moved on thankful that he had accomplished at least onethird of the distance home  the road now left the vicinity of the lake and led up into the woods and across several deep ravines it also crossed the railroad track for there was a spur of the main line which came down to glen arborthis spur being the only railroad in the vicinity  ralph had just crossed the tracks when happening to glance toward an old shed in the vicinity he saw something which filled him with astonishment emerging from the place were two men and they were martin and toglet  at first the boy could scarcely credit his senses but a second look convinced him that he was not mistaken they were his two assailants true enough  ralph stood still not knowing whether to advance or retreat before he could decide the point martin and toglet who had spent the night in the shanty after leaving squire paget discovered him  toglet gave a cry of terror thinking he was looking upon a ghost martin also uttered a yell but it was more of astonishment than aught else  look look shrieked toglet  and he pointed with his long finger  its the boy as im a sinner burst out martin  its his ghost oh why did i  shut up its the boy i tell you he must have escaped in some miraculous manner see his forehead is bound up went on martin  but how could he escape asked toglet faintly  that is more than i can answer but there he is and all our work was for nothing growled martin  never mind weve got the two hundred began his younger companion  but we havent the five hundred additional grumbled martin let us go after him  martin strode forward and shaking in every limb toglet followed  each of the rascals carried his gun and as they advanced upon him ralph thought it best to retreat there was no telling what they would do for all he knew they might try to finish their dastardly work  hi hi stop called out martin as he began to run  what do you want called back ralph  i want to talk to you what are you afraid of  you know perfectly well returned ralph  aint you going to stop  not just now come up to the railroad station and do the talking  dont you do it put in toglet in alarm hell have us arrested  stop where you are or it will be the worse for you went on martin  he raised his gun and pointed it at ralphs head  fearful that the villain would shoot him ralph left the road and dodged behind a clump of trees  there was no longer the slightest doubt in the boys mind concerning the two men they had meant to take his life and they were still disposed to carry out their intention  he has gone into the woods cried toglet why not let him go  you fool if he gets away hell have the officers of the law on our track in no time ejaculated martin we must catch him by all means  he sprang on ahead and was soon making after the boy as rapidly as his long legs would carry him  ralph heard him coming and once more he moved away he left the patch of wood and a second later came out on the railroad tracks  as he did so he heard a locomotive whistle and a locomotive rolled past followed by a long line of empty freight cars  now ill catch him cried martin to toglet he cant cross the tracks while the cars are passing  he rushed toward ralph who did not know which way to turn up the track a big cut in the rocks blocked his way and down was a deep ravine  just then for some reason apparent to the engineer the long train slackened its speed for a moment a freight car came to a halt directly in front of ralph the big side doors wide open  hardly giving the matter a second thought the boy sprang up into the car intending to let himself out on the other side  but before he could accomplish his purpose the train gave a jerk and in a second more was on its way on a down grade at such a rate of speed that to leap off would have been highly dangerous  ralph was exhausted by his run and when the car started off he could hardly stand he clutched at the side and staggered to one end and then sank down in a heap in the corner the excitement had been too much for him in his weak state and he had fainted  when he came to his senses all was dark around him a strange whirr sounded in his ears coming from the car wheels and telling him that the car was still in motion  he arose to his feet and then made the discovery that although it was dark in the car it was daylight outside the reason was plainboth of the doors on either side had been closed during the time that he had been lying in the corner  feeling his way along the side of the empty car he at length reached one of the doors only to find it locked he crossed over to the other side to find a similar condition of affairs he was a prisoner in the freight car and riding he knew not where  well this is too bad he murmured to himself as too weak to stand longer he sank down on the floor i wonder how long i have been riding  this was a question just then impossible to answer but he made up his mind that he had been riding for some little time possibly half an hour or more  there was satisfaction however in the thought that he had escaped from martin and toglet it was not likely that they had been able to board the train even if inclined to do so which was decidedly doubtful  a halfhour went by and still the car rattled on up grade and down without once slacking its speed  id like to know if were not going to stop pretty soon ralph murmured to himself  he was getting thirsty and knew it would not be long before he would need both food and drink  getting up once more he began to kick upon one of the doors with the heel of his shoe he kicked as loudly and as long as he could but no one came to answer his summons  at the end of another hour ralph began to grow alarmed the train had stopped once but kicking on the door and shouting had brought no one to his aid it looked as if he must remain in the car until the journeys end  we must be miles away from westville by this time he thought i would like to know where we are going east west north or south perhaps theyll land me in some outoftheway place that i never even heard of before  another hour passed and ralph began to grow sleepy he laid down and making a pillow of some loose hay in the bottom of the car began to take it easy in ten minutes more he was sound asleep  his awakening was a rude one somebody touched him in the side with the toe of a boot and the light of a smoky lantern was flashed into his face  get out of here you tramp cried a rough voice get out of here at once before i turn you over to the police  whowhat stammered ralph rising to his feet  but before he could say more he was jerked backward and sent flying outof the car into the darkness  now get out of the freight yard said the man who had ejected him so forcibly skip do you hear  and he raised a stick he carried so threateningly that ralph was glad to retreat     chapter xxviii  ralph in the city   hardly knowing what to make of such rough and unexpected treatment ralph staggered toward a large gateway close at hand he passed through and found himself on a narrow and dirty street at the upper end of which were a number of tenement houses and saloons  where in the world am i he murmured to himself as he passed his hand over his forehead from which the bandage had slipped what place can this be  the cool night air braced the boy up and soon he felt stronger but he was very thirsty and was willing enough to stop at a nearby street fountain for a drink  he heard a distant bell strike twice and he knew it must be two oclock in the morning his involuntary ride had lasted over ten or twelve hours at leastthe length depending upon the time spent in the freight yard before disturbed by the night watchman  the street was practically deserted saving for several men who were staggering along under the influence of liquor all the stores were closed  i must find some place to stay for the rest of the night no matter what place i am in thought ralph and he walked on for a dozen blocks or more looking for a hotel or lodginghouse  at last he came to a place that was still partly open over the doorway was the sign in gold letters    royal crown hotel   beds 25 cents per night  certainly not a very expensive place thought ralph and he peered inside to where a sleepy clerk sat dozing in a chair beside the desk  entering he aroused the clerk and asked if he could obtain accommodations  certainly was the prompt reply single room one dollar two beds seventyfive cents six beds a quarter which will you have  any place will do for me so long as its clean returned the boy who was not inclined to be wasteful of his limited capital the total amount in his pockets was not over six dollars part of which belonged to the boatman for whom he worked  all our beds are clean said the clerk sharply pay in advance please  ralph brought out a quarter and passed it over  can i get a bite to eat anywhere before i go to bed he asked  theres an allnight lunchroom on the corner above  thank you ill get something for i have had no supper i came in on a train and went to sleep i dont even know what place this is ralph went on  dont eh this is jersey city  jersey city could it be possible then he had indeed taken a long trip  ralph knew that jersey city lay just across the river from new york a short ride would take him into the great metropolis despite the fact that he wished himself safe at home the thought of seeing new york filled him with pleasure  i must send word to mother that i am safe and tell her all of what has happened and then spend a day or two in new york before i go back he said to himself i may not get the chance of seeing the city again for a long time  ralph found the allnight lunchroom without much trouble and entering he sat down at one of the numerous tables he was a wellread boy and therefore did not appear as green as he might otherwise have done  a waiter soon came to serve him  what will you have he asked  what have you got  all kinds of dairy dishes tea coffee and oysters  ill take an oyster stew  anything else  i guess not  the stew was soon brought it was a fairly good one and the hungry boy ate it with a great relish consuming all of the crackers that went with it  while he was eating a short stout man with his arm done up in a sling entered the place and after gazing around sharply came and sat down close to ralph  how is the stew pretty good he asked  i think so returned the boy  all right then waiter an oyster stew  while he was eating his stew the man began to converse with ralph he said his name was jackson walters and that he had just come into the city from toledo ohio  and i feel mighty strange he added do you know the city pretty well  not at all i just got in myself said ralph  indeed then we are in the same boat stopping with friends or at a hotel  i am going to stop at a hotel over night  this reply seemed to please jackson walters and he drew up closer hurrying to finish his stew at the same time  good enough perhaps we can stop together i feel rather lonely here he said  i am afraid my hotel wouldnt be good enough for you replied ralph honestly i didnt want to waste my money and so chose a cheap place  well i want something cheap too said jackson walters he was more pleased than ever over the idea that ralph had money even if he did not care to spend it  where is the hotel  just down the street a step i will show you if you wish it  let us take a room together suggested jackson walters as they left the restaurant i hate to go in among perfect strangers dont you  yes but it couldnt be helped i took a quarter bed and there are six in a room  humph six thats too many how much do they want for a room for two  seventyfive cents each  then ill tell you what ill doill pay the dollar if youll pay the fifty cents those rooms with six beds in are vile  ralph hesitated a moment and then said he was agreeable he too did not imagine after some reflection that the bed for a quarter of a dollar could be very good  they soon reached the hotel and jackson walters explained the new arrangement to the clerk ralph paid over another twentyfive cents and his new friend the dollar and then a boy was called to conduct them to room no 96 on the third floor  call me at halfpast seven said jackson walters i dont know when you want to get up he said to ralph  that will suit me sir was the boys reply  he usually arose at an earlier hour but thought he deserved a longer rest considering what he had passed through  the boy led them up two flights of narrow stairs and showed them the room at the same time lighting the gas he had brought a pitcher of water with him and placing this on the washstand he left closing the door behind him  the room was plainly but neatly furnished and although the bed was scratched and oldfashioned it was clean it did not take ralph long to undress and get under the covers  do you sleep with a light asked jackson walters i never do  nor i  so the gas was put out and a moment later ralphs companion retired also in a few minutes he began to breathe heavily as though in the soundest of slumbers  but this was all sham he was far from being asleep as the sequel soon showed  ten minutes later ralph fell asleep to dream of home and all that had been left behind  in a few minutes after this jackson walters crawled from the bed and began to don his clothing silently but in great haste he put on his stockings but he placed his shoes in his coat pockets  this done he took up ralphs clothing from where it lay on a chair with a dexterity worthy of a better cause he went through the pockets searching for everything of value  his nefarious task was soon accomplished ralph slept on unconscious and did not awaken when jackson walters opened the door and glided out  the thief was soon below the clerk dozed away in the office and in his stocking feet the man had no difficulty in passing out of the building without being noticed  once on the pavement he slipped on his shoes  not much of a haul but a good deal better than nothing he chuckled to himself and disappeared down the street which led toward the ferries     chapter xxix  penniless   it was daylight when ralph awakened from what had been an unusually sound sleep he sat up and rubbed his eyes wondering for the moment where he was then the recollection of what had occurred flashed over his mind he looked beside him and saw that jackson walters had gone  he must have dressed and left me to sleep it out he thought i wonder what timehallo what does that mean  ralph had espied his clothing in a heap on the floor most of the pockets inside out with a strange fear he leaped from the bed and made a hasty examination it was only too truehe had been robbed  that fellow was nothing but a sharper he ejaculated to himself what a fool i was to be taken in by his smooth tongue he took me for a greeny from the country and he was right  ralph did not know enough to ring for the proprietor of the hotel and acquaint him with the facts in the case he scrambled into his clothing as best he could and washed and brushed up all in a minute  when he reached the office he found a new man at the desk  i have been robbed he said  robbed cried the clerk by whom  a man who occupied the same room that i did replied the boy  he told what he knew to which the clerk listened with interest but the hotel clerk saw that ralph was green so he took no responsibility upon his own shoulders he said he would notify the police but it was likely nothing would be heard of jackson walters  the matter was talked over for half an hour and then ralph left the place to see if he could trace up the thief he walked around until noon without any success  this is the worst yet he muttered to himself as he at last came to a halt down near one of the ferries here i am in the city without a cent in my pocket what in the world shall i do  had ralph been in new york he would have made an effort to hunt up horace kelsey the gentleman he had assisted while he was acting as bridge tender the gentleman had told him to call whenever he was in the city and he had no doubt but what he could raise a loan when he stated how he was situated  at length he decided to go back to the hotel and see if anything had been heard of jackson walters he went back only to be disappointed  but the visit was productive of some good hearing that he had a friend in new york the hotel keeper gave him a quarter of a dollar with which to get over the ferry and pay other expenses while hunting him up  ralph was soon back to the river and in company with a great stream of people he purchased a ferry ticket and went aboard one of the boats  the trip on such a craft was a novelty and he was sorry it did not last longer yet when the boat touched on the other side he was one of the first ashore  ralph was now in the great city of new york and the country boy could not help but stare about him at the bustle and apparent confusion on all sides by a miracle he managed to cross wall street in safety and then learning that broadway lay several blocks beyond he followed the crowd in that direction  its a big place and no mistake he said to himself my gracious what tall buildings and how they are crowded together  at last broadway was reached that greatest of all metropolitan thoroughfares it was the most wonderful of all sights to ralph so many cars and wagons and trucks not to mention people he stood on the corner so long that at last a policeman came up and told him to move on  ralph was sorry he could not remember horace kelseys number the insurance agents card was at home and the boy had not troubled himself to commit the address to memory he knew it was on broadway and that was all  i suppose i might inquire at some of the insurance offices he thought at length ill step into the next one i run across  it was not long before he came to such a place as he was looking for he entered and made known his wants to the clerk who advanced to ascertain his wishes  horace kelsey said the clerk dont know the man  he is an insurance agent went on ralph  good many insurance agents in new york you might look in the directory there is one on that stand over by the window  thank you ill try it replied the boy  he soon found the list of men in the insurance business running down the column of ks he came across the name kelsey horace insurance broker with his office address and also his home address uptown  making a mental note of both ralph hurried out a policeman directed him to the tall office building in which his friend had rooms and he was soon on his way thither  arriving at the building the boy took his first ride in an elevator it must be confessed that the lift moved so fast and the sensation was so unusual that it made him somewhat sick when he got out at the right floor he felt as if he was walking on air for a few seconds  he found horace kelseys office handsomely fitted up there were several young gentlemen clerks and two young lady typewriters evidently business was in a prosperous condition  ralph was disappointed to find that the gentleman himself was not visible  i came to see mr kelsey he said to the clerk who greeted him  mr kelsey is out sir what can we do for you  i will wait until mr kelsey comes in please my business is with him personally  im afraid youll have to wait a long time smiled the clerk mr kelsey is out of the city  ralphs heart sank at this announcement he had felt sure that assistance was close at hand  when do you expect him to return  i can hardly say perhaps today perhaps tomorrow or the day after it depends on when he finishes up the business on hand  ralph heaved a sigh the clerk saw that he was greatly disappointed  cant you come in tomorrow and see if he has returned he asked  i guess so faltered the boy but i expected sure to meet him today he went on  very sorry  i will come in again before you close if you dont mind  not at all come whenever you please we are open until five oclock here  ralph left his name and then quitted the offices he did not bother taking the elevator down but used the winding stairs instead  he had reached the second floor and was about to start down for the street when he caught sight of a man standing on the stone steps below the man was jackson walters  the rascal muttered ralph to himself how fortunate to catch sight of him  he sprang down the steps two at a time walters heard him coming and looked around but before he could attempt to move away ralph had him tightly by the arm  so ive caught you have i he said bluntly whyerreallyyou have the advantage of me stammered jackson walters coldly  i guess i have and its a good thing too returned ralph  ierdont know you  what ejaculated the boy in amazement  i say i dont know you isnt that plain enough  well i know you plain enough you are the man who roomed with me last night and robbed me  pon my word i never saw you before this is some extraordinary mistake  no mistake about it returned ralph doggedly he was not to be buncombed by the oily manner of the thief  let go of my arm boy  i will not you are the thief and you must return what you stole from me said ralph  he spoke rather loudly and a crowd began to collect about the two in a few seconds a policeman hurried up to ascertain the cause of the trouble     chapter xxx  the sharper is outwitted   whats the matter here exclaimed the policeman as he pushed his way forward  this man is a thief replied ralph  the boy is mistaken burst out jackson walters in assumed indignation  no i am not mistaken said ralph he slept in the same room with me in a hotel in jersey city last night and he went through my pockets and got out before i woke up  a likely story ejaculated the sharper i live in englewood new jersey and i was home last night as usual  the policeman looked perplexed ralphs earnest manner had impressed him and yet jackson walters looked honest enough  you are sure that you are not mistaken in your man he asked of ralph  i am positive sir  he is mistaken blustered the sharper i am an honest man my name is william g harrow and i am in the crockery business over in park place  well the best you two can do is to come with me said the policeman  where to  to the police station you can tell your story there  i am willing returned ralph promptly  it is an outrage cried jackson walters a respectable citizen like myself to be dragged to the station house  you wont be dragged you can walk interrupted the policeman with fine sarcasm  the fact that ralph was willing to go while the other was not had impressed him greatly in the lads favor  its all the same this boy is a young gamester he wanted to frighten me into paying him money its a pure case of blackmail  if it is the boy will be sent up for it replied the policeman sharply just come with me both of you  i wont go cried jackson walters and before he could be stopped he sprang away and started to cross broadway  like a flash ralph was after him the boy was fearful the sharper would get away and the money be lost once more before jackson walters reached the car tracks ralph had him by the arm  let go of me howled the sharper  not much i want my money replied the boy stubbornly  there take your confounded money then cried the sharper and snatching several dollar bills from his vest pocket he flung them in the street  the sight of the bills relieved ralph greatly he stooped to pick them up and as he did so jackson walters darted across the street the policeman at his heels  with the bills in his hand ralph got out of the way of the trucks and wagons as soon as he could he ran to the sidewalk and counted the money there were eleven dollars in his haste jackson walters had thrown him five dollars more than the amount originally taken  ralph now found himself in a new crowd of people the policeman and the sharper had entirely disappeared  thinking to find the pair the boy crossed broadway and hunted around up and down and into several of the side streets but it was useless the two had disappeared  well i am not the loser thought ralph with considerable satisfaction im the gainer and if jackson walters wants his money let him apply to me for it  the fact that he now had his money safe once more gave ralph not a little satisfaction he was no longer worried over the fact that he might not see horace kelsey before nightfall  it was now noon and ralph felt hungry he walked along until he came to a cleanlooking restaurant which he entered and called for the regular dinner at thirty cents he ate all that was placed before him with keen relish  while at the table he reflected upon his situation and came to the conclusion that his duty was to write to his mother telling her of all that had happened he would also ask her to see bill franchard and pay him the money due for boat hire and tell him all so that he might start on a search for his missing boat  then ill wait till i see mr kelsey and get his advice as to what to do next he thought perhaps hell see through his mystery even if i do not  close to the restaurant ralph found a stationery store at which he purchased a sheet of paper and an envelope  will you kindly allow me to write a letter here he asked  certainly replied the clerk you will find pen and ink at the desk in the rear  it took ralph some little time to compose his letterhe had so much to sayand when he had finished the sheet was crowded from the first page to the last he sent his love to his mother and told her to address him at the general post office  ralphs next move was to take his letter to the post office and stamp and mail it this took nearly half an hour but the boy enjoyed the trip to the big government building and was astonished to note on what a large scale the metropolitan postoffice business was conducted  this beats the westville post office all to bits he murmured to himself mr hooker would cut a mighty small figure here no matter how important he is at home  the letter mailed ralph felt better it would relieve his mother of much anxiety and clear up the mystery concerning his strange disappearance  shine yer shoes boss  it was the inquiry of a ragged bootblack standing just outside of the post office building  whats that asked ralph  shine yer shoes make em look like a lookinglass boss  ralph glanced down at his shoes and saw that they were decidedly in need of brushing up  what do you charge he asked  five fer a regular an ten fer an oil finish  i cannot afford more than five go ahead and do the best you can for that  all right boss ill give yer a good one  the boy dropped on his knees in an angle of the building and put out his little box before him in a second he was hard at work with a wellworn whiskbroom brushing the dirt from the bottom of ralphs trousers  how do you like shining shoes questioned ralph curiously  dont like it boss was the truthful reply no sir but a feller has got ter do somethin fer a livinor starve  and you cant get anything else to do  nixy ive tried a hundred times but it wasnt no goall the stores and shops is so crowded  that is too bad  maybe you kin give me a job went on the bootblack suddenly and he turned his blue eyes up in expectancy  hardly laughed ralph i am looking for work myself  dats too bad do yer belong in new york  no i just arrived this morning  aint yer got no pull  pull what do you mean  no friend ter give yer a lift  i have a friend yes  is he rich  yes  den its all right but if yer didnt have no pull i would advise yer to go back home a feller widout a pull in new york cant do nuthin nohow and the bootblack gave an extra dash with his brush to emphasize his remarks  i havent been able to see my friend yet he is out of town  say maybe yer kin put in a word fer me  what is your name  mickety  mickety mickety what  me udder name is powers but da all calls me just mickety  and where do you live mickety  over in cherry street wid me old granmudder she cant work an i have ter keep tings goin

mickety arose to his feet ralph brought out a quarter and handed it over  keep it all mickety he said i am sorry i cant spare more just now  gee a quarter yer a liberal gent so yer are tank yer sir  you are quite welcome returned ralph and he walked off  he was destined to meet the bootblack again and under circumstances full of the gravest peril     chapter xxxi  on the bowery   after leaving the bootblack ralph hardly knew what to do with himself it was barely three oclock and he fancied it still too early to visit horace kelseys office again  he concluded to walk around and see the sights and accordingly strolled up broadway past the city hall park and continued on up until fourteenth street was reached  this great thoroughfare with its immense stores interested him greatly he spent fully half an hour in looking into the showwindows  what a lot of money must be invested in business here he thought how i would like to be a merchant on such a scale a person who had never been here would not imagine it was so grand  when a neighboring clock showed the hour of four the boy thought it time to return to the insurance agents office he was soon on his way downtown  at the entrance to the office a policeman tapped him on the shoulder it was the one he had met earlier in the day  hallo young fellow he said did you get your money back  yes i got my money and a trifle more returned ralph did you catch the man  no the rascal gave me the slip so you got more than your money eh  i got five dollars more but he has my pocketknife and a silver temperance badge he can have his money when he gives me my things back  i reckon youll have to call it square laughed the policeman he was a slick one  he was sir  you are a stranger in the city i take it went on the policeman with a glance at ralphs country clothes  yes  you want to have your eyes open in the future or youll be robbed again before long  if you sleep in a room with others pin your money fast inside of your shirt then they cant get it without waking you up  thank you ill remember that  i shall watch out for that sharper and nab him the first chance i get  thats right he ought to be arrested  the trouble will be that there will be no one to make a complaint went on the policeman  ill make a complaint if i am still in the city said ralph  but where will i find you  ask for me at mr kelseys office in this building  oh all right said the guardian of the peace and then he and the boy separated  in a minute more ralph was back in the offices upstairs  sorry but mr kelsey has not returned said the clerk better come in tomorrow about ten oclock  thank you i will replied ralph  he went downstairs much disappointed  ill have to find some sort of a sleepingplace for tonight he thought and it must be a cheap one for if mr kelsey doesnt come back in a day or two i will have to go home without seeing him and i want to save the carfare to do it no more riding in empty freight cars for me and he laughed to himself as he remembered his experience in that line  ralph had often heard of the battery as the lower end of the city is called and he determined to pay it a brief visit before nightfall should set in  from a passerby he learned that broadway ran directly down there and on he walked against the great tide of humanity which was now setting in toward uptown  it was not long before he reached the little park back of castle garden and the emigrant offices and here he sat down on a bench to take a look at the bay and also at the various types of people that were moving about in all directions  it was dark when ralph moved off during his stay he had heard two young men speak of the bowery and the many odd sights to be seen there especially during the evening  i have nothing to do between now and bedtime he thought ill take a stroll up the bowery and take in all that is to be seen in such a place as new york it will be easy enough to find a cheap hotel when i want to retire  so leaving the battery he traveled up to park row and continued along until the bowery was reached  the bowery even at this early hour in the evening was alive with people many of the men and women were of very questionable character but ralph did not know this he walked along staring at everything to be seen  presently he came to a clothing establishment in front of which were hung a number of suits marked at very low figures he stopped to examine them and hardly had he done so when an outside salesman or pullerin as he is called approached him  nice suits eh he said pleasantly as he placed his hand on ralphs arm  they look so returned the boy  come in and try one on  no thank you not tonight  wont cost you anything come on persisted the fellow  i dont care to buy tonight  thats all right just try em on and see how nice they look on you  thank you but i wont bother you and ralph attempted to walk away  the pullerin was not going to lose him thus easily however trade had been bad with him for the day and he felt he must sell something or his position with the owner of the establishment would be at stake  its no trouble to show goods my dear sir walk right in he said and instead of letting ralph go pushed him toward the open store doors  but i dont want to buy insisted ralph who began to fancy he was not being treated just right  didnt ask you to buy my dear sir isaac just show this young gentleman some of those beautiful allwool suits for nine and ten dollars  a greasy old jew at once came forward rubbing his hands  chust sthep back here he said smiling broadly i vill show you der greatest pargains in new york  but i dont care to bu began ralph again but the jew cut him short  ve got dese suits at a great pargain he said da vos made originally to sell at twenty dollars so efery von vot buys von of dem suits saves ten or elefen dollars on der burchase brice  he hurried ralph back to the rear of the store and in a trice had at hand half a dozen suits more or less faded and of exceedingly doubtful material  chust try on der coat and vest he said here rachel hold der young gentlemans coat an vest till i fit him to perfection he went on to his wife who had come up  oh isaac it vos a shame to sold dem peautiful allvool suits for twelfe dollars she cried in assumed dismay  i vos sold dem for nine and ten dollars returned isaac  vot you reduced dem again she cried in wellassumed horror  yah i vos got to haf der monish  it vos der greatest pargain sale in der vorld cried the woman you ought to buy two suits vile it lasts she went on to ralph  in the meantime her husband was trying to make ralph take off his coat and vest he at length succeeded and in a trice had part of one of the store suits on his back  ach vot an elegant fit he cried in deep admiration chust like it vos made to order  peautiful peautiful joined in his wife  vill you try on der bants asked the jew  no returned ralph decidedly  you had better da might not fit chust so vell as der coat  but i do not want to buy cried ralph desperately  vat screamed the old jew and dot suit fits so elegantly  of course he takes dot suit put in his wife vot more you vonts hey  i didnt want to buy from the start returned ralph give me my coat and vest  and taking off the store coat and vest he flung them on a counter  you dinks i vos a fool shrieked the old jew vot you try dem clothes on for hey dot suit chust fits youits chust vot you vonts i wraps dem up and you bays for dem and say noddings more i vos here to sell gootsnot to be fooled mit     chapter xxxii  new employment   had ralph been more familiar with the ways of the city and particularly with the ways of such merchants as the one with whom he now had to deal he would have known that the jews anger was only put on in order to intimidate him into purchasing a suit he did not want  the bowery is full of such shops as i have described and despite the many protests that have been made pullersin and their associates continue to flourish in more than threequarters of the cases where passersby are enticed into stores they are forced into buying no matter how hard they protest against the outrage  but although he was ignorant of the real facts of the matter one thing was clear to ralph he did not want to buy and he was not going to be forced into doing so  i did not come in to fool he said stoutly your man outside insisted that i should come in and try on the things although i told him i did not wish to buy  dots all righti wrap der suit up and you bay for dem  not much and ralphs temper began to rise give me my coat and vest  he made a dash for the articles but before he could secure them the jews wife had whisked them out of his reach  you cant vos fool isaac she screamed you bay for der suit and den you gits dem packnot before  ill have them back now exclaimed ralph his eyes flashing dangerously give them to me  the woman ran behind the counter but he made after her he caught hold of the coat and vest and despite her resistance twisted them from her grasp in a second he had them on once more  hellup hellup screamed the woman  dont you touch mine wife howled the old jew  samuel come in here and hellup your fadder and mudder  the pullerin had been watching proceedings from outside of the store and now he came running in he was a big muscular fellow and not above acting roughly when the occasion demanded  see here what do you mean by striking my mother he cried out boldly do you want to get yourself locked up  instead of replying to this speech ralph backed toward the rear of the clothing establishment he had no desire to enter into a fight on the premises now he had his clothing he wished to get out as quickly as possible  sthop sthop screamed the old jew vere vos you going  still ralph returned no reply the way to the front was blocked but a rear door leading to a small yard was open and toward this he ran  hes goin out of der pack cried the woman sthop him isaac  run samuel shrieked isaac and the son darted forward but too late to stop ralph in making his exit  ralph found the yard both small and exceedingly dirty beyond was another yard and looking over the fence the boy saw an open hallway leading to a street  without hesitation for samuel was close at his heels ralph vaulted over the fence before the young jew could follow he was inside of the hallway a minute later he was in the next street and running through the crowd toward the end of the block he did not cease his rapid pace until the neighborhood was left a good distance behind  well thats the most trying experience ive had yet he murmured to himself as he at last dropped into a slow walk to catch his breath those people are not thieves but they are next door to it  ralph was so disgusted with the bowerywhich in reality has many nice places of business in itthat he left the street at the next corner  at nine oclock he found himself in the vicinity of the brooklyn bridge here he came across a cheap but neatlooking hotel he entered and engaged a room for himself alone on the top floor for fifty cents and soon after retired and slept soundly until morning  the boy was on the streets again long before the time appointed for his next call at horace kelseys offices having nothing to do he mounted to the bridge and took a walk across to brooklyn and return this gave him a splendid view of both cities and afforded him a means of enjoyment until it was time to make the call  he had brushed himself up to the last degree and invested in another shine for his shoes and a clean collar and tie so now even if his clothing was rather worn and torn in one or two places he nevertheless looked quite respectable  he is in said the clerk when ralph entered the offices and the next moment horace kelsey came forward and shook him by the hand  this is an unexpected pleasure said the insurance agent step into my private office and he led the way showed ralph to a seat and closed the door my clerk told me of your calling yesterday  this is a totally unexpected trip mr kelsey returned ralph by way of apologizing for his appearance when i started i had no idea i would end up in new york  indeed and the gentleman looked his curiosity  ive got rather a long story to tell went on ralph  yes then let me hear it at once i will be at leisure for the next hour  it was rather awkward for ralph to start but it was not long before he was deep in the recital of his adventures and the great wrong that had been done to him horace kelsey listened with scarcely a word of comment until he finished  well ralph if i did not know you to be an honest boy i would not believe it he exclaimed at last  i can hardly believe it myself mr kelsey why did those two men attack me  it is a great mystery had you not met them after the fall over the bluff i would be inclined to say that that fall must have been accidental but as it is it was premeditated beyond a doubt and you are certain that you never met the men before  i am  they could not have been the ones that robbed the post office and got angry because you put the authorities on their track  no sir i dont believe they had anything to do with that affair  it couldnt be that percy paget set them up to it  i dont believe he would go as far as thatnot when our quarrel was no worse than it was  i believe you there yet there must be some reason insisted horace kelsey men do not attempt to take life for the mere fun of it  i believe you there sir  the thing iswhat could they profit by if you were out of the way  i dont know  could they claim that property the papers of which are missing  no sir the property belongs to my motherat least i think it does  your father might have willed it to you  in that case my mother would have told me of it  you should have gone back to westville at once and made a search your mother will be worried over your absence  i have already written to her telling her all i dont see the use of going back just now those men have most likely skipped out  that is true  and now i had come to new york i thought i would take a look around before i went back i may not get the chance again besides i only had a job on the lakes running the pleasure sloop and i would like to strike something better if its to be had  i see horace kelsey smiled well i promised to do what i could and i wont disappoint you i will give you employment here in my office unless you can strike something better  thank you i would prefer to work for you  i need another clerk for a new line of work and i fancy you would just suit but you would have to remain in new york how would your mother like that  she would miss me sir but if the job paid i could send for her to come on and rent the place in westville  then you can consider yourself engaged whenever you are ready to come to work and by the way horace kelsey went on hurriedly as there came a knock on the door there is a gentleman i must see on business come in at one oclock again will you  yes sir replied ralph and not to detain the gentleman longer he bowed himself out well pleased over the sudden turn his fortunes had taken  could the boy have seen what was at that time occurring at westville he would not have been so contented but would instead have taken the first train homeward     chapter xxxiii  squire pagets move   let us leave ralph for a short time and go back to westville and see what was occurring at that place during his absence of course when the boy did not return in the evening from his trip up big silver lake mrs nelson was much worried over his absence she took supper alone after waiting until eight oclock for him to make his appearance and then took a walk down to the bridge where her son was in the habit of tying up  have you seen anything of ralph she asked of dan pickley who sat in the office counting his tolls for the day  no he returned shortly and went on with his counting  not wishing to disturb him the widow said no more she strained her eyes to see through the gathering darkness but not a boat that could be the right one appeared in sight  after waiting nearly an hour she returned to the cottage she sat up until twelve oclock watching and waiting and went to bed  if something had happened they would let me know she said to herself he must have taken out some party and been detained he will surely come back by tomorrow noon  but the morrow came and the morning passed slowly by without any one coming near the distressed woman  after dinner she could bear the suspense no longer dressing up and putting on her bonnet she started out to walk to glen arbor  on the way she met one of the neighbors who was driving and offered her a seat in his wagon she accepted the offer gladly for she was not accustomed to walking a long distance  it aint often you go to glen arbor i reckon said the neighbor a farmer named wilkins  no she replied i am going to see what has become of ralph  ralph whats the matter with him run away  i hope not mr wilkins but he did not return last night from a trip on the lake and i am worried  maybe he couldnt get back because he went too far and the wind died out  there was a good breeze all night  thats so widow well i hope you find ralph all right  so do i returned mrs nelson  she knew very well where bill franchards boathouse was and after leaving mr wilkins walked hither quickly luckily she found franchard on shore mending one of his boats  where is ralph mr franchard she asked hurriedly  thats just what id like to know mrs nelson replied the boatman he aint showed up since he went off yesterday morning  did you expect him to stay out so long  no i didnt i was looking for him in last evening  who did he take out  two gentlemen i believe he made the engagement himself i dont know who they were  have you any idea where he can be  they sailed up the lake so jack harper says maybe they might be puttin in the time around the islands sometimes these sportsmen dont care to come home at dark but want the fun of camping out over night  this last remark afforded mrs nelson some relief if the supposition was correct ralph might be perfectly safe  i hope he comes back soon she said would you mind if i stay around the boathouse for a while  why no mrs nelson make yourself at home returned franchard heartily we aint got very good accommodations here but such as they are you are welcome to  the widow sat down and watched the boatman mending his craft thus an hour passed then came a hail from the water  ahoy there franchard  the boatman looked up and saw a young fellow in a rowboat  hullo evans he called back  say one of your boats is ashore over to macks meadow went on the youth in the rowboat  one of my boats which one  the minnie i saw her as i came past and i thought id tell you about her she isnt tied up there  my gracious what can it mean cried mrs nelson that was the boat ralph had wasnt it  it was returned franchard jump in this rowboat mrs nelson and well go over to the meadow and take a look at the boat  he ran for a pair of oars and soon the two were on the water macks meadow was less than half a mile away and franchard who was an expert rower soon pulled the boat to it  there is the minnie sure enough he exclaimed as they rounded a little point  and he pointed to where the sloop lay halfhidden in the water and high meadow grass  isis any one on board asked mrs nelson in a trembling tone  not a soul  oh mr franchard what do you suppose has happened she burst out  i cant say maam wait till i go on board and take a look around  franchard was soon on the sloop everything appeared to be in order although there were the marks of muddy feet on the flooring and on the seats martin and toglet had taken good care that no clew that should lead to their identity should be left behind  do you see anything belonging to ralph asked mrs nelson  not a thing  do you suppose he left the boat here  the boatman shook his head slowly  i wish i could say yes mrs nelson he said but i dont think so its all wet around here and there would be no sense in it when there are so many dry landing places nearby most likely he landed somewhere else and the boat drifted away from him  the widow gave a start  oh might they not have landed on one of the islands and the sloop got away from them she cried  by creation that may be it ejaculated bill franchard i never thought of it before  i wish we could find out im greatly worried something tells me that ralph is not safethat something has happened to him  ill tell you what ill do mrs nelson ill take the ariel and sail up to the islands and take a look around  will you go this afternoon  if you wish it yes  i do very much  then i wont waste another minute maybe you would like to go along  i would returned mrs nelson impelled by a fear she could not banish  franchard lost no time in towing the sloop back to the boathouse ten minutes later he and the widow were sailing up the lake as fast as the wind would carry them  it was well on toward evening when the islands were reached  ill give them a call if they are anywhere about said franchard and he yelled many times at the top of his lungs  no reply came back and after sailing around for some time they came to anchor beside three top island  if they landed anywhere they landed here said the boatman so as long as we are in the vicinity we may as well take a look around  as luck would have it they had reached shore close to the bottom of the cliff as they leaped on the rocks mrs nelson gave a start  what is it cried her companion quickly  oh mr franchard look screamed the poor woman it is ralphs fishing towel and it has blood upon it  and as she spoke she held up the object  you are sure it is his  i am positive oh i am sure something dreadful has happened  perhaps not mrs nelson let us hope for the best and search further  mrs nelson heaved a long sigh her heart was heavy within her breast  the two searched around until nightfall but nothing more was found  at last they returned to glen arbor and after another inquiry there for ralph the poor widow made her way back slowly to her home  she was all but prostrated and all that night paced the rooms watching and waiting in vain for her sons return  the news of ralphs disappearance spread and several parties went out to hunt for him strange to say one of the parties contained squire paget  the squire went up to the islands in a private boat of his own he remained there probably half an hour then he returned and called at the nelson cottage  it is too bad mrs nelson he said but i have i am afraid very bad news for you     chapter xxxiv  the squire in hot water   as the reader well knows there was no love lost between squire paget and the nelsons the squire had not treated ralph and his mother fairly and they were inclined to look upon him with considerable distrust  yet when the squire entered the cottage with the announcement that he had bad news to convey the widow forgot all the past and began to question him eagerly  you have bad news she faltered  i am sorry to say i have he returned in a hypocritical tone of sympathy  and what is it she went on her breast heaving violently  pray calm yourself madam  i cannot wait squire you have news of ralph the poor boy has beenhas been  she could get no further  his body has not yet been found mrs nelson  then he is dead she shrieked and fell forward in a swoon  fortunately a neighbor arrived just at this moment and this good woman aided by the squire soon revived the widow at the end of ten minutes she sat up in a chair her face as white as a sheet  tell metell me all she gasped out  there is not much to tell unfortunately returned the squire smoothly i was up to the islands in company with others and i found strong evidence that made me believe that ralph fell over the cliff  then he was killed burst out the neighbor  most likely mrs corcoran the cliff is more than a hundred feet high and the rocks below are sharp  but his bodywhat of that asked mrs corcoran for mrs nelson was unable to utter a word  his body must have been carried off by the current which sweeps around the island especially during such a breeze as we had recently  it must be true cried mrs nelson bursting into tears i found his fishing towel and that was covered with blood oh my poor ralph  she went off into a fit of weeping and in that state squire paget left her to the attention of mrs corcoran he had expected to go into the details of his search but evidently they were not now needed  i guess my plan will work all right he said to himself as he walked home rapidly its a pity i must hurry matters so but unless i do that valuable piece of property may slip through my fingers  not for one moment did the squires conscience trouble him for what he had done he thought only of the end to be gainedof the money he intended to make  of course he imagined that ralph was really dead he would have been furious had he known the real truth  but an awakening was close at hand it came on the following day when the squire was at the post office  he was standing in a corner looking over the various letters he had received when he heard henry bott the clerk address a few words to a laboring man who had come in to post a letter  kind of mysterious about ralph nelson remarked the man whose name was fielder  it is returned bott  any news of him yet  none excepting that he fell over the cliff on three top island and his body was washed away  the widow must feel bad about it  sure  i was going to stop at the cottage but i must get over to eastport  theres a letter just came in for mrs nelson from new york went on bott i suppose i might send it to her it might have some sort of news she might want to hear  at these words the squire became more attentive than ever who knew but what the letter might refer to the missing papers that the widow had advertised for  did you say you had a letter for mrs nelson he asked stepping to the window  yes  i am going down to the place ill take it to her if you wish  all right squire here it is returned bott and handed over the epistle  squire paget at once hurried from the building and in the direction of the nelson cottage but once beyond the village proper he turned into a bypath  here he stopped to examine the letter it was not sealed very tightly and by breathing upon the mucilage in the back he soon managed to get it open without tearing the envelope  it was ralphs letter to his mother and for the moment squire paget was so stunned that he was in danger of collapsing then and there he staggered to a stone and fell upon it  alive he muttered to himself alive and the rascals said he was dead  he read the letter carefully not once but several times he saw how martin and toglet had failed twice in their efforts to take ralph from his path forever  the scamps they knew he was alive when he boarded the empty freight car why did they not come back and tell me i suppose they expect to get that five hundred dollars out of me at chambersburgh just wait till i see them  squire paget did not know what to do with the letter if he destroyed it might not the widow hear of his having a letter for her and ask him for it  and yet if he gave her the letter that would be the end of the plot against herthe whole cake would be dough  already a new plan to get ralph out of the way was forming in his mind based on the fact that martin and toglet had really tried to do as agreed perhaps they would make another trial if urged on  ill fix this letter business he said  among his own mail had been a circular from a new york drygoods house calling attention to a big midsummer bargain sale and soliciting orders from outoftown patrons this circular the squire now thrust into the envelope which had contained ralphs letter to make the deception more complete the squire drew out his stylographic pen and went over the address altering the handwriting quite a little so that it might not be recognized  then stowing away the genuine letter among his own he walked on to the nelson cottage where he left the bogus letter with mrs corcoran who came to the door  i thought i would bring it along as it might have news he said  mrs nelson was handed the letter she gave it a hasty examination and finding to her great disappointment that it was merely an advertisement she threw it aside and thus her sons communication upon which so much depended never reached her  the squire found out that nothing could be done to further his plan just then so far as the widow was concerned so leaving the cottage he took the evening boat for chambersburgh  he knew exactly where to look for martin and toglet who had come down from an upper lake town by railroad it was in a fashionable clubhouse with a saloon attached at which many of the sports of the city congregated  he saw martin sitting at a table playing some game of chance and at once motioned him to come out  what is it asked martin but his face showed that he was much disturbed  you know well enough returned the squire sharply ralph nelson is alive and well  never cried martin in some surprise  it is so and you know it went on the squire coldly  why he went over the cliff  and escaped  escaped  yes and you know he did for you met after that in the woods  it is false  no it isnt mr martin he was too smart for you and he got away  is he in westville questioned martin anxiously  no he is in new york  when is he coming home  never if i can prevent it returned squire paget earnestly he wrote to his mother but i got the letter she does not even know he is alive  and he is in new york said martin looking suggestively at the squire  he is martin  i might go down there  that is what i thought  i can go alone toglet is too chickenhearted for this business i know he wishes he was out of it if he hadnt been in it from the start there would have been no failure  then go alone but lose no time for he may write more letters and one of them may slip through my hands now he has disappeared i do not wish him to be heard of again  but he has a friend in new york  i dont care for that i do not wish his mother to hear from him that is the whole point  all right squire give me time to get to the city and shell never hear of her boy again there will be no failure this time  the two talked the matter over for half an hour longer and arranged all of their plans then martin took the first train for the metropolis and squire paget the last boat for westville     chapter xxxv  ralph a prisoner   at the appointed time ralph called again upon horace kelsey and was given instructions in regard to the work he would be called on to do  but you had better not start in until you hear from your mother said the insurance agent she may wish you to pay a visit home before you settle down here  ralph thought this good advice and he resolved to act upon it  i ought to get a letter by tomorrow noon or night he said and i will wait that long if i dont get word ill take the trip home anyway seeing as you say you will be kind enough to wait for me  kelsey then asked him what he intended to do while waiting and learning ralph had nothing in particular in view he advised the boy to get a guidebook of the city and walk about so that he might become familiar with the streets  the work i have for you will take you out more or less he said and it is a great help if you understand how to get around  at a nearby booksellers ralph purchased a guidebook for twentyfive cents he studied it off and on the entire afternoon walking around in the meantime before he retired that night at the hotel he had taken in the city from fourteenth street down to the battery  its awful big and crooked he thought but i guess ill manage to get around especially if i keep the guidebook on hand for reference  his first duty in the morning even before he had breakfast was to go to the post office of course he found no letter there for him he inquired at the information office about the westville mail and ascertained that the next pouch from that place would be ready for delivery about three oclock in the afternoon  ill wait for that he thought and then if there is no word ill take the first train home  to tell the truth ralph was growing anxious the more he thought over the matter the more he became convinced that he had done wrong in not returning home at once he was willing to admit that the sight of the great metropolis had proven too much for his better judgment  when ralph left the post office building he did not know that he was being followed yet such was a fact martin who had got into the city but a short while before had been watching for him knowing that he would most likely call for mail the man slunk out of sight when ralph appeared and when he went out dogged him through the crowd like a shadow  ralph returned from the post office across park row and from there made his way toward the east side as the great tenement district of new york is termed he had not been through this section very much and thought to make a tour along the east river  martin followed him for a distance of eight or ten blocks just as ralph was about to go past a coal yard he tapped the boy on the shoulder  ralph turned quickly and was almost dumbfounded to see who it was that had accosted him  what you he exclaimed  then i am really right cried martin reaching forth and grasping his hand thank heaven that you are safe  why i dont understand stammered ralph  he could not comprehend the others manner  i was afraid you had been killed on the cars went on martin i am very glad to see that you escaped  indeed i thought you wished me dead said ralph coldly  dead no indeed my young friend  but you pushed me over the cliff on the island  that was accidental i assure you  perhaps our meeting in the woods was accidental too and the boy could not help sneering  it was all because i took charge of my poor friend toglet said martin with an anxious look in his face that poor poor fellow has caused me no end of trouble  how  well i presume i will have to make a clean breast of it toglet is more or less insane his folks do not care to place him in an asylum and so i offered to take care of him for a while it was his sudden fit of insanity that caused all of the trouble  what made you point your gun at me in the woods asked ralph who could not help but doubt martins story  i wanted you to stop so that i might have a chance to explain i was afraid you would return home and have us arrested  after you pushed me over the cliff why didnt you try to find out whether i was dead or alive  please dont say i pushed you over it was toglet and directly after you disappeared he turned on me and i had all i could do to keep him at bay  you dont look as if you had a very tough time with him remarked ralph bluntly  luckily i am a strong man and i soon overpowered him but he then got a strange fit and i knew i must get him to a doctor at once so i took the boat and left the island if i had thought that you were still alive you may rest assured i would not have left you behind  ralph hardly knew what to say he did not believe that martin was telling the truth plausible as the villain tried to make his story appear  you took him to a doctors he asked  i did then he got away and disappeared in the woods i had just found him when i saw you that is the whole story why my young friend what reason would i have for pushing you over the cliff  i dont know returned ralph that is something i have been trying to find out  i had none in the world i never saw nor heard of you previous to hiring your boat and i might have hired anybody in glen arbor for that matter  how is it you are in new york now questioned ralph suddenly  i brought toglet home to his folks  does he belong here  yes he lives but a few blocks from here i will tell you what we had better do we had better go to his home and you can interview his folks and make sure that i have told you the truth about him perhaps he will even confess if he is in a proper state of mind to do so  ralph hesitated martin spoke with so much apparent candor that he was half inclined to believe the mans story concerning toglets mental condition besides as martin had said what reason could there have been for such an attack if it was not that of a madman  come on if only to please me urged martin you will find toglets mother a very nice old lady and you will certainly believe her even if you will not believe me  you say it is but a few blocks  not more than four come i will show you the way  martin linked his arm in that of ralph and together they proceeded down the street  presently they came in sight of a large tenement house although ralph being a country boy did not recognize it as such  here we are said martin mrs toglet lives on the upper floor  he led the way into the hallway and up the somewhat narrow and dirty stairs  they passed up two flights and then reached a floor which was not occupied martin threw a quick glance around and entered an empty room the door of which stood open  they are getting ready to move uptown he said this neighborhood is no longer nice enough for them  ralph followed him into the room hardly had he done so when martin slammed the door shut and sprang upon him  ralph was taken so off his guard that he went flat on his back his head struck a block of wood that lay near and for the moment he was dazed before he could recover martin had his hands bound with a strap he took from his pocket  make a sound and ill choke you he cried in a warning tone  then he struggled to fix a gag in ralphs mouth a fierce fight ensued but finally the rascal was successful then he bound ralphs legs  the poor boy was a prisoner at last     chapter xxxvi  mickety to the rescue   that was easier done than i anticipated muttered martin grimly as he gazed down at his young prisoner now what is best to do its good i remembered these rooms were empty  he walked about the bare apartment and then paused to listen  all was silent save for the rattle of the wagons and the shrill cries of the playing children in the street below  humph i thought i heard a footstep he went on i must be getting nervous  he left the apartment and was gone several minutes when he came back he raised ralph in his strong arms as if the boy were a small child  now i am going to lock you in a closet for a few hours he said harshly dont you dare to attempt an escape or it will be the worse for you mind that  he walked with his burden to a rear room here was situated in one corner a large kitchen pantry now bare of even the shelving  into the pantry ralph was thrust in a sitting position then the door was closed and bolted on him presently he heard martin leave the room and hurry downstairs  the poor boy was dazed and bewildered by the rough treatment he had received for some time he sat where he had been placed not daring to move for fear his tormentor would come back and finish his evil work  there is something behind it all he thought dismally martin is doing this for some purpose what can that purpose be  ralph did not brood over the mystery long as the minutes passed slowly by and martin did not come back the youth began to speculate on the chances of escape  if i could only get free of these cords i might burst open the door he thought let me see what i can do  ralph struggled manfully but it availed him but little he was no great contortionist and his efforts resulted only in a painful laceration of his wrists and ankles martin had done his work well and the bonds could not be severed without outside aid  five minutes more went byto poor ralph they seemed an age then the boy fancied he heard a light footstep without  hullo where are yer came in a clear but subdued voice which ralph was sure he had heard before  the cry was repeated several times in the meanwhile ralph changed his position and began to kick upon the door  in the kitchen closet dats where he is exclaimed the voice and the patter of bare feet came toward ralphs prison  a second later the bolt on the door was shot back a flood of light came into the place and ralph beheld the face and form of the bootblack he had become acquainted with at the entrance to the post office  i tought so exclaimed the bootblack say hes a corker ter treat yer dis way aint he  then he saw how ralph was gagged and bound and he gave a low whistle of surprise  gee whats dis highway robbery he cried  in a trice he had out his pocketknife and with it he cut ralphs bonds ralph himself removed the gag  thank you mickety he ejaculated as he sprang to his feet you are the friend in need  i seen him leadin yer up here an i tought it was mighty queer said the bootblack wots de game  i am as much in the dark as you mickety that man has tried twice before to take my life  gee yer dont say  it is true  maybe he wants ter git a fortune away from yer like der villain in der play  there is no fortune to get awayat least none that i ever heard of but where has he gone  he went down der street i watched him around der corner before i came up so as ter make sure i wouldnt be collared  we had best get out of here before he comes back went on ralph after a moments thought i do not wish to meet him again and he shuddered  all right come on  what brought you here  i live across der street an i just come home fer me grub i kin take yer ter our rooms if yer want ter come  i will tell you what i would like to do mickety i would like to stay here until he comes back and then follow him  gee dats der ticket come on right over  the bootblack led the way across the dirty and crowded street and into an alleyway  me home is back dere he said pointing to a rear tenement i dont suppose yer want ter come in if yer goin ter watch fer dat man  no i will stay here returned ralph  ill git a bit of grub an den come out agin said mickety  he ran off leaving ralph alone the crowd of street children looked at the country boy but they had seen him talking to mickety with whom they were well acquainted and they did not offer to ask ralph any questions or tease him as they might an utter stranger  in less than a quarter of an hour the bootblack was back munching the last of a big doughnut  aint come yet  not yet mickety  kin i stay an help yer watch fer him  if you wish certainly  he may try to do yer agin an i kin call a cop  that is so yes stay with me and i will pay you for your trouble  huh dont want no pay mr  yer didnt tell me yer name  ralph nelson  i aint askin fer no pay mr nelson dis sort of a job is nuthin but fun  you may be of valuable assistance to me went on ralph i may have that man arrested you can prove that he bound and gagged me and locked me up in the closet  dats so  i want to find out what his object is he may  ralph broke off short and pointed across the street  dats him true enough whispered mickety as martin entered the tenement opposite wot yer goin ter do now  wait till he comes out  this did not consume much time in less than three minutes after he had entered the building martin came running out he looked greatly disturbed and hurried down the street as fast as his long legs would carry him  dere he goes exclaimed mickety in illsuppressed excitement  come on returned ralph he must not get out of our sight  he started off with the bootblack at his side he looked at mickety and saw that the little fellows head was about the size of his own and that he wore a largebrimmed soft hat  let us trade hats for a while mickety i can pull that down over my face  the exchange was quickly effected with the soft hat bent down ralph knew he would stand a much greater chance of escaping detection at the hands of martin than before  on went the man and his followers for fully a dozen blocks then martin turned into a very respectable side street and ascending the stone steps of a large brick mansion rang the bell  a man came to the door and let him in then the door was tightly closed once more  dats de end of dis case muttered mickety in a disappointed tone  not a bit of it mickety returned ralph see if you can hunt up a policeman in the meantime i will watch the house so that this man does not get away     chapter xxxvii  martin is trapped   mickety at once went off to do as ralph had requested he was rather doubtful about a policeman listening to his tale but he resolved to do his best  in the meantime ralph inspected the house and wondered what sort of place it was and what had brought martin there his inspection ended in disappointment for nothing came to light  presently however a young girl came out of the basement of the house with a pitcher in her hand she was evidently a servant girl a milkman drove up and from him she purchased a quart of milk  before she could return to the house ralph touched her on the arm  excuse me but i believe you live in that house he said pleasantly  i works there sur said the girl in a strong irish accent  will you kindly tell me who lives there  mr martin thomas sur  ralph stared at this bit of information martin thomas and the man he was after were most likely the same individual  did he just come in  yis sur  he lives there alone does he  oh no sur theres another family occupying the house but they are away for the summer sur  oh i see thank you  did you wish to see mr thomas sur  is he busy  he said he was going away sur hes at work packing up some things i believe  then i wont bother him it isnt likely that he would want to buy a new history of the united states is it  indeed not cried the girl in deep disgust  she at once took ralph for a book agent a set of men she thoroughly despised  i wont bother him said ralph and walked away while the girl hurried back into the basement  so he is going away thought ralph i must see to it that he does not get very far  he took up his position behind the stone steps of a house nearby so that looking from the windows of his own residence martin might not see him  while he was waiting ralph looked up and down the street for the bootblack but mickety had disappeared  he wont leave me in the lurch i feel certain of that said ralph to himself yet i would feel easier if there was a policeman in sight  five minutes more went by and then the front door of the house opened and martin came out  he was elegantly dressed and wore a silk hat in one hand he carried a large leather valise  he looked up and down anxiously and then ran down the steps to the pavement  he started to walk down the block and ralph allowed him to get a hundred feet or more from the house  then he stepped out and confronted the man  well mr martin thomas we meet again he said coolly  martin thomas for that was really the mans name was thunderstruck  whater he stammered  i say we meet again repeated ralph i guess you did not expect to see me quite so soon  confound the luck muttered the man biting his lips nervously  you did not expect me to obtain my freedom as quickly as i did  how did you get out muttered the man savagely  a friend came to my assistance  a friend repeated martin thomas with a start  yes a friend  who  perhaps you can guess went on ralph who wished to prolong the conversation as much as possible  i cannot  make a guess  somebody from glen arbor  no  a city friend perhaps  exactly  well what are you going to do now  rather let me ask you what you are going to do returned ralph warmly  he was much relieved just then to see mickety across the way with a policeman beside him  i  exactly you tried your best to get me out of the way went on ralph in rather a loud voice and now you have failed i want to know what your next move is going to be  hush not so loud cried martin thomas in alarm never mind what i am going to do  will you tell me why you tried to take my life  hang it boy dont talk so loud  then tell me your object  i wont  you will have to  whats that boy  i say you will have to  nonsense get out of my way i am in a hurry  martin thomas tried to brush past ralph but the boy caught him by the arm  let go of me boy unless you want me to do something desperate you escaped me three times but  martin thomas broke off short and his face turned a sickly green he had just caught sight of the policeman and mickety who were dodging behind him  whyer he began  dats der feller officer cried out mickety didnt yer hear wot he said  i did replied the policeman  arrest this man officer put in ralph and be careful for he is a desperate criminal  this is an outrage cried martin thomas but he was too overcome to put any courage in his words  i will make a complaint against the man said ralph calmly this boy will be a witness for me and i can get other witnesses against him if it be necessary  thats all i want said the policeman you just come with me he went on to martin thomas  the rascal begged pleaded and threatened but all to no purpose the policeman held him on one side while ralph ranged up on the other and mickety marched behind in this order they soon reached the stationhouse  here ralph told his whole story and mickety related what he knew of the affair then the country boy sent a special messenger to horace kelsey  the arrival of the rich insurance agent helped ralphs case considerably martin thomas was locked up in default of a thousand dollars bail pending trial for atrocious assault     chapter xxxviii  beginning of the end   it would be a great thing if you could get this martin thomas to confess his secret remarked horace kelsey to ralph after the hearing was over  that is true returned the boy but i dont see how i am going to do it he is very stubborn  he wont be stubborn long he knows the charge against him is too grave you might intimate to him that it will go easier with him if he confesses  that is true sir  if he is merely a tool it is nothing to you whether he is punished or not you wish to bring the instigator of this plot against you to justice  supposing i go in and have a talk with him then suggested ralph  we will both go in returned horace kelsey  half an hour later they were closeted with martin thomas in a side room of the police station they told the rascal of the object of their visit  at first martin thomas would not listen to them but when horace kelsey pictured the possible future to him he grew more pliable he began to pace up and down nervously  well supposing i own up to everything he said at last will you drop this case against me  that depends on what you have to say said ralph cautiously  well i can say this much i was only hired for this worki and toglet  who by  squire paget of westville  had a bombshell exploded at ralphs feet he would have been no more astonished than at this declaration  do you mean to say squire paget hired you for this work he demanded  yes i do the whole scheme was his  but what was his object  he wanted to get you out of the way  but why  he didnt tell me why but i reckon it was on account of some valuable westville property  it must be the property down by the lake front cried ralph  had he the papers for that land asked horace kelsey  i never thought so returned the boy slowly but he might have he used to transact most of fathers business for him years ago  then you can depend upon it that he has the papers  but the land belongs to my mother  hes going to force her into selling out to him put in martin thomas with you out of the way he felt sure i suppose that he could do as he pleased with your mother  the scamp ejaculated ralph his honest eyes flashing fire if you have told the truth he shall suffer for this mark my words  and hoping you will drop this matter against me went on the prisoner let me give you another pointer you wrote to your mother the other day didnt you  yes  well he got that letter your mother never saw it  no wonder i havent received any reply then burst out ralph did you ever hear of anything so mean he added turning to his rich friend  your duty at present is plain ralph replied the insurance agent pointedly the best you can do is to take the first train home  you are right  there is no telling if this squire paget is so villainous what he may not try to do  you think he will not wait  it is not likely he has shown a great haste in the whole matter  no dont wait go home and have him locked up put in martin thomas i will appear against him if you wish it  he was willing now to do anything to save himself from a long term in prison  i will go home said ralph i will not lose another minute  shall i go along asked horace kelsey you may need some one to help you in your fight against so influential a man as squire paget  i shall consider it a great favor said ralph and he gave the insurance agent a grateful look  they consulted a timetable and found that they could get a train for chambersburgh in an hour this train would connect with the regular lake steamer that stopped at westville  the two questioned martin thomas for a few minutes longer and got what additional information they could from him then they called in the jail keeper and hurried off  i guess squire paget will be surprised when we walk in on him said ralph with a grim smile  he will be still more surprised when he learns that martin thomas has been arrested and that his whole plot is known replied horace kelsey  the insurance agent had several small matters to attend to but these did not take long and then they took an elevated train for the depot  fifteen minutes later ralphs homeward journey had begun it was none too soon as the sequel will show     chapter xxxix  a surprise at chambersburgh   i believe that one reason why squire paget wished to get me out of the situation on the bridge was because he hoped thereby to force me to leave westville altogether remarked ralph as the train sped on its way  perhaps you are right returned horace kelsey one thing is certain he was decidedly anxious to get you out of the way otherwise he would not have hired this martin thomas a second time  i never thought it of squire paget murmured ralph thoughtfully why it is simply horrible  there is no telling to what depths a man will sink for the sake of money returned the insurance agent here in the city we see it more than in the country  i thought percy paget bad enough but he cant be a patch to his father  you must be careful how you go ahead ralph squire paget may deny the whole statement made by martin thomas and then you will have some trouble to prove anything against him  i know that  the best thing you can do is to call on your mother first  i intend to do that i am much worried since i know she has not received my letter  she may have news to tell who knows but what the squire has approached her about this property question already  i shall look to you for advice before i make an important movement said ralph  it was growing dark and soon it became time to go to bed on the train horace kelsey had procured berths and both retired but to tell the truth ralph did not sleep a wink all night  he could not help but think of all that had happened and speculate as to what the future held in store never once did he dream of the many surprises so close at hand  ralph was up before any one else among the passengers it was a good hour before horace kelsey followed  anxious i suppose smiled the insurance agent well i dont blame you  there is so much at stake rejoined ralph i feel as if a fuse had been lighted and i was just waiting for something to explode  and something will explode ere long i imagine laughed horace kelsey  it was a little after eight oclock when the train rolled into chambersburgh and they alighted both knew the place fairly well and started at once for the steamboat landing  just as they turned a corner of the street they came face to face with three police officers who were escorting two men and a boy to the stationhouse the men were dock brady and another the boy was percy paget  look cried ralph what can this mean  i dont know them returned horace kelsey  why that is percy paget  is it possible  and one of those men is dock brady the man who is supposed to have robbed the westville post office  really that is interesting  ill bet a fortune they are the three that did that job burst out ralph excitedly there were two men and a boy and this crowd is the same  ask one of the officers suggested horace kelsey or stop i will do so  he stepped up to the little crowd which had come to a halt at a corner and tapped one of the policemen on the arm  i wish to ask you a few private questions about your prisoners he said in a low tone  ask him returned the officer and he pointed to a quietlooking man in black a few steps away  horace kelsey at once stepped up to the person indicated ralph beside him  we are interested in these prisoners he said will you tell me why they have been arrested  i am not at liberty to say much just now began the man in black  are they not the westville post office robbers questioned horace eagerly  ah what do you know of that case and the quietlooking man became interested at once  ralph told him what he knew in a few brief wellchosen words the man smiled  you have hit it on the head he said they are the guilty parties i am a post office detective and have just run them down  and is percy paget as guilty as the rest  he was drawn into the scheme by this brady who is a very smart fellow brady also drew in the other man who was formerly a horse dealer in this city  and did you obtain the money and packages that were stolen asked horace kelsey  we recovered nearly everything by the way went on the detective did you say your name was ralph nelson  yes sir  i overheard this percy paget say how he had put a valise in your yard in order to throw suspicion on you i knew of that valise being found you are now cleared on that point  i am glad of it replied ralph heartily  there is something else which may interest you i do not quite understand it because this paget boy is one of the robbers among the registered letters which dock brady held was one sent by squire paget to some friend in new york this contained several important papers relating to some property in westville belonging to a mrs martha nelson widow of the late randolph nelson  my mother shouted ralph hurrah the missing papers have been found  dock brady was evidently holding them to obtain money from the squire on them went on the man in black what shall we do with them under the law they ought to be forwarded to the party in new york  keep them until matters can be straightened out said horace kelsey coming to ralphs rescue listen and i will tell you where we are going and what my young friend intends to do     chapter xl  the exposureconclusion   let us again shift the scene to westville and for the last time  mrs nelson had recovered from the first effects of her severe shock attending the announcement that her son was dead but she was still very weak and sick  poor ralph poor ralph she murmured over and over again as she sat by the kitchen window while kindhearted mrs corcoran moved about doing the simple household duties oh mrs corcoran it cannot be possible can it  there there try to think of something else thats a good dear returned the neighbor sympathetically it wont do any good to brood over the matter  but ralph was my only child and his father gone too and mrs nelson heaved a deep sigh while the tears streamed down her cheeks anew  the widows sorrow was deep and up to now she had not allowed herself to think of aught else she was alone in the world so she thought and did not care how the future shaped itself  presently there was a knock on the door and mrs corcoran opened it to admit squire paget the head man of the village wore a look of hypocritical sympathy upon his sharp features  i was just going over the bridge to eastport he explained and thought i would drop in for a neighborly chat  even in this simple statement he could not put a grain of truth he had made a special trip to the cottage and had come solely for his own selfish ends  mrs corcoran bid him welcome and offered him a chair  i trust you do not let your sorrow rest too deeply upon you widow he went on to mrs nelson we all have our trials in this world and he gave a grunt that was meant for a deep sigh  how can i help it squire she replied ralph was all the world to me  so was my late wife widow and yet i had to give her up and again he gave a gruntlike sigh  this statement did not affect mrs nelson greatly she knew that it was a fact that the squire and his late wife had quarreled continually and that many had said he had not cared at all when death had relieved him of her companionship  i was wondering what you intended to do went on the squire after an awkward pause do you intend to stay here  i do not know yet squire  i should think you would want to change your surroundings does not everything in this cottage remind you of your late husband and late son  indeed it does cried mrs nelson sometimes i cannot bear it  if i were you i would sell out and go elsewhere suggested the squire coming around to the subject that was on his mind perhaps a little trip somewhere would do you a world of good  it would do her good put in simpleminded mrs corcoran who believed the squire sincere  i cannot afford a trip sighed mrs nelson besidesiisometimes think that ralph may come back she faltered  never in this life widow returned the squire solemnly alas the dead never return no matter how much we love them  sometimes they do squire paget cried a young voice from the open doorway and ralph sprang into the room mother  ralph my son screamed mrs nelson thank heaven for its many mercies  and she thew herself into ralphs arms while the tears of sorrow were quickly turned to tears of joy  squire paget was dumbfounded he stared at ralph as if the boy was an apparition  is it really you ralph he stammered at last  sure an it is heaven bless him put in mrs corcoran  and where have you been ralph cried mrs nelson when she could again speak  i have been in new york you would have heard from me before had not that villain stolen the letter i sent  villain ralph  yes villain mother squire paget is the blackesthearted wretch in westville  whats this and to me ejaculated the squire  yes to you squire paget you mean contemptible coward returned the boy boldly look at him mother and see him quail while i tell you of all he has done  i have done nothing faltered the squire but he looked as if he wished to sink through the floor  he hired two men to throw me over the cliff on tree top island and when they failed he got one of the men to follow me to new york and try to put me out of existence there  oh ralph i cannot believe it  it is all true mother here is mr kelsey and he will tell you the same  this is preposterous began the squire faintly but ralph cut him short  it is all true the man who followed me to new york was martin thomas he is now in jail and has confessed all  the squire tottered as if struck a blow he tried to speak but the words would not come  and do you know why he did it went on ralph he had the missing papers and wished to get hold of our property here but the missing papers we have found  found  the squire managed to gasp out the single word  yes found they were in a registered letter sent by squire paget to some friend in new york they were stolen by the post office thieves who are now in custody and by the way squire shall i tell you who the thieves were dock brady a man named cassidy and a boy named percy paget  it was a final and telling blow the squire fell back pale and trembling ralph faced him dauntlessly while the others stood around holding their breath  squire paget could not answer he wanted to speak but not a word would his tongue utter he looked about for his silk hat and finding it dashed out of the house as if a legion of demons were after him  we will pass over the immediate scenes that followed mrs nelson could not let ralph leave her side for the rest of the day and horace kelsey undertook to follow the squire and bring him to terms  but the exposure had been too much for squire paget he disappeared that night leaving his business affairs just as they were it was not until a year afterward that he was heard from as living in an obscure state in a little town in canada  on the strength of his confession ralph did not appear against martin thomas and the man got off with a very light sentence toglet took time by the forelock and fled to the southwest  the post office robbers were all heavily punished although percy paget on account of his years received a lighter sentence than his older companions  it was not long before the papers which had been missing were turned over to mrs nelson under ralphs advice the entire question of property was placed in horace kelseys charge  the insurance agent was not long in finding out what squire paget had intended to do with the land along the lake front part of it was to be turned over to a syndicate for a factory site and the balance was to be cut up and sold as town lots the plan was carried out later on for mrs nelsons benefit and the sum of seventy thousand dollars was eventually realized out of the transaction  of course this made the widow and her son the richest people in the village ralph at once left off work and took up his studies and passed through yale college with high honors today he is the mayor of westville honored and loved by all who know him and here we will leave him  the end
