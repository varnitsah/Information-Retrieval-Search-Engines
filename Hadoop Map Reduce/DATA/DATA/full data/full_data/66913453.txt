66913453	discipline and other sermons     sermon idiscipline    preached at the volunteer camp wimbledon july 14 1867  numbers xxiv 9  he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion  who dare rouse him up  these were the words of the eastern sage as he looked down from the mountain height upon the camp of israel abiding among the groves of the lowland according to their tribes in order discipline and unity  before a people so organized he saw well none of the nations round could stand  israel would burst through them with the strength of the wild bull crashing through the forest  he would couch as a lion and as a great lion  who dare rouse him up  but such a people the wise balaam saw would not be mere conquerors like those savage hordes or plundering armies which have so often swept over the earth before and since leaving no trace behind save blood and ashes  israel would be not only a conqueror but a colonist and a civilizer  and as the sage looked down on that well ordered camp he seems to have forgotten for a moment that every man therein was a stern and practised warrior  how goodly he cries are thy tents oh jacob and thy camp oh israel  he likens them not to the locust swarm the sea flood nor the forest fire but to the most peaceful and most fruitful sights in nature or in art they are spread forth like the watercourses which carry verdure and fertility as they flow  they are planted like the hanging gardens beside his own river euphrates with their aromatic shrubs and wide spreading cedars  their godgiven mission may be stern but it will be beneficent  they will be terrible in war but they will be wealthy prosperous civilized and civilizing in peace  many of you must have seenall may seethat noble picture of israel in egypt which now hangs in the royal academy in which the hebrews harnessed like beasts of burden writhing under the whips of their taskmasters are dragging to its place some huge egyptian statue  compare the degradation portrayed in that picture with this prophecy of balaams and then considerwhat in less than two generations had so transformed those wretched slaves  compare too with balaams prophecy the hints of their moral degradation which scripture givesthe helplessness the hopelessness the cowardice the sensuality which cried let us alone that we may serve the egyptians  because there were no graves in egypt hast thou brought us forth to die in the wilderness whose highest wish on earth was to sit by the fleshpots of egypt where they did eat bread to the full  what had transformed that race into a lion whom none dare rouse up  plainly those forty years of freedom  but of freedom under a stern military education  of freedom chastened by discipline and organized by law  i say of freedom  no nation of those days we have reason to believe enjoyed a freedom comparable to that of the old jews  they were to use our modern phrase the only constitutional people of the east  the burdensomeness of moses law ere it was overlaid in later days by rabbinical scrupulosity has been much exaggerated in its simpler form in those early times it left every man free to do as we are expressly told that which was right in his own eyes in many most important matters  little seems to have been demanded of the jews save those simple ten commandments which we still hold to be necessary for all civilized society  and their obedience was after all a moral obedience the obedience of free hearts and wills  the law could threaten to slay them for wronging each other but they themselves had to enforce the law against themselves  they were always physically strong enough to defy it if they chose  they did not defy it because they believed in it and felt that in obedience and loyalty lay the salvation of themselves and of their race  it was not understand me the mere physical training of these forty years which had thus made them men indeed  whatever they may have gained by thatthe younger generation at leastof hardihood endurance and selfhelp was a small matter compared with the moral training which they had gaineda small matter compared with the habits of obedience selfrestraint selfsacrifice mutual trust and mutual help the inspiration of a common patriotism of a common national destiny  without that moral discipline they would have failed each other in need have broken up scattered or perished or at least remained as settlers or as slaves among the arab tribes with that moral discipline they held together and continued one people till the last till they couched they lay down as a lion and as a great lion and none dare rouse them up  you who are here todayi speak to those in uniformare the representatives of more than one great body of your countrymen who have determined to teach themselves something of that lesson which israel learnt in the wilderness not indeed by actual danger and actual need but by preparation for dangers and for needs which are only too possible as long as there is sin upon this earth  i believei have already seen enough to be surethat your labour and that of your comrades will not be in vain that you will be as you surely may be the better men for that discipline to which you have subjected yourselves  you must never forget that there are two sides a softer and a sterner side to the character of the good man that he the perfect christ who is the lion of judah taking vengeance in every age on all who wrong their fellow men is also the lamb of god who shed his own blood for those who rebelled against him  you must recollect that there are virtuesgraces we call them ratherwhich you may learn elsewhere better than in the camp or on the drilling ground graces of character more devout more pure more tender more humane yet necessary for the perfect man which you will learn rather in your own homes from the innocence of your own children from the counsels and examples of your mothers and your wives  but there are virtuesgraces we must call them toojust as necessary for the perfect man which your present training ought to foster as for most of you no other training can virtues which the old monk tried to teach by the stern education of the cloister which are still taught thank god by the stern education of our public schools which you and your comrades may learn by the best of all methods by teaching them to yourselves  for here and wherever military training goes on must be kept in check those sins of selfwill conceit selfindulgence which beset all free and prosperous men  here must be practised virtues which if not the very highest are yet virtues still and will be such to all eternity  for the moral discipline which goes to make a good soldier or a successful competitor on this groundthe selfrestraint the obedience the diligence the punctuality the patience the courtesy the forbearance the justice the temperancethese virtues needful for those who compete in a struggle in which the idler and the debauchee can take no share all these go equally toward the making of a good man  the germs of these virtues you must bring hither with you  and none can give them to you save the spirit of god the giver of all good but here you may have them i trust quickened into more active life strengthened into more settled habits to stand you in good stead in all places all circumstances all callings whether you shall go to serve your country and your family in trade or agriculture at home or whether you shall go forth as many of you will as soldiers colonists or merchants to carry english speech and english civilization to the ends of all the earth  for then if you learn to endure hardnessin plain english to exercise obedience and selfrestraintwill you be whether regulars or civilians alike the soldiers of christ able and willing to fight in that war of which he is the supreme commander and which will endure as long as there is darkness and misery upon the earth even the battle of the living god against the baser instincts of our nature against ignorance and folly against lawlessness and tyranny against brutality and sloth  those the deadly enemies of the human race you are all bound to attack if you be good men and true wheresoever you shall meet them invading the kingdom of your saviour and your god  but you can only conquer them in others in proportion as you have conquered them in yourselves  may god give you grace to conquer them in yourselves more and more to profit by the discipline which you may gain by this movement and bequeath it as a precious heirloom to your children hereafter  for so whether at home or abroad will you help to give your nation that moral strength without which physical strength is mere violent weakness and by the example and influence of your own discipline obedience and selfrestraint help to fulfil of your own nation the prophecy of the seer   he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion  who dare rouse him up    sermon iithe temple of wisdom    preached at wellington college all saints day 1866  proverbs ix 15  wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her table  she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the city whoso is simple let him turn in hither  and to him that wanteth understanding she saith to him come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled  this allegory has been a favourite one with many deep and lofty thinkers  they mixed it now and then with greek fancies and brought phoebus apollo and the muses into the temple of wisdom but whatever they added to the allegory they always preserved the allegory itself  no words they felt could so well express what wisdom was and how it was to be obtained by man  the stately temple built by mystic rules of art the glorious lady at once its architect its priestess and its queen the feast spread within for all who felt in themselves divine aspirations after what is beautiful and good and true the maidens fair and pure sent forth throughout the city among the millions intent only on selfish gain or selfish pleasure to call in all who were not content to be only a more crafty kind of animal that they might sit down at the feast among the noble company of gueststhose who have inclined their heart to wisdom and sought for understanding as for hid treasures this is a picture which sages and poets felt was true true for all men and for all lands  and it will be perhaps looked on as true once more as natural all but literally exact when we who are now men are in our graves and you who are now boys will be grown men in the days when the present soulless mechanical notion of the world and of men shall have died out and philosophers shall see once more that wisdom is no discovery of their own but the inspiration of the almighty and that this world is no dead and dark machine but alight with the glory and alive with the spirit of god  but what has this allegory however true to do with all saints day  my dear boys on all days wisdom calls you to her feast by many weighty arguments by many loving allurements by many awful threats but on this day of all the year she calls you by the memory of the example of those who sit already and for ever at her feast  by the memory and example of the wise of every age and every land she bids you enter in and feast with them on the wealth which she and they her faithful servants have prepared for you  they have laboured and they call you in their mistresss name to enter into their labours  she taught them wisdom and she calls on you to learn wisdom of them in turn  remember i say this day with humility and thankfulness of heart the wise who are gone home to their rest  there are many kinds of noble personages amid the blessed company of all saints whom i might bid you to remember this day  some of you are the sons of statesmen or lawyers  i might call on you to thank god for your fathers and for every man who has helped to make or execute wise laws  some of you are the sons of soldiers  i might call on you to thank god for your fathers and for all who have fought for duty and for their countrys right  some of you are the sons of clergymen  i might call on you to thank god for your fathers and for all who have preached the true god and jesus christ his onlybegotten son whether at home or abroad  all of you have mothers whether on earth or in heaven i might call on you to thank god for them and for every good and true woman who since the making of the world has raised the coarseness and tamed the fierceness of men into gentleness and reverence purity and chivalry  i might do this  but today i will ask you to remember speciallythe wise  for you are here as scholars you are here to learn wisdom you are here in what should be and i believe surely is one of the fore courts of that mystic temple into which wisdom calls us all  and therefore it is fit that you should this day remember the wise for they have laboured and you are entering into their labours  every lesson which you learn in school all knowledge which raises you above the savage or the profligate who is but a savage dressed in civilized garments has been made possible to you by the wise every doctrine of theology every maxim of morals every rule of grammar every process of mathematics every law of physical science every fact of history or of geography which you are taught here is a voice from beyond the tomb  either the knowledge itself or other knowledge which led to it is an heirloom to you from men whose bodies are now mouldering in the dust but whose spirits live for ever before god and whose works follow them going on generation after generation upon the path which they trod while they were upon earth the path of usefulness as lights to the steps of youth and ignorance  they are the salt of the earth which keeps the world of man from decaying back into barbarism  they are the children of light whom god has set for lights that cannot be hid  they are the aristocracy of god into which not many noble not many rich not many mighty are called  most of them were poor many all but unknown in their own time many died and saw no fruit of their labours some were persecuted some were slain even as christ the lord was slain as heretics innovators and corruptors of youth  of some the very names are forgotten  but though their names be dead their works live and grow and spread over ever fresh generations of youth showing them fresh steps toward that temple of wisdom which is the knowledge of things as they are the knowledge of those eternal laws by which god governs the heavens and the earth things temporal and eternal physical and spiritual seen and unseen from the rise and fall of mighty nations to the growth and death of the moss on yonder moors  they made their mistakes they had their sins for they were men of like passions with ourselves  but this they didthey cried after wisdom and lifted up their voice for understanding they sought for her as silver and searched for her as hid treasure  and not in vain  for them as to every earnest seeker after wisdom that heavenly lady showed herself and her exceeding beauty and gave gifts to each according to his earnestness his purity and his power of sight  to some she taught moral wisdomrighteousness and justice and equity yea every good path  to others she showed that political science whichas solomon tells youis but another side of her beauty and cannot be parted however men may try from moral wisdomthat wisdom in whose right hand is length of days and in her left hand riches and honour whose ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace  to others again she showed that physical science whichso solomon tells us againcannot be parted safely from the two others  for by the same wisdom he says which gives alike righteousness and equity riches and long lifeby that same wisdom and no other did the lord found the heavens and establish the earth by that same knowledge of his are the depths broken up and the clouds drop down the dew  and to some she showed herself as she did to good boethius in his dungeon in the deepest vale of misery and the hour of death when all seemed to have deserted them save wisdom and the god from whom she comes and bade them be of good cheer still and keep innocency and take heed to the thing that is right for that shall bring a man peace at the last  and they beheld her and loved her and obeyed her each according to his powers  and now they have their reward  and what is their reward  how can i tell dear boys  this at least can i say for scripture has said it already  that god is merciful in this that he rewardeth every man according to his work  this at least i can say for god incarnate himself has said it alreadythat to the good and faithful servant he will saywell done  thou hast been faithful over a few things  i will make thee ruler over many things  enter thou into the joy of thy lord  the joy of thy lord  think of these words a while  perhaps they may teach us something of the meaning of all saints day  for if jesus christ beas he isthe same yesterday today and for ever then his joy now must be the same as his joy was when he was here on earthto do good and to behold the fruit of his own goodness to seeas isaiah prophesied of himto see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied  and so it may be so it surely iswith them if blessed spirits as i believe have knowledge of what goes on on earth  they enter into the joy of their lord  therefore they enter into the joy of doing good  they see of the travail of their soul and are satisfied that they have not lived in vain  they see that their work is going on still on earth that they being dead yet speak and call ever fresh generations into the temple of wisdom  my dear boys take this one thought away with you from this chapel today  believe that the wise and good of every age and clime are looking down on you to see what use you will make of the knowledge which they have won for you  whether they laboured like kepler in his garret or like galileo in his dungeon hid in gods tabernacle from the strife of tongues or like socrates and plato in the whirl and noisefar more wearying and saddening than any lonelinessof the foolish crowd they all have laboured for you  let them rejoice when they see you enter into their labours with heart and soul  let them rejoice when they see in each one of you one of the fairest sights on earth before men and before god a docile and innocent boy striving to become a wise and virtuous man  and whenever you are tempted to idleness and frivolity whenever you are tempted to profligacy and lowmindedness whenever you are temptedas you will be too often in these mean daysto join the scorners and the fools whom solomon denounced tempted to sneering unbelief in what is great and good what is laborious and self sacrificing and to the fancy that you were sent into this world merely to get through it agreeablythen fortify and ennoble your hearts by solomons vision  remember who you are and where you are that you stand before the temple of wisdom of the science of things as god has made them wherein alone is health and wealth for body and for soul that from within the heavenly lady calls to you sending forth her handmaidens in every art and science which has ever ministered to the good of man and that within there await you all the wise and good who have ever taught on earth that you may enter in and partake of the feast which their mistress taught them to prepare  remember i say who you areeven the sons of god and remember where you arefor ever upon sacred ground and listen with joy and hope to the voice of the heavenly wisdom as she calls whoso is simple let him come in hither and him that wanteth understanding let him come and eat of my bread and drink of the wine that i have mingled  listen with joy and hope  and yet with fear and trembling as of moses when he hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god  for the voice of wisdom is none other than the voice of the spirit of god in whom you live and move and have your being    sermon iiiprayer and science    preached at st olaves church hart street before the honourable corporation of the trinity house 1866  psalm cvii 23 24 28  they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses  these are days in which there is much dispute about religion and sciencehow far they agree with each other whether they contradict or interfere with each other  especially there is dispute about providence  men say and truly that the more we look into the world the more we find everything governed by fixed and regular laws that man is bound to find out those laws and save himself from danger by science and experience  but they go on to sayand therefore there is no use in prayer  you cannot expect god to alter the laws of his universe because you ask him  the world will go on and ought to go on its own way and the man who prays against danger by sea or land is asking vainly for that which will not be granted him  now i cannot see why we should not allowwhat is certainly true that the world moves by fixed and regular laws  and yet allow at the same timewhat i believe is just as truethat gods special providence watches over all our actions and that to use our lords example not a sparrow falls to the ground without some special reason why that particular sparrow should fall at that particular moment and in that particular place  i cannot see why all things should not move in a divine and wonderful order and yet why they should not all work together for good to those who love god  the psalmist of old finds no contradiction between the two thoughts rather does the one of them seem to him to explain the other  all things says he continue this day as at the beginning  for all things serve thee  still it is not to be denied that this question has been a difficult one to men in all ages and that it is so to many now  but be that as it may this i say that of all men seafaring men are the most likely to solve this great puzzle about the limits of science and of religion of law and of providence for of all callings theirs needs at once most science and most religion theirs is most subject to laws and yet most at the mercy of providence and i say that many seafaring men have solved the puzzle for themselves in a very rational and sound way though they may not be able to put thoughts into words and that they do show by their daily conduct that a man may be at once thoroughly scientific and thoroughly religious  and i say that this ancient and honourable corporation of the trinity house is a proof thereof unto this day a proof that sound science need not make us neglect sound religion nor sound religion make us neglect sound science  no man ought to say that seamen have neglected science  it is the fashion among some to talk of sailors as superstitious  they must know very little about sailors and must be very blind to broad facts who speak thus of them as a class  many sailors doubtless are superstitious  but i appeal to every master mariner here whether the superstitious men are generally the religious and godly men whether it is not generally the most reckless and profligate men of the crew who are most afraid of sailing on a friday and who give way to other silly fancies which i shall not mention in this sacred place  and i appeal too to public experience whether many i may say most of those to whom seamanship and seascience owes most have not been godfearing christian men  be sure of this that if seamen as a class had been superstitious they would never have done for science what they have done  and what they have done all the world knows  to seamen and to men connected with the sea what do we not owe in geography hydrography meteorology astronomy natural history  at the present moment the world owes them large improvements in dynamics and in the new uses of steam and iron  it may be fairly said that the mariner has done more toward the knowledge of nature than any other personage in the world save the physician  for seamen have been forced by the nature of their calling to be scientific men  from the very earliest ages in which the first canoe put out to sea the mariner has been educated by the most practical of all schoolmasters namely danger  he has carried his life in his hand day and night he has had to battle with the most formidable and the most seemingly capricious of the brute powers of nature with storms with ice with currents with unknown rocks and shoals with the vicissitudes of climate and the terrible and seemingly miraculous diseases which change of climate engenders  he has had to fight nature and to conquer her if he could by understanding her by observing facts and by facing facts  he dared not like a scholar in his study indulge in theories and fancies about how things ought to be  he had to find out how they really were  he dared not say according to my theory of the universe this current ought to run in such a direction he had to find out which way it did actually run according to gods method of the universe lest it should run him ashore  everywhere i say and all day long the seaman has to observe facts and to use facts unless he intends to be drowned and therefore so far from being a superstitious man who refuses to inquire into facts but puts vain dreams in their stead the sailor is for the most part a very scientificminded man observant patient accurate truthful conquering nature as the great saying is because he obeys her  but if seamen have been forced to be scientific they have been equally forced to be religious  they that go down to the sea in ships see both the works of the lord and also his wonders in the deep  they see gods works regular orderly the same year by year voyage by voyage and tide by tide and they learn the laws of them and are so far safe  but they also see gods wondersstrange sudden astonishing dangers which have no doubt their laws but none which man has found out as yet  over them they cannot reason and foretell they can only pray and trust  with all their knowledge they have still plenty of ignorance and therefore with all their science they have still room for religion  is there an old man in this church who has sailed the seas for many a year who does not know that i speak truth  are there not men here who have had things happen to them for good and for evil beyond all calculation who have had good fortune of which they could only say the glory be to god for i had no share therein or who have been saved as by miracle from dangers of which they could only say it was of the lords mercies that we were not swallowed up who must if they be honest men as they are say with the psalmist we cried unto the lord in our trouble and he delivered us out of our distress  and this it is that i said at first that no men were so fit as seamen to solve the question where science ends and where religion begins because no mens calling depends so much on science and reason and so much at the same time on providence and gods merciful will  therefore when men say as they willif this world is governed by fixed laws and if we have no right to ask god to alter his laws for our sakes then what use in prayer  i will answergo to the seaman and ask him what he thinks  the puzzle may seem very great to a comfortable landsman sitting safe in his study at home but it ought to be no puzzle at all to the master mariner in his cabin with his chart and his bible open before him side by side  he ought to know well enough where reason stops and religion begins  he ought to know when to work and when to pray  he ought to know the laws of the sea and of the sky  but he ought to know too how to pray without asking god to alter those laws as presumptuous and superstitious men are wont to do  take as an instance the commonest of alla storm  we know that storms are not caused as folk believed in old time by evil spirits that they are natural phenomena obeying certain fixed laws that they are necessary from time to time that they are probably on the whole useful  and we know two ways of facing a storm one of which you may see too often among the boatmen of the mediterraneanhow a man shall say i know nothing as to how or why or when a storm should come and i care not to know  if one falls on me i will cry for help to the panagia or st nicholas or some other saint and perhaps they will still the storm by miracle  that is superstition the child of ignorance and fear  and you may have seen what comes of that temper of mind  how when the storm comes instead of order you have confusion instead of courage cowardice instead of a calm and manly faith a miserable crying of every man to his own saint while the vessel is left to herself to sink or swim  but what is the temper of true religion and of true science likewise  the seaman will say i dare not pray that there may be no storm  i cannot presume to interfere with gods government  if there ought to be a storm there will be one  if not there will be none  but i can forecast the signs of the weather i can consult my barometer i can judge by the new lights of science what course the storm will probably take and i can do my best to avoid it  but does that make religion needless  does that make prayer useless how so  the seaman may say i dare not pray that the storm may not come  but there is no necessity that i should be found in its path and i may pray and i will pray that god may so guide and govern my voyage and all its little accidents that i may pass it by  i know that i can forecast the storm somewhat and if i do not try to do that i am tempting god  but i may pray i will pray that my forecast may be correct  i will pray the spirit of god who gives man understanding to give me a right judgment a sound mind and a calm heart that i may make no mistake and neglect no precaution and if i fail and sinkgods will be done  it is a good will to me and all my crew and into the hands of the good god who has redeemed me i commend my spirit and their spirits likewise  this much therefore we may say of prayer  we may always pray to be made better men  we may always pray to be made wiser men  these prayers will always be answered for they are prayers for the very spirit of god himself from whom comes all goodness and all wisdom and it can never be wrong to ask to be made right  there are surely too evils so terrible that when they threaten us if god being our father means anythingif christ being our example means anythingthen we have a right to cry like our lord himself father if it be possible let this cup pass from me if we only add like our lord nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt  and of dangers in general this we may saythat if we pray against known dangers which we can avoid we do nothing but tempt god  but that against unknown and unseen dangers we may always pray  for instance if a sailor needlessly lodges over a foul tideless harbour or sleeps in a tropical mangrove swamp he has no right to pray against cholera and fever for he has done his best to give himself cholera and fever and has thereby tempted god  but if he goes into a new land of whose climate diseases dangers he is utterly ignorant then he has surely a right to pray god to deliver him from those dangers and if notif he is doomed to suffer from themto pray god that he may discover and understand the new dangers of that new land in order to warn future travellers against them and so make his private suffering a benefit to mankind  this then is our duty as to known dangersto guard ourselves against them by science and the reason which god has given us and as to unknown dangers to pray to god to deliver us from them if it seem good to him  but above all to pray to him to deliver us from them in the best way the surest way the most lasting way the way in which we may not only preserve ourselves but our fellowmen and generations yet unborn namely by giving us wisdom and understanding to discover the dangers to comprehend them and to conquer them by reason and by science  this is the spirit of sound science and of sound religion  and it was in this spirit and for this very end that this ancient and honourable corporation of the trinity house was founded more than three hundred years ago  not merely to pray to god and to the saints after the ancient fashion to deliver all poor mariners from dangers of the seas  that was a natural prayer and a pious one as far as it went  but it did not go far enough  for as a fact god did not always answer it  he did not always see fit to deliver those who called upon him  gallant ships went down with all their crews it was plain that god would not always deliver poor mariners even though they cried to him in their distress  then in the sixteenth century when mens minds were freed from many old superstitions by a better understanding both of holy scripture and of the laws of nature the master mariners of england took a wiser course  they said god will not always help poor mariners  but he will always teach them to deliver themselves  and so they built this house not in the name of the virgin mary or any saints in heaven but with a deep understanding of what was needed in the most awful name of god himself  thereby they went to the root and ground of this matter and of all matters  they went to the source of all law and order to the source of all force and life and to the source likewise of all love and mercy when they founded their house in the name of the father of lights in whom men live and move and have their being from whom comes every good and perfect gift and without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground in the name of the son who was born on earth a man and tasted sorrow and trial and death for every man in the name of the holy ghost who inspires man with the spirit of wisdom and understanding and gives him a right judgment in all things putting into his heart good desires and enabling him to bring them to good effect  and so believing that the everblessed trinity would teach them to help themselves and their fellow mariners they set to work like truly godfearing men not to hire monks to sing and say masses for them but to set up for themselves lights and seamarks and to take order for the safe navigation of these seas like men who believed indeed that they were the children of god and that god would prosper his children in as far as they used that reason which he himself had bestowed upon them  it is for these mens sakes as well as for our own that we are met together here this day  we are met to commemorate the noble dead not in any popish or superstitious fashion as if they needed our prayers or we needed their miraculous assistance  but in the good old protestant scriptural senseto thank god for all his servants departed this life in his faith and fear and to pray that god may give us grace to follow their good examples and especially to thank him for the founders of this ancient trinity house which stands here as a token to all generations of britons that science and religion are not contrary to each other but twin sisters meant to aid each other and mankind in the battle with the brute forces of this universe  we are met together here to thank god for all gallant mariners and for all who have helped mariners toward safety and success for all who have made discoveries in hydrography or meteorology in navigation or in commerce adding to the safety of seamen and to the health and wealth of the human race for all who have set noble examples to their crews facing danger manfully and dying at their posts as many a man has died a martyr to his duty for all who living active and useful and virtuous lives in their sea calling have ended as they lived godfearing christian men  to thank god for all these we are met together here and to pray to god likewise that he would send his spirit into the hearts of seamen and of those who deal with seamen and specially into the hearts of the royal the master and the worshipful the elder brethren of this ancient and honourable house that they may be true and loyal and obedient to that divine name in which they are met together here this daythe name of father son and holy ghost the everblessed trinity the giver of all good gifts in whom we live and move and have our being always keeping gods commandments and looking for gods guidance and setting to those beneath them an example of sound reason virtue and religion that so there may never be wanting to this land a race of seamen who shall trust in god to teach them all they need to know and to dispose of their bodies and souls as seemeth best to his most holy will who fearing god shall fear nought else but shall defy the dangers of the seas and all the brute forces of climates and of storms who shall set in foreign lands an example of justice and mercy of true civilization and true religion and so shall still maintain the marine of great britain as it has been for now three hundred years a safeguard and a glory to these islands and a blessing to the coasts of all the world    sermon ivgods training    deuteronomy viii 25  and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no  and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live  thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty years  thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee  this is the lesson of our lives  this is training not only for the old jews but for us  what was true of them is more or less true of us  and we read these verses to teach us that gods ways with man do not change that his fatherly hand is over us as well as over the people of israel that we are in gods schoolhouse as they were that their blessings are our blessings their dangers are our dangers that as st paul says all these things are written for our example  and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger  how true to life that is  how often there comes to a man at his setting out in life a time which humbles him a time of disappointment when he finds that he is not so clever as he thought as able to help himself as he thought when his fine plans fail him when he does not know how to settle in life how to marry how to provide for a family  perhaps the man actually does hunger and go through a time of want and struggle  then it may be he cries in his hearthow hard it is for me  how hard that the golden days of youth should be all dark and clouded over  how hard to have to suffer anxiety and weary hard work just when i am able to enjoy myself most  it is hard  but worse things than hard things may happen to a man far worse is it to grow up as some men do in wealth and ease and luxury with all the pleasures of this life found ready to their hands  some men says the proverb are born with a golden spoon in their mouth  god help them if they are  idleness profligacy luxury selfconceit no care for their duty no care for god no feeling that they are in gods schoolhousethese are too often the fruits of that breeding up  how hardly will they learn that man doth not live by bread alone or by money alone or by comfort alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god  truly said our lord how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven  not those who earn riches by manful and honest labour not those who come to wealth after long training to make them fit to use wealth  but those who have wealth who are born amid luxury and pomp who have never known want and the golden lessons which want bringsgod help them for they need his help even more than the poor young man who is at his wits end how to live  for him god is helping  his very want and struggles and anxiety may be gods help to him  they help him to control himself and do with a little they help him to strengthen his character and to bring out all the powers of mind that god has given him  god is humbling him that he may know that man doth not live by bread alone but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of god  god too if he trusts in god will feed him with mannaspiritual manna not bodily he fed the jews in the wilderness with manna to show them that his power was indeed almightythat if he did not see fit to help his people in one way he could help them just as easily in another  and so with every man who trusts in god  in unforeseen ways he is helped  in unforeseen ways he prospers his life as he goes on becomes very different from what he expected from what he would have liked his fine dreams fade away as he finds the world quite another place from what he fancied it  but still he prospers  if he be earnest and honest patient and godfearing he prospers god brings him through  his raiment doth not wax old neither doth his foot swell through all his forty years wandering in the wilderness  he is not tired out he does not break down though he may have to work long and hard  as his day is so his strength shall be  god holds him up strengthens and refreshes him and brings him through years of labour from the thought of which he shrank when he was young  and so the man learns that man doth not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that not in the abundance of things which he possesses not in money not in pleasure not even in comforts does the life of man consist  but in thisto learn his duty and to have strength from god to do it truly said the prophetit is good for a man to learn to bear the yoke in his youth  after that sharp training a man will prosper because he is fit to prosper  he has learnt the golden lesson  he can be trusted with comforts wealth honour  let him have them if god so will and use them well  only only when a time of ease and peace comes to him in his middle age let him not forget the warning of the latter part of the chapter  for there is another danger awaiting him as it awaited those old jews the danger of prosperity in old age  ah my friends that is a sore temptationthe sorest perhaps which can meet a man in the long struggle of life the temptation which success brings  in middle age when he has learnt his business and succeeded in it when he has fought his battle with the world and conquered more or less when he has made his way up and seems to himself safe and comfortable and thriving when he feels that he is a shrewd thrifty experienced man who knows the world and how to prosper in itthen how easy it is for him to say in his heartas moses feared that those old jews would saymy might and the power of my wit has gotten me this wealth and to forget the lord his god who guided him and trained him through all the struggles and storms of early life and so to become vainly confident worldly and hardhearted undevout and ungodly even though he may keep himself respectable enough and fall into no open sin  therefore it is i think that while we see so many lives which have been sad lives of poverty and labour and struggle end peacefully and cheerfully in a sunshiny old age like a still bright evening after a day of storm and rain so on the other hand we see lives which have been prosperous and happy ones for many years end sadly in bereavement poverty or disappointment as did the life of david the man after gods own heart  god guided him through all the dangers and temptations of youth and through them all he trusted god  god brought him safely to success honour a royal crown and he thanked god and acknowledged his goodness  and yet after a while his heart was puffed up and he forgot god and all he owed to god and became a tyrant an adulterer a murderer  he repented of his sin  but he could not escape the punishment of it  his children were a curse to him the sword never departed from his house and his last years were sad enough and too sad  perhaps that was gods mercy to him gods way of remembering him again and bringing him back to him  perhaps too that same is gods way of bringing back many a man in our own days who has wandered from him in success and prosperity  god grant that we may never need that terrible chastisement  god grant that we if success and comfort come to us may never wander so far from god but that we may be brought back to him by the mere humbling of old age itself without needing affliction over and above  yes by old age alone  old age it seems to me is a most wholesome and blessed medicine for the soul of man  good it is to find that we can work no longer and rejoice no more in our own strength and cunning  good it is to feel our mortal bodies decay and to learn that we are but dust and that when we turn again to our dust all our thoughts will perish  good it is to see the world changing round us going ahead of us leaving us and our opinions behind  good perhaps for usthough not for themto see the young who are growing up around us looking down on our oldfashioned notions  good for us because anything is good which humbles us makes us feel our own ignorance weakness nothingness and cast ourselves utterly on that god in whom we live and move and have our being and on the mercy of that saviour who died for us on the cross and on that spirit of god from whose holy inspiration alone all good desires and good actions come  god grant that that may be our end  that old age when it comes may chasten us humble us soften us and that our second childhood may be a second childhood indeed purged from the conceit the scheming the fierceness the covetousness which so easily beset us in our youth and manhood and tempered down to gentleness patience humility and faith  god grant that instead of clinging greedily to life and money and power and fame we may cling only to god and have one only wish as we draw near our endfrom my youth up hast thou taught me oh god and hitherto i have declared thy wondrous works  now also that i am old and greyheaded oh lord forsake me not till i have showed thy goodness to this generation and thy power to those who are yet to come    sermon vgood friday    hebrews ix 13 14  for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god  the three collects for good friday are very grand and very remarkable  in the first we pray  almighty god we beseech thee graciously to behold this thy family for which our lord jesus christ was contented to be betrayed and given up into the hands of wicked men and to suffer death upon the cross who now liveth and reigneth with thee and the holy ghost ever one god world without end  amen  in the second we pray  almighty and everlasting god by whose spirit the whole body of the church is governed and sanctified  receive our supplications and prayers which we offer before thee for all estates of men in thy holy church that every member of the same in his vocation and ministry may truly and godly serve thee through our lord and saviour jesus christ  amen  in the third we pray  o merciful god who hast made all men and hatest nothing that thou hast made nor wouldest the death of a sinner but rather that he should be converted and live  have mercy upon all jews turks infidels and hereticks and take from them all ignorance hardness of heart and contempt of thy word and so fetch them home blessed lord to thy flock that they may be saved among the remnant of the true israelites and be made one fold under one shepherd jesus christ our lord who liveth and reigneth with thee and the holy spirit one god world without end  amen  now these collects give us the keynote of good friday they tell us what the church wishes us to think of on good friday  we are to think of christs death and passion  of that there is no doubt  but we need not on good friday or perhaps at any other time trouble our minds with the unfathomable questions how did christs sacrifice take away our sins  how does christs blood purge our conscience  mere theories of the atonement as they are called have very little teaching in them and still less comfort  wise and good men have tried their minds upon them in all ages they have done their best to explain christs sacrifice and the atonement which he worked out on the cross on good friday  but it does not seem to me that they have succeeded  i never read yet any explanation which i could fully understand which fully satisfied my conscience or my reason either or which seemed to me fully to agree with and explain all the texts of scripture bearing on this great subject  but is it possible to explain the matter  is it not too deep for mortal man  is it not one of the deep things of god and of god alone before which we must worship and believe  as for explaining or understanding it must not that be impossible from its very nature  for consider the first root and beginning of the whole question put it in the simplest shape to which all christians will agree the father sent the son to die for the world  most true  but who can explain those words  we are stopped at the very first step by an abyss  who can tell us what is meant by the father sending the son what is the relation the connexion between the father and the son if we do not know that we can know nothing about the matter about the very root and ground thereof  and we do know little or nothing the bible only gives us scattered hints here and there  it is one of the things of which we may say with st paul that we know in part and see through a glass darkly  how then dare we talk as if we knew all as if we saw clearly  the atonement is a blessed and awful mystery hidden in god  ordained by and between god the father and god the son  and who can search out that  who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor  did we sit by and were we taken into his counsels when he made the world  not we neither were we when he redeemed the world  he did it  let that be enough for us  and he did it in love  let that be enough for us  god the father so loved the world that he sent his son into the world that the world by him might be saved  god the son so loved the world that he came to do his fathers will and put away sin by the sacrifice of himself  that is enough for us  let it be enough and let us take simply honestly literally and humbly like little children everything which the bible says about it without trying or pretending to understand but only to believe  we can believe that christs blood can purge our conscience though we cannot explain in any words of our own how it can do so  we can believe that god made him to be sin for us who knew no sin though we not only cannot but dare not try to explain so awful a mystery we can believe that christs sacrifice on the cross was a propitiation for sin though neither we nor as i hold any man on earth can tell exactly what the words sacrifice and propitiation mean  and so with all the texts which speak of christs death and passion and that atonement for sin which he in his boundless mercy worked out this day  let us not torment our minds with arguments in which there are a hundred words of mans invention to one word of holy scripture while the one word of scripture has more in it than the hundred words of man can explain  but let us have faith in christ  i mean let us trust him that he has done all that can or need be done that whatsoever was needed to reconcile god to man he has done for he is perfect god that whatever was needed to reconcile man to god he has done for he is perfect man  let us instead of puzzling ourselves as to how the lamb of god takes away the sins of the world believe that he knows and that he lives and cry to him as to the living godlamb of god who takest away the sins of the world have mercy on us and take our sins away  and let us beseech god this day graciously to behold his family the nations of christendom for which our lord jesus christ was contented to be betrayed into the hands of wicked men and suffer death upon the cross  let us ask this even though we do not fully understand what christs death on the cross did for mankind  that was the humble childlike really believing spirit of the early christians god grant us the same spirit we need it much in these very times  for if we are of that spirit my friends then instead of tormenting our minds as to the how and why of christs sacrifice on the cross we shall turn our hearts and not merely our minds to the practical questionwhat shall we do  if christ died for us what shall we do what shall we ask god to help us to do  to that the second collect gives a clear answer at onceserve the living god  and how  by dead works  by mere outward forms and ceremonies churchgoings psalmsingings sermonhearings  not so  these are right and good but they are dead works which cannot take away sin any more than could the gifts and sacrifices the meats and drinks of the old jewish law  those says st paul could not make him that did the sacrifice perfect as pertaining to the conscience  they could not give him a clear conscience they could not make him sure that god had forgiven him they could not give him spirit and comfort to saynow i can leave the church a forgiven man a new man and begin a fresh life and go about my daily business in joyfulness and peace of mind sure that god will help me and bless me and enable me to serve him in my calling  no says st paul  more than dead works are wanted to purge a mans conscience  nothing will do that but the blood of christ  and that will do it  he the spotless lamb has offered himself to god as a full and perfect and sufficient sacrifice offering and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world and therefore for thy sins whoever thou art be thy sins many or few  believe that for thou art a man for whom christ died  claim thy share in christs blood  believe that he has died for thee that he has blotted out thy sins in the blood of his cross that thou needest not try to blot them out by any dead works forms or ceremonies whatsoever for christ has done and suffered already all for thee  thou art forgiven  put away thy sins for god has put them away rise and be a new man  thou art one of gods holy church  god has justified thee  let him sanctify thee likewise  gods spirit is with thee to guide thee to inspire thee and make thee holy  serve thy father and thy master the living god sure that he is satisfied with thee for christs sake that thou art in thy right state henceforward in thy right place in this world and that he blesses all thy efforts to live a right life and to do thy duty  but how to serve him and where  by doing something strange and fantastic  by giving up thy business money time  going to the ends of the earth  making what some will call some great sacrifice for god  not so  all that may be and generally is the fruit of mere self will and selfconceit  god has made a sacrifice for thee  let that be enough  if he wants thee to make a sacrifice to him in return he will compel thee to make it doubt it not  but meanwhile abide in the calling wherein thou art called  do the duty which lies nearest thee  whether thou art squire or labourer rich or poor whether thy duty is to see after thy children or to mind thy shop do thy duty for that is thy vocation and calling that is the ministry in which thou canst serve god by serving thy fellowcreatures for whom christ died  this day the grand prayer has gone up throughout christs churchand thou hast joined in itfor all estates of men in his holy church for all estates from kings and statesmen governing the nations down to labouring men tilling in the field and poor women washing and dressing their children at home that each and all of them may do their work well whatever it is and thereby serve the living god for now their work however humble is gods work christ has bought it and redeemed it with his blood  when he redeemed human nature he redeemed all that human nature can and ought to do save sin  all human duties and occupations are purified by the blood of christs cross and if we do our duty well we do it to the lord and not to man and the lord blesses us therein and will help us to fulfil our work like christian men by the help of his holy spirit  and for those who know not christ  for them too we can pray  for for them too christ died  they too belong to christ for he has bought them with his most precious blood  what will happen to them we know not  but this we know that they are his sheep lost sheep though they may be and that we are bound to pray that he would bring them home to his flock  but how will he bring them back  that again we know not  but why need we know  if christ knows how to do it surely we need not  let us trust him to do his own work in his own way  but will he do it  my friends if we wish for the salvation of all jews turks infidels and heretics do you suppose that we are more compassionate to them than god who made them  who is more likely to pity the heathen  we who send a few missionaries to teach them  or god who sent his own son to die for them  oh trust god and trust christ for this as for all other things believe that for the heathen as for us he is able to do exceedingly and abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think and believe too that if we do ask we do not ask in vain that this collect which has gone up every good friday for centuries past from millions of holy hearts throughout the world has not gone up unheard that it will be answeredwe know not howbut answered still and that to jew and turk heathen and heretic this day will prove hereafter to have been what it is to us good friday    sermon vifalse civilization    jeremiah xxxv 19  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever  let us think a while this morning what this text has to do with us and why this strange story of the rechabites is written for our instruction in the pages of holy scripture  let us take the story as it stands and search the scriptures simply for it  for the bible will surely tell its own story best and teach its own lesson best  these rechabites who were they  or indeed we may askwho are they  for they are said to exist still  they were not israelites but wild arabs a branch of the kenite tribe which claimedat least its chiefsto be descended from abraham by his wife keturah  they joined the israelites and wandered with them into the land of canaan  but they never settled down as the israelites did into farmers and townsfolk  they never became what we call civilized  though they had a civilization of their own which stood them in good stead and kept themand keeps them it would seem to this daystrong and prosperous while great cities and mighty nations have been destroyed round about them  they kept their old simple arab customs living in their great black camels hair tents feeding their flocks and herds as they wandered from forest to forest and lawn to lawn living on the milk of the flock and it would seem on locusts and wild honey as did john the baptist after them  they had as many arab tribes have still neither corn seedfield nor vineyard  wild men they were in their ways yet living a simple wholesome life till in the days of ahab and jehu there arose among them a chief called jonadab the son of rechab of the house of hammath  why he was called the son of rechab is not clearly known  the son of the rider or the son of the chariot seems to be the most probable meaning of the name  so that these rechabites at least had horsesas many arab tribes have nowand whether they rode them or used them to draw their goods about in carts like many other wild tribes they seem to have gained from jonadab the name of rechabim the sons of rechab the sons of the rider or the sons of the chariot  of jonadab the son of rechab you heard three sundays since in that noble passage of 2 kings x where jehu returning from the slaughter of the idolatrous kings and going to slay the priests of baal meets jonadab and asks him is thy heart rightthat is sound in the worship of god and determined to put down idolatryas my heart is with thy heart  we hear of him and his tribe no more till the days of jeremiah 250 years after in the story from which my text is taken  what jonadabs reasons may have been for commanding his tribe neither to settle in towns nor till the ground it is not difficult to guess  he may have dreaded lest his people by settling in the towns should learn the idolatry of the israelites  he may have dreaded likewise lest they should give way to that same luxury and profligacy in which the israelites indulgedand especially lest they should be demoralized by that drunkenness of which the prophets speak as one of the crying sins of that age  he may have feared too lest their settling down as landholders or townsmen would cause them to be absorbed and lost among the nation of the israelites and probably involved in their ruin  be that as it may he laid his command upon his tribe and his command was obeyed  of the afterhistory of these simple godfearing folk we know very little  but what we do know is well worth remembering  they were it seems carried away captive to babylon with the rest of the jews and with them they came back to jerusalem  meanwhile they had intermarried with the priests of the tribe of levi and they assisted at the worship and sacrificesstanding before the lord as jeremiah had foretold in the temple but living as some say outside the walls in their tents  and it is worth remembering that we have one psalm in the bible which was probably written either by one of these rechabites or by jeremiah for them to sing and that a psalm which you all know well the old mans psalm as it has well been calledthe 71st psalm which is read in the visitation of the sick which says o god thou hast taught me from my youth  and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works  now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to every one that is to come  it was moreover a rechabite priest we are toldone of the sons of the rechabim spoken of by jeremiah the prophetwho when the jews were stoning st james the just one of the twelve apostles cried out against their wickedness  what befell the rechabites when jerusalem was destroyed we know not but they seem to have returned to their old life and wandered away into the far east for in the twelfth century more than one thousand years after a jewish traveller met with them 100000 strong under a jewish prince of the house of david still abstaining from wine and flesh and paying tithes to teachers who studied the law and wept for the fall of jerusalem  and even yet they are said to endure and prosper  for in our own time a traveller met the rechabites once more in the heart of arabia still living in their tents still calling themselves the sons of jonadab  with one of them mousa ie moses by name he talked and mousa said to him come and i will show you who we are and from an arabic bible he read the words of my text and said you will find us 60000 in number still  see the words of the prophet have been fulfilledjonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever  what lesson shall we learn from this storyso strange and yet so beautiful  what lesson need we learn save that which the holy scripture itself bids us learn  the blessing which comes upon reverence for our forefathers and above all for god our father in heaven  reverence for our forefathers  these are days in which we are too apt to sneer at those who have gone before us to look back on our forefathers as very ignorant prejudiced oldfashioned people whose opinions have been all set aside by the progress of knowledge  be sure that in this temper of mind lies a sin and a snare  if we wish to keep up true independence and true selfrespect in ourselves and our children we should be careful to keep up respect for our forefathers  a shallow sneering generation which laughs at those who have gone before it is ripe for disaster and slavery  we are not bound of courseas those old rechabites considered themselves boundto do in everything exactly what our forefathers did  for we are not under the law but under grace and where the spirit of the lord is there is libertyliberty to change improve and develop as the world grows older and we may hope wiser  but we are bound to do not exactly what our forefathers did but what we may reasonably suppose that they would have done had they lived now and were they in our places  we are to obey them not in the letter but in the spirit  and whenever in the prayer for the church militant we commemorate the faithful dead and thank god for all his servants departed this life in his faith and fear we should remember with honest pride that we are thanking god for our own mothers and fathers and for those that went before them ay for every honest godfearing man and woman high or low who ever did their duty by god and their neighbours and left when they died a spot of this land somewhat better than they found it  and for god the father of all fathers our father in heavenoh my friends god grant that it may never be said to any of us behold the words of jonadab the son of rechab which he commanded his children are performed  but ye have not hearkened unto me  i have sent also unto you saith god not merely my servants the prophets but my onlybegotten jesus christ your lord saying return you now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers  but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me  god grant that that may never be said to any of us  and yet it is impossible to denyimpossible to shut our eyes to the plain fact that englishmen nowadays are more and more forgetting that there are any commandments of god whatsoever any everlasting laws laid down by their heavenly father which if they break will avenge themselves by our utter ruin  we do not go after other gods it is true in the sense of worshipping idols  but there is another god which we go after more and more and that is money gain our interest as we call it not knowing that the only true interest of any man is to fear god and keep his commandments  we hold more and more that a man can serve god and mammon that a man must of course be religious and belong to some special sect or party or denomination and stand up for that fiercely enough  but we do not hold that there are commandments of god which say for ever to the sinner do this and thou shalt live do this or thou shalt die  we hold that because we are not under the law but under grace there is no condemnation for sinat least for the special sort of sin which happens to be in fashion which is nowadays the sin of making money at all risks  we hold that there is one law of morality for the kingdom of heaven and another for the kingdom of mammon therefore we hold more and more that when money is in question anything and everything is fair  there arewe have reason to know it just now but too wellthousands who will sell their honour their honesty yea their own souls for a few paltry pounds and think no shame  and if any one says with jeremiah the prophet these are poor they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god  i will get me to the great men for they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their godthen will he find as jeremiah did that too many of these great and wealthy worshippers of mammon have utterly broken the yoke and burst the bonds of all moral law of right and wrong  heaping up vast fortunes amid the ruin of those who have trusted them and the tears of the widow and the orphan by means now glossed over by fine new words but called in plain honest old english by a very ugly name  how many there are in england now my friends who would laugh in their hearts at those worthy rechabites and hold them to be ignorant oldfashioned bigoted people for keeping up their poor simple temperate life wandering to and fro with their tents and cattle instead of dwelling in great cities and making money and becoming what is nowadays called civilized in luxury and covetousness  surely according to the wisdom of this world the rechabites were foolish enough  but it is the wisdom of this world itselfnot simplicity and loyalty like theirswhich is foolishness with god  my friends let us all take warning each man for himself  when a nation corrupts itselfas we seem inclined to do now by luxury and covetousness selfishness and selfwill forgetting more and more loyalty and order honesty and high principlethen some wholesome but severe judgment of god is sure to come upon that nation  a day in which all faces shall gather blackness  a day of gloominess and thick darkness like the morning spread upon the mountains  for the eternal laws of gods providence are still at work though we choose to forget them and the judge who administers them is the same yesterday today and for ever even jesus christ the lord the everlasting rock on which all morality and all society is founded whosoever shall fall on that rock in repentance and humility confessing bewailing and forsaking his worldliness and sinfulness he shall indeed be broken  but of him it is written the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit  a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise  and he shall find that rock even christ a safe standingground amid the slippery mire of this worlds temptations and the storms and floods of trouble which are coming it may be in our childrens daysit may be in our own  but he who hardens his heart  he who says proudly we are they that ought to speak who is lord over ushe who says carelessly soul take thine ease thou hast much goods laid up for many yearshe who halts between two opinions and believes to the last that he can serve both god and mammonhe especially who fancies that falsehood injustice covetousness and neglect of his fellowmen can properly be his interest or help his interest in any wiseof all such it is written on whomsoever that rockeven the eternal laws of christ the judgeon whomsoever that rock shall fall it shall grind him to powder    sermon viithe name of god    isaiah l 10  who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light  let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god  to some persons it may seem strange advice to tell them that in the hour of darkness doubt and sorrow they will find no comfort like that of meditating on the name of the everblessed trinity  yet there is not a prophet or psalmist of the old testament who does not speak of the name of the lord as a kind of talisman against all the troubles which can befall the spirit of man  and we as christians know or ought to know far more of god than did even prophets or psalmists  if they found comfort in the name of god we ought to find far more  but some will sayyes  let us think of god gods mercies gods dealings with his people but why think especially of the name of the everblessed trinity  for this simple reason  that it is by that name of father son and holy ghost that god has revealed himself  that is the name by which he bids us think of him and we are more or less disregarding his commands when we think of him by any other  that is the name which god has given himself and therefore it is morally certain that that is gods right name that it expresses gods very self gods very being as he is  theology signifies the knowledge of god as he is  and it is dying out among us in these days  much of what is called theology now is nothing but experimental religion which is most important and useful when it is founded on the right knowledge of god  but which is not itself theology  for theology begins with god  but experimental religion right or wrong begins with a mans own soul  therefore it is that men are unaccustomed to theology  they shrink from it as something very abstruse only fit for great scholars and divines and almost given up nowadays even by them  they do not know that theology the knowledge of god is full of practical everyday comfort and guidance for their conduct and character yea that it isso says the bibleeverlasting life itself  therefore it is that some shrink from thinking of the everblessed trinity not from any evil intent but because they are afraid of thinking wrongly and so consider it more safe not to think at all  they have been puzzled it may be by arguments which they have heard or read or which have risen up in their own minds and which have made them doubt about the trinity  and they sayi will not torment my soul and perhaps endanger my soul by doubts  i will take the doctrine of the trinity for granted because i am bidden to do so  but i leave what it means to be explained by wiser men  if i begin thinking about it i shall only confuse myself  so it is better for me not to think at all  and one cannot deny that they are right as far as they go  if they cannot think about the trinity without thinking wrongly it is better to take on trust what they are told about it  but they lose much by so doing  they lose the solid and real comfort which they may get by thinking of the name of god  and i believe they lose it unnecessarily  i cannot see why they must think wrongly of the trinity if they think at all  i cannot see why they need confuse themselves  the doctrine of the trinity is not really an unreasonable one  the doubts which come into mens minds concerning it do not seem to me sound and reasonable doubts  for instance some sayhow can there be three persons in one god  it is contrary to reason  one cannot be many  three cannot be one  that is unreasonable  i think that if you will use your reason for yourselves you will see that it is those words which are unreasonable and not the doctrine of the trinity  first  a thing need not be unreasonablethat is contrary to reasonbecause it is above and beyond reasonor at least beyond our human reason which at best as st paul says sees as in a glass darkly and only knows in part  consider how many things are beyond reason which are not contrary to it  i say that all things which god has made are so  but without going so far let us consider these simple examples  is it not beyond all reason that among animals like should bring forth like  why does an eagles egg always produce an eagle and a doves egg a dove and so forth  no man knows no man can give any reason whatsoever  if a doves egg produced an eagle ignorant men would cry out at the wonder the miracle  wise men know that the real wonder the real miracle is that a doves egg always produces a dove and not any and every other bird  here is a common and notorious fact entirely above our reason there is no cause to be given for it save that god has ordained it so  but it is not contrary to our reason  so far from it we are certain that a dove will produce a dove and our reason has found out much of the laws of kind and found out that they are reasonable laws regular and to be depended upon so that we can as all know produce and keep up new breeds whether of plants or of animals  so that the law of kind though it is beyond our reason is not contrary to our reason at all  so much for things which have life  take an equally notorious example from things which have not life  is it not above and beyond all our reasonthat the seemingly weakest thing in the world the most soft and yielding the most frail and vanishing should be also one of the strongest things in the world that is so utterly above reason that while i say it it seems to some of you to be contrary to reason to be unreasonable and impossible  it is so above reason that till two hundred years ago no one suspected that it was true  and yet it is strictly true  what is more soft and yielding more frail and vanishing than steam and what is stronger than steam  i know nothing  steam it is which has lifted up the mountains from the sea into the clouds  steam it is which tears to pieces the bowels of the earth with earthquakes and volcanoes shaking down cities rasping the solid rocks into powder and scattering them far and wide in dust over the face of the land  what gives to steam its enormous force is beyond our reason  we do not know  but so far from being contrary to our reason we have learnt that the laws of steam are as reasonable as any other of gods laws  we can calculate its force we can make it use it and turn its mighty powers by reason and science into our most useful and obedient slave till it works ten thousand mills and sends ten thousand ships across the sea  above reason i say but not contrary to reason is the mighty power of steam  and god who made all these wondersand millions of wonders more must he not be more wonderful than them all  must not his being and essence be above our reason  but need they be therefore contrary to our reason  not so  nevertheless some will say how can one be many  how can one be three  why not  two are one in you and every man  your body is you and your soul is you  they are two  but you know yourself that you are one being that the athanasian creed speaks at least reason when it says as the reasonable soul and the flesh are one man so god and man is one christ  and three are one in every plant in the field  root bark leaves are three  and yetthey are one tree and if you take away any one of them the tree will die  so it is in all nature  but why do i talk of a tree or any other example  wherever you look you find that one thing is many things and many things one  so far from that fact being contrary to our reason it is one which our reason as soon as we think deeply about this world assures us is most common of every organized body it is strictly true that it is many things bound together by a certain law which makes them one thing and no more  and therefore every organized body is a mystery and above reason  but its organization is none the less true for that  and there are philosophers who will tell youand wisely and well that there must needs be some such mystery in god that reason ought to teach useven if revelation had nottwo things  first that god must be one and next that god must be manythat is more than one  do i mean that our own reason would have found out for itself the mystery of the everblessed trinity  god forbid  nothing less  there surely is a difference between knowing that a thing must be and knowing that the thing is and what it is like and there surely is a difference between knowing that there is a great mystery and wonder in god and knowing what that mystery is  man might have found out that god was one and yet more than one but could he have found out what is the essence and character of god not his own reason but the spirit of god it is which tells him that tells him that god is three in onethat these three are persons that these persons are a father a son and a holy spirit  this is what god has himself condescended to tell us and therefore this is what he specially wishes us to believe and remember when we think of him  this is gods name for himselffather son and holy ghost  man may give god what name he chooses  gods own name which he has given himself is likely surely to be the most correct  at least it is the one of which god means us to think for it is the one into which he commanded us to be baptized  remember that whenever you hear discourse concerning god and if any man however learned says that god is absolute answerit may be so  but i was not baptized into the name of the absolute  if he tell you god is infinite answerit may be so  but i was not baptized into the name of the infinite  if he tell you god is the first cause answerthat i doubt not  but i was not baptized into the name of the first cause  i was baptized into the name which god has given himselffather son and holy ghost and i will give him no other name and think of him by no other name lest i be committing an act of irreverence toward god by presuming to call him one thing when he has bid me call him another  absolute infinite first cause and so forth are deep words  but they are words of mans invention and words too which plain hardworking hardsorrowing folks do not understand even if learned men dowhich i doubt very much indeed and therefore i do not trust them cannot find comfort for my soul in them  but father son and holy spirit are words which plain hard working hardsorrowing men can understand and can trust and can find comfort in them for they are gods own words and like all gods words go straight home to the hearts of menstraight home to the heart of every one who is a father or motherto the heart of every one who has a parent or a childto the heart of every one who has the holy spirit of god putting into his mind good desires and striving to make him bring them into good effect and be what he knows he should be a holy and good man  answer thus my friends  and think thus of the mystery of the ever blessed trinity  for this is a thoroughly reasonable plan of thought  and morein thinking thus you will find comfort guidance clearness of head and clearness of conscience also  only remember what you are to think of  you are not to think merely of the mystery of the question and to puzzle yourselves with arguments as to how the three persons are one for that is not to think of the ever blessed trinity but only to think about it  still less are you to think of the everblessed trinity under names of philosophy which god has not given to himself for that is not to think of the ever blessed trinity at all  you must think of the everblessed trinity as he isof a father a son and a holy spirit and to think of him the more earnestly the more you are sad at heart  it may be that god has sent that sadness to make you think of him  it may be that god has cut the very ground from under your feet that you may rest on him the true and only ground of all created things as it is written  who is he among you who walketh in darkness and hath no light  let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god  some will tell you that if you are sorrowful it is a time for self examination and for thinking of your own soul  i answerin good time but not yet  think first of god for how can you ever know anything rightly about your own soul unless you first know rightly concerning god in whom your soul lives and moves and has its being  others may tell you to think of gods dealings with his people  i answerin good time but not yet think first of god  for how can you rightly understand gods dealings unless you first rightly understand who god is and what his character is  right notions concerning your own soul right notions concerning gods dealings can only come from right notions concerning god himself  he is before all things  think of him before all things  he is the first and he is the last  think of him first in this life and so you will think of him last and for ever in the life to come  think of the father that he is a father indeed in spirit and in truth  think of the son that he is a son indeed in spirit and in truth  think of the holy spirit that he is a holy spirit indeed in spirit and in truth  so you will be thinking indeed of the everblessed trinity and will worship god not with your lips or your thoughts merely but in spirit and in truth  think of the father that he is the father of our lord jesus christ and that the perfect son must be forever perfectly like the perfect father  for then you will believe that god the father looks on you and feels for you exactly as does jesus christ your lord then you will feel that he is a father indeed and will enter more and more into the unspeakable comfort of that word of all words our father who art in heaven  think of the lord jesus christ as the perfect son who though he is coequal and coeternal with his father yet came not to do his own will but his fathers who instead of struggling instead of helping himself cried in his agony  not my will but thine be done and conquered by resignation  so you will enter into the unspeakable comfort of conquering by resignation as you see that your resignation is to be like the resignation of christ not that of trembling fear like a condemned criminal before a judge not that of sullen necessity like a slave before his master  but that of the onlybegotten son of god the resignation of a child to the will of a father whom he can utterly trust because that fathers name is love  think of the holy spirit as a person having a will of his own who breatheth whither he listeth and cannot be confined to any feelings or rules of yours or of any mans but may meet you in the sacraments or out of the sacraments even as he will and has methods of comforting and educating you of which you will never dream one whose will is the same as the will of the father and of the son even a good will just as his character is the same as the character of the father and of the son  even love which works by holiness love which you can trust utterly for yourself and for all whom you love  think i say of god himself as he is think of his name by which he has revealed himself and thus you willbut who am i to pretend to tell you what you will learn by thinking rightly of father son and holy ghost  how can i dare to say how much you will or will not learn  how can i put bounds to gods teaching to the workings of him who has said if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him  how can i tell you in a few words of one sermon all that that means  how can i or any man know all that that means  who is one man or all men to exhaust the riches of the glory of god or the blessings which may come from thinking of gods glory  let it be enough for us to be sure that truly to know god is everlasting life and that the more we think of god by his own revealed name of father son and holy ghost the more we shall enter now and hereafter into eternal life and into the peace which comes by the true knowledge of him in whom we live and move and have our being    sermon viiithe end of religion    ephesians iv 23 24  be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put ye on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness  this text is exceedingly valuable to us for it tells us the end and aim of all religion  it tells us why we are to pray whether at home or in church why we are to read our bibles and good books why we are to be what is commonly called religious  it tells us i say the end and aim of all religion namely that we may put on the new man which after godaccording to the likeness of godis created in righteousness and true holiness  so says st paul in another place  be ye therefore followersliterally copiers imitatorsof god as dear children  now this is not what you will be told from too many pulpits and in too many books nowadays is the end of religion  you will be told that the end of religion is to save your soul and go to heaven  but experience shows my friends in all religions and in all ages that those who make it their first object in life to save their souls are but too likely to lose them as our lord says he that saveth his soul or lifefor the words are the same in scripture shall lose it  and experience shows that in all religions and in all ages those who make it their first object in life to get to heaven are but too likely never to get there  because in their haste they forget what heaven is and what is the only way of arriving at it  good works as they call the likeness of god and the divine life are in too many persons eyes only fruits of faith or proofs of faith and not the very end of faith and of religionay of their very existence here on earth and therefore they naturally begin to ask how few good works will be enough to prove their faith  and when a man has once set that question before himself he is sure to find a comfortable answer and to discover that very few good works indeed a very little sanctification as it is called a very little righteousness and a very little holinesswill be enough to save his soul as far at least as he wishes his soul to be saved  my friends all this springs from that selfish view of religion which is gaining power among us more and more  christ came to deliver us from our selfishness from being slaves to our selfish prudence and selfish interest  but we make religion a question of profit and loss as we make everything else  we askwhat shall i get by being good  what shall i get by worshipping god  is it not prudent and selfinterested and businesslike to give up a little pleasure on earth in the hope of getting a great deal in heaven  is not religion a good investment  is it not considering how short and uncertain life is the best of all lifeinsurances  my friends we who have to earn our bread and to take honest money for honest work know well enough what trouble we have to keep out of our daily life that mean base spirit of selfinterest rather than of duty which never asks of anything is it right but only will it pay mewhich instead of thinking how can i do this work as well as possible is perpetually thinking how can i get most money for the least work  we have to fight against that spirit in worldly matters  for we know that if we yield to itif we sacrifice our duty to our pleasure or our gainit is certain to make us do something mean covetous even fraudulent in the eyes of god and man  but if we carry that spirit into religion and our spiritual and heavenly duties if we forget that that is the spirit of the world if we forget that we renounced the world at our baptism and that we therefore promised not to shape our lives by its rules and maxims if our thought is not of whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely of good report whatsoever brings us true honour and deserved praise from god and from man if we think only that intensely selfish and worldly thought how much will god take for saving my soulwhich is the secret thought alas that it should be so of too many of all denominationsthen we shall be in a fair way of killing our souls so that if they be saved they will not at all events be saved alive  for we shall kill in our souls just those instincts of purity justice generosity mercy love in one word of unselfishness and unworldliness which make the very life of the soul because they are inspired by the spirit of god even the holy ghost  and we shall be but too likely not to sit in heavenly places with christ jesusas st paul tells us we may do even in this life  but to go to our own placewherever that may bewith selfish judas who when he found that his saviour was not about to restore the kingdom to israel and make a great prince of him there and then made the best investment he could under the danger which he saw at hand by selling his lord for thirty pieces of silver  to remain to all time a warning to those who are religious for selfinterests sake  what then is the end and aim of true religion  st paul tells us in the text  the end and aim he says of hearing christ the end and aim of learning the truth as it is in jesus is thisthat we may be renewed in the spirit of our minds and put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness  to put on the new man the new pattern of manhood which is after the pattern of the son of man jesus christ and therefore after the pattern and likeness of god  to be followers that is copiers and imitators of god that so says st paul is the end and aim of religion  in one word we are to be good and religion according to st paul is neither more nor less than the act of becoming good like the good god  to be like god  can we have any higher and more noble aim than that and yet it is a simple aim  there is nothing fantastic fanatical inhuman about it  it is within our reachwithin the reach of every man and woman within the reach of the poorest the most unlearned for how does st paul tell us that we can become like god  wherefore he says putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour  for we are members one of another  be ye angry and sin not  let not the sun go down upon your wrath  neither give place to the devil  let him that stole steal no more  but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth  let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption  let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you  do that he says and you will be followers of god as dear children and thus will you surely save your souls alive  for they will be inspired by the spirit of god the spirit of goodness who is the lord and giver of life wherefore they cannot decay nor die but must live and grow develop and improve perpetually becoming better and wiserand therefore more useful to their fellowcreatures more blessed in themselves and more pleasing to god their father through all eternity  and thus you will surely go to heaven  for heaven will begin on earth and last on after this earth and all that binds you to this earth has vanished in the grave  heaven will begin on earth i say  when st paul told these very ephesians to whom my text was addressed that god had made them sit even then in heavenly places with christ jesus he did not mean in any wisewhat they would have known was not truethat their bodies had been miraculously lifted up above the earth above the clouds or elsewhere  no for he had told them before in the first chapter what he meant by heavenly places  god their father he says had blessed them with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ in that he had chosen them in christ before the foundation of the worldand for what end  for the very end which i have been preaching to you  that they should be holy and without blame before god in love  that was heaven  if they were thatholy blameless loving they were in heavenly places alreadyin that moral and spiritual heaven in which god abides for ever  they were with god and with all who are like god as it is written he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  my dear friends this is the heaven for which we are all to strivea heaven of goodness wherein god dwells  and therefore an eternal and everlasting heaven as eternal as goodness and as eternal as god himself and if we are living in it we have all we need  but we may begin to live in it here  to what particular place our souls go after death scripture does not tell us and we need not know  to what particular place our souls and bodies go after the resurrection scripture tells us not and we need not know  but this scripture tells us and that is enough for us that they will be in heavenly places in the presence of christ and of god  and this scripture tells usand indeed our own conscience and reason tell us likewise that though death may alter our place it cannot alter our character though it may alter the circumstances round us it cannot alter ourselves  if we have been good and pure before death we shall be good and pure after death  if we have been led and inspired by gods spirit before death so shall we be after death  if we have been in heavenly places before death thinking heavenly thoughts feeling heavenly feelings and doing heavenly deeds then we shall be in heavenly places after death for we shall have with us the spirit of god whose presence is heaven and as long as we are holy good pure unselfish just and merciful we may be persuaded with st paul that wheresoever we go all will be well for neither death nor life nor angels nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord    sermon ixthe humanity of god    st luke xv 7  i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance  there are three parables in this chapter  all agree in one quality in their humanity  god shows us in them that there is something in his character which is like the best and simplest parts of our characters  god himself likens himself to men that men may understand him and love him  why there should be more joy over the repenting sinner than over the just man who needs no repentance we cannot explain in words  but our hearts tell us that it is true beautiful that it is reasonable though we can give no reason for it  you know that if you had lost a sheep if you had lost a piece of money if you had had a child run away from you it would be far more pleasant to find that thing which you had lost than never to have lost it at all  you do not know why  god tells you that it is a part of his image and likeness in you that you rejoice over what you have lost and found again because god rejoices over what he has lost and found again  and is not this a gospel and good news  is it not good news that we need never be afraid or ashamed to give way to our tenderness and pity for god does not think it beneath him to be tender and pitiful is it not good news that we need never be afraid or ashamed to forgive to take back those who have neglected us wronged us for god does not think it beneath him to do likewise  that we need never show hardness pride sternness to our children when they do wrong but should win them by love and tenderness caring for them all the more the less they care for themselves for god does even so to us who have sinned against him far more than our children ever can sin against us  and is it not good news again that god does care for sinners and for all kinds and sorts of sinners  some go wrong from mere stupidity and ignorance because they know no better because they really are not altogether accountable for their own doings  they are like the silly sheep who gets out over the fence of his own fancy and yet no reasonable man will be angry with the poor thing  it knows no better  how many a poor young thing goes wandering away like that silly sheep and having once lost its way cannot get back again but wanders on further and further till it lies down all desperate tired out mired in the bogs and torn about with thorns  then the good shepherd does not wait for that sheep to come back  he goes and seeks it far and wide up hill and down dale till he finds it and having found it he does not beat it rate itnot even drive it home before him  it is tired and miserable  if it has been foolish it has punished itself enough for its folly and all he feels for it is pity and love  it wants rest and he gives it rest at his own expense  he lays it on his shoulders and takes it home calling on all heaven and earth to rejoice with him  ah my friends if that is not the picture of a god whom you can love of a god whom you can trust what god would you have  some again go wrong from ignorance and bad training bad society bad education bad example and in other countriesthough thank god not in thisfrom bad laws and bad government  how many thousands and hundreds of thousands are ruined as it seems to us thereby  the child born in a london alley reared up among london thieves taught to swear lie steal never entering a school or church never hearing the name of god save in oathsthere is the lost piece of money  it is a valuable thing the kings likeness is stamped on it  but it is useless because it is lost lying in the dust and darkness hidden in a corner unable to help itself and of no use to any one  and so there is many a person man and woman who is worth something who has gods likeness on them who if they were brought home to god might be of good use in the world but they are lost from ignorance and bad training  they lie in a corner in darkness not knowing their own value in gods eyes not knowing that they bear his image though it be all crusted over with the dust and dirt of barbarism and bad habits  then christ will go after them and seek diligently till he finds them and cleanses them and makes them bright and of good use again in his church and his kingdom they are worth something and christ will not let them be wasted he will send clergymen teachers missionaries schools reformatories penitentiaries hospitalsay and other messengers of his of whom we never dream for his ways are as high above our ways as the heaven is above the earth  with all these he sweeps his house and his blessing is on them all for by them he finds the valuable coin which was lost  but there is a third sort of sinner spoken of in christs next parable in this chapter from which my text is taken of whom it is not said that god the father sends out to seek and to save him  that is the prodigal son who left his fathers house and strayed away of his own wantonness and free will  christ does not go out after him he has gone away of his own will and of his own will he must come back  and he has to pay a heavy price for his follyto taste hunger shame misery all but despair  for understandif any of you fancy that you can sin without being punishedthat the prodigal son is punished and most severely  he does not get off freely the moment he chooses to repent as false preachers will tell you  even after he does repent and resolves to go back to his fathers house he has a long journey home in poverty and misery footsore hungry and all but despairing  but when he does get home when he shows that he has learnt the bitter lesson when all he dares to ask is make me as one of thy hired servants he is received as freely as the rest  and it is worth while to remark that our lord spends on him tenderer words than on those who are lost by mere foolishness or ignorance  of him it is not said rejoice with me for i have found himbut bring out the best robe for this my sonnot my sheep not my piece of money but my sonwas dead and is alive again he was lost and is found  in this is a great mystery one of which one hardly dares to talk but one which one must think over in ones own heart and say oh the depth of the riches and of the knowledge and wisdom of god  how wonderful are his judgments and his ways past finding out  for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor  or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again  who indeed  god is not a tyrant who must be appeased with gifts or a taskmaster who must be satisfied with the labour of his slaves  he is a father who loves his children who gives and loveth to give who gives to all freely and upbraideth not  he truly willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  his will is a good will and howsoever much mans sin and folly may resist it and seem for a time to mar it yet he is too great and good to owe any man even the worst the smallest spite or grudge  patiently nobly magnanimously god waits waits for the man who is a fool to find out his own folly waits for the heart which has tried to find pleasure in everything else to find out that everything else disappoints and to come back to him the fountain of all wholesome pleasure the wellspring of all life fit for a man to live  when the fool finds out his folly when the wilful man gives up his wilfulness when the rebel submits himself to law when the son comes back to his fathers housethere is no sternness no peevishness no upbraiding no pride no revenge but the everlasting and boundless love of god wells forth again as rich as ever  he has condescended to wait for his creature because what he wanted was not his creatures fear but his creatures love not his lipobedience but his heart because he wanted him not to come back as a trembling slave to his master but as a son who has found out at last what a father he has left him when all beside has played him false  let him come back thus and then all is forgiven and forgotten and all that will be said will be this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found    sermon xgods world    preached before the prince of wales at sandringham 1866  genesis i 1  in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  it may seem hardly worth while to preach upon this text  every one thinks that he believes it  of coursethey saywe know that god made the world  teach us something we do not know not something which we do  why preach to us about a text which we fully understand and believe already  because my friends there are few texts in the bible more difficult to believe than this the very first few texts which we need to repeat to ourselves again and again in all the chances and changes of this mortal life lest we should forget it just as we feel we are most sure of it  we know that it was very difficult for people in olden times to believe it  else why did all the heathens of old and why do all heathens now worship idols  we know that the old jews after it had been revealed to them found it very difficult to believe it  else why were they always deserting the worship of god and worshipping idols and devils sun moon and stars and all the host of heaven  we know that the early christians in spite of the light of the gospel and of gods spirit found it very difficult to believe it doubtless they believed it a thousand times more fully than it had ever been believed before  they would have shrunk with horror from saying that any one but god had made the heavens and the earth  but christians clung for many hundred years even almost up to our own day to old heathen superstitions which they would have cast away if their faith had been full and if they had held with their whole hearts and souls and minds that there was one god of whom are all things  they believed that the devil and evil spirits had power to raise thunderstorms and blight crops and change that course of nature of which the psalmist had said that all things served god and continued this day as at the beginning for god had given them a law which could not be broken  they believed in magic and astrology and a hundred other dreams which all began from secret disbelief that god made the heaven and the earth till they fancied that the devil could and would teach men the secrets of nature and the way to be rich and great if they would but sell their souls to him  they believed in a word the very atheistic lie which satan told to our blessed lord when he said that all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them were his and to whomsoever he would he gave theminstead of believing our lords answer get thee behind me satan  it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve  and therefore i tell you hereas the church has told christian people in all agesthat if any of you have any fancy for such follies any belief in charms and magic any belief that you can have your fortunes told by astrologers gipsies or such like you must go back to your bible and learn better the first text in it  in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  gods is the kingdom and the power and the glory of all things visible and invisible all the world round us with its wonderful secrets is governed from the sun over our heads to the smallest blade of grass beneath our feet by god and by god alone and neither evil spirit nor magician has the smallest power over one atom of it and our fortunes in likewise do not depend on the influences of stars or planets ghosts or spirits or anything else  but on ourselves of whom it is written that god shall judge every man according to his works  even now in these very days many good people are hardly able it seems to me to believe with their whole hearts that god made heaven and earth  they half believe it  but their faith is weak and when it is tried they grow frightened and afraid of truth  this it is which makes so many good people afraid of what is now called science of all new discoveries about the making of this earth and the powers and virtues of the things about us afraid of wonders which are become matters of course among us but of which our forefathers knew little or nothing  they are afraid lest these things should shake peoples faith in the bible and in christianity lest men should give up the good old faith of their forefathers and fancy that the world is grown too wise to believe in the old doctrines one cannot blame them cannot even be surprised at them  so many wonderful truths for truths they are of which our fathers never dreamed are discovered every year that none can foretell where the movement will stop what we shall hear next what we shall have to believe next  only let us take refuge in the textin the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  all that we see around us however wonderful all that has been found out of late however wonderful all that will be ever found out however still more wonderful it may be is the work of god of that god who revealed himself to moses of that god who led the children of israel out of their slavery in egypt of that god who taught david in all his trouble and wanderings to trust in him as his guide and friend of that god who revealed to the old prophets the fate of nations and the laws by which he governs all the kingdoms and people of the earth of that god above all who so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that the world by him might be saved  this material world which we do see is as much gods world as the spiritual world we do not see  and therefore the one cannot contradict the other and the true understanding of the one will never hurt our true understanding of the other  but many good people have another fear and that i think a far more serious one  they are afraid in consequence of all these wonderful discoveries of science that people will begin to trust in science and not in god  and that fear is but too well founded  it is certain that if sinful man can find anything to trust in instead of god trust therein he surely will  the old jews preferred to trust in idols rather than god the christians of the middle age to their shame trusted in magic and astrology rather than god and after that some 200 years ago when men had grown too wise to trust in such superstitions they certainly did not grow wise enough most of them to trust in the living god they relied the rulers of the nations especially in their own wit and cunning and tried to govern the world and keep it straight by falsehood and intrigue envy and jealousy plotting and party spirit and the wisdom which cometh not from above but is earthly sensual devilishthat wisdom against which we pray whenever we sing god save the queen    confound their politics frustrate their knavish tricks on thee our hopes we fix    god save the queen   and since that false wisdom has failed and the wisdom of this world and the rulers of this world came to nought in the terrible crisis of the french revolution eighty years ago men have been taking up a new idolatry  for as science has spread they have been trusting in science rather than in the living god and giving up the old faith that gods judgments are in all the earth and that he rewards righteousness and punishes iniquity till too many seem to believe that the world somehow made itself and that there is no living god ordering and guiding it but that a man must help himself as he best can in this world for in god no help is to be found  and how shall we escape that danger  i do not think we shall escape it if we stop short at the text  we must go on from the old testament and let the new explain it  we must believe what moses tells us  but we must ask st john to show us more than moses saw  moses tells us that god created the heavens and the earth st john goes further and tells us what that god is like how he saw christ the word of god by whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made that is made  and what was he like  he was the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person  and what was that like was there any darkness in himmeanness grudging cruelty changeableness deceit no  he was full of grace and truth  grace and truth  that is what christ is and therefore that is what god is  there was another aspect of him true and st john saw that likewise  and so awful was it that he fell at the lords feet as he had been dead  but the lord was still full of grace and truth still however awful he was he was as full as ever of love pity gentleness  he was the lamb that was slain for the sins of the world even though that lamb was in the midst of the throne from which came forth thunderings and lightnings and judgments against the sins of all the world terrible to wrong and to the doers of wrong  but most loving and merciful to all true penitents who cast themselves and the burden of their sins before his feet perfect justice and perfect lovethat is god  that is the maker of this world  that is he who in the beginning made heaven and earth  an utterly good god  a god whose mercy is over all his creatures  a god who desires the good of his creatures who willeth not that one little one should perish who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth who wages everlasting war against sin and folly and wrong and misery and all the ills to which men are heirs who not only made the world but loves the world and who proved thatwhat a proof by not sparing his onlybegotten son but freely giving him for us  therefore we can say not merelyi know that a god made the world but i know what that god is like  i know that he is not merely a great god a wise god but a good god that goodness is his very essence  i know that he is gracious and merciful long suffering and of great kindness  i know that he is loving to every man and that his mercy is over all his works  i know that he upholds those who fall and lifts up those who are down i know that he careth for the fatherless and widow and executes judgment and justice for all those who are oppressed with wrong  i know that he will fulfil the desire of those who call upon him and will also hear their cry and will help them  i know in short that he is a living god and a loving god a god in whom men may trust to whom they may open their hearts as children to their father  and i am sure that those who come to him he will in no wise cast out for he himself has said with human voice upon this earth of ourscome unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  in him all can trust  the sick man on his bed can trust in him and sayin the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and he is full of grace and truth  this sickness of mine comes by the laws of heaven and earth and those laws are gods laws  then even this sickness may be full of grace and truth  it comes by no blind chance but by the will of him who so loved me that he stooped to die for me on the cross  christ my lord and god has some gracious and bountiful purpose in it some lesson for me to learn from it  i will ask him to teach me that lesson and i trust in him that he will teach me and that even for this sickness and this sorrow i shall have cause to thank him in the world to come  shall i not trust him who not only made this world but so loved it that he stooped to die for it upon the cross  the labourer and the farmer can trust in him in the midst of short crops and bad seasons and say in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and he is full of grace and truth  frost and blight obey his commands as well as sunshine and plenty  he knows best what ought to be  shall we not trust in him who not only made this world but so loved it that he stooped to die for it upon the cross  the scholar and the man of science studying the wonders of this earth can trust in him and say in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and he is full of grace and truth  many things puzzle me and the more i learn the less i find i really know but i shall know as much as is good for me and for mankind  god is full of grace and will not grudge me knowledge and full of truth and will not deceive me  and i shall never go far wrong as long as i believe not only in one god the father almighty maker of all things visible and invisible but in one lord jesus christ his only begotten son light of light very god of very god by whom all things were made who for us men and our salvation came down and died and rose again whose kingdom shall have no end who rules over every star and planet every shower and sunbeam every plant and animal and stone every body and every soul of man who will teach men in his good time and way all that they need know in order to multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it in this life and attain everlasting life in the world to come  and for the rest puzzled though i be shall i not trust him who not only made this world but so loved it that he stooped to die for it upon the cross    sermon xithe armour of god    preached before the prince of wales at sandringham january 20th 1867  ephesians vi 11  put on the whole armour of god  st paul again and again compares himself and the christians to whom he writes to soldiers and their lives to warfare  and it was natural that he should do so  everywhere he went in those days he would find roman soldiers ruling over men of different races from themselves and ruling them on the whole well  greeks syrians jews egyptiansall alike in his days obeyed the roman soldiers who had conquered the then known world  and st paul and his disciples wished to conquer the world likewise the roman soldier had conquered it for caesar  st paul would conquer it for christ  the roman soldier had used bodily forcethe persuasion of the sword  st paul would use spiritual forcethe persuasion of preaching  the roman soldier wrestled against flesh and blood  st paul wrestled against more subtle and dangerous enemiesspiritual enemies he calls themwho enslaved and destroyed the reason and conscience and morals of men  st paul and his disciples i say had set before themselves no less a task than to conquer the world  therefore he says they must copy the roman soldier and put on their armour as he put on his  he took caesars armour and put on caesars uniform  they must take the armour of god that they may withstand in the evil day of danger and battle and having done all done their duty manfully as good soldiersstand keep their ranks and find themselves at the end of the battle not scattered and disorganized but in firm and compact order like the roman soldiers who by drill and discipline had conquered the irregular and confused troops of all other nations  let me this morning explain st pauls words to you one by one we shall find them full of lessonsand right wholesome lessonsfor in this parable of the armour of god st paul sketches what you and i and every man should be  he sketches the character of a good man a true man a man after gods own heart  first the christians are to gird their loinsto cover the lower part of their body which is the most defenceless  that the roman soldier did with a kilt much like that which the highlanders wear now  and that garment was to be truth  truthfulness honesty that was to be the first defence of a christian man instead of being as too many socalled christians make it the very last  honesty before all other virtues was to gird his very loins was to protect his very vitals  the breastplate which covered the upper part of the body was to be righteousnesswhich we now commonly call justice  to be a just man after being first a truthful man was the christians duty  and his helmet was to be the hope of salvationthat is of safety not merely of being saved in the next worldthough of course st paul includes thatbut of being saved in this world of coming safe through the battle of life of succeeding of conquering the heathen round them and making them christians instead of being conquered by them  the hope of safety was to be his helmet to guard his head the thinking part  we all know how a blow on the head confuses and paralyses a man making him as we say lose his head  we know too how in spiritual matters terror and despair deal a deadly blow to a mans mindhow if a man expects to fail he cannot think clearly and calmlyhow often desperation and folly go hand in hand for if a man loses hope he is but too apt to lose his reason  the christians helmet thenthat which would save his head and keep his mind calm prudent strong and activewas the hope of success  and for their feetthey must be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace  that is a grand saying if you will remember that the keyword which explains it all is peace and the gospel that is the good news thereof  the roman soldier had his preparation which kept him prepared and ready to march through the world and of that st paul was thinking and had need to think for he had heard the sound of it in every street on every high road from jerusalem to ephesus ever since he was a childthe tramp of the heavy nailed boot which the roman soldier always wore  the roman soldiers were proud of their boots so proud that in st pauls time they nicknamed one of their royal princes caligula because as a boy in camp he used to wear boots like the common soldiers  and he bore that name when he became emperor and bears it to this day  and they had reason to be proud after their own notion of glory  for that boot had carried them through desert and through cities over mountain ranges through trackless forests from africa even into britain here to be the conquerors of the then known world and wherever the tramp of that boot had been heard it had been the sound not of the good news of peace but of the evil news of war  isaiah of old watching for the deliverance of the jews from captivity heard in the spirit the footsteps of the messengers coming with the news that cyrus was about to send the jews home to their own land and cried how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that bring good tidings that publish peace  but the tramp of the roman armies had as yet brought little but bad tidings and published destruction  men slain in battle women and children driven off captive villages burnt towns sacked and ruined till wherever their armies passedas one of their own writers has saidthey made a desert and then called that peace  so had the roman soldier marched over the world and conquered it and now christs soldiers were beginning their march over the world that they might conquer it by fulfilling isaiahs prophecy  they were going forth with their feet shod with the good news of peace to treat all men not as their enemies not as their slaves but as their brothers and to bring them good news and bid them share in itthe good news that god was at peace with them and that they might now be at peace with their own consciences and at peace with each other for all were brothers in jesus christ their lord  shod with that good news of peace these christians were going to conquer the world and to penetrate into distant lands from which the roman armies had been driven back in shameful defeat  to penetrate too where the roman armies never cared to goamong the miserable and crowded lanes of the great cities and conquer there what the roman armies could not conquerthe vice the misery the cruelty the idolatry of the heathen  the shield again guarded those parts of the soldier which the armour did not guard  it warded off the stones arrows and darts fiery darts often as st paul says which were hurled at him from afar  and the christians shield st paul says was to be faith trust in godbelief that he was fighting gods battle and not his own belief that god was over him in the battle and would help and guide him and give him strength to do his work  to believe firmly that he was in the right and on gods side  to believe that when he was wounded and struck downwhen men deserted him cursed him tried to take his lifeperhaps did take his lifewith torments unspeakableto have faith to say in his heart i am in the right when he was writhing under the truly fiery darts of misrepresentation slander scorn or under the equally fiery darts of remorse for his own mistakes his own weaknesses still to say after all i am in the right  that shield of faith though it might not save him from wounds torturing wounds perhaps crippling wounds would at least save his lifeat least protect his vitals and when he seemed stricken to the very earth he could still shelter himself under that shield of faith and cry rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise  and they were to take a sword  they were to use only one weapon as the roman soldier used but one  for though he went into battle armed with a short heavy pike he hurled it at once against the enemy then he closed in with his sword and fought the real battle with that alone hand to hand and knee to knee  the short roman sword used by brave men in close fight had defeated all the weapons of all the nations  st paul knew that fact as well as we and i cannot but suppose that he had it in his mind when he wrote these great words and that he meant to bid christians when they fought gods battle to fight like the romans hand to hand  not to indulge in cowardly stratagems intrigues and lawyers quibbles fighting like the barbarians cowardly and afar off hurling stones and shooting clouds of arrows but to grapple with their enemies looking them boldly in the face as honest men should do trying their strength against them fairly and striking them to the heart but with what  with that sword which if it wound heals likewise if it kills also makes alive the sword which slays the sins of a man that he may die to sin but rise again to righteousness the sword of the spirit which is the word of god the message of god the speech of god the commandment of god  they were to conquer the world simply by saying thus saith the lord  they were to preach god and god alone revealed in his son jesus christ a god of love who willed that none should perish but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth  but a god of wrath likewise  we must never forget that  a merely indulgent god would be an unjust god and a cruel god likewise  if god be just as he is then he has boundless pity for those who are weak  but boundless wrath for the strong who misuse the weak boundless pity for those who are ignorant misled and out of the right way  but boundless wrath for those who mislead them and put them out of the right way  all through st pauls epistles as through our blessed lords sayings and doings you see this wholesome mixture of severity and mercy of divine anger and divine love very different from the sentimentalism of our own times when men fancy that because they dislike the pain and trouble of punishing evil doers god is even such a one as themselves who sits still and takes no heed of the wrong which is done on earth  no  the christians were to tell men of both sides of gods character for both were working every day and all day long about them  they were to tell men that god had by their mouths revealed from heaven his wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men at the same moment that he had revealed the good news that men might be purified by the blood of christ and saved from wrath through him  they were to tell men of a god who so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son to die for it but of a god who so loved the world that he would not tolerate in it those sins which cause the ruin of the world  tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil and glory honour and peace to every man that worketh goodthat was to be their message that was to be their weapon wherewith they were to strike and did strike through the hearts of sinners and convert them to repentance that they might die to sin and live again to righteousness  with this armour and that one weapon the word of god the christians conquered the souls of the men of the old world  often they failed often they were defeated sadly and shamefully for they were men of like passions with ourselves  but their defeats always happened when they tried other armour than the armour of god and fancied that they could fight the world the flesh and the devil with the weapons which the world the flesh and the devil had forged  still they conquered at lastfor god was with them and the spirit of god and they put on again and again the armour of god after they had cast it off for a while to their own hurt  and so shall we conquer in the battle of life just in proportion as we fight our battle with the armour of god  my friends each and all of you surely wish to succeed in life and to succeed not merely in getting money still less merely in getting pleasure but with a far nobler and far more real success  you wish i trust to be worthy virtuous respectable useful christian men and women to be honoured while you live and regretted when you die to leave this world with the feeling that your life has not been a failure and your years given you in vain  but that having done some honest work at least in this world you are going to a world where all injustice shall be set right  then here in st pauls words are the elements of success in life this and this only is the way to true success to put on the whole armour of god  truthfulness justice peaceableness faith in gods justice and mercy hope of success and the sword of the spirit even that word of god which if you do not preach it to others you can and should preach to yourselves all day long continually asking yourselves what would god have me to do  what is likely to be his will and message upon the matter which i have in handall these qualities go to make up the character of the worthy man or woman the useful person the truly able person who does what he can do well because he is what he ought to be good and all these qualities you need if you will fight the battle of life like men and conquer instead of being conquered therein  but some will say and with truth it is easy to tell us to be good we can no more change our own character than we can change our own bodies the question is who will make us good  who indeed save he who said ask and ye shall receive  st paul knew well enough that if his armour was gods armour god alone could forge it and god alone could bestow it and therefore he ends his commands with this last commandpraying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints  those who wrote the church catechism knew it likewise and have said to us from our very childhood  my good child know this  that thou canst not do these things of thyself nor walk in the commandments of god and serve him without his special grace which thou must learn at all times to call for by diligent prayer  yes my friends there is but one way to obtain that armour of god which will bring us safe through the battle of life and that is pray for it  ask and it shall be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you  you who wish for true success in life pray  pray if you never prayed before morning and evening with your whole hearts for that spirit of god which is truth justice peace faith and hopeand you shall not pray in vain    sermon xiipaul and felix    acts xxiv 25  and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee  this is a wellknown text on which many a sermon has been preached and with good reason for it is an important text  it tells us of a man who like too many men in all times trembled when he heard the truth about his wicked life but did not therefore repent and mend and a very serious lesson we may draw from his example  but even a more important fact about the text is that it tells us what were really the fundamental doctrines of the christian religion in those early times about twentyfive years seemingly after our lords death what st paul used to preach about what he considered was the first thing which he had to tell men  let us take this latter question first  about what did st paul reason before felix  about righteousness which means justice temperance and judgment to come  i beg you to remember these words  if you believe the bible to be inspired you are bound to take its words as they stand  and therefore i beg you to remember that st paul preached not about unrighteousness but righteousness not about intemperance but about temperance not about hell but about judgment to come in a word not about wrong but about right  i hope that does not seem to you a small matter  i hope that none of you are ready to say it comes to the same thing in the end  it does not come to the same thing there is no use in telling a man what is wrong unless you first tell him what is right  there is no use rebuking a man for being bad unless you first tell him how he may become better and give him hope for himself or you will only drive him to recklessness and despair you must show him the right road before you can complain of him for going the wrong one  but if st paul had reasoned with felix about injustice intemperance and hell one could not have been surprised  for felix was a thoroughly bad man unjust and intemperate and seemingly fitting himself for hell  he had begun life as a slave of the emperor in a court which was a mere sink of profligacy and villainy  then he had got his freedom and next the governorship of judaea probably by his brother pallass interest who had been a slave like him and had made an enormous fortune by the most detestable wickedness  when in his governorship felix began to show himself as wicked as his brother  the violence misrule extortion and cruelty which went on in judaea was notorious  he caused the highpriest at jerusalem to be murdered out of spite  drusilla his wife he had taken away from a syrian king who was her lawful husband  making money seems to have been his great object and the great roman historian of those times sums up his character in a few bitter words thus  felix he says exercised the power of a king with the heart of a slave in all cruelty and lust  such was the wicked upstart whom god for the sins of the jews had allowed to rule them in st pauls time and before him st paul had to plead for his life  the first time that st paul came before him felix seems to have seen at once that paul was innocent and a good man and that perhaps was the reason why he sent for him again and strangely enough heard him concerning the faith in christ  there was some conscience left it seems in the wretched man  he was not easy amid his illgotten honour illgotten wealth ill gotten pleasures and perhaps as many men are in such a case he was superstitious afraid of being punished for his sins and looking out for false prophets smooth preachers new religions which would make him comfortable in his sins and drug his conscience by promising the wicked man life where god had not promised it  so he wanted it seems to know what this new faith in christ was like and he heard  and what he heard we may very fairly guess because we know from st pauls writings what he was in the habit of saying  st paul told him of righteousnessa word of which he was very fond he told felix of a righteous and good god who had manifested to man his righteousness and goodness in the righteousness and goodness of his son jesus a righteous god who wished to make all men righteous like himself that they might be happy for ever  perhaps st paul called felix to give up all hopes of having his own righteousness the false righteousness of forms and ceremonies and superstitions and to ask for the righteousness of christ which is a clean heart and a right spirit and then he set before him no doubt as was his custom the beauty of righteousness the glory of it as st paul calls it how noble honourable divine godlike a thing it is to be good  then st paul told felix of temperance  and what he said we may fairly guess from his writings  he would tell felix that there were two elements in every man the flesh and the spirit and that those warred against each other  the flesh trying to drag him down that he may become a brute in fleshly lusts and passions the spirit trying to raise him up that he may become a son of god in purity and virtue  but if so what need must there be of temperance  how must a man be bound to be temperate to keep under his body and bring it into subjection bound to restrain the lower and more brutal feelings in him that the higher and purer feelings may grow and thrive in him to everlasting life  truly the temperate man the man who can restrain himself is the only strong man the only safe man the only happy man the only man worthy of the name of man at all  this or something like this st paul would have said to felix  he did not as far as we know rebuke him for his sins  he left him to rebuke himself  he told him what ought to be what he ought to do and left the rest to his conscience  poor felix brought up a heathen slave in that profligate court of rome had probably never heard of righteousness and temperance had never had what was good and noble set before him  now st paul set the good before him and showed him a higher life than any he had ever dreamed ofhigher than all his viceregal power and pompand bade him see how noble and divine it was to be good  but it is written st paul reasoned with felix about judgment to come  we must not too hastily suppose that this means that he told felix that he was in danger of hellfire  for that is an argument which st paul never uses anywhere in his writings or speeches as far as we know them  he never tries as too many do nowadays to frighten sinners into repentance by telling them of the flames of hell and therefore we have no right to fancy that he did so by felix  he told him of judgment to come and we can guess from his writings what he would have said  that there was a living god who judged the earth always by his son jesus christ and that he was coming then immediately to punish all the horrible wickedness which was then going on in those parts of the world which st paul knew  st paul always speaks of the terrible judgments of god as about to come in his own days we know that they did come  we knowgod forbid that a preacher should tell you onetenth of what he ought to knowthat st pauls times were the most horribly wicked that the world had ever seen that the few heathens who had consciences left felt that some terrible punishment must come if the world went on as it was going  and we know that the punishment did come and that for about twenty years towards the end of which st paul was beheaded the great roman empire was verily a hell on earth if felix lived ten years more he saw the judgment of god and the vengeance of god in a way which could not be mistaken  but did judgment to come overtake him in his life  we do not altogether know we know that he committed such atrocities that the roman emperor nero was forced to recall him that the chief jews of caesarea sent to rome and there laid such accusations against him that he was in danger of death that his brother pallas who was then in boundless power saved him from destruction  that shortly afterwards pallas himself was disgraced stripped of his offices and a few years later poisoned by nero and it is probable enough that when he fell felix fell with him  but we know nothing of it certainly  but at least he saw with his own eyes that there was such a thing as judgment to come not merely thousands of years hence at the last day but there and then in his own lifetime  he saw the wrath of god revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men  he saw the wicked murdering and destroying each other till the land was full of blood  he saw the empressmother agrippina who had been the paramour of his brother pallas murdered by her own son the emperor nero and so judgment came on her  he saw his own brother first ruined and then poisoned and so judgment came on him  he saw many a man whom he knew well and who had been mixed up with him and his brother in their intrigues put to death himself and so judgment came on them  and last of all he saw unless he had died beforehand the fall of the emperor nero himselfwho very probably set fire to rome and then laid the blame on the christiansthe man of sin of whom st paul prophesied that he would be revealedthat is unveiled and exposed for the monster which he was and that the lord would destroy him with the brightness of his coming the man who had dressed the christians in skins and hunted them with dogs who had covered them with pitch and burnt them who had beheaded st paul and crucified st peter who had murdered his own wife who had put to death every good man whom he could seize simply for being good who had committed every conceivable sin fault and cruelty that can disgrace a man while he made the people worship him as god  he saw that great emperor nero hunted down by his own people who were weary of his crimes condemned to a horrible death hiding in a filthy hole and at last stabbing himself in despair and so judgment came on him likewise while the very heathen felt that nero was gone to hell leaving his name behind him as a proverb of wickedness and cruelty for ever  so felix if he were alive saw judgment come  and yet more  he saw if he were alive such a time follow as the world has seldom or never seencivil war bloodshed lawlessness plunder and every horror a time in which men longed to die and could not find death and instead of repenting of their evil deeds gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the god of heaven as st john had prophesied in the revelation  yes if felix lived only ten years after he trembled at st pauls words he saw enough to show him that those words were true that there was a god in heaven whose wrath was revealed against all unrighteousness of men who was coming out of his place to judge the earth and punish all the tyranny and pride and profligacy and luxury of that roman world  god grant that he did remember st pauls words  god grant that he trembled once more and to good purpose and so repented of his sins even at the last  god grant that he may find mercy in that day  but we can have but little hope for him it is but too probable that he was put to death with his brother within five years of the time when st paul warned him of judgment to cometoo probable that that was his last chance of salvation and that he threw it away for ever as too many sinners do  what do we learn then from this sad story  we learn one most practical and important lesson which we are all too apt to forget  that the foundation of the christian religion is not forms and ceremonies nor fancies and feelings but righteousness temperance and judgment to come  judgment i say to come whensoever it may seem good to christ who sits for ever on his throne judging right and ministering true judgment among the people  a dreadful judgment says the commination service is always hanging over the heads of those who do wrong and always ready to fall on them without waiting for the last day thousands of years hence  it was by telling men thatby telling them that christ was righteous and pure and desired to make them righteous and pure like himself and that christ was a living and present judge watching all their actions ready at any moment to forgive their sins and ready at any moment to punish their sinsby that message the apostles converted the heathen  it was by believing that message and becoming righteous and good men temperate and pure men and looking up in faith and hope to christ their everpresent judge and lord that the heathen were converted and became saints and martyrs  and that religion will stand and bring a man through the storm safe to everlasting life while all religions which are built on doctrines and systems on forms and ceremonies on fancies and feelings on the godless notion that sinners are safe enough in this life for god will not judge and punish them till the last day are built on a foundation of sand and the storm when it comes will sweep those dreams away and leave their possessors to shame and misery  therefore my friends let no man deceive you  god is not mocked what a man soweth that shall he reap  the wages of sin are death as felix found too well but the fruit of righteousness is everlasting life through jesus christ our lord  therefore follow after innocency and take heed to the thing which is right for that and that only shall bring a man peace at the last    sermon xiiithe good samaritan    luke x 33 34  but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was  and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him  no words perhaps ever spoken on earth have had more effect than those of this parable  they are words of power and of spirit living words which have gone forth into the hearts and lives of men and borne fruit in them of a hundred different kinds  truly their sound is gone out into all lands and their words to the ends of the world for a proof that christ who spake them said truly when he said the flesh profiteth nothing it is the spirit which maketh alive the words which i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life  what was the power and the spirit of this parable  what gave it its strength in the hearts of men  thisthat it told them that they were to help their fellowmen simply because they were their fellow men  not because they were of the same race the same religion the same sect or party but simply because they were men  in a word it commanded men to be humane to exercise humanity which signifies kindness to human beings simply because they are human beings  one can understand our lord preaching that  it was part and parcel of his doctrine  he called himself the son of man  he showed what he meant by calling himself so by the widest and most tender humanity  but his was quite a new doctrine and a new practice likewise  the jews had no notion of humanity  all but themselves were common and unclean  they might not even eat with a man who was a gentile  all mankind save themselves they thought were accursed and doomed to hell  they lived as st paul told them hateful to and hated by all mankind  there was no humanity in them  the greek again despised all nations but his own as barbarians  he would mix with them eat with them work for them but he only looked on the rest of mankind as stupid savages out of whom he was to make money by the basest and meanest arts  there was no humanity in him  the romans again were a thoroughly inhuman people  their calling they held was to conquer all the nations of the earth to plunder them to enslave them  they were the great slaveholding man stealing people  mercy was a virtue which they had utterly forgotten  their public shows and games were mere butcheries of blood and torture  to see them fight to death in their theatres pairs after pairs sometimes thousands in one day was the usual and regular amusement  and in that great city of rome which held something more than a million human beings there was not as far as i am aware one single hospital or other charitable institution of any kind  there was in a word no humanity in them  but the gospel changed all that miraculously and suddenly both in jew in greek and in roman  when men became christians at st pauls preaching all the old barriers of race were broken down between them  they said no more i am a roman i a greek i a jew but i am a christian man and because i am a christian roman and greek and jew are alike my brothers  there was seen such a sight as so far as we know was never seen before on earththe highborn white lady worshipping by the side of her own negro slave the proud and selfish roman who never had helped a human being in his life sending his alms to the churches of syria or of some other country far away the clever and educated greek learning from the jew whom he called a barbarian and the jew who had hated all mankind and been hated by them in return preaching to all mankind the good news that they were brothers in the name and for the sake of jesus christ the son of man  instead of a kingdom of division the church was a kingdom of union charity and generosity and mutual help took the place of selfishness and distrust and oppression  while men had been heathens their pattern had been that of the priest who saw the wounded man lying and looked on him and passed by  their pattern now was that of the good samaritan who helped and saved the wounded stranger simply because he was a man  in one word the new thing which the gospel brought into the world washumanity  the thing which the gospel keeps in the world still is humanity  it brought other things and blessed things but this it brought  and why  because through the church was poured on men the spirit of god  and what is that save humanitythe spirit of the compassionate all generous son of manthe spirit of charity and love  what were the woes of humanity to the heathen  if a man fell in the race of life so much the worse for him  so much the better for them for there was one more competitor out of the way  one of the greatest roman poets indeed talks of the pleasure which men have in seeing others in trouble just as when the storm is tossing up the sea it is sweet to sit on the shore and watch the ships labouring in the waves  not he says that one takes actual pleasure in seeing a man in trouble but in the thought that one is not in the trouble oneself  a rather lame excuse i think for a rather inhuman sentiment  yes the heathen could feel pleasure in being safe while others were afflicted  and indeed our own fallen nature if we give way to it will tempt us to the same sin  but how did men begin to look not only on the afflictions but on the interest on the feelings on the consciences of their neighbours when they began to be led by the spirit of christ  let st paul speak for himself not in one text only but in a hundredthough i be free from all i have made myself a servant to alla jew to the jews a greek to the greeks strong to the strong weak to the weak all things to all men if by any means i might save some  whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation  for the love of christ constraineth us for he died for all that those who live should henceforth not live to themselves but to him  and what did he mean by living to christliving in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness beside that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the church  who is weak and i am not weak  who is offended and i burn notoh who does not see in such words as these the picture of a new ideal a new life for man even a life of utter sympathy with his fellowmen utter love and selfsacrificein one word utter humanity as far above that old heathen poets selfish notion as man is above the ape or heaven above the earth  this is the spirit of god even the holy ghost the spirit of christ which also is the spirit of humanity because it is the spirit of christ who is both god and man both human and divine  this is the spirit of love by which god created mankind and all the worlds that he might have something which was not himself whereon to spend his boundless love  this is the spirit of love by which he spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for the sins of all mankind  this is the spirit of love by which he is leading mankind through strange paths and by ways which their fathers knew not toward that eternal city of god which all truly human hearts are seeking blindly often and confusedly and sometimes by utterly mistaken paths  but seeking her still if by any means they may enter into her and be at peace  this is that spirit of love by which having sent forth all souls out of his everlasting bosom he will draw them home again in the fulness of time as many as have eternal life in jesus christ our lord into his bosom once more that they may rest in peace and god be all in all  take comfort from these words my friends for there is deep comfort to be found in them if you will look at them aright  when you hear that the spirit of god is in you unless you are reprobates and that if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of hisdo not be afraid as if that spirit were something quite unlike anything which you feel or even think of  as if it was something which must show itself in strange visions or peculiar experiences which very few persons have and which tempt them to set themselves apart from their fellowmen and thank god that they are not as other men are remember that the spirit of god is the spirit of christ and that the spirit of christ is the spirit by which the good samaritan helped the poor wounded man simply because he was a man  remember that the spirit of god so far from making you unlike a man comes to make you more perfect men so far from parting you from your fellowmen comes to knit you more to your fellowmen by making you understand them feel for them make allowances for them long to help them however different in habits or in opinions they may be from you that it is in one word the spirit of humanity which comes down from heaven into your hearts to make you humane as it descended on christ that he might be the most humane of all human beingsthe very son of man who knew understood loved suffered for and redeemed all mankind because in him all humanity was gathered into one  that spirit is not far from any of you  surely he is in all your hearts already if you be worthy of the name of men  he is in you unless you be inhuman and that i trust none of you are  from him come every humane thought and feeling you ever had  all kindliness pity mercy generosity all sense or justice and honour toward your fellowmen all indignation when you hear of their being wronged tortured enslaved all desire to help the fallen to right the oppressedwhence do these come  from the world  most surely not from the flesh  st paul says not  from the devil  no one i trust will say that save his own children the pharisees if there be any of them left which we will hope there are not  no all these come from the gracious spirit of humanitythe spirit of christ and of god  pray to him that he may take possession of all your thoughts feelings and desires and purge you from every taint of selfishness  give up your hearts to him and grieve not by any selfishness passion or hardness of your own his gracious instructions  but let him teach you and guide you and purge you and sanctify you till you come to the stature of a perfect man to the fulness of the measure of christ who could perfectly hate the sin and yet perfectly love the sinner who could see in every man even in his enemies and murderers a friend and a brother  and you who are afflicted remember that if the spirit of humanity be the spirit of christ the spirit of christ is also the spirit of humanity  what do i mean  this  that if that good samaritan had christs spirit was like christ then christ has the same spirit and is like that good samaritan utterly humane for mere humanitys sake  yes thou who art weary and heavy ladenthou who fanciest at moments that the lords arm is shortened that it cannot save and art ready to cry my god my god why hast thou forsaken metake comfort and look upon christ  thou wilt never be sure of the love of god unless thou rememberest that it is the same as the love of christ and by looking at christ learnest to know thy father and his father whose likeness and image he is and see that the spirit which proceeds alike from both of them is the spirit of humanity and love which cannot help going forth to seek and to save thee simply because thou art lost  look i say at christ and be sure that what he bade the good samaritan do to the wounded traveller that same will he do to thee because he is the son of man human and humane  art thou robbed wounded deserted left to die worsted in the battle of life and fallen in its rugged road with no counsel no strength no hope no purpose left  then remember that there is one walking to and fro in this world unseen but ever present whose form is as the form of the son of man  to him is given all power to execute judgment in heaven and earth because he is the son of man  he is beholding the nations and fashioning all their hearts  even as i speak now he is pouring contempt on princes and making the counsels of the people of no effect  even now he is frustrating the tokens of the liars and making diviners mad  he is smiting asunder mighty nations and filling the lands with dead bodies  even now he is coming as he came of old from bozra treading down the people in his anger and making them dumb in his fury and their blood is sprinkled on his garments and he hath stained all his raiment  for the day of vengeance is in his heart and the year of his redeemed is come  he who ariseth terribly to shake the nations has he time has he will to turn aside to attend to such as thee  he has time and he has will  no human being so mean no human sorrow too petty but what he has the time and the will as well as the power to have mercy on it because he is the son of man therefore he will turn aside even to thee whoever thou art who art weary and heavy laden and canst find no rest for thy soul at the very moment and in the very manner which is best for thee  when thou hast suffered long enough he will stablish strengthen settle thee  he will bind up thy wounds and pour in the oil and the wine of his spiritthe holy ghost the comforter and will carry thee to his own inn whereof it is written he shall hide thee secretly in his own presence from the provoking of men he shall keep thee in his tabernacle from the strife of tongues  he will give his servants charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and when he comes again he will repay them and fetch thee away to give thee rest in that eternal bosom of the father from which thou like all human souls camest forth at first and to which thou shalt at last return with all human souls who have in them that spirit of humanity which is the spirit of god and of christ and of eternal life    sermon xivconsider the lilies of the field    preached on easter day 1867  matthew vi 26 28 29  behold the fowls of the air  for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them  are ye not much better than they    and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin  and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these  what has this text to do with easterday  let us think a while life and death the battle between life and death life conquered by death and death conquered again by life  those were the mysteries over which the men of old time thought often till their hearts were sad  they saw that they were alive and they loved life and would fain see good days  they saw again that they must die  but would death conquer life in them  would they ever live again  they saw that other things died or seemed to die and yet rose and lived again and that gave them hope for themselves at times but their hopes were very dim till christ came and brought life and immortality to light  they saw i say that other things died or seemed to die and yet lived again  light rose out of darkness every morning and lived but darkness as they thought killed the light at even till it came to life again in the morning and the sun rose once more  the sun himselfthey thought of him as a glorious and lifegiving being who every morning fought his way up the sky scattering the dark clouds with his golden arrows and reigning for awhile in heaven pouring down heat and growth and life  but he too must die  the dark clouds of evening must cover him  the red glare upon them was his dying blood  the twilight which lingered after the sun was gone was his bride the dawn come to soothe his dying hour  true he had come to life again often and often morning after morning  but would it be so for ever  would not a night come at last after which he would never rise again  would not he be worn out at last and slain in his long daily battle with the kingdom of darkness which lay below the world or with the dragon who tried to devour him when the thunder clouds hid him from the sight or the eclipse seemed to swallow him up before their eyes  so too they felt about the seasons of the year  the winter came the sun grew low and weak  would he not die  the days grew short and dark  would they not cease to be and eternal night come on the earth  they had heard dimly of the dark northern land where it was always winter and the night was six months long  why should it not be so in their own land in some evil time  every autumn the rains and frost came on the leaves fell the flowers withered the birds fled southward or died of hunger and cold the cattle starved in the field the very men had much ado to live  why should not winter conquer at last and shut up the sun the god of light and warmth and life for ever in the place of darkness cold and death  so thought the old syrians of canaan and taught the jewish women to weep as they themselves wept every autumn over adonai the lord which was another name for the sun slain as they thought by the winter cold and rain  and then when springtime came with its sunshine flowers and birds rejoiced that the sun had come to life again  so thought the old greeks and told how persephone the fair maiden who was the springtime was stolen away by the king of darkness who lived beneath the earth and how her mother earth would not be comforted for her loss but sent barrenness on all the world till her daughter the spring was given back to her to dwell for six months in the upper world of light and six months in the darkness under ground  so thought our old forefathers and told how baldur the baal of the bible the god of light and heat who was likewise the sun was slain by treachery and imprisoned for ever below in hell the kingdom of darkness and of cold and how all things on earth even the very trees and stones wept for his death  yet all their tears could not bring back from death the god of life  nor any of the gods unlock the gates which held him in  and because our forefathers were a sad and earnest folk  because they lived in a sad and dreary climate where winter was far longer and more bitter than it is thank god now therefore all their thoughts about winter and spring were sad and they grew to despair at last of life ever conquering death or light conquering darkness an age would come they said in which snow should fall from the four corners of the world and the winters be three winters long an evil age of murder and adultery and hatred between brethren when all the ties of kin would be rent asunder and wickedness should triumph on the earth  then should come that dark time which they called the twilight of the gods  then the powers of evil would be let loose the earth would go to ruin in darkness and in flame  all living things would die  the very gods would die fighting to the last against the powers of evil till the sun should sink for ever and the world be a heap of ashes  and thenso strangely does gods gift of hope linger in the hearts of menthey saw beyond all that a dim dream of a new heaven and a new earth in which should dwell righteousness and of a new sun more beautiful than ours of a woman called life hid safe while all the world around her was destroyed fed on the morning dew preserved to be the mother of a new and happier race of men  and so to them heathens as they were god whispered that christ should some day bring life and immortality to light  my friends shall we sneer and laugh at all these dreams as mere follies of the heathen  if we do so we shall not show the spirit of god or the mind of christ  nor shall we show our knowledge of the bible  in it the spirit of god who inspired the bible does not laugh at these dreams  it rebukes them sternly whenever they are immoral and lead men to do bad and foul deeds as ezekiel rebuked the jewish women who wept for thammuz the dead summer  but that was because those jewish women should have known better  they should have knownwhat the old testament tells us all throughwhat it was especially meant to tell the men who lived while it was being written just because they had their fancies and their fears about summer and winter and life and death  and what ought they to have known  what does the old testament say  that life will conquer death because god the lord jehovah even jesus christ is lord of heaven and earth  from the time that it was written in the book of genesis that the lord jehovah said in his heart i will not again curse the ground for mans sake  neither will i again smite any more anything living as i have done while the earth remainethseed time and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not ceasefrom that time the jews were bound not to fear the powers of nature or the seasons nor to fear for them for they were all in the government of that one good god and lord who cared for men and loved them and dealt justly by them and proved his love and justice by bringing the children of israel out of the land of egypt   god treated these heathens st paul says as we ought to treat our children  his wrath was revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men  all wilful disobedience and actual sin he punished often with terrible severity but not their childish mistakes and dreams about how this world was made just as we should not punish the fancies of our children  the times of that ignorance says st paul he winked at till christ came and then he commanded all men everywhere to repent and believe in the god who gave them rain and fruitful seasons filling their hearts with food and gladness  for he had appointed a day in which he would judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he had ordained of which he had given full assurance to all men in that he had raised him from the dead  some who were spoilt by false philosophy mocked when they heard of the resurrection of the dead  but there were those who had kept something of the simple childlike faith of their forefathers and who were prepared for the kingdom of god and to them st pauls message came as an answer to the questions of their minds and a satisfaction to the longings of their hearts  the news of christof christ raised from the dead to be the life and the light of the worldstilled all their fears lest death should conquer life and darkness conquer light  so it was with all the heathen  so it was with our old forefathers when they heard and believed the gospel of christ  they felt that as st paul said they were translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light which was the kingdom of his dear son that now the world must look hopeful cheerful to them now they could live in hope of everlasting life now they need sorrow no more for those who slept as if they had no hope  for christ had conquered death and the evil spirit who had the power of death christ had harrowed hell and burst the bonds of the graves  he as man and yet god had been through the dark gate and had returned through it in triumph the firstborn from the dead and his resurrection was an everlasting sign and pledge that all who belonged to him should rise with him and death be swallowed up in victory  so it pleased the father says st paul to gather together in christ all things whether in heaven or in earth  in him were fulfilled and more than fulfilled the dim longings the childlike dreams of heathen poets and sages and of our own ancestors from whom we sprung  he is the desire of all nations for whom all were longing though they knew it not  he is the true sun the sun of righteousness who has arisen with healing on his wings and translated us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light he is the true adonai the lord for whose death though we may mourn upon good friday yet we rejoice this day for his resurrection  he is the true baldur the god of light and life who though he died by treachery and descended into hell yet needed not to deliver him the tears of all creation of men or angels or that any god should unlock for him the gates of death for he rose by his own eternal spirit of light and saith i am he that was dead and behold i am alive for evermore  amen  and i have the keys of death and hell  and now we may see it seems to me what the text has to do with easterday  to my mind our lord is using here the same parable which st paul preaches in his famous chapter which we read in the burial service  be not anxious says our lord for your life  is not the life more than meat  there is an eternal life which depends not on earthly food but on the will and word of god your father and that life in you will conquer death  behold the birds of the air which sow not nor reap nor gather into barns to provide against the winters need  but do they starve and die  does not god guide them far away into foreign climes and feed them there by his providence and bring them back again in spring as things alive from the dead and can he not feed us if it be his will with a bread which comes down from heaven and with every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of god  consider again the lilies of the field  we must take our lords words exactly  he is speaking of the lilies the bulbous plants which spring into flower in countless thousands every spring over the downs of eastern lands  all the winter they are dead unsightly roots hidden in the earth  what can come of them  but no sooner does the sun of spring shine on their graves than they rise into sudden life and beauty as it pleases god and every seed takes its own peculiar body  sown in corruption they are raised in incorruption sown in weakness they are raised in power sown in dishonour they are raised in glory delicate beautiful in colour perfuming the air with fragrance types of immortality fit for the crowns of angels  consider the lilies of the field how they grow for even so is the resurrection of the dead  yes not without a divine providenceyea a divine inspirationhas this blessed eastertide been fixed by the church of all ages at the season when the earth shakes off her winters sleep when the birds come back and the flowers begin to bloom when every seed which falls into the ground and dies and rises again with a new body is a witness to us of the resurrection of christ and a witness too that we shall rise again that in us as in it life shall conquer death when every bird which comes back to sing and build among us is a witness to us of the resurrection of christ and of our resurrection and that in us as in it joy shall conquer sorrow  the seed has passed through strange chances and dangers  of a thousand seeds shed in autumn scarce one survives to grow in spring be it so  still there is left as scripture says a remnant an elect to rise again and live  the birds likewisethey have been through strange chances dangers needs  far away south to africa they wentthe younger ones by a way they had never travelled before  thousands died in their passage south  thousands more died in their passage back again this spring by hunger and by storm  be it so  yet of them is left a seed a remnant an elect and they are saved to build once more in their old homes and to rejoice in the spring and pour out their songs to god who made them   some say that the seeds grow by laws of nature the birds come back by instinct  be it so  what scripture says and what we should believe is this  that the seeds grow by the spirit of god the lord and giver of life that the birds come back and sing and build by the spirit of god the lord and giver of life  he works not on them things without reason as he works on us reasonable souls  but he works on them nevertheless  they obey his call they do his will they show forth his glory they return to life they breed they are preserved by the same spirit by which the body of jesus rose from the dead and therefore every flower which blossoms and every bird which sings at eastertide everything which like the seeds was dead and is alive again which like the birds was lost and is found is a type and token of christ their maker who was dead and is alive again who was lost in hell on eastereve and was found again in heaven for evermore and the resurrection of the earth from her winters sleep commemorates to us as each blessed eastertide comes round the resurrection of our lord jesus christ who made all the world and redeemed all mankind and sanctifieth to eternal life all the elect people of god  a witness to us that some day life shall conquer death light conquer darkness righteousness conquer sin joy conquer grief when the whole creation which groaneth and travaileth in pain until now shall have brought forth that of which it travails in labour even the new heavens and the new earth wherein shall be neither sighing nor sorrow but god shall wipe away tears from all eyes    sermon xvthe jewish rebellions    1 peter ii 11  dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul  i think that you will understand the text and indeed the whole of st peters first epistle better if i explain to you somewhat the state of the eastern countries of the world in st peters time  the romans a short time before st peter was born had conquered all the nations round them and brought them under law and regular government  st peter now tells those to whom he wrote that they must obey the roman governors and their laws for the lords sake it was gods will and providence that the romans should be masters of the world at that time  jesus christ the lord the king of kings had so ordained it in his inscrutable wisdom and they must submit to it not for fear of the romans but for the lords sake as the servants of god who believed that he was governing the world by his son jesus christ and that he knew best how to govern it  that was a hard lesson for them to learn for they were jews  this epistle as the words of it show plainly was written for jews both for those who believed in the lord jesus christ as the true king of the jews and for those who ought to have believed in him but did not  they were strangers and pilgrims as st peter calls them who had no city or government of their own but had been scattered abroad among the gentiles and settled in all the great cities of the roman empire especially in the east  in babylon from which st peter wrote his epistle where the jews had a great settlement in the rich plains of the river euphrates in syria in asia minor which we now call turkey in asia  in persia and many other eastern lands  there they lived by trade very much as the jews live among us now and as long as they obeyed the roman law they were allowed to keep their own worship and their own customs and their law of moses and to have their synagogues in which they worshipped the true god every sabbathday  but evil times were coming on these prosperous jews wicked emperors of rome and profligate governors of provinces were about to persecute them  in alexandria in egypt hundreds of them had been destroyed by lingering tortures and thousands ruined and left homeless  caligula the mad emperor had gone further still fancying himself a god he had commanded that temples should be raised in his honour and his statues worshipped everywhere  he had even gone so far as to command that his statue should be set up in the temple of jerusalem and to do actually that which st paul prophesied a few years after the man of sin would do exalt himself over all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he would sit in the temple of god and show himself as god  then followed a strange scene which will help to explain much of this epistle of st peter  the jews of jerusalem did not rise in rebellion  they did what st peter told the jews of asia minor to do  they determined to suffer for welldoingto die as martyrs not as rebels  petronius the roman governor who was sent to carry out the order was a strange mixture of good and bad  he was a peculiarly profligate and luxurious man  he wrote one of the foulest books which ever disgraced the pen of man  but he was kindhearted humane rational  he had orders to set up the emperors statue in the temple at jerusalem and no doubt he laughed inwardly at the folly  but he must obey orders  yet he hesitated when he landed and saw the jews come to him in thousands covering the country like a cloud young and old rich and poor unarmed many clothed in sackcloth and with ashes on their heads and beseeching him that he would not commit this abomination  he rebuked them sternly  he had a whole army at his back and would compel them to obey  they answered that they must obey god rather than man  petroniuss heart relented he left his soldiers behind and went on to try the jews at tiberias  there he met a similar band  he tried again to be stern with them  all other nations had worshipped the emperors image why should not they  would they make war against their emperor  we have no thought of war they cried with one voice but we will submit to be massacred rather than break our law and at once the whole crowd fell with their faces to the earth and declared that they were ready to offer their throats to the swords of the roman soldiers  for forty days that scene lasted it was the time for sowing and the whole land lay untilled  petronius could do nothing with people who were ready to be martyrs but not rebels and he gave way  he excused himself to the mad emperor as he best could  he promised the jews that he would do all he could for them even at the risk of his own lifeand he very nearly lost his life in trying to save them but the thing tided over and the poor jews conquered as the christian martyrs conquered afterwards by resignation by that highest courage which shows itself not in anger but in patience and suffering instead of rebelling  well it had been for the jews elsewhere if they had been of the same mind  but near babylon just about the time st peter wrote his epistle the jews broke out in open rebellion  two jewish orphans who had been bred as weavers and ran away from a cruel master escaped into the marshes and there became the leaders of a great band of robbers  they defeated the governor of babylon in battle they went to the court of the heathen king of persia and became great men there  one of them had the other poisoned and then committed great crimes wasted the country of babylon with fire and sword and came to a miserable end being slaughtered in bed when in a drunken sleep  then the babylonians rose on all the jews and massacred them  the survivors fled to the great city of seleucia and mixed themselves up in party riots with the heathens the heathens turned on them and slew 50000 of them and so as st peter told them judgment began at the house of god  whether this massacre of the babylonian jews happened just before or just after st peter wrote his epistle from babylon we cannot tell but it is plain i think that either this matter or what led to it was in his mind  it seems most likely that it had happened a little before and that he wrote to the jews in the northeast of asia minor to warn them against giving way to the same lawless passions which had brought ruin and misery on the jews of babylon  for they were in great danger of falling into the same misery and ruin  the romans expected the jews to rebel all over the world and as it fell out they did rebel and perished in vast numbers miserably because they would not take st peters advice because they would not obey every ordinance of man for the lords sake because they would not honour all men  but looked on all men as the enemies of god  good for them it would have been had they taken st peters advice which was the only plan he said to save their souls and lives in those terrible times  good for them if they had believed st peters gospel when he told them that god had chosen them to obedience and purification by the blood of christ to an inheritance undefiled and that faded not away  he said that remember to all the jews whether christians or not st peter took for granted that christ was lord and king of all the jews whether they believed it or not  he did not say if you believe in christ then he is your king if not then he is not butbecause you are jews you are all christs subjects to him you owe faith loyalty and obedience  it was of him the old jewish prophets foretold and saw that their prophecies of christs coming would be fulfilled not in their own time but in your timein the time of the jews to whom he spoke  therefore they were to give up the foolish practices which had been handed down to them from their forefathers  therefore they were to give up fleshly lusts which warred against the soul and would only bring them to destruction therefore they were to be holy even as god was holy therefore they were to purify their souls in sincere brotherly love therefore they were to keep their conduct honourable among the gentiles that though they were now spoken against as evildoers they might see their good works and glorify god in the coming day of visitation therefore they were to submit to every ordinance of man for the lords sake and trust to christ their true king in heaven to deliver them from oppression and free them from injustice in his own good way and time  free men they were in the sight of god and unjustly enslaved by the romans  but they were not to make their being free men a cloak and excuse for malice and evil passions against the gentiles as too many of the jews were doing but remember that they were the servants of god and serve him and trust in him to deliver them in his own way and time by his son jesus christ  those jews who believed st peters gospel and good news that christ was their king and saviour kept their souls in peace  those jews who did not believe st peterand they unhappily for them were the far greater numberbroke out into mad rebellion again and perished in vast numbers till they were destroyed off the face of the earth as st peter had warned them by their own fleshly lusts which warred against the soul  but what has this to do with us  it has everything to do with us if we believe that we are christian men that christ is our king and the king of all the world just as much as he was king of the jews that all power is given to him in heaven and earth and that he is actually exercising his power and governing all heaven and earth  yes  if we really believed in the kingdom of god and christ if we really believed that the fate of nations is determined not by kings not by conquerors not by statesmen not by parliaments not by the people but by god that we england the world are going gods way and not our own then we should look hopefully peacefully contentedly on the matters which are too apt now to fret us for we should say more often than we do it is the lord  let him do what seemeth to him good  when we see new opinions taking hold of mens minds when we see great changes becoming certain then instead of being angry and terrified we should say with gamaliel the wise let them alone  if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought if it be of god you cannot overthrow it lest haply you be found fighting against god  if again we fancied ourselves aggrieved by any law we should not say it is unjust therefore i will not obey it for it would seem a small matter to us whether the law was unjust to us which only means in most cases that the law is hard on us personally and that we do not like it for almost every one considers things just which make for his own interest while whatever is against his interest is of course unjust  we should say let the law be hard on me yet i will obey it for the lords sake if it can be altered by fair and lawful means well and good but if not i will take it as one more burden which i am to bear patiently for the sake of him who lays it on me christ my lord and my king  the true question with us ought to be does the law force us to do that which is wrong  if so we are bound not to obey it as the jews were bound not to obey the law which commanded caesars image to be set up in the temple  but if any man knows of a law in this land which compels him to do a wrong thing i know of none  and let no man fancy that such submission shows a slavish spirit  not so  st peter did not wish to encourage a slavish spirit in jews and christians  he told them that they were free  but that they were not to use that belief as a cloak of maliciousnessof spiteful bitter and turbulent conduct and as a fact those who have done most for true freedom in all ages have not been the violent noisy bitter rebellious spirits who have cried we are the masters who shall rule over us but the godfearing patient lawabiding men who would obey every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it seemed to them altogether just or not unless they saw it was ruinous not to themselves merely but to their country and to their children after them  it is because men in their own minds do not believe that christ is the ruler of the world that they lose all hope of gods delivering them and break out into mad rebellion  it is because again men do not believe that christ is the ruler of the world that when their rebellion has failed they sink into slavishness and dull despair and bow their necks to the yoke of the first tyrant who arises and try to make a covenant with death and hell  better far for them had they made a covenant with christ who is ready to deliver men from death and hell in this world as well as in the world to come  but he who believes in christ in the living christ the ordering christ the governing christ will possess his soul in patience  he will not fret himself lest he should do evil because he can always put his trust in the lord until the tyranny be overpast  he will not hastily rebel  but neither will he truckle basely and cowardly to the ways of this wicked world  for christ the lord hates those ways and has judged them and doomed them to destruction and he reigns and will reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet    sermon xviterror by night    preached in lent  psalm xci 5  thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night  you may see if you will read your bible that the night is spoken of in the old testament much as we speak of it now as a beautiful and holy thing  the old jews were not afraid of any terror by night they rejoiced to consider the heavens the work of gods fingers the moon and the stars which he had ordained  they looked on night as we do as a blessed time of rest and peace for men in which the beasts of the forest seek their meat from god while all things are springing and growing man knows not how under the sleepless eye of a good and loving creator  but on the other hand you may remark that st paul in his epistles speaks of night in a very different tone  he is always opposing night to day and darkness to light as if darkness was evil in itself and a pattern of all evil in mens souls  and st paul knew what he was saying and knew how to say it for he spoke by the holy spirit of god  the reason of this difference is simple  the old jews spoke of gods night such as we country folks may see thank god as often as we will  st paul spoke of mans night such as it might be seen alas in the cities of the roman empire  all those to whom he wrote romans corinthians ephesians and the restdwelt in great cities heathen and profligate and night in them was mixed up with all that was ugly dangerous and foul  they were bad enough by day  after sunset they became hells on earth  the people high and low were sunk in wickedness the lower classes in poverty and often despair the streets were utterly unlighted and in the darkness robbery housebreaking murder were so common that no one who had anything to lose went through the streets without his weapon or a guard while inside the houses things went on at nightworks of darknessof which no man who knows of them dare talk  for as st paul says it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret  evil things are done by night still in london paris new york and many a great city but they are pure respectable comfortable and happy when compared with one of those old heathen cities which st paul knew but too well  again  our own forefathers were afraid of the night and its terrors and looked on night as on an ugly time  but for very different reasons from those for which st paul warned his disciples of night and the works of darkness  though they lived in the country they did not rejoice in gods heaven or in the moon and stars which he had ordained  they fancied that the night was the time in which all ghastly and ugly phantoms began to move that it was peopled with ghosts skeletons demons witches who held revels on the hilltops or stole into houses to suck the life out of sleeping men  the cry of the wild fowl and the howling of the wind were to them the yells of evil spirits  they dared not pass a graveyard by night for fear of seeing things of which we will not talk  they fancied that the forests the fens the caves were full of spiteful and ugly spirits who tempted men to danger and to death and when they prayed to be delivered from the perils and dangers of the night they prayed not only against those real dangers of fire of robbers of sudden sickness and so forth against which we all must pray but against a thousand horrible creatures which the good god never created but which their own fancy had invented  now in the bible from beginning to end you will find no teaching of this kind  that there are angels and that there are also evil spirits the bible says distinctly and that they can sometimes appear to men  but it is most worthy of remark how little the bible says about them not how much how it keeps them as it were in the background instead of bringing them forward while our forefathers seem continually talking of them continually bringing them forward i had almost said they thought of nothing else  if you compare the holy bible with the works which were most popular among our forefathers especially among the lower class till within the last 200 years you will see at once what i meanhow ghosts apparitions demons witchcraft are perpetually spoken of in them how seldom they are spoken of in the bible lest i suppose men should think of them rather than of god as our forefathers seem to have been but too much given to do  and so with this psalm  it takes for granted that men will have terrors by night that they will be at times afraid of what may come to them in the darkness  but it tells them not to be afraid for that as long as they say to god thou art my hope and my stronghold in thee will i trust so long they will not be afraid for any terror by night  it was because our forefathers did not say that that they were afraid and the terror by night grew on them till at times it made them half mad with fear of ghosts witches demons and suchlike and with the madness of fear came the madness of cruelty and they committed again and again such atrocities as i will not speak of here crimes for which we must trust that god has forgiven them for they knew not what they did  but though we happily no longer believe in the terror by night which comes from witches demons or ghosts there is another kind of terror by night in which we must believe for it comes to us from god and should be listened to as the voice of god  even that terror about our own sinfulness folly weakness which comes to us in dreams or in sleepless nights  some will say these painful dreams these painful waking thoughts are merely bodily and can be explained by bodily causes known to physicians  whether they can or not matters very little to you and me  things may be bodily and yet teach us spiritual lessons  a bookthe very bible itselfis a bodily thing  bodily leaves of paper printed with bodily ink and yet out of it we may learn lessons for our souls of the most awful and eternal importance  and so with these night fancies and night thoughts  we may learn from them  we are forced often to learn from them whether we will or not  they are often gods message to us calling us to repentance and amendment of life  they are often gods book of judgment wherein our sins are written which god is setting before us and showing us the things which we have done  who that has come to middle age does not know how dreams sometimes remind him painfully of what he once was of what he would be still without gods grace  how in his dreams he finds himself tempted by the old sins giving way to the old meannesses weaknesses follies how dreams remind him awfully enough that though his circumstances have changedhis opinions his whole manner of life have changed yet he is still the same person that he was ten twenty thirty forty years ago and will be for ever  nothing bears witness to the abiding enduring immortal oneness of the soul like dreams when they prove to a man in a way which cannot be mistakenthat is by making him do the deed over again in fancythat he is the same person who told that lie felt that hatred many a year ago and who would do the same again if gods grace left him to that weak and sinful nature which is his master in sleep and runs riot in his dreams whether god sends to men in these days dreams which enable them to look forward and to foretell things to come i cannot say  but this i can say that god sends dreams to men which enable them to look back and recollect things past which they had forgotten only too easily and that these humbling and penitential dreams are gods warning that as the article says the infection of nature doth remain even in those who are regenerate that nothing but the continual help of gods spirit will keep us from falling back or falling away  again  those sad thoughts which weigh on the mind when lying awake at night when all things look black to a man when he is more ashamed of himself more angry with himself more ready to take the darkest view of his own character and of his own prospects of life than he ever is by daydo not these thoughts too come from god is it not god who is holding the mans eyes waking  is it not god who is making him search out his own heart and commune with his spirit  i believe that so it is  if any one says it is all caused by the darkness and silence  you have nothing to distract your attention as you have by day and therefore the mind becomes unwholesomely excited and feeds upon itself i answer then they are good things now and then this darkness and this silence if they do prevent the mind from being distracted as it is all day long by business and pleasure if they leave a mans soul alone with itself to look itself in the face and be thoroughly ashamed of what it sees  in the noise and glare of the day we are all too apt to fancy that all is right with us and say i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and the night does us a kindly office if it helps us to find out that we knew not that we were poor and miserable and blind and nakednot only in the sight of god but in our own sight when we look honestly at ourselves  the wise man says   oh would some power the gift but give us to see ourselves as others see us   and those painful thoughts make us do that  for if we see some faults in ourselves be sure our neighbours see them likewise and perhaps many more beside  but more  these sad thoughts make us see ourselves as god sees us for if we see faults in ourselves we may be sure that the pure and holy god in whose sight the very heavens are not clean and who charges his angels with folly sees our faults with infinitely greater clearness and in infinitely greater number  so let us face those sad night thoughts however painful however humiliating they may be for by them god is calling us to repentance and forcing us to keep lent in spirit and in truth whether we keep it outwardly or not  what some may say you would have us then afraid of the terror by night  my dear friends that is exactly what i would not have i would teach you from holy scripture how to profit by the terror how to thank god for the terror instead of being afraid of it as you otherwise certainly will be  for these ugly dreams these sad thoughts do come whether you choose or not  whether you choose or not you all have or will have seasons of depression of anxiety of melancholy  shall they teach you or merely terrify you  shall they only bring remorse or shall they bring repentance  remorse  in that is nothing but pain  a man may see all the wrong and folly he has done he may fret over it torment himself with it curse himself for it and yet be the worse and not the better for what he sees  if he be a strongminded man he may escape from remorse in the bustle of business or pleasure  if he be a weak minded man he may escape from it in drunkenness as hundreds do or he may fall into melancholy superstition despair suicide  but if his sadness breeds not remorse but repentancethat is in one word if instead of keeping his sins to himself he takes his sins to godthen all will be well  then he will not be afraid of the terror but thankful for it when he knows that it is what st paul calls the terror of the lord  this is why the old psalmists were not afraid of the terror by night because they knew that their anxiety had come from god and therefore went to god for forgiveness for help for comfort  therefore it is that one says i am weary of groaning  every night wash i my bed and water my couch with my tears and yet says the next moment away from me all ye that work vanity  the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping  the lord will receive my prayer  therefore it is that another says while i held my sins my bones waxed old through my daily complaining and the next momenti said i will confess my sins unto the lord and so thou forgavest the wickedness of my sin  therefore it is that again another says thou holdest mine eyes waking  i am so feeble that i cannot speak  i call to remembrance my sin and in the night season i commune with my heart and search out my spirit  will the lord absent himself for ever and will he be no more entreated  is his mercy clean gone for ever and his promise come utterly to an end for evermore  and i said it is mine own infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most highest  i will remember the works of the lord and call to mind the wonders of old  and another why art thou so heavy o my soul and why art thou so disquieted within me  o put thy trust in god for i shall yet give him thanks who is the help of my countenance and my god  and therefore it is that our lord jesus christ in order that he might taste sorrow for every man and be made in all things like to his brethren endured once and for all in the garden of gethsemane the terror which cometh by night as none ever endured it before or since the agony of dread the agony of helplessness in which he prayed yet more earnestly and his sweat was as great drops of blood falling down to the ground  and there appeared an angel from heaven strengthening him because he stood not on his own strength but cast himself on his father and our father on his god and our god  so says st paul who tells us how our lord in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he fearedthough he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of everlasting salvation unto all them that obey him  oh may we all in the hour of shame and sadness in the hour of darkness and confusion and above all in the hour of death and the day of judgment take refuge with him in whom alone is help and comfort and salvation for this life and the life to comeeven jesus christ who died for us on the cross    sermon xviithe son of thunder    st john i 1  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god  we read this morning the first chapter of the gospel according to st john  some of you i am sure must have felt as you heard it how grand was the very sound of the words  some one once compared the sound of st johns gospel to a great church bell  simple slow and awful and awful just because it is so simple and slow  the words are very shortmost of them of one syllableso that even a child may understand them if he will  but every word is full of meaning  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god  the same was in the beginning with god  all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made  in him was life and the life was the light of men  and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not  those i hold are perhaps the deepest words ever written by man whole books have been written and whole books more might be written upon them and on the words which come after them  that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world  he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not  he came unto his own and his own received him not  but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name  which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god  and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace and truth  they go down to the mystery of all mysteriesto the mystery of the unfathomable one god who dwells alone in the light which none can approach unto selfsustained and selfsufficing for ever  and then they go on to the other great mysteryhow that god comes forth out of himself to give life and light to all things which he has made and what is the bond between the abysmal father in heaven and us his human children and the world in which we live even jesus christ god of the substance of his father begotten before the worlds and man of the substance of his mother born in the world  yes  the root and ground of all true philosophy lies in this chapter  its words are so deep that the wisest man might spend his life over them without finding out all that they mean  and yet they are so simple that any child can understand enough of their meaning to know its duty and to do it  remark again how short the sentences are  each is made up of a very few words and followed by a full stop that our minds may come to a full stop likewise and think over what we have heard before st john goes on to tell us more  yes  st john does not hurry either himself or us  he takes his time and he wishes us to take our time likewise  his message will keep for it is eternal  it is not a story of yesterday or today or tomorrow  it is the story of eternityof what is and was and always will be  always has the word been with god and always will he be god  always has the word been making all things and always will he be making  always has the spirit been proceeding and always will the spirit be proceeding from the word and from the father of the word giving their light and their life to men  st johns message will last for ever and therefore he tells it slowly and deliberately knowing that no time can change what he has to say for it is the good news of the word jesus christ who is the same yesterday today and for ever because he is god of very god eternally in the bosom of the father  now st john who writes thus simply and quietly was no weak or soft person  he was one of the two whom the lord surnamed boanerges the son of thunderthe man of the loud and awful voice  painters have liked to draw st john as young soft and feminine because he was the apostle of love  i beg you to put that sentimental notion out of your minds and to remember that the only hint which holy scripture gives us about st johns person is that he was a son of thunder that his very voice when he chose was awful that he and his brother james before they were converted were not of a soft but of a terrible temper that it was james and john the sons of thunder who wanted to call down thunder and lightning from heaven on all the villages who would not receive the lord  a son of thunder  think over that name and think over it carefully remembering that it was our lord himself who gave st john the name and that it therefore has surely some deep meaning  do not fancy that it means merely a loud and noisy person  i have known too many carelessly looking only at the outsides and shows of things and not at their inside and reality fancy that that was what it meant  i have known them fancy that they themselves were sons of thunder when they raved and shouted and used violent language in preaching or in public speaking  and i have heard foolish people honour such men the more and think them the more in earnest the more noise they made and say of him he is a true boanergesa son of thunder like st john  like st john  the only sermon of st johns which we have on record is that which they say he used to preach over and over again when he was carried as an old man into his church at ephesus  and that was no more than these few words over and over again sunday after sunday little children love one another  that was the way in which st john the son of thunder spoke when age and long obedience to the spirit of god had taught him how to use his strength wisely and well  like st john  is there anywhere in st johns gospel or epistles one violent expression  one sentence of great swelling words  are not the words of the son of thunder as i have been telling you peculiarly calm slow simple gentle  can those whose mouths are full of noisy and violent talk be true sons of thunder if st john was one  no  and if you will think for yourselves you will see that there is a deeper meaning in our lords name for st john than merely that he was a loud and violent man  you hear the roar of the thunder but you know surely that it is not the thunder itself that it is only its echo rolling on from cloud to cloud and hill from hill  but the thunder itselfif you have ever been close enough to it to hear itis very different from that and far more awful  still and silently it broods till its time is come  and then there is one ear piercing crack one blinding flash and all is over  nothing so swift so instantaneous as the thunder itself and yet nothing so strong  and such are those sudden flashes of indignation against sin and falsehood which break out for a moment in st johns writing piercing like the word of god himself the very joints and marrow of the heart and showing in one terrible word what is the real matter with the bad mans soul as the thunderbolt lights up for an instant the whole heavens far and wide  if we say that we have fellowship with god and walk in darkness we lie  in that one plain ugly word he tells us the whole truth frightful as it is and then he goes on calmly once more  and again  he that saith i know god and keepeth not his commandments is a liar  he that committeth sin is of the devil  he that hateth his brother is a murderer  if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen  he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil has not seen god  such words as these coming as they do amid the usually quiet and gentle language of st johnthese are truly words of thunder going straight to their mark tearing off the mask from hypocrisy and self deceiving and false religion and speaking the truth in majesty  and yet there is no noisiness no wordiness about them nothing like rant or violence  such a man is a liar says st john  but he says no more  that is all and that is enough  so speaks the true son of thunder  and his words like the thunder echo from land to land and we hear them now this day in a foreign tongue eighteen hundred years after they were written  while thousands of bigger noisier and frothier words and more violent books have been lost and forgotten utterly  and now my friends we may find in st johns example a wholesome lesson for ourselves  we may learn from it that noisiness is not earnestness that violence is not strength  noise is a sign of want of faith and violence is a sign of weakness  the man who is really in earnest who has real faith in what he is saying and doing will not be noisy and loud and in a hurry as it is written he that believeth will not make haste  he that is really strong he who knows that he can do his work if he takes his time and uses his wit and god prospers himhe will not be violent but will work on in silence and peaceful industry as it is written thy strength is to sit still  i know that you here do not require this warning much for yourselves there is thank god something in our quiet industrious country life which breeds in men that solid sober temper the temper which produces much work and little talk which is the mark of a true englishman a true gentleman and a true christian  but if you go as more and more of you will go into the great towns you will hear much noisy and violent speaking from pulpits and at public meetings  you will read much noisy and violent writing in newspapers and books  now i say to you distrust such talk  it may seem to you very earnest and passionate  distrust it for that very reason  it may seem to you very eloquent and full of fine words  distrust it for that very reason  the man who cannot tell his story without wrapping it up in fine words generally does not know very clearly what he is talking about  the man who cannot speak or write without scolding and exaggeration is not very likely to be able to give sound advice to his fellowmen  remember that it is by violent language of this kind in all ages that fanatical preachers have deceived silly men and women to their shame and ruin and mobleaders have stirred up riots and horrible confusions  remember this  and distrust violent and wordy persons wheresoever you shall meet them  but after listening to them if you must go home and take out your bibles and read the gospel of st john and see how he spoke the true son of thunder whose words are gone out into all lands and their sound unto the end of the world just because they are calm and sober plain and simple like the words of jesus christ his lord and our lord who spake as never man spake  and for ourselveslet us remember our lords own warning  let your yea be yea and your nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil  tell your story plainly and calmly speak your mind if you must  but speak it quietly  do not try to make out the worst case for your adversary do not exaggerate do not use strong language  say the truth the whole truth but say nothing but the truth in patience and in charity  for everything beyond that comes of evilof some evil or fault in us  either we are not quite sure that we are right or we have lost our temper and then we see the whole matter awry through the mist of passion or we are selfish and looking out for our own interest or our own credit instead of judging the matter fairly  this or something else is certainly wrong in us whenever we give way to violent language  therefore whenever we are tempted to say more than is needful let us remember st johns words and ask god for his holy spirit the spirit of love which instead of weakening a mans words makes them all the stronger in the cause of truth because they are spoken in love    sermon xviiihumility    luke v 8  depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord  few stories in the new testament are as well known as this  few go home more deeply to the heart of man  most simple most graceful is the story and yet it has in it depths unfathomable  great painters have loved to draw great poets have loved to sing that scene on the lake of gennesaret  the clear blue water land locked with mountains the meadows on the shore gay with their lilies of the field on which our lord bade them look and know the bounty of their father in heaven the rich gardens oliveyards and vineyards on the slopes the towns and villas scattered along the shore all of bright white limestone gay in the sun the crowds of boats fishing continually for the fish which swarm to this day in the lakeeverywhere beautiful country life busy and gay healthy and civilized likewiseand in the midst of it the maker of all heaven and earth sitting in a poor fishers boat and condescending to tell them where the shoal of fish was lying  it is a wonderful scene  let us thank god that it happened once on earth  let us try to see what we may learn from it in these days in which our god and saviour no longer walks this earth in human form  ah some may say but for that very reason there is no lesson in the story for us in these days  true it is that god does not walk the earth now in human form  he works no miracles either for fishermen or for any other men  we shall never see a miraculous draught of fishes  we shall never be convinced as st peter was by a miracle that christ is close to us  what has the story to do with us  my friends are things after all so different now from what they were then  is our case after all so very different from st peters god and christ cannot change for they are eternalthe same yesterday today and for ever and if christ was near st peter on the lake of gennesaret he is near us now and here for in him we live and move and have our being and he is about our path and about our bed and spieth out all our ways  near us for ever whether we know it or not  and human nature cannot change  there is in us the same heart as there was in st peter for evil and for good  when st peter found suddenly that it was the lord who was in his boat his first feeling was one of fear  depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord  and when we recollect at moments that god is close to us watching all we do all we say yea all we think are we not afraid for the moment at least  do we not feel the thought of gods presence a burden  do we never long to hide from godto forget god again and cry in our hearts  depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord  god grant to us all that after that first feeling of dread and awe is over we may go on as st peter went on to the better feelings of admiration loyalty worship and say at last as st peter said afterwards when the lord asked him if he too would leave him lord to whom shall we go for thou hast the words of eternal life  but do i blame st peter for saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord  god forbid  who am i to blame st peter especially when even the lord jesus did not blame him but only bade him not to be afraid  and why did the lord not blame him even when he asked him to go away  because st peter was honest  he said frankly and naturally what was in his heart  and honesty even if it is mistaken never offends god and ought never to offend men  god requires truth in the inward parts and if a man speaks the truthif he expresses his own thoughts and feelings frankly and honestlythen even if he is not right he is at least on the only road to get right as st peter was  he spoke not from dislike of our lord but from modesty from a feeling of awe of uneasiness of dread at the presence of one who was infinitely greater wiser better than himself  and that feeling of reverence and modesty even when it takes the shape as it often will in young people of shyness and fear is a divine and noble feelingthe beginning of all goodness  indeed i question whether there can be any real and sound goodness in any mans heart if he has no modesty and no reverence  boldness forwardness selfconceit above all in the youngwe know how ugly they are in our eyes and the bible tells us again and again how ugly they are in the sight of god  the truly great and free and noble souland st peters soul was suchis that of the man who feels awe and reverence in the presence of those who are wiser and holier than himself who is abashed and humbled when he compares himself with his betters just because his standard is so high  because he knows how much better he should be than he is because he is discontented with himself ashamed of himself therefore he shrinks at first from the very company which after a while he learns to like best because it teaches him most and so it was with st peters noble soul  he felt himself in the presence of that pure christ a sinful man not perhaps what we should call sinful but sinful in comparison of christ  he felt his own meanness ignorance selfishness weakness  he felt unworthy to be in such good company  he felt unworthyhe the ignorant fishermanto have such a guest in his poor boat  go elsewhere lord he tried to say to a place and to companions more fit for thee  i am ashamed to stand in thy presence  i am dazzled by the brightness of thy countenance crushed down by the thought of thy wisdom and power uneasy lest i say or do something unfit for thee lest i anger thee unawares in my ignorance clumsiness lest i betray to thee my own bad habits  and those bad habits i feel in thy presence as i never felt before  thou art too condescending thou honourest me too much thou hast taken me for a better man than i am thou knowest not what a poor miserable creature i am at heart depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord  there spoke out the truly noble soul who was ready the next moment as soon as he had recovered himself to leave all and follow christ who was ready afterwards to wander to suffer to die upon the cross for his lord and who when he was led out to execution asked to be crucified as it is said st peter actually did with his head downwards for it was too much honour for him to die looking up to heaven as his lord had died  do you not understand me yet  then think what you would have thought of st peter if instead of saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord st peter had said stay with me for i am a holy man o lord  i am just the sort of person who deserves the honour of thy company and my boat poor though it is more fit for thee than the palace of a king  would st peter have seemed to you then wiser or more foolish better or worse than he does now when in his confused honest humility he begs the lord to go away and leave him  and do you not feel that a man is as a great poet says displeasing alike to god and to the enemies of god when he comes boldly to the throne of grace not to find grace and mercy because he feels that he needs them  but to boast of gods grace and make gods mercy to him an excuse for looking down upon his fellow creatures and worships like the pharisee in selfconceit and pride thanking god that he is not as other men are  better far to be the publican who stood afar off and dare not lift up as much as his eyes toward heaven but cried only god be merciful to me a sinner  better far to be the honest and devout soldier who when jesus offered to come to his house answered lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof  but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed  only he must say that in honesty in spirit and in truth like st peter  for a man may shrink from religion from the thought of god from coming to the holy communion for two most opposite reasons  he may shrink from them because he knows he is full of sins and wishes to keep his sins and knows that if he worships god if he comes to the holy communionindeed if he remembers the presence of god at allhe pledges himself to give up his bad habits to repent and amend which is just what he has no mind to do  so he turns away from god because he chooses to remain bad  may the lord have mercy on his soul for he has no mercy on it himself  he chooses evil and refuses good and evil will be his ruin  but again a man may shrink from god from church from the holy communion because he feels himself bad and longs to be good because he feels himself full of evil habits and hates them and sees how ugly they are and is afraid to appear in the presence of god foul with sin  let him be of good cheer  he is not going wrong wilfully  but he is making a mistake  let him make it no more  he feels himself unworthy  let him come all the more that he may be made worthy let him come because he is worthy  forstrange it may seem but true it isthat a man is the more worthy to draw near to god the more he feels himself to be utterly unworthy thereof  he who partakes worthily of the holy communion is he who says with his whole heart we are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy table  he with whom christ will take up his abode is he who says lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof  for humility is the beginning of all goodness and the end of all wisdom  he who says that he sees is blind  he who knows his own blindness sees  he who says he has no sin in him is the sinner  he who confesses his sins is the righteous man for god is faithful and just to forgive him as he did st peter and to cleanse him from all unrighteousness    sermon xixa whitsun sermon    psalm civ 24 2730  o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all  the earth is full of thy riches     these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season  that thou givest them they gather  thou openest thine hand they are filled with good  thou hidest thy face they are troubled  thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust  thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created  and thou renewest the face of the earth  you may not understand why i read this morning instead of the te deum the song of the three children which calls on all powers and creatures in the world to bless and praise god  you may not understand also at first why this grand 104th psalm was chosen as one of the special psalms for whitsuntidewhat it has to do with the holy ghost the comforter the spirit of god  let me try to explain it to you and may god grant that you may find something worth remembering among my clumsy words  you were told this morning that there were two ways of learning concerning god and the spirit of godthat one was by the hearing of the ear and the holy bible the other by the seeing of the eyeby nature and the world around us  it is of the latter i speak this afternoonof what you can learn concerning god by seeing if only you have eyes and the same spirit of god to open those eyes as the psalmist had  the man who wrote this psalm looked round him on the wondrous world in which we dwell and all he saw in it spoke to him of god of one god boundless in wisdom and in power in love and care and of one spirit of god the lord and giver of life  he saw all this and so glorious did it seem to him as he looked on the fair world round him that he could not contain himself  not only was his reason satisfied but his heart was touched  it was so glorious that he could not speak of it coldly calmly and he burst out into singing a song of praiseo lord our god thou art become exceeding glorious thou art clothed with majesty and honour  for he saw everywhere order all things working together for good  he saw everywhere order and rule and something within him told him there must be a lawgiver an orderer a ruler and he must be one  again the psalmist saw everywhere a purpose things evidently created to be of use to each other  and the spirit of god told him there must be one who purposed all this who meant to do it and who had done it who thought it out and planned it by wisdom and understanding  then the psalmist saw how everything from the highest to the lowest was of use  the fir trees were a dwelling for the stork and the very stony rocks where nothing else can live were a refuge for the wild goats everywhere he saw use and bountyfood shelter life happiness given to man and beast and not earned by them then he saidthere must be a bountiful lord a giver generous and loving from whom the very lions seek their meat when they roar after their prey on whom all the creeping things innumerable wait in the great sea that he may give them meat in due season  but moreover he saw everywhere beauty shapes and colours and sounds which were beautiful in his eyes and gave him pleasure deep and strange he knew not why  and the spirit of god within him told himthese fair things please thee  do they not please him who made them  he that formed the ear shall he not hear the song of birds he that made the eye shall he not see the colours of the flowers he who made thee to rejoice in the beauty of the earth shall not he rejoice in his own works  and god seemed to him in his minds eye to delight in his own works as a painter delights in the picture which he has drawn as a gardener delights in the flowers which he has planted as a cunning workman delights in the curious machine which he has invented as a king delights in the fair parks and gardens and stately palaces which he has laid out and builded and adorned for his own pleasure as well as for the good of his subjects  and then beneath all and beyond all there came to him another questionwhat is life  the painter paints his picture but it has no life  the workman makes his machine but though it moves and works it has no life the gardenerhis flowers have life but he has not given it to them he can only sow the seemingly dead seeds  who is he that giveth those seeds a body as it pleases him and to every seed its own body its own growth of leaf form and colour  god alone  and what is that life which he does give  who can tell that  what is life  what is it which changes the seed into a flower the egg into a bird  it is not the seed itself the egg itself  what power or will have they over themselves  it is not in the seed or in the egg as all now know from experience  you may look for it with all the microscopes in the world but you will not find it  there is nothing to be found by the eyes of mortal man which can account for the growth and life of any created thing  and what is death  what does the live thing lose when it loses life  this moment the bird was alive a tiny pellet of shot has gone through its brain and now its life is lost  but what is lost  it is just the same size shape colour it weighs exactly the same as it did when alive  what is the thing not to be seen touched weighed described or understood which it has lost which we call life  and to that deep question the psalmist had an answer whispered to hima hint only as it were in a parable  life is the breath of god  it is the spirit of god who is the lord and giver of life god breathes into things the breath of life  when he takes away that breath they die and are turned again to their dust  when he lets his breath go forth again they are made and he renews the face of the earth  that is enough for thee o man to know  what life is thou canst not know  thou canst only speak of it in a figureas the breath the spirit of god  that spirit of god is not the universe itself  but he is working in all things giving them form and life dividing to each severally as he will all their shape their beauty their powers their instincts their thoughts all in them save brute matter and dead dust  from him they come and to him they return again  all order all law all force all usefulness come from him he is the lord and giver of life in whom all things live and move and have their being  therefore my friends let us at all times in all places and especially at this whitsuntide remember that all we see or can see except sin is the work of the holy ghost the spirit of god  let us look on the world around us as what it is as what the old psalmist saw it to bea sacred place full of gods presence shaped quickened and guided by the spirit of god the lord and giver of life  my dear friends god grant that you may all learn to look upon this world as the psalmist looked on it  god grant that you may all learn to see each in your own way what a great and pious poet of our fathers time put into words far wiser and grander than any which i can invent for you when he said how looking on the earth the sea the sky he felt    a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused whose dwelling is the light of setting suns and the round ocean and the living air and the blue sky and in the mind of man a motion and a spirit that impels all thinking things all objects of all thought and rolls through all things  therefore am i still a lover of the meadows and the woods and mountains and of all that we behold from this green earth of all the mighty world of eye and ear both what they half create and what perceive well pleased to recognise in nature and the language of the sense the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse the guide the guardian of my heart and soul of all my moral being 243   of all my moral being  yes of our moral being our characters our souls  by looking upon this beautiful and wonderful world around us with reverence and earnestness and love as what it isthe work of gods spiritwe shall become not merely the more learned or the more happy we shall become actually better men  the beauties in the earth and sky the flowers with their fair hues and fragrant scents the song of birds the green shaughs and woodlands the moors purple with heath and golden with furze the shapes of clouds from the delicate mist upon the lawn to the thunder pillar towering up in awful might the sunrise and sunset painted by god afresh each morn and even the blue sky which is the image of god the heavenly father boundless clear and calm looking down on all below with the same smile of love sending his rain alike on the evil and on the good and causing his sun to shine alike on the just and on the unjust he who watches all these things day by day will find his heart grow quiet sober meek contented  his eyes will be turned away from beholding vanity his soul will be kept from vexation of spirit  in gods tabernacle which is the universe of all the worlds he will be kept from the strife of tongues  as he watches the work of gods spirit the beauty of gods spirit the wisdom of gods spirit the fruitfulness of gods spirit which shines forth in every wayside flower and every gnat which dances in the sun he will rejoice in gods work even as god himself rejoices  he will learn to value things at their true price and see things of their real size  ambition fame money will seem small things to him as he considers the lilies of the field how the heavenly father clothes them and the birds of the air how the heavenly father feeds them and he will say with the wise man    all the windy ways of men are but dust that rises up and is lightly laid again   dust indeed and not worthy the attention of the wise man who considers how the very heaven and earth shall perish and yet god endure howthey all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shall god change them and they shall be changed  but god is the same and his years shall not fail  and as that man grows more quiet he will grow more loving likewise more merciful to the very dumb animals  he will be ashamed even to disturb a bird upon its nest when he remembers the builder and maker of that nest is not the bird alone but god  he will believe the words of the wise man    he prayeth well who loveth well    both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best    all things both great and small for the great god who loveth us    he made and loveth all   more quiet more loving will that man grow and more pious likewise for there ought to come to that man a sense of gods presence of gods nearness which will fill him with a wholesome fear of god  as he sees with the inward eyes of his reason gods spirit at work for ever on every seed on every insect ay on every nerve and muscle of his own body he will heartily say with the psalmisti will give thanks unto thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well  thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book were all my members written which day by day were fashioned when as yet there was none of them  whither shall i go then from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence  if i climb up to heaven thou art there if i go down to hell thou art there also if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there thy hand shall lead me and thy right hand hold me still  if i say peradventure the darkness shall cover me then shall my night be turned into day  yes god he will see is everywhere over all and through all and in all and from god there is no escape  the only hope the only wisdom is to open his heart to god as a child to its father and cry with the psalmisttry me o god and search the ground of my heart prove me and examine my thoughts  look well if there be any way of wickedness in me and lead me in the way everlasting  my dear friends take these thoughts home with you  and may god give you grace to ponder over them and so make your whitsun holiday more quiet more pure more full of lessons learnt from gods great green book which lies outside for every man to read  of such as you said the wise heathen long agotoo happy are they who till the land if they but knew the blessings which they have  and it is a blessing a privilege and therefore a responsibility laid on you by your father and your saviour to have such a fair peaceful country scene around you as you will behold when you leave this churcha scene where everything is to the wise man where everything should be to you a witness of gods spirit a witness of gods power gods wisdom gods care gods love  go and may god turn away your hearts from all that is mean and selfish all that is coarse and low and lift them up unto himself as you look upon the fields and woods and sky till you too say with the psalmisto lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches  i will praise my god while i have my being my joy shall be in the lord    sermon xxselfhelp    st john xvi 7  it is expedient for you that i go away  for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you  this is a deep and strange saying  how can it be expedient useful or profitable for any human being that christ should go away from them  to be in christs presence to see his face to hear his voicewould not this be the most expedient and profitable yea the most blessed and blissful of things which could befall us  is it not that which saints hope to attain for ever in heaventhe beatific vision of christ  my dear friends one thing is certain that christ loves us far better than we can love ourselves and knows how to show that love he would have stayed with the apostles instead of ascending into heaven if it had been expedient for them  yea if it had been expedient for him to have stayed on earth among mankind unto this very day he would have stayed  because it was not expedient not good for the apostles not good for mankind that he should stay among them therefore he ascended into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god all authority and power being given to him in heaven and in earth  and he gives us a reason for so doingonly a hint but still a hint by which we may see today it was expedient for us that he should go away  unless he went away the comforter would not come  now the true and exact meaning of the comforter is the strengthener the encourager one who gives a man strength of mind and courage of spirit to do his work  without that comforter the apostles would be weak and spiritless  without being encouraged and inspirited by him they would never get through the work which they had to do of preaching the gospel to the whole world  we may surely see if we think some of the cause of this  the apostles till our lords ascension had been following him about like scholars following a masteralmost like children holding by their fathers hand  they had had no will of their own no opinion of their own they had never had to judge for themselves or act for themselves and when they had tried to do so they had always been in the wrong and christ had rebuked them  they had been like scholars i say with a teacher or children with a parent  yea rather when one remembers who they were poor fishermen and who he wasgod made manthey had been i speak with all reverence as dogs at their masters sidefaithful and intelligent truly but with no will of their own looking for ever up to his hand and his eye to see what he would have them do  but that could not last  it ought not to last  god does not wish us to be always as animals not even always as children he wishes us to become men perfect men who have their senses exercised by experience to discern good and evil  and so it was to be with the apostles  they had to learn as we all have to learn selfhelp selfgovernment selfdetermination  they were to think for themselves and act for themselves and yet not by themselves  for he would put into them a spirit even his spirit and so when they were thinking for themselves they would be thinking as he would have them think when they were acting for themselves they would be acting as he would have them act  they would live but not their own life for christ would live in them they would speak  but not their own words the spirit of their father would speak in them that so they might come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god to be perfect men to the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ  my dear friends this may seem deep and a mystery  but so are all things in this wondrous life of ours  and surely we see a pattern of all this in our own lives  each child is educatedor ought to be as christ educated his apostles  have we not had some of us in early life some parent friend teacher spiritual pastor or master to whom we looked up with unbounded respect  his word to us was law  his counsel was as the oracles of god  we did not dream of thinking for ourselves acting for ourselves while we had him to tell us how to think how to act and we were happy in our devotion  we felt what a blessed thing not merely protecting and guiding but elevating and ennobling was reverence and obedience to one wiser and better than ourselves  but that did not last  it could not last  our teacher was taken from us perhaps by mere change of place and the chances of this mortal life perhaps by death which sunders all fair bonds upon this side the grave  perhaps most painful of all we began to differ from our teacher to find that though we respected and loved him still though we felt a deep debt of thanks to him for what he had taught us we could not quite agree in all we had begun to think for ourselves and we found that we must think for ourselves and the new responsibility was very heavy  we felt like young birds thrust out of the nest to shift for themselves in the wide world  but after a while we found that we could think could act for ourselves as we never expected to do  we found that we were no more children that we were improving in manly virtues by having to bear our own burdens and to acquire   the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill   and we found too that though our old teachers were parted from us yet they were with us still that to compare small things with great and christs servants with their lord a spirit came to us from them and brought all things to our remembrance whatsoever they had said to us that we remembered their words more vividly we understood their meaning more fully and deeply now that they were parted than we did when they were with us  we loved them as well ay better than of old for we saw more clearly what a debt we owed to them and so it was after all expedient for us that they should have gone away  that parting with them which seemed so dangerous to us as well as painful really comforted usstrengthened and encouraged us to become stronger and braver souls full of selfhelp selfgovernment selfdetermination  and so we shall find it i believe in our religion  we may say with a sigh ah that i could see my lord and saviour  i should be safe then  i dare not sin then  it may be so  i am the last to deny that our lord jesus christ has as he certainly could if he chose shown himself bodily to certain of his saints as he showed himself to st paul and to st stephen in order to strengthen their faith in some great trial  but if it had been good for us in general to see the lord in this life doubt not that we should have seen him  and because we do not see him be sure that it is not good  we may say again ah that the lord jesus had but remained on earth what just laws what peace and prosperity would the world have enjoyed  wars would have ceased long ago oppression and injustice would be unknown  it may be so  and yet again it may not  perhaps our lords staying on earth would have had some quite different effect of which we cannot even dream and done not good but harm  let us have faith in him  let us believe in his perfect wisdom and in his perfect love  let us believe that he is educating us as he educated the apostles by going away  that he is by his absence helping men to help themselves teaching men to teach themselves guiding and governing men to guide and govern themselves by that law of liberty which is the law of his spirit to love the right and to do the right not from fear of punishment but of their own heart and will  for remember he has not left us comfortless  he has not merely given us commands he has given us the power of understanding valuing obeying these commands  for his spirit is with us the spirit of whitsuntide the comforter the encourager the strengthener by whom we may both perceive and know what we ought to do and also have grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same  come to yonder holy table this day and there claim your share in christ who is absent from you in the body but ever present in the spirit  come to that table that you may live by christs life and learn to love what he commandeth and desire what he doth promise that so your hearts may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found namely in the gracious motions and heavenly inspirations of the holy ghost the comforter who proceedeth from the father and the son    sermon xxiendurance    i peter ii 19  this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully  this is a great epistle this epistle for the day and full of deep lessons  let us try to learn some of them  what glory is it st peter says if when ye be beaten for your faults ye take it patiently  what credit is it to a man if having broken the law he submits to be punished  the man who will not do that the man who resists punishment is not a civilized man but a savage and a mere animal  if he will not live under discipline if he expects to break the law with impunity he makes himself an outlaw he puts himself by his rebellion outside the law and becomes unfit for society a public enemy of his fellowmen  the first lesson which men have to learn which even the heathen have learnt as soon as they have risen above mere savages is the sacredness of lawthe necessity of punishment for those who break the law  the jews had this feeling of the sacredness of law  moses divine law had taught it them  the romans heathen though they were had the same feelingthat law was sacred that men must obey law  and the good thing which they did for the world though they did it at the expense of bloodshed and cruelty without end was the bringing all the lawless nations and wild tribes about them under strict law and drilling them into order and obedience  that it was which gave the roman power strength and success for many centuries  but above the kingdom of law which says to a man merely thou shalt not do wrong  and if thou dost thou shalt be punished there is another kingdom far deeper wider nobler even the kingdom of grace which says to a man not merely do not do wrong but do right and not only do right for fear of being punished but do right because it is right do right because thou hast grace in thy heart even the grace of god and the spirit of god which makes thee love what is right and see how right it is and how beautiful so that thou must follow after the right not from fear of punishment but in spite of fear of punishment follow after the right not when it is safe only but when it is dangerous not when it is honourable only in the eyes of men but when it is despised  if thou hast gods grace in thy heart if thou lovest what is right with the true love which is the spirit of god then thou wilt never stop to ask will it pay me to do right  thou wilt feel that the right thou must do whether it pays thee or not still loving the right and cleaving steadfastly to the right through disappointment poverty shame trouble death itself if need be  if only thou canst keep a conscience void of offence toward god and man  but shall i have no reward asks a man for doing right  am i to give up a hundred pleasant things for conscience sake and get nothing in return  yes  there is a reward for righteousness even in this life  god repays those who make sacrifices for conscience sake i verily believe in most cases a hundred fold in this life in this life it stands true that he who loses his life shall save it that he who goes through the world with a single eye to duty without selfishness without vanity without ambition careless whether he be laughed at careless whether he be illused provided only his conscience acquits him and gods approving smile is on him in this life it stands true that that man is the happiest man after all that that man is the most prosperous man after all that like christ when he was doing his fathers work he has meat to eat and strengthen him in his lifes journey which the world knows not of but if not if it seem good to god to let him taste the bitters and not the sweets of doing right in this life if it seem good to god that he should sufferas many a man and woman too has suffered for doing rightnothing but contempt neglect prison and death is he worse off than jesus christ his lord was before him  shall the disciple be above his master  what if he have to drink of the cup of sorrow of which christ drank and be baptized with the baptism of martyrdom with which christ was baptized  where is he but where the son of god has been already  what is he doing but treading in the steps of christ crucified that he may share in the blessing and glory and honour without end which god the father heaped upon christ his son because he was perfect in duty perfect in love of right perfect in resignation perfect in submission under injustice perfect in forgiveness of his murderers perfect in faith in the justice and mercy of god  who did no sinthat is never injured his own cause by anger or revenge and had no guile in his mouththat is never prevaricated lied concealed his opinions for fear of the consequences however terrible but before the chief priests and pontius pilate witnessed a good confession though he knew that it would bring on him a dreadful death who when he was reviled reviled not again but committed himself to him who judgeth righteouslythe meekest of all beings and in that very meekness the strongest of all beings the most utterly resigned and by that very resignation the most heroicthe being who seemed on the cross of calvary most utterly conquered by injustice and violence  but who by that very cross conquered the whole world  this is a great mystery and hard to learn  flesh and blood our animal nature will never compass it all for it belongs not to the flesh but to the spirit  but our spirits our immortal souls may learn the lesson at last if we feed them continually with the thought of christ if we meditate upon whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honourable just pure lovely and of good report  then we may learn at last after many failures and many sorrows of heart that the spirit is stronger than the flesh that meekness is stronger than wrath silence stronger than shouting peace stronger than war forgiveness stronger than vengeance just as christ hanging on his cross was strongerexercising a more vast and miraculous effect on the hearts of menthan if he had called whole armies of angels to destroy his enemies like one of the old kings and conquerors of the earth whose works have perished with themselves  yes gradually we must learn that our strength is to sit still that to do well and suffer for it instead of returning evil for evil and railing for railing is to show forth the spirit of christ and to enter into the joy of our lord  the statesman debating in parliament the conqueror changing the fate of nations on bloody battlefields these all do their work and are needful doubtless in a sinful piecemeal world like this  but there are those of whom the noisy world never hears who have chosen the better part which shall not be taken from them who enter into a higher glory than that of statesmen or conquerors or the successful and famous of the earth  many a manclergyman or laymanstruggling in poverty and obscurity with daily toil of body and mind to make his fellowcreatures better and happier many a poor woman bearing children in pain and sorrow and bringing them up with pain and sorrow but in industry too and piety or submitting without complaint to a brutal husband or sacrificing all her own hopes in life to feed and educate her brothers and sisters or enduring for years the peevishness and troublesomeness of some relationall these and the world which god sees is full of such though the world which man sees takes no note of themgentle souls humble souls uncomplaining souls suffering souls pious soulsthese are gods elect these are christs sheep these are the salt of the earth who by doing each their little duty as unto god not unto men keep society from decaying more than do all the constitutions and acts of parliament which statesmen ever invented  these are theythough they little dream of any such honourwho copy the likeness of the old martyrs who did well and suffered for it and the likeness of christ of whom it was said he shall not strive nor cry neither shall his voice be heard in the streets  for what was it in the old martyrs which made men look up to them as persons infinitely better than themselves with quite unmeasurable admiration so that they worshipped them after their deaths as if they had been gods rather than men  it was this  the world in old times had been admiring successful people just as it does at this day  was a man powerful rich  had he slaves by the hundred  was his table loaded with the richest meats and wines  could he indulge every pleasure and fancy of his own  could he heap his friends with benefits  could he ruin or destroy any one who thwarted him  in one word was he a mighty and successful tyrant  then that was the man to honour and worship that was the sort of man to become if anyone had the chance by fair means or foul  just as the world worships now the successful man andif you will but make a million of moneywill flatter you and court you and never ask either how you made your money or how you spend your money or whether you are a good man or a bad one  for money in mans eyes as charity in gods eyes covereth a multitude of sins and as long as thou doest well unto thyself men will speak well of thee  but there arose in that wicked old world in which st paul lived an entirely new sort of peoplepeople who did not wish to be successful did not wish to be rich did not wish to be powerful did not wish for pleasures and luxuries which this world could give  who only wished to be good to do right and to teach others to do right christians they were called after christ their lord and god  weak old men poor women slaves even children were among them  not many mighty not many rich not many noble were called  they were mostly weak and oppressed people who had been taught by suffering and sorrow  one would have thought that the world would have despised these christians and let them go their own way in peace  but it was not so  the mighty of this world and those who lived by pandering to their vices so far from despising the christians saw at once how important they were  they saw that if people went about the world determined to speak nothing but what they believed to be true and to do nothing but what was right then the wicked world would be indeed turned upside down and as they complained against st paul more than once the hope of their gains would be gone  therefore they conceived the most bitter hatred against these christians and rose against them for the same simple reason that cain rose up against abel and slew him because his works were wicked and his brothers righteous  they argued with them they threatened them they tried to terrify them  but they found to their astonishment that the christians would not change their minds for any terror  then their hatred became rage and fury  they could not understand how such poor ignorant contemptible people as the christians seemed to be dared to have an opinion of their own and to stand to it how they dared to think themselves right and all the world wrong and in their fury they inflicted on them tortures to read of which should make the blood run cold  and their rage and fury increased to madness when they found that these christians instead of complaining instead of rebelling instead of trying to avenge themselves submitted to all their sufferings not only patiently and uncomplaining but joyfully and as an honour and a glory  some no doubt they conquered by torture agony and terror and so made them deny christ and return to the wickedness of the heathen  but those renegades were always miserable  their own consciences condemned them  they felt they had sold their own souls for a lie and many of them in their agony of mind repented again like st peter after he had denied his lord through fear proclaimed themselves christians after all went through all their tortures a second time and died triumphant over death and hell  but there were thoseto be counted by hundreds if not thousands who dared all and endured all and won as it was rightly called the crown of martyrdom  feeble old men weak women poor slaves even little children sealed their testimony with their blood and conquered not by fighting but by suffering  they conquered  they conquered for themselves in the next world for they went to heaven and bliss and their light affliction which was but for a moment worked out for them an exceeding and eternal weight of glory  they conquered in this world also  for the very world which had scourged them racked them crucified them burned them alive when they were dead turned round and worshipped them as heroes almost as divine beings  and they were divine for they had in them the divine spirit the spirit of god and of christ  therefore the foolish world was awed consciencestricken pricked to the heart when it looked on those whom it had pierced as it had pierced christ the lord and cried as the centurion cried on calvary surely these were the sons and daughters of god  surely there was some thing more divine more noble more beautiful in these poor creatures dying in torture than in all the tyrants and conquerors and rich men of the earth  this is the true greatness this is the true heroismto do well and suffer for it patiently  and thenceforth men began to get slowly but surely a quite new idea of true greatness they learnt to see that not revenge but forgiveness not violence but resignation not success but holiness are the perfection of humanity  they began to have a reverence for those who were weak in body and simple in hearta reverence for women for children for slaves for all whom the world despises such as the old egyptians greeks romans had never had they began to see that god could make strong the weak things of this world and glorify himself in the courage and honesty of the poorest and the meanest  they began to see that in christ jesus was neither male nor female jew nor greek barbarian scythian slave or free but that all were one in christ jesus all alike capable of receiving the spirit of god all alike children of the one father who was above all and in all and with them all  and so the endurance and the sufferings of the early martyrs was the triumph of good over evil the triumph of honesty and truth of purity and virtue of gentleness and patience of faith in a just and loving god  because it was the triumph of the spirit of christ by which he died and rose again and conquered shame and pain and death and hell    sermon xxiitoleration    preached at christ church marylebone 1867 for the bishop of londons fund  matthew xiii 2430  the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field  but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way  but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also  so the servants of the household came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares  he said unto them an enemy hath done this  the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up  but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye toot up also the wheat with them  let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest  i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them  but gather the wheat into my barn  the thoughtful man who wishes well to the gospel of christ will hardly hear this parable without a feeling of humiliation  none of our lords parables are more clear and simple in their meaning none have a more direct and practical command appended to them none have been less regarded during the last fifteen hundred years toleration solemnly enjoined has been the exception  persecution solemnly forbidden has been the rule  men as usual have fancied themselves wiser than god for they have believed themselves wise enough to do what he had told them that they were not wise enough to do and so have tried to root the tares from among the wheat  men have as usual lacked faith in christ they did not believe that he was actually governing the earth which belonged to him that he was actually cultivating his field the world  they therefore believed themselves bound to do for him what he neglected or at least did not see fit to do for himself and they tried to root up the tares from among the wheat  they have tried to repress free thought and to silence novel opinions forgetful that christ must have been right after all and that in silencing opinions which startled them they might be quenching the spirit and despising prophecies  but they found it more difficult to quench the spirit than they fancied when they began the policy of repression  they have found that the spirit blew where it listed and they heard the sound of it but knew not whence it came or whither it went that the utterances which startled them the tones of feeling and thought which terrified them reappeared though crushed in one place suddenly in another that the whole atmosphere was charged with them as with electricity and that it was impossible to say where the unseen force might not concentrate itself at any moment and flash out in a lightning stroke  then their fear has turned to a rage  they have thought no more of putting down opinions  but of putting down men  they have found it more difficult than they fancied to separate the man from his opinions to hate the sin and love the sinner  and so they have begun to persecute and finding brute force or at least the chichane of law far more easy than either convincing their opponents or allowing themselves to be convinced by them they have fined imprisoned tortured burnt exterminated and like the roman conquerors of old made a desert and called that peace  and all the while the words stood written in the scriptures which they professed to believe  nay  lest while ye root up the tares ye root up the wheat also  they had been told if ever men were told that the work was beyond their powers of discernment  that whatever the tares were or however they came into gods field the world they were either too like the wheat or too intimately entangled with them for any mortal man to part them  god would part them in his own good time  if they trusted god they would let them be certain that he hated what was false what was hurtful infinitely more than they certain that he would some day cast out of his kingdom all things which offend and all that work injustice and whatsoever loveth and maketh a lie and that therefore if he suffered such things to abide awhile it was for them to submit and to believe that god loved the world better than they and knew better how to govern it  but if on the contrary they did not believe god then they would set to work in their disobedient selfconceit to do that which he had forbidden them and the certain result would be that with the tares they would root up the wheat likewise  note here two things  first it is not said that there were no tares among the wheat nor that the servants would fail in rooting some of them up  they would succeed probably in doing some good  but they would succeed certainly in doing more harm  in their shortsighted blind erring hasty zeal they would destroy the good with the evil their knowledge of this complex and miraculous universe was too shallow their canons of criticism were too narrow to decide on what ought or ought not to grow in the field of him whose ways and thoughts were as much higher than theirs as the heaven is higher than the earth  note also that the lord does not blame them for their purpose  he merely points out to them its danger and forbids it because it is dangerous for their wish to root out the tares was not natural we shall libel it by calling it that  it was distinctly spiritual the first impulse of spiritual men who love right and hate wrong and desire to cultivate the one and exterminate the other  to root out the tares to put down bad men and wrong thoughts by force is one of the earliest religious instincts  it is the childs instinct pardonable though mistaken  the natural manwhether the heathen savage at one end of the scale or the epicurean man of the world at the otherhas no such instinct  he will feel no anger against falsehood because he has no love for truth he will be liberal enough tolerant enough of all which does not touch his own self interest but that once threatened he too may join the ranks of the bigots and persecute not like them in the name of god and truth but in those of society and order and so the chief priests and pontius pilate may make common cause  and yet the chief priests with their sense of duty of truth and of right however blundering concealed perverted may be a whole moral heaven higher than pilate with no sense of aught beyond present expediency  but nevertheless what have been the consequences to both  that the chief priests have failed as utterly as the pilates  as god forewarned them they have rooted up the wheat with the tares they have made the blood of martyrs the seed of the church and more they have made martyrs of those who never deserved to be martyrs by wholesale and indiscriminate condemnation  they have forgotten that the wheat and the tares grow together not merely in separate men but in each mans own heart and thoughts that light and darkness wisdom and folly duty and ambition selfsacrifice and selfconceit are fighting in every soul of man in whom there is even the germ of spiritual life  therefore they have made men offenders for a word they have despised noble aspirations ignored deep and sound insights because they came in questionable shapes mingled with errors or eccentricities  they have cried in their haste here are tares and tares alone  again and again have religious men done this for many a hundred years and again and again the nemesis has fallen on them  a generation or two has passed and the world has revolted from their unjust judgments  it has perceived among the evil good which it had overlooked in an indignant haste and passionateness learnt from those who should have taught it wisdom patience and charity  it has made heroes of those who had been branded as heretics and has cried there was wheat and wheat alone and so religious men have hindered the very cause for which they fancied that they were fighting and have gained nothing by disobeying gods command save to weaken their own moral influence to increase the divisions of the church and to put a fresh stumblingblock in the path of the ignorant and the young  and what have been the consequences to christs church  have not her enemiesand her friends toofor centuries past cried in vain   for forms of faith let graceless zealots fight his cant he wrong whose life is in the right   of christian morals her enemies have not complained  but that these morals have been postponed neglected forgotten in the disputes over abstruse doctrines over ceremonies and over noceremonies that men who were all fully agreed in their definition of goodness and what a good man should be and do have denounced each other concerning matters which had no influence whatsoever to practical morality till the ungodly cried see how these christians hate one another  see how they waste their time in disputing concerning the accidents of the bread of life forgetful that thousands were perishing round them for want of any bread of life at all  my friends these things are true and have been true for centuries let us not try to forget them by denouncing them as the utterances of the malevolent and the unbelieving  let us rather imitate the wise man who said that he was always grateful to his critics for however unjust their attacks they were certain to attack and therefore to show him his weakest points  and here is our weakest point namely in our unhappy divisionswhich are the fruits of selfwill and selfconceit and of the vain attempt to do that which god incarnate has told us we cannot doto part the wheat from the tares  we cannot part them  man could never do it even in the simpler middle age  far less can he do it now in an age full of such strange such complex influences at once so progressive and conservative an age in which the same man is often craving after some new prospect of the future and craving at the same moment after the seemingly obsolete past longing for fresh truth and yet dreading to lose the old with hope struggling against fear courage against modesty scorn of imbecility against reverence for authority in the same mans heart while the mystery of the new world around him strives with the mystery of the old world which lies behind him while the belief that man is the same being now as he was five thousand years ago strives with the plain fact that he is assuming round us utterly novel habits opinions politics while the belief that christ is the same now as he was in judaea of oldyea the same yesterday today and for everstrives with the plain fact that his field the world is in a state in which it never has been since the making of the world while it is often most difficult though as i believe certainly possible to see those divine laws at work with which god governed the nations in old time  may god forgive us all both laity and clergy every cruel word every uncharitable thought every hasty judgment  have we not need in such a time as this of that divine humility which is the elder sister of divine charity have we not need of some of that godinspired modesty of st pauls i think as a child i speak as a child  i see through a glass darkly  have we not need to listen to his warning  he that regardeth the day to the lord he regardeth it and he that regardeth it not to the lord he regardeth it not  who art thou that judgest another  to his own master he standeth or falleth  yea and he shall stand for god is able to make him stand  have we not need to hear our lords solemn rebuke when st john boasted how he saw one casting out devils in christs name and he forbade him because he followed not themforbid him not  have we not need to believe st james when he tells us that every good gift and every perfect gift cometh from above from the father of lights and not as we have too often fancied sometimes from below from darkness and the pit  have we not need to keep in mind the canon of the wise gamalielif this counsel or this work be of man it will come to nought  but if it be of god we cannot overthrow it lest haply we too be found fighting even against god  have we not need to keep in mind that every spirit which confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and no man saith that jesus is the christ save by the spirit of god lest haply we too be found more fastidious than almighty god himself  have we not need to beware lest we like the scribes and pharisees should be found keeping the key of knowledge and yet not entering in ourselves and hindering those who would enter in have we not need to beware lest while we are settling which is the right gate to the kingdom of heaven the publicans and harlots should press into it before us and lest while we are boasting that we are the children of abraham god should without our help raise up children to abraham of those stones outside those hard hearts dull brains natures ground down by the drudgery of daily life till they are as the pavement of the streets those socalled heathen masses of whom we are bid to think this day  if there be any truth any reason in what i have saidor rather in what christ and his apostles have saidlet us lay it to heart upon this day on which the clergy of this great metropolis have found a common cause for which to plead whatever may be their minor differences of opinion  let us wish success to every argument by which this great cause may be enforced to every scheme of good which may be built up by its funds  let us remember that however much the sermons preached this day differ in details they will all agree thank god in the root and ground of their pleadingduty to christ and to those for whom christ died  let us remember that to whatever outwardly different purposes the money collected may be applied it will after all be applied to one purposeto christian civilization christian teaching christian discipline and that any christianity any christian civilization any christian discipline is infinitely better than none that though all mans systems and methods must be imperfect faulty yet they are infinitely better than anarchy and heathendom just as the wheat however much mixed with weeds is infinitely better than the weeds alone  but above all let us wish well to all schemes of education of whatever kind certain that any education is better than none  and therefore let me entreat you to subscribe bountifully to that scheme for which i specially plead this day  let me remind you very solemnly that the present dearth of education in these realms is owing mainly to our unhappy religious dissensions that it is the disputes not of unbelievers but of christians which have made it impossible for our government to fulfil one of the first rights one of the first duties of any government in a civilized country namely to command and to compel every child in the realm to receive a proper education  strange and sad that so it should be  yet so it is  we have been letting we are letting still year by year thousands sink and drown in the slough of heathendom and brutality while we are debating learnedly whether a raft or a boat or a rope or a lifebuoy is the legitimate instrument for saving them and future historians will record with sorrow and wonder a fact which will be patent to them though the dust of controversy hides it from our eyeseven the fact that the hinderers of education in these realms were to be found not among the socalled sceptics not among the socalled infidels but among those who believed that god came down from heaven and became man and died on the cross for every savage child in london streets compulsory government education is by our own choice and determination impossible  the more solemn is the duty laid on us on laity and clergy alike to supply that want by voluntary education  the clergy will do their duty each in his own way  let the laity do theirs likewise in fear and trembling as men who have voluntarily and deliberately undertaken to educate the lower classes and who must do it or bear the shame for ever  for in the last day when we shall all appear before him whose ways are not as our ways or his thoughts as our thoughtsin that day the question will not be whether the compulsory system or the denominational system or any other system satisfied best our sectarian ways and our narrow thoughts  but whether they satisfied the ways of that father in heaven who willeth not that one little child should perish    sermon xxiiithe kingdom of christ    luke xix 41  and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it  let us think awhile what was meant by our lords weeping over jerusalem  we ought to learn thereby somewhat more of our lords character and of our lords government  why did he weep over that city whose people would in a few days mock him scourge him crucify him and so fill up the measure of their own iniquity  had jesus been like too many who since his time have fancied themselves saints and prophets would he not have rather cursed the city than wept over it with tenderness regret sorrow most human and most divine for that horrible destruction which before forty years were past would sweep it off the face of the earth and leave not one stone of those glorious buildings on another  the only answer isthat in spite of all its sins he loved jerusalem  for more than a thousand years he had put his name there  it was to be the salt of the earth the light of the world the city set on a hill which could not be hid  from jerusalem was to go forth to all nations the knowledge of the one true god as a light to lighten the gentiles as well as a glory to his people israel  this was our lords purpose this had been his purpose for one thousand years and more  and behold mans sin and folly had frustrated for a time the gracious will of god  that glorious city with its temple its worship its religion true as far as it went and in spite of all the traditions with which the scribes and pharisees had overlaid it infinitely better than the creed or religion of any other people in the old worldall this instead of being a blessing to the world had become a curse  the jews who had the key of the knowledge of god neither entered in themselves nor let the gentiles enter in  they who were to have taught all the world were hating and cursing all the world and being hated and cursed by them in return  jerusalem the holy city set on a hill instead of being a light to the world was become a nuisance to the world  jerusalem was the salt of the world meant to help it all from decay but the salt had lost its savour and in another generation it would be cast out and trodden under foot and become a byword among the gentiles  our lord the lord the hereditary king of the jews according to the flesh as well as the god of the jews according to the spirit foresaw the destruction of the work of his own hands of the spot on earth which was most precious to him  the ruin would be awful the suffering horrible  the daughters of jerusalem were to weep not for him but for themselves  blessed would be the barren and those that never nursed a child  they would call on the mountains to cover them and on the hills to hide them and call in vain  such tribulation would fall on them as never had been since the making of the world  mothers would eat their own children for famine  three thousand crosses would stand at one time in the valley below with a living man writhing on each  eleven hundred thousand souls would perish or be sold as slaves  it must be  the eternal laws of retribution according to which god governs the world must have their way now  it was too late  it must happen now  but it need not have happened  and at that thought our lords infinite heart burst forth in human tenderness human pity human love as he looked on that magnificent city those gorgeous temples castles palaces that mighty multitude which dreamt so little of the awful doom which they were bringing on themselves  and now where is he that wept over jerusalem  has he left this world to itself  does he care no longer for the rise and fall of nations the struggles and hopes the successes and the failures of mankind  not so my friends  he has ascended up on high and sat down at the right hand of god  but he has done so that he might fill all things  to him all power is given in heaven and earth  he reigneth over the nations  he sitteth on that throne whereof the eternal father hath said to him sit thou on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool and again desire of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the utmost ends of the earth for thy possession  he is set upon his throne as st john saw him in his revelation judging right and ministering true judgment unto the people  the nations may furiously rage together and the people may imagine a vain thing  the kings of the earth may stand up and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bondsthat is their laws asunder and cast away their cordsthat is their gospelfrom us  they may say tush god doth not see neither doth god regard it  we are they that ought to speak  who is lord over us nevertheless christ is king of kings and lord of lords he reigns and will reign  and kings must be wise and the judges of the earth must be learned they must serve the lord in fear and rejoice before him with reverence  they must worship the son lest he be angry and so they perish from the right way  all the nations of the world with their kings and their people their war their trade their politics and their arts and sciences are in his hands as clay in the hands of the potter fulfilling his will and not their own going his way and not their own  it is he who speaks concerning a nation or a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it  and it is he again who speaks concerning a nation or kingdom to build and to plant it  for the lord is king be the world never so much moved  he sitteth between the cherubim though the earth be never so unquiet  but while we recollect thiswhich in these days almost all forget that christ the lord is the ruler and he alone we must recollect likewise that he is not only a divine but a human ruler  we must recollectoh blessed thoughtthat there is a man in the midst of the throne of heaven that christ has taken for ever the manhood into god and that all judgment is committed to him because he is the son of man who can feel for men and with men  yes christs humanity is no less now than when he wept over jerusalem and therefore we may believe we must believe that while jesus is very god of very god yet his sacred heart is touched with a divine compassion for the follies of men a divine regret for their failures a divine pity for the ruin which they bring so often on themselves  we must believe that even when he destroys he does so with regret that when he cuts down the tree which cumbers the ground he grieves over it as he grieved over his chosen vine the nation of the jews  it is a comfort to remember this as we watch the world change and the fashions of it vanish away  great kingdoms venerable institutions gallant parties which have done good work in their time upon gods earth grow old wear out lose their first love of what was just and true and know not the things which belong to their peace but grow as the jews grew in their latter years more and more fanatical quarrelsome peevish uncharitable trying to make up by violence for the loss of strength and sincerity  till they come to an end and die often by unjust and unfair means and by men worse than they  shall we not believe that christ has pity on them that he who wept over jerusalem going to destruction by its own blindness sorrows over the sins and follies which bring shame on countries once prosperous authorities once venerable causes once noble  they too were thoughts of christ  whatsoever good was in them he inspired whatsoever strength was in them he gave whatsoever truth was in them he taught whatsoever good work they did he did through them  perhaps he looks on them not with wrath and indignation but with pity and sorrow when he sees mans weakness folly and sin bringing to naught his gracious purposes and falling short of his glorious will  it is a comfort i say to believe this in these times of change places manners opinions institutions change around us more and more and we are often sad when we see good old fashions in which we were brought up which we have loved revered looked on as sacred things dying out fast and new fashions taking their places which we cannot love because we do not trust them or even understand  the old ways were good enough for us  why should they not be good enough for our children after us  therefore we are sad at times and the young and the ambitious are apt to sneer at us because we delight in what is old rather than what is new  let us remember then that whatsoever changes still there is one who cannot change jesus christ the same yesterday today and for ever  surely he can feel for us when he sees us regret old fashions and old times surely he does not look on our sadness as foolish weak or sinful  it is pardonable for it is human and he has condescended to feel it himself when he wept over jerusalem  only he bids us not despair not doubt his wisdom his love the justice and beneficence of his rule  he ordereth all things in heaven and earth and therefore all things must at last go well   the old order changes giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world   we must believe that and trust in christ  we must trust in him that he will not cut down any tree in his garden until it actually cumbers the ground altogether unfruitful and taking up room which might be better used  we must trust him that he will cast nothing out of his kingdom till it actually offends makes men stumble and fall to their destruction  we must trust him that he will do away with nothing that is old without putting something better in its place  thus we shall keep up our hearts though things do change round us sometimes mournfully enough  for christ destroyed jerusalem  but again its destruction was as st paul said life to all nations  he destroyed moses law  but he by so doing put in its place his own gospel  he scattered abroad the nations of the jews but he thereby called into his church all nations of the earth he destroyed with a fearful destruction the holy city and temple over which he wept  but he did so in order that the holy city the new jerusalem even his church should come down from heaven needing no temple for he himself is the temple thereof that the nations of those which were saved should walk in the light of it and that the river of the water of life should flow from the throne of god and that the leaves of the trees which grew thereby should be for the healing of the nations  in that magnificent imagery st john shows us how the most terrible destruction which the lord ever brought upon a holy place and holy institutions was really a blessing to all the world  let us believe that it has been so often since that it will be so often again  let us look forward to the future with hope and faith even while we look back on the past with love and regret  let us leave unmanly and unchristian fears to those who fancy that christ has deserted his kingdom and has left them to govern it in his stead and who naturally break out into peevishness and terrified lamentations when they discover that the world will not go their way or any mans way because it is going the way of god whose ways are not as mans ways nor his thoughts as mans thoughts  let us have faith in god and in christ amid all the chances and changes of this mortal life and believe that he is leading the world and mankind to      one faroff divine event toward which the whole creation moves   and possess our souls in patience and in faith and in hope for ourselves and for our children after while we say with the psalmist of old  thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands  they shall perish but thou shalt endure  they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be cleansed  but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail  the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight  amen    sermon xxivthe likeness of god    ephesians iv 23 24  and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness  be renewed says st paul in the spirit of your mindin the tone character and habit of your mind  and put on the new man the new pattern of man who was created after god in righteousness and true holiness  pay attention i beg you to every word here  to understand them clearly is most important to you  according as you take them rightly or wrongly will your religion be healthy or unhealthy and your notion of what god requires of you true or false  the new man the new pattern of man says st paul is created after god  that is after the pattern of god in the image of god in the likeness of god  you will surely see that that is his meaning  we speak of making a thing after another thing meaning make it exactly like another thing  so by making a man after god st paul means making a man like god  now what is this man  none be sure save christ himself the co equal and coeternal son of god  of him alone can it be said utterly that he is after godthe brightness of gods glory and the express image of his person  but still he is a man and meant as a pattern to men the new adam the new pattern type and ideal for all mankind  him says st paulthat is his likenesswe are to put on that as he was after the likeness of god so may we be likewise  but now in what does this same likeness consist  st paul tells us distinctly lest we should mistake a matter of such boundless importance as the question of all questionswhat is the life of god the divine and godlike life  it is created founded says he in righteousness and true holiness that is the character that is the form of it  whatever we do not know whatever we cannot know concerning god and his divine life we know that it consists of righteousness and true holiness  and what is righteousness  justice  you must understandas any good scholar or divine would assure youthat st paul is not speaking here of the imputed righteousness of christ  he is speaking of righteousness in the simple old testament meaning of the word of justice whereof our lord has said do unto others as ye would they should do unto you justice which as wise men of old have said consists in thisto harm no man and to give each man his own that is true righteousness and justice and that is the godlike life  and true holiness  that is truthful holiness honest holiness this is st pauls meaning  as any good scholar or divine would tell you st pauls exact words are the holiness of truth  he does not mean true holiness as opposed to a false holiness a legal holiness a holiness of empty forms and ceremonies or a holiness of ascetism and celibacy but as opposed to a holiness which does not speak the truth to that sly untruthful prevaricating holiness which was only too common in st pauls time and has been but too common since  be honest says st paul for this too is part of the godlike life and the new man is created after god in justice and honesty  and that this is what st paul actually means is clear from what immediately follows  wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour  for we are members one of another  what does the wherefore mean if not that because the life of god is a life of justice and honesty therefore you must not lie therefore you must not hear spite and malice therefore you must not steal but rather work therefore you must avoid all foul talk which may injure your neighbour but rather teach refine educate him  it would seem at first sight that this would have been a gospel and good news to men  but alas it has not been such  in all ages in all religions men have turned away from this simple righteousness of god which is created in justice and truth and have sought some righteousness of their own founded upon anything and everything save common morality and honesty  alas for the spiritual pride of man he is not content to be simply just and true for any one and every one he thinks can be that  he must needs be something which other people cannot be  he must needs be able to thank god that he is not as other men are and say this people this wicked world who knoweth not our law is accursed  if god had bid men do some great thing to save their souls would they not have done it  how much more when he says simply to them as to naaman wash and be clean  wash you says the lord by the prophet isaiah make you clean  put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes  cease to do evil  learn to do well seek justice relieve the oppressed and then though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow  but no  any one can do that and therefore it is beneath the spiritual pride of man  in our own days there are too many who do not hesitate to look down on plain justice and plain honesty as natural virtues which so they say men can have without the grace of god and make a distinction between these natural virtues and the effects of gods spirit which is not only not to be found in scripture but is contradicted by scripture from beginning to end  now there can be no doubt that such notions concerning religion do harm that they demoralise thousandsthat is make them less moral and good men  for there are thousands especially in england who are persons of good commonsense uprightness and truthfulness  but they have not lively fancies or quick feelings  they have no inclination for a life of exclusive devoutness and if they had they have no time for it  they must do their business in the world where god has put them  and when they are told that god requires of them certain frames and feelings and that the godlike life consists in them then they are disheartened and say there is no use then in my trying to be religious or moral either  if plain honesty justice sobriety usefulness in my place will not please god i cannot please him at all  why then should i try if my way of trying is of no use  why should i try to be honest sober and useful if that is not true religionif what god wants of me is not virtue but a certain highflown religiousness which i cannot feel or even understandand so they grow weary in welldoing and careless about the plain duties of morality  they become careless likewise about the plain duties of religion and so they are demoralised because they are told that justice and the holiness of truth are not the godlike and eternal life because they are told that religion has little or nothing to do with their daily life and business nothing to do with those just and truthful instincts of their hearts which they feel to be the most sacred things about them which are their best if not their only guide in life  but more  they fall into the mistake that they can have a righteousness of their own and into that pelagianism as it is called which is growing more and more the creed of modern men of the world  too many religious people on the other hand are demoralised by the very same notion  they too are taught that justice and truth are mere morality as it is called and not the grace of god that they are not the foundation of the divine life that they are not the essence of true religion therefore they become more and more careless about mere moralityso careless of justice so careless of truth as to bring often fearful scandals on religion  meanwhile men in general especially englishmen have a very sound instinct on this whole matter  they have a sound instinct that if god be good then goodness is the only true mark of godliness and that goodness consists first and foremost in plain justice and plain honesty and they ask not what a mans religious profession is not what his religious observances are  butwhat is the man himself is he a just upright and fairdealing man  is he true  can we depend on his word  if not his religion counts for nothing with them  as it ought to count  now i hold that st paul in this text declares that the plain english folk who talk thus and who are too often called mere worldlings and men of the world are right that justice and honesty are the divine life itself and the very likeness of christ and of god  justice and truth all men can have and therefore all men are required to have  about devotional feelings about religious observances however excellent and blessed we may deceive ourselves for we may put them in the place of sanctification of righteousness and true holiness  about justice and honesty we cannot deceive ourselves for they are sanctification itself righteousness itself true holiness itself the very likeness of god and the very grace of god  but if so they come from god they are gods gift and not any natural product of our own hearts  and for that very reason we can and must keep them alive in us by prayer  as long as we think that the sentiment of justice and truth is our own so long shall we be in danger of forgetting it paltering with it playing false to it in temptation and by some injustice or meanness grieving as st paul warns us the holy spirit of god who has inspired us with that priceless treasure  but if we believe that from god the fount of justice comes all our justice that from god the fount of truth comes all our truthfulness then we shall cry earnestly to him day by day as we go about this worlds work to be kept from all injustice and from all falsehood  we shall entreat him to cleanse us from our secret faults and to give us truth in the inward parts to pour into our hearts that love to our neighbour which is justice itself for it worketh no ill to its neighbour and so fulfils the law  we shall dread all meanness and cruelty as sins against the very spirit of god and our most earnest and solemn endeavour in life will be to keep innocence and take heed to the thing that is right for that will bring us peace at the last    footnotes  243  wordsworths ode on tintern abbey
