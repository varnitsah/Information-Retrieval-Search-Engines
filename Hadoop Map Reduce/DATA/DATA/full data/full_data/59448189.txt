caesar  the soldiers he led to battle were very strong and conquered the people wherever they went  they had no gun or gunpowder then but they had swords and spears and to prevent themselves from being hurt they had helmets or brazen caps on their heads with long tufts of horsehair upon them by way of ornament and breastplates of brass on their breasts and on their arms they carried a sort of screen made of strong leather  one of them carried a little brass figure of an eagle on a long pole with a scarlet flag flying below and wherever the eagle was seen they all followed and fought so bravely that nothing could long stand against them  when julius caesar rode at their head with his keen pale hooknosed face and the scarlet cloak that the general always wore they were so proud of him and so fond of him that there was nothing they would not do for him  julius caesar heard that a little way off there was a country nobody knew anything about except that the people were very fierce and savage and that a sort of pearl was found in the shells of mussels which lived in the rivers  he could not bear that there should be any place that his own people the romans did not know and subdue so he commanded the ships to be prepared and he and his soldiers embarked watching the white cliffs on the other side of the sea grow higher and higher as he came nearer and nearer  when he came quite up to them he found the savages were there in earnest  they were tall men with long red streaming hair and such clothes as they had were woollen checked like plaid but many had their arms and breasts naked and painted all over in blue patterns they yelled and brandished their darts to make julius caesar and his roman soldiers keep away but he only went on to a place where the shore was not quite so steep and there commanded his soldiers to land  the savages had run along the shore too and there was a terrible fight but at last the man who carried the eagle jumped down into the middle of the natives calling out to his fellows that they must come after him or they would lose their eagle  they all came rushing and leaping down and thus they managed to force back the savages and make their way to the shore  there was not much worth having when they had made their way there though they came again the next year and forced their way a good deal farther into the country they saw chiefly bare downs or heaths or thick woods  the few houses were little more than piles of stones and the people were rough and wild and could do very little  the men hunted wild boars and wolves and stags and the women dug the ground and raised a little corn which they ground to flour between two stones to make bread and they spun the wool of their sheep dyed it with bright colors and wove it into dresses  they had some strong places in the woods with trunks of trees cut down to shut them in from the enemy with all their flocks and cattle but caesar did not get into any of these  he only made the natives give him some of their pearls and call the romans their masters and then he went back to his ships and none of the set of savages who were alive when he came saw him or his romans any more  do you know who these savages were who fought with julius caesar they were called britons  and the country he came to see  that was our very own island england only it was not called so then  and the place where julius caesar landed is called deal and if you look at the map where england and france most nearly touch one another i think you will see the name deal and remember it was there julius caesar landed and fought with the britons  it was fiftyfive years before our blessed saviour was born that the romans came  so at the top of this chapter stands bc before christ 55     chapter ii  the romans in britain  ad 41418   it was nearly a hundred years before any more of the romans came to britain but they were people who could not hear of a place without wanting to conquer it and they never left off trying till they had done what they undertook  one of their emperors named claudius sent his soldiers to conquer the island and then came to see it himself and called himself brittanicus in honor of the victory just as if he had done it himself instead of his generals  one british chief whose name was caractacus who had fought very bravely against the romans was brought to rome with chains on his hands and feet and set before them emperor  as he stood there he said that when he looked at all the grand buildings of stone and marble in the streets he could not think why the romans should want to take away the poor roughstone huts of the britons  the wife of caractacus who had also been brought a prisoner to rome fell upon her knees imploring for pity but the conquered chief asked for nothing and exhibited no signs of fear  claudius was kind to caractacus but the romans went on conquering britain till they had won all the part of it that lies south of the river tweed and as the people beyond that point were more fierce and savage still a very strong wall with a bank of earth and deep ditch was made to keep them out and always watched by roman soldiers  the romans made beautiful straight roads all over the country and they built towns  almost all the towns whose names end in chester were begun by the romans and bits of their walls are to be seen still built of very small bricks  sometimes people dig up a bit of the beautiful pavement of colored tiles in patterns which used to be the floors of their houses or a piece of their money or one of their ornaments  for the romans held britain for four hundred years and tamed the wild people in the south and taught them to speak and dress and read and write like themselves so that they could hardly be known from the romans  only the wild ones beyond the wall and in the mountains were as savage as ever and now and then used to come and steal the cattle and burn the houses of their neighbors who had learnt better  another set of wild people used to come over in boats across the north sea and german ocean  these people had their home in the country that is called holstein and jutland  they were tall men and had blue eyes and fair hair and they were very strong and goodnatured in a rough sort of way though they were fierce to their enemies  there was a great deal more fighting than any one has told us about but the end of it all was that the roman soldiers were wanted at home and though the great british chief we call king arthur fought very bravely he could not drive back the blueeyed men in the ships but more and more came till at last they got all the country and drove the britons some up into the north some into the mountains that rise along the west of the island and some into its west point  the britons used to call the blueeyed men saxons but they called themselves angles and the country was called after them angleland dont you know what it is called now  england itself and the people english  they spoke much the same language as we do only more as untaught country people and they had not so many words because they had not so many things to see and talk about  as to the britons the english went on driving them back till they only kept their mountains  there they have gone on living ever since and talking their own old language  the english called them welsh a name that meant strangers and we call them welsh still and their country wales  they made a great many grand stories about their last brave chief arthur till at last they turned into a sort of fairy tale  it was said that when king arthur lay badly wounded after his last battle he bade his friend fling his sword into the river and that then three lovely ladies came in a boat and carried him away to a secret island  the welsh kept on saying for years and years that one day king arthur would wake up again and give them back all britain which used to be their own before the english got it for themselves but the english have had england now for thirteen hundred years and we cannot doubt they will keep it as long as the world lasts  it was about 400 years after our lord was born that the romans were going and the english coming     chapter iii  the angle children  ad 597   the old english who had come to britain were heathen and believed in many false gods the sun to whom they made sunday sacred as monday was to the moon wednesday to a great terrible god named woden and thursday to a god named thor or thunder  they thought a clap of thunder was the sound of the great hammer he carried in his hand they thought their gods cared for people being brave and that the souls of those who died fighting gallantly in battle were the happiest of all but they did not care for kindness or gentleness  thus they often did very cruel things and one of the worst that they did was the stealing of men women and children from their homes and selling them to strangers who made slaves of them  all england had not one king  there were generally about seven kings each with a different part of the island and as they were often at war with one another they used to steal one anothers subjects and sell them to merchants who came from italy and greece for them  some english children were made slaves and carried to rome where they were set in the marketplace to be sold  a good priest named gregory was walking by  he saw their fair faces blue eyes and long light hair and stopping he asked who they were  angles he was told from the isle of britain  angles he said they have angel faces and they ought to be heirs with the angels in heaven  from that time this good man tried to find means to send teachers to teach the english the christian faith  he had to wait for many years and in that time he was made pope namely fatherbishop of rome  at last he heard that one of the chief english kings ethelbert of kent had married bertha the daughter of the king of paris who was a christian and that she was to be allowed to bring a priest with her and have a church to worship in  gregory thought this would make a beginning so he sent a priest whose name was augustine with a letter to king ethelbert and queen bertha and asked the king to listen to him  ethelbert met augustine in the open air under a tree at canterbury and heard him tell about the true god and jesus christ whom he sent and after some time and a great deal of teaching ethelbert gave up worshiping woden and thor and believed in the true god and was baptized and many of his people with him  then augustine was made archbishop of canterbury and one after another in the course of the next hundred years all the english kingdoms learnt to know god and broke down their idols and became christian  bishops were appointed and churches were built and parishes were marked offa great many of them the very same that we have now  here and there when men and women wanted to be very good indeed and to give their whole lives to doing nothing but serving god without any of the fighting and feasting the buying and selling of the outer world they built houses where they might live apart and churches where there might be services seven times a day  these houses were named abbeys  those for men were sometimes also called monasteries and the men in them were termed monks while the women were called nuns and their homes convents of nunneries  they had plain dark dresses and hoods and the women always had veils  the monks used to promise that they would work as well as pray so they used to build their abbeys by some forest or marsh and bring it all into order turning the wild place into fields full of wheat  others used to copy out the holy scriptures and other good books upon parchment because there was no paper in those days nor any printingdrawing beautiful painted pictures at the beginning of the chapters which were called illuminations  the nun did needlework and embroidery as hangings for the altar and garments for the priests all bright with beautiful colors and stiff with gold  the english nuns work was the most beautiful to be seen anywhere  there were schools in the abbeys where boys were taught reading writing singing and latin to prepare them for being clergymen but not many others thought it needful to have anything to do with books even the great men thought they could farm and feast advise the king and consent to the laws hunt or fight quite as well without reading and they did not care for much besides for though they were christians they were still rude rough ignorant men who liked nothing so well as a hunt or a feast and slept away all the evening especially when they could get a harper to sing to them  the english men used to wear a long dress like a carters frock and their legs were wound round with strips of cloth by way of stockings their houses were only one story and had no chimneysonly a hole at the top for the smoke to go out at and no glass in the windows  the only glass there was at all had been brought from italy to put into york cathedral and it was thought a great wonder  so the windows had shutters to keep out the rain and wind and the fire was in the middle of the room  at dinnertime about twelve oclock the lord and lady of the house sat upon crosslegged stools and their children and servants sat on benches and square bits of wood called trenchers were put before them for plates while the servants carried round the meat on spits and everybody cut off a piece with his own knife and at it without a fork  they drank out of cows horns if they had not silver cups  but though they were so rough they were often good brave people     chapter iv  the northmen  ad 858958   there were many more of the lighthaired blueeyed people on the further side of the north sea who worshiped thor and woden still and thought that their kindred in england had fallen from the old ways besides they liked to make their fortunes by getting what they could from their neighbors  nobody was thought brave or worthy in norway or denmark who had not made some voyages in a long keel as a ship was called and fought bravely and brought home gold cups and chains or jewels to show where he had been  their captains were called sea kings and some them went a great way even into the mediterranean sea and robbed the beautiful shores of italy  so dreadful was it to see the fleet of long ships coming up to the shore with a serpent for the figurehead and a raven as the flag and crowds of fierce warriors with axes in their hands longing for prey and bloodshed that where we pray in church that god would deliver us from lightning and tempest and battle and murder our forefathers used to add from the fury of the northmen good lord deliver us  to england these northmen came in great swarms and chiefly from denmark so that they were generally call the danes  they burnt the houses drove off the cows and sheep killed the men and took away the women and children to be slaves and they were always most cruel of all where they found an abbey with any monks or nuns because they hated the christian  faith  by this time those seven english kingdoms i told you of had all fallen into the hands of one king  egbert king of the west saxons who reigned at winchester is counted as the first king of all england  his four grandsons had dreadful battles with the danes all their lives and the three eldest all died quite young  the youngest was the greatest and best king england ever hadalfred the truthteller  as a child alfred excited the hopes and admiration of all who saw him and while his brothers were busy with their sports it was his delight to kneel at his mothers knee and recite to her the saxon ballads which his tutor had read to him inspiring him at that early age with the ardent patriotism and the passionate love of literature which rendered his character so illustrious  he was only twentytwo years old when he came to the throne and the kingdom was overrun everywhere with the danes  in the northern part some had even settled down and made themselves at home as the english had done four hundred years before and more and more kept coming in their ships so that though alfred beat them in battle again and again there was no such thing as driving them away  at last he had so very few faithful men left him that he thought it wise to send them away and hide himself in the somersetshire marsh country  there is a pretty story told of him that he was hidden in the hut of a poor herdsman whose wife thinking he was a poor wandering soldier as he sat by the fire mending his bow and arrows desired him to turn the cakes she had set to bake upon the hearth  presently she found them burning and cried out angrily lazy rogue you cant turn the cakes though you can eat them fast enough  however that same spring the brave english gained more victories alfred came out of his hiding place and gathered them all together and beat the danes so that they asked for peace  he said he would allow those who had settled in the north of england to stay there provided they would become christians and he stood godfather to their chief and gave him the name of ethelstane  after this alfred had stout ships built to meet the danes at sea before they could come and land in england and thus he kept them off so that for all the rest of his reign and that of his son and grandsons they could do very little mischief and for a time left off coming at all but went to rob other countries that were not so well guarded by brave kings  but alfred was not only a brave warrior  he was a most good and holy man who feared god above all things and tried to do his very best for his people  he made good laws for them and took care that every one should be justly treated and that nobody should do his neighbor wrong without being punished  so many abbeys had been burnt and the monks killed by the danes that there were hardly any books to be had or scholars to read them  he invited learned men from abroad and wrote and translated books himself for them and he had a school in his house where he made the young nobles learn with his own sons  he built up the churches and gave alms to the poor and he was always ready to hear the troubles of any poor man  though he was always working so hard he had a disease that used to cause him terrible pain almost every day  his last years were less peaceful than the middle ones of his reign for the danes tried to come again but he beat them off by his ships at sea and when he died at fiftytwo years old in the year 901 he left england at rest and quiet and we always think of him as one of the greatest and best kings who ever reigned in england or in any other country  as long as his children after him and his people went on in the good way he had taught them all prospered with them and no enemies hurt them and this was all through the reigns of his son his grandson and greatgrandsons  their council of great men was called by a long word that is in our english wise mens meeting and there they settled the affairs of the kingdom  the kings wife was not called queen but lady and what do you think lady means  it means loafgivergiver of bread to her household and the poor  so a ladys great work is to be charitable     chapter v  the danish conquest  ad 9581035   the last very prosperous king was alfreds greatgrandson edgar who was owned as their overlord by all the kings of the remains of the britons in wales and scotland  once eight of these kings came to meet him at chester and rowed him in his barge along the river dee it was the grandest day a king of england enjoyed for many years edgar was called the peaceable because there were no attacks by the danes at all through his reign  in fact the northmen and danes had been fighting among themselves at home and these fights generally ended in some one going off as a seaking with all his friends and trying to gain a new home in some fresh country  one great party of northmen under a very tall and mighty chief named rollo had some time before thus gone to france and forced the king to give them a great piece of his country just opposite to england which was called after them normandy  there they learned to talk french and grew like frenchmen though they remained a great deal braver and more spirited than any of their neighbors  there were continually fleets of danish ships coming to england and the son of edgar whose name was ethelred was a helpless cowardly sort of man so slow and tardy that his people called him ethelred the unready  instead of fitting out ships to fight against the danes he took the money the ships ought to have cost to pay them to go away without plundering and as to those who had come into the country without his leave he called them his guard took them into his pay and let them live in the houses of the english where they were very rude and gave themselves great airs making the english feed them on all their best meat and bread and beer and always call them lord danes  he made friends himself with the northmen or normans who had settled in france and married emma the daughter of their duke but none of his plans prospered things grew worse and worse and his mind and his peoples grew so bitter against the danes that at last it was agreed that all over the south of england every englishman should rise up in one night and murder the dane who lodged in his house  among those danes who were thus wickedly killed was the sister of the king of denmark  of course he was furious when he heard of it and came over to england determined to punish the cruel treacherous king and people and take the whole island for his own  he did punish the people killing burning and plundering wherever he went but he could never get the king into his hands for ethelred went off in the height of the danger to normandy where he had before sent his wife emma and her children leaving his eldest son child of his first wife edmund ironside to fight for the kingdom as best he might  the king of denmark died in the midst of his english war but his son cnut went on with the conquest he had begun and before long ethelred the unready died and edmund ironside was murdered and cnut became king of england as well as of denmark  he became a christian and married emma ethelreds widow though she was much older than himself he had been a hard and cruel man but he now laid aside his evil ways and became a noble and wise and just king a lover of churches and good men and the english seem to have been as well off under him as if he had been one of their own kings  there is no king of whom more pleasant stories are told  one is of his wanting to go to church at ely abbey one cold candlemas day  ely was on a hill in the middle of a great marsh  the marsh was frozen over not strong enough to bear and they all stood looking at it  then out stepped a stout countryman who was so fat that his nickname was the pudding  are you all afraid he said  i will go over at once before the king  will you said the king then i will come after you for whatever bears you will bear me  cnut was a little slight man and he got easily over and pudding got a piece of land for his reward  these servants of the king used to flatter him  they told him he was lord of land and sea and that every thing would obey him  let us try said cnut who wished to show them how foolish and profane they were bring out my chair to the seaside  he was at southampton at the time close to the sea and the tide was coming in  now sea he said as he sat down i am thy lord dare not to come near nor wet my feet  of course the waves rolled on and splashed over him and he turned to his servants and bade them never say words that took away from the honor due to the only lord of heaven and earth  he never put on his crown again after this but hung it up in winchester cathedral  he was a thorough good king and there was much grief when he died stranger though he was  a great many danes had made their homes in yorkshire and lincolnshire ever since alfreds time and some of their customs are still left there and some of their words  the worst of them was that they were great drunkards and the english learnt this bad custom of them     chapter vi  the norman conquest  ad 10351066   cnut left three sons but one was content to be only king of denmark and the other two died very soon  so a great english nobleman called earl godwin set up as king edward one of those sons of ethelred the unready who had been sent away to normandy  he was a very kind good pious man who loved to do good  he began the building of our grand church at westminster abbey and he was so holy that he was called the confessor which is a word for good men not great enough to be called saints  he was too goodnatured as you will say when you hear that one day when he was in bed he saw a thief come cautiously into his room open the chest where his treasure was and take out the money bags  instead of calling anyone or seizing the man the king only said sleepily take care you rogue or my chancellor will catch you and give you a good whipping  you can fancy that nobody much minded such a king as this and so there were many disturbances in his time  some of them rose out of the kingwho had been brought up in normandyliking the normans better than the english  they really were much cleverer and more sensible for they had learnt a great deal in france while the english had forgotten much of what alfred and his sons had taught them and all through the long sad reign of ethelred had been getting more dull and clumsy and rude  moreover they had learnt of the danes to be sad drunkards but both they and the danes thought the norman french fine gentlemen and could not bear the sight of them  think then how angry they all were when it began to be said that king edward wanted to leave his kingdom of england to his mothers norman nephew duke william because all his own near relations were still little boys not likely to be grown up by the time the old king died many of the english wished for harold the son of earl godwin a brave spirited man but edward sent him to normandy and there duke william made him swear an oath not to do anything to hinder the kingdom from being given to duke william  old king edward died soon after and harold said at once that his promise had been forced and cheated from him so that he need not keep it and he was crowned king of england  this filled william with anger  he called all his fighting normans together fitted out ships and sailed across the english channel to dover  the figurehead of his own ship was a likeness of his second little boy named william  he landed at pevensey in sussex and set up his camp while harold was away in the north fighting with a runaway brother of his own who had brought the norwegians to attack yorkshire harold had just won a great battle over these enemies when he heard that william and his normans had landed and he had to hurry the whole length of england to meet them  many of the english would not join him because they did not want him for their king  but though his army was not large it was very brave when he reached sussex he placed all his men on the top of a low hill near hastings and caused them to make a fence all round with a ditch before it and in the middle was his own standard with a fighting man embroidered upon it  then the normans rode up on their warhorses to attack him one brave knight going first singing  the warhorses stumbled in the ditch and the long spears of the english killed both men and horses  then william ordered his archers to shoot their arrows high in the air  they came down like hail into the faces and on the heads of the english  harold himself was pierced by one in the eye  the normans charged the fence again and broke through and by the time night came on harold himself and all his brave englishmen were dead  they did not flee away they all staid and were killed fighting to the last and only then was harolds standard of the fighting man rooted up and williams standarda cross which had been blessed by the popeplanted instead of it  so ended the battle of hastings in the year 1066  the land has had a great many conquests hithertothe roman conquest the english conquest and now the norman conquest  but there have been no more since and the kings and queens have gone on in one long line ever since from william of normandy down to queen victoria     chapter vii  william the conqueror  ad 10661087   the king who had conquered england was a brave strong man who had been used to fighting and struggling ever since he was a young child  he really feared god and was in many ways a good man but it had not been right of him to come and take another peoples country by force and the having done one wrong thing often makes people grow worse and worse  many of the english were unwilling to have william as their king and his norman friends were angry that he would not let them have more of the english lands nor break the english laws  so they were often rising up against him and each time he had to put them down he grew more harsh and stern  he did not want to be cruel but he did many cruel things because it was the only way to keep england  when the people of northumberland rose against him and tried to get back the old set of kings he had the whole country wasted with fire and sword till hardly a town or village was left standing  he did this to punish the northumbrians and frighten the rest  but he did another thing that was worse because it was only for his own amusement  in hampshire near his castle of winchester there was a great space of heathy ground and holly copse and beeches and oaks above it with deer and boars running wild in the gladesa beautiful place for hunting only that there were so many villages in it that the creatures were disturbed and killed  william liked hunting more than anything elsehis people said he loved the high deer as if he was their fatherand to keep the place clear for them he turned out all the inhabitants and pulled down their houses and made laws against any one killing his game  the place he thus cleared is still called the new forest though it is a thousand years old  an old norman law that the english grumbled about very much was that as soon as a bell was rung at eight oclock every evening everyone was to put out candle and fire and go to bed  the bell was called the curfew and many old churches ring it still  william caused a great list to be made of all the lands in the country and who held them  we have this list still and it is called domesday book  it shows that a great deal had been taken from the english and given to the normans  the king built castles with immensely thick strong walls and loophole windows whence to shoot arrows and here he placed his normans to keep the english down  but the normans were even more unruly than the english and only his strong hand kept them in order  they rode about in armorhelmets on their heads a shirt of mail made of iron linked together over their bodies gloves and boots of iron swords by their sides and lances in their handsand thus they could bear down all before them  they called themselves knights and were always made to take an oath to befriend the weak and poor and helpless but they did not often keep it towards the poor english  william had four sonsrobert who was called courthose or shortlegs william called rufus because he had red hair henry called beau clerc or the fine scholar and richard who was still a lad when he was killed by a stag in the new forest  robert the eldest was a wild rude thoughtless youth but he fancied himself fit to govern normandy and asked his father to give it up to him  king william answered i never take my clothes off before i go to bed meaning that robert must wait for his death  robert could not bear to be laughed at and was very angry  soon after when he was in the castle court his two brothers william and henry grew riotous and poured water down from the upper windows on him and his friends  he flew into a passion dashed upstairs with his sword in his hand and might have killed his brothers if their father had not come in to protect them  then he threw himself on his horse and galloped away persuaded some friends to join him and actually fought a battle with his own father in which the old king was thrown off his horse and hurt in the hand but we must do the prince the justice to say that when he recognized his father in the knight whom he had unseated he was filled with grief and horror and eagerly sought his pardon and tenderly raised him from the ground  then robert wandered about living on money that his mother queen matilda sent him though his father was angry with her for doing so and this made the first quarrel the husband and wife had ever had  not long after william went to war with the king of france  he had caused a city to be burnt down and was riding through the ruins when his horse trod on some hot ashes and began to plunge  the king was thrown forward on the saddle and being a very heavy stout man was so much hurt that after a few weeks in the year 1087 he died at a little monastery a short way from rouen the chief city of his dukedom of normandy  he was the greatest man of his time and he had much good in him and when he lay on his deathbed he grieved much for all the evil he had brought upon the english but that could not undo it  he had been a great churchbuilder and so were his norman bishops and barons  you always know their work because it has round pillars and round arches with broad borders of zigzags and all manner of patterns round them  in the end the coming of the normans did the english much good by brightening them up and making them less dull and heavy but they did not like having a king and court who talked french and cared more for normandy than for england     chapter viii  william ii rufus  ad 10871100   william the conqueror was obliged to let normandy fall to robert his eldest son but he thought he could do as he pleased about england which he had won for himself  he had sent off his second son william to england with his ring to westminster giving him a message that he hoped the english people would have him for their king  and they did take him though they would hardly have done do if they had known what he would be like when he was left to himself  but while he was kept under by his father they only knew that he had red hair and a ruddy face and had more sense than his brother robert  he is sometimes called the red king but more commonly william rufus  things went worse than ever with the poor english in his time for at lest william the conqueror had made everybody mind the law but now william rufus let his cruel soldiers do just as they pleased and spoil what they did not want  it was of no use to complain for the king would only laugh and make jokes  he did not care for god or man only for being powerful for feasting and for hunting  just at this time there was a great stir in europe  jerusalemthat holy city where our blessed lord had taught where he had been crucified and where he had risen from the deadwas a place where everyone wished to go and worship and this they called going on pilgrimage  a beautiful church had once been built over the sepulchre where our lord had lain and enriched with gifts  but for a long time past jerusalem had been in the hands of an eastern people who think their false prophet mahommed greater than our blessed lord  these mahommedans used to rob and illtreat the pilgrims and make them pay great sums of money for leave to come into jerusalem  at last a pilgrim named peter the hermit came home and got leave from the pope to try to go to the holy land and fight to get the holy sepulchre back into christian hands again  he used to preach in the open air and the people who heard him were so stirred up that they all shouted out it is gods will  it is gods will  and each who undertook to go and fight in the east received a cross cut out into cloth red or white to wear on his shoulder  many thousands promised to go on this crusade as they called it among them was robert duke of normandy but he had wasted his money so that he could not fit out an army to take with him  so he offered to give up normandy to his brother william while he was gone if william would let him have the money he wanted  the red king was very ready to make such a bargain and he laughed at the crusaders and thought that they were wasting their time and trouble  they had a very good man to lead them named godfrey de buillon and after many toils and troubles they did gain jerusalem and could kneel weeping at the holy sepulchre  it was proposed to make robert king of jerusalem but he would not accept the offer and godfrey was made king instead and staid to guard the holy places while duke robert set out on his return home  in the meantime the red king had gone on in as fierce and ungodly a way as ever laughing good advice to scorn and driving away the good archbishop of canterbury st anselm and everyone else who tried to warn him or withstand his wickedness  one day in the year 1100 he went out to hunt deer in the new forest which his father had wasted laughing and jesting in his rough way  by and by he was found under an oak tree with an arrow through his heart and a woodcutter took up his body in his cart and carried it to winchester cathedral where is was buried  who shot the arrow nobody knew and nobody ever will know  some thought it must be a knight named walter tyrrell to whom the king had given three long good arrows that morning  he rode straight away to southampton and went off to the holy land so it is likely that he knew something about the kings death  but he never seems to have told any one whether it was only an accident or a murder or who did it  anyway it was a fearful end for a bad man to die in his sin without a moment to repent and pray     chapter ix  henry i beauclerc  ad 11001135   henry the brother of william rufus was one of the hunting party and as soon as the cry spread through the forest that the king was dead he rode off at full speed to winchester and took possession of all his brothers treasure  william rufus had never been married and left no children and henry was much the least violent and most sensible of the brothers and as he promised to govern according to the old laws of england he did not find it difficult to persuade the people to let him be crowned king  he was not really a good man and he could be very cruel sometimes as well as false and cunning but he kept good order and would not allow such horrible things to be done as in his brothers time  so the english were better off than they had been and used to say the king would let no one break the laws but himself  they were pleased too that henry married a lady who was half englishmaude the daughter of malcolm greathead king of scotland and of a lady of the old english royal line  they loved her greatly and called her good queen maude  robert came back to normandy and tried to make himself king of england but henry soon drove him back  the brothers went on quarreling for some years and robert managed normandy miserably and wasted his money so that he sometimes had no clothes to wear and lay in bed for want of them  some of the normans could not bear this any longer and invited henry to come and take the dukedom  he came with an army many of whom were english and fought a battle with robert and his faithful normans at trenchebray in normandy  they gained a great victory and the english thought it made up for hastings  poor robert was made prisoner by his brother who sent him off to cardiff castle in wales where he lived for twentyeight years and then died and was buried in gloucester cathedral with his figure made in bog oak over his monument  henry had two childrenwilliam and maude  the girl was married to the emperor of germany and the boy was to be the husband of alice daughter to the count of anjou a great french prince whose lands were near normandy  it was the custom to marry children very young then before they were old enough to leave their parents and make a home for themselves  so william was taken by his father to anjou and there married to the little girl and then she was left behind while he was to return to england with his father  just as he was going to embark a man came to the king and begged to have the honor of taking him across in his new vessel called the white ship  henry could not change his own plans but as the man begged so hard he said his son the young bridegroom and his friends might go in the white ship they sailed in the evening and there was a great merrymaking on board till the sailors grew so drunk that they did not know how to guide the ship and ran her against a rock  she filled with water and began to sink  a boat was lowered and william safely placed in it but just as he was rowed off he heard the cries of the ladies who were left behind and caused the oarsmen to turn back for them so many drowning wretches crowded into it as soon as it came near that it sank with their weight and all were lost  only the topmast of the ship remained above water and to it clung a butcher and the owner of the ship all night long  when daylight came and the owner knew that the kings son was really dead and by his fault he lost heart let go the mast and was drowned  only the butcher was taken off alive and for a long time no one durst tell the king what had happened  at last a boy was sent to fall at his feet and tell him his son was dead  he was a brokenhearted man and never knew gladness again all the rest of his life  his daughter maude had lost her german husband and came home  he made her marry geoffrey of anjou the brother of his sons wife and called upon all his chief noblemen to swear that they would take her for their queen in england and their duchess in normandy after his own death  he did not live much longer  his death was caused in the year 1135 by eating too much of the fish called lamprey and he was buried in reading abbey     chapter x  stephen  ad 11351154   neither english nor normans had ever been ruled by a woman and the empress maude as she still called herself was a proud disagreeable illtempered woman whom nobody liked  so her cousin stephen de bloiswhose mother adela had been daughter of william the conqueror thought to obtain the crown of england by promising to give everyone what they wished  it was very wrong of him for he like all the other barons had sworn that maude should reign  but the people knew he was a kindly gracious sort of person and greatly preferred him to her  so he was crowned and at once all the norman barons whom king henry had kept down began to think they could have their own way  they built strong castles and hired men with whom they made war upon each other robbed one anothers tenants and when they saw a peaceable traveler on his way they would dash down upon him drag him into the castle take away all the jewels or money he had about him or if he had none they would shut him up and torment him till he could get his friends to pay them a sum to let him loose  stephen who was a kindhearted man himself tried to stop these cruelties but then the barons turned round on him told him he was not their proper king and invited maude to come and be crowned in his stead  she came very willingly and her uncle king david of scotland set out with an army to fight for her but all the english in the north came out to drive him back and they beat him and his scots at what they call the battle of the standard because the english had a holy standard which was kept in durham cathedral soon after stephen was taken prisoner at a battle at lincoln and there was nothing to prevent maude from being queen but her own bad temper  she went to winchester and was there proclaimed but she would not speak kindly or gently to the people and when her friends entreated her to reply more kindly she flew into a passion and it is even said that she gave a box on the ear to her unclethe good king of scotland who had come to help herfor reproving her for her harsh answers  when stephens wife came to beg her to set him free promising that he should go away beyond the seas and never interfere with her again she would not listen and drove her away  but she soon found how foolish she had been  stephens friends would have been willing that he should give up trying to be king but they could not leave him in prison for life and so they went on fighting for him while more and more of the english joined them as they felt how bad and unkind a queen they had in the empress  indeed she was so proud and violent that her husband would not come over to england to help her but staid to govern normandy  she was soon in great distress and had to flee from winchester riding through the midst of the enemy and losing almost all her friends by the way as they were slain or made prisoners  her best helper of allearl robert of gloucesterwas taken while guarding her and she could only get to his town of gloucester by lying down in a coffin with holes for air and being thus carried through all the country where she had made everyone hate her  stephens wife offered to set the earl free if the other side would release her husband and this exchange was brought about  robert then went to normandy to fetch maudes little son henry who was ten years old leaving her as he thought safe in oxford castle but no sooner was he gone than stephen brought his army and besieged the castle that is he brought his men round it tried to climb up the walls or beat them down with heavy beams and hindered any food from being brought in  everything in the castle that could be eaten was gone but maude was determined not to fall into her enemys hands  it was the depth of winter the river below the walls was frozen over and snow was on the ground  one night maude dressed herself and three of her knights all in white and they were one by one let down by ropes from the walls  no one saw them in the snow  they crossed the river on the ice walked a great part of the night and at last came to abingdon where horses were waiting for them and thence they rode to wallingford where maude met her little son  there was not much more fighting after this  stephen kept all the eastern part of the kingdom and henry was brought up at gloucester till his father sent for him to take leave of him before going on a crusade  geoffrey died during this crusade  he was fond of hunting and was generally seen with a spray of broom blossom in his cap  the french name for this plant is genet and thus his nickname was plantagenet and this became a kind of surname to the kings of england  henry called fitzempressor the empresss soncame to england again as soon as he was grown up but instead of going to war he made an agreement with stephen  henry would not attack stephen any more but leave him to reign all the days of his life provided stephen engaged that henry should reign instead of his own son after his death this made stephens son eustace very angry and he went away in a rage to raise troops to maintain his cause but he died suddenly in the midst of his wild doings and the king his father did not live long after him but died in 1154  maude had learnt wisdom by her misfortunes  she had no further desire to be queen but lived a retired life in a convent and was much more respected there than as queen     chapter xi  henry ii fitzempress  ad 11541189   henry fitzempress is counted as the first king of the plantagenet family also called the house of anjou  he was a very clever brisk spirited man who hardly ever sat down but was always going from place to place and who would let no one disobey him  he kept everybody in order pulled down almost all the castles that had been built in stephens time and would not let the barons illtreat the people  indeed everyone had been so mixed up together during the wars in stephens reign that the grandchildren of the normans who had come over with william the conqueror were now quite english in their feelings  french was however chiefly spoken at court  the king was really a frenchman and he married a french wife eleanor the lady of aquitaine a great dukedom in the south of france and as henry had already normandy and anjou he really was lord of nearly half france  he ruled england well but he was not a good man for he cared for power and pleasure more than for what was right and sometimes he fell into such rages that he would roll on the floor and bite the rushes and sticks it was strewn with  he made many laws one was that if a priest or monk was thought to have committed any crime he should be tried by the kings judge instead of the bishop the archbishop of canterbury thomas a becket did not think it right to consent to this law and though he and the king had once been great friends henry was so angry with him that he was forced to leave england and take shelter with the king of france  six years passed by and the king pretended to be reconciled to him but still when they met would not give him the kiss of peace  the archbishop knew that this showed that the king still hated him but his flock had been so long without a shepherd that he thought it his duty to go back to them  just after his return he laid under censure some persons who had given offence  they went and complained to the king and henry exclaimed in passion will no one rid me of this turbulent priest  four of his knights who heard these words set forth to canterbury  the archbishop guessed why they were come but he would not flee again and waited for them by the altar in the cathedral not even letting the doors be shut  there they slew him and thither in great grief at the effect of his own words the king camethree years laterto show his penitence by entering barefoot kneeling before thomass tomb and causing every priest or monk in turn to strike him with a rod  we should not exactly call thomas a martyr now but he was thought so then because he died for upholding the privileges of the church and he was held to be a very great saint  while this dispute was going on the earl of pembroke called strongbow one of henrys nobles had gone over to ireland and obtained a little kingdom there which he professed to hold of henry and thus the kings of england became lords of ireland though for a long time they only had the province of leinster and were always at war with the irish around  henry was a most powerful king but his latter years were very unhappy his wife was not a good woman and her sons were all disobedient and rebellious  once all the three eldest henry richard and geoffrey and their mother ran away together from his court and began to make war upon him  he was much stronger and wiser than they so he soon forced them to submit and he sent queen eleanor away and shut her up in a strong castle in england as long as he lived  here sons were much more fond of her than of their father and they thought this usage so hard that they were all the more ready to break out against him  the eldest son henry was leading an army against his father when he was taken ill and felt himself dying  he sent an entreaty that his father would forgive him and come to see him but the young man had so often been false and treacherous that henry feared it was only a trick to get him as a prisoner and only sent his ring and a message of pardon and young henry died pressing the ring to his lips and longing to hear his fathers voice  geoffrey the third son was killed by a fall from his horse and there were only two left alive richard and john  just at this time news came that the mahommedans in the holy land had won jerusalem back again and the pope called on all christian princes to leave off quarreling and go on a crusade to recover the holy sepulchre  the kings of england and france young richard and many more were roused to take the cross but while arrangements for going were being made a fresh dispute about them arose and richard went away in a rage got his friends together and with king philip of france to help him began to make war  his father was feeble and worn out and could not resist as in former times  he fell ill and gave up the struggle saying he would grant all they asked  the list of richards friends whom he was to pardon was brought to him and the first name he saw in it was that of john his youngest son and his darling the one who had never before rebelled  that quite broke his heart his illness grew worse and he talked about an old eagle being torn to pieces by his eaglets  and so in the year 1189 henry ii died the saddest death perhaps that an old man can die for his sons had brought down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave     chapter xii  richard i lionheart  ad 11891199   richard was greatly grieved at his fathers death and when he came and looked at the dead body in fontevraud abbey church he cried out alas it was i who killed him  but it was too late now he could not make up for what he had done and he had to think about the crusade he had promised to make  richard was so brave and strong that he was called lionheart he was very noble and good in some ways but his fierce passionate temper did him a great deal of harm  he and king philip of france and several other great princes all met in the island of sicily in the mediterranean sea and thence sailed for the holy land  the lady whom richard was to marry came to meet him in sicily  her name was berengaria but as it was lent he did not marry her then  she went on to the holy land in a ship with his sister joan and tried to land in the island of cypress but the people were inhospitable and would not let them come  so richard in his great anger conquered the isle and was married to berengaria there  the mahommedans who held palestine at that time were called saracens and had a very brave prince at their head named saladin which means splendor of religion  he was very good just upright and truth telling and his saracens fought so well that the crusaders would hardly have won a bit of ground if the lionheart had not been so brave  at last they did take one city on the coast named acre and one of the princes leopold duke of austria set up his banner on the walls  richard did not think it ought to be there he pulled it up and threw it down into the ditch asking the duke how he durst take the honors of a king  leopold was sullen and brooded over the insult and king philip thought richard so overbearing that he could not bear to be in the army with him any longer  in truth though philip had pretended to be his friend and had taken his part against his father that was really only to hurt king henry  he hated richard quite as much or more and only wanted to get home first in order to do him as much harm as he could while he was away  so philip said it was too hot for him in the holy land and made him ill  he sailed back to france while richard remained though the climate really did hurt his health and he often had fevers there  when he was ill saladin used to send him grapes and do all he could to show how highly he thought of so brave a man  once saladin sent him a beautiful horse richard told the earl of salisbury to try it and no sooner was the earl mounted than the horse ran away with him to the saracen army saladin was very much vexed and was afraid it would be taken for a trick to take the english king prisoner and he gave the earl a quieter horse to ride back with  richard fought one terrible battle at joppa with the saracens and then he tried to go on to take jerusalem but he wanted to leave a good strong castle behind him at ascalon and set all his men to work to build it up  when they grumbled he worked with them and asked the duke to do the same but leopold said gruffly that he was not a carpenter or a mason  richard was so provoked that he struck him a blow and the duke went home in a rage  so many men had gone home that richard found his army was not strong enough to try to take jerusalem  he was greatly grieved for he knew it was his own fault for not having shown the temper of a crusader and when he came to the top of a hill whence the holy city could be seen he would not look at it but turned away saying they who are not worthy to win it are not worthy to behold it  it was of no use for him to stay with so few men besides tidings came from home that king philip and his own brother john were doing all the mischief they could  so he made a peace for three years between the saracens and christians hoping to come back again after that to rescue jerusalem  but on his way home there were terrible storms his ships were scattered and his own ship was driven up into the adriatic sea where he was robbed by pirates or sea robbers and then was shipwrecked  there was no way for him to get home but through the lands of leopold of austria so he pretended to be a merchant and set out attended only by a boy  he fell ill at a little inn and while he was in bed the boy went into the kitchen with the kings glove in his belt  it was an embroidered glove such as merchants never used and people asked questions and guessed that the boys master must be some great man  the duke of austria heard of it sent soldiers to take him and shut him up as a prisoner in one of his castles  afterwards the duke gave him up for a large sum of money to the emperor of germany  all this time richards wife and mother had been in great sorrow and fear trying to find out what had become of him  it is said that he was found at last by his friend the minstrel blondel  a minstrel was a person who made verses and sang them  many of the nobles and knights in queen eleanors duchy of aquitaine were minstrelsand richard was a very good one himself and amused himself in his captivity by making verses  this is certainly truethough i cannot answer for it that the pretty story is true which says that blondel sung at all the castle courts in germany till he heard his masters voice take up and reply to his song  the queens eleanor and berengaria raised a ransomthat is a sum of money to buy his freedomthough his brother john tried to prevent them and the king of france did his best to hinder the emperor from releasing him but the pope insisted that the brave crusader should be set at liberty and richard came home after a year and a half of captivity  he freely forgave john for all the mischief he had done or tried to do though he thought so ill of him as to say i wish i may forget johns injuries to me as soon as he will forget my pardon of him  richard only lived two years after he came back  he was besieging a castle in aquitaine where there was some treasure that he thought was unlawfully kept from him when he was struck in the shoulder by a bolt from a crossbow and the surgeons treated it so unskilfully that in a few days he died  the man who had shot the bolt was made prisoner but the lionhearts last act was to command that no harm should be done to him  the soldiers however in their grief and rage for the king did put him to death in a cruel manner  richard desired to be burned at the feet of his father in fontevraud abbey where he once bewailed his undutiful conduct and now wished his body forever to lie in penitence  the figures in stone of the father mother and son who quarreled so much in life all lie on one monument now and with them richards youngest sister joan who died nearly at the same time as he died party of grief for him     chapter xiii  john lackland  ad 11991216   as a kind of joke john king henrys youngest son had been called lackland because he had nothing when his brothers each had some great dukedom  the name suited him only too well before the end of his life the english made him king at once  they always did take a grownup man for their king if the last kings son was but a child  richard had never had any children but his brother geoffrey who was older than john had left a son named arthur who was about twelve years old and who was rightly the duke of normandy and count of anjou king philip who was always glad to vex whoever was king of england took arthur under his protection and promised to get normandy out of johns hands  however john had a meeting with him and persuaded him to desert arthur and marry his son louis to johns own niece blanche who had a chance of being queen of part of spain  still arthur lived at the french kings court and when he was sixteen years old philip helped him to raise an army and go to try his fortune against his uncle  he laid siege to mirabeau a town where his grandmother queen eleanor was living  john who was then in normandy hurried to her rescue beat arthurs army made him prisoner and carried him off first to rouen and then to the strong castle of falaise  nobody quite knows what was done to him there  the governor hubert de burgh once found him fighting hard though with no weapon but a stool to defend himself from some ruffians who had been sent to put out his eyes  hubert saved him from these men but shortly after this good man was sent elsewhere by the king and john came himself to falaise  arthur was never seen alive again and it is believed that john took him out in a boat in the river at night stabbed him with his own hand and threw his body into the river  there was any way no doubt that john was guilty of his nephews death and he was fully known to be one of the most selfish and cruel men who ever lived and so lazy that he let philip take normandy from him without stirring a finger to save the grand old dukedom of his forefathers so that nothing is left of it to us now but the four little islands guernsey jersey alderney and sark  matters became much worse in england when he quarreled with the pope whose name was innocent about who should be archbishop of canterbury the pope wanted a man named stephen langton to be archbishop but the king swore he should never come into the kingdom  then the pope punished the kingdom by forbidding all church services in all parish churches  the was termed putting the kingdom under an interdict john was not much distressed by this though his people were but when he found that innocent was stirring up the king of france to come to attack him he thought it time to make his peace with the pope  so he not only consented to receive stephen langton but he even knelt down before the popes legate or messenger and took off his crown giving it up to the legate in token that he only held the kingdom from the pope  it was two or three days before it was given back to him and the pope held himself to be lord of england and made the king and people pay him money whenever he demanded it  all this time johns cruelty and savageness were making the whole kingdom miserable and at last the great barons could bear it no longer  they met together and agreed that they would make john swear to govern by the good old english laws that had prevailed before the normans came  the difficulty was to be sure of what these laws were for most of the copies of them had been lost  however archbishop langton and some of the wisest of the barons put together a set of lawssome copied some recollected some old some newbut all such as to give the barons some control of the king and hinder him from getting savage soldiers together to frighten people into doing whatever he chose to make them  these laws they called magna carta or the great charter and they all came in armor and took john by surprise at windsor  he came to meet them in a meadow named runnymede on the bank of the thames and there they forced him to sign the charter for which all englishmen are grateful to them  but he did not mean to keep it  no not he  he had one of his fathers fits of rage when he got back to windsor castlehe gnawed the sticks for rage and swore he was no king  then he sent for more of the fierce soldiers who went about in bands ready to be hired and prepared to take vengeance on the barons  they found themselves not strong enough to make head against him so they invited louis the son of philip of france and husband of johns niece to come and be their king  he came and was received in london while john and his bands of soldiers were roaming about the eastern counties wasting and burning everywhere till they came to the washthat curious bay between lincolnshire and norfolk where so many rivers run into the sea  there is a safe way across the sands in this bay when the tide is low but when it is coming in and meets the rivers the waters rise suddenly into a flood  so it happened to king john he did get out himself but all carts with his goods and treasures were lost and many of his men  he was full of rage and grief but he went on to the abbey where he meant to sleep  he supped on peaches and new ale and soon after became very ill  he died in a few days a miserable disgraced man with half his people fighting against him and london in the hands of his worst enemy     chapter xiv  henry iii of winchester  ad 12161272   king john left two little sons henry and richard nine and seven years old and all the english barons felt that they would rather have henry as their king than the french louis whom they had only called in because john was such a wretch  so when little henry had been crowned at gloucester with his mothers bracelet swearing to rule according to magna carta and good hubert de burgh undertook to govern for him one baron after another came back to him  louis was beaten in a battle at lincoln and when his wife sent him more troops hubert de burgh got ships together and sunk many vessels and drove the others back in the straits of dover so that louis was forced to go home and leave england in peace  henry must have been too young to understand about magna carta when he swore to it but it was the trouble of all his long reign to get him to observe it  it was not that he was wicked like his father for he was very religious and kindheartedbut he was too good natured and never could say no to anybody  bad advisers got about him when he grew up and persuaded him to let them take good hubert de burgh and imprison him  he had taken refuge in a church but they dragged him out and took him to a blacksmith to have chains put on his feet the smith however said he would never forge chains for the man who had saved his country from the french  de burgh was afterwards set free and died in peace and honor  henry was a builder of beautiful churches  westminster abbey as it is now was one  and he was so charitable to the poor that when he had his children weighed he gave their weight in gold and silver in alms  but he gave to everyone who asked and so always wanted money and sometimes his men could get nothing for the king and queen to eat but by going and taking sheep and poultry from the poor farmers around so that things were nearly as bad as under william rufusbecause the king was foolishly goodnatured  the pope was always sending for money too and the king tried to raise it in ways that according to magna carta he had sworn not to do  his foreign friends told him that if he minded magna carta he would be a poor creaturenot like a king who might do all he pleased and whenever he listened to them he broke the laws of magna carta  then when his barons complained and frightened him he swore again to keep them so that nobody could trust him and his weakness was almost as bad for the kingdom as johns wickedness  when they could bear it no longer the barons all met him at the council which was called the parliament from a french word meaning talk  this time they came in armor bringing all their fighting men and declared that he had broken his word so often that they should appoint some of their own number to watch him and hinder his doing anything against the laws he had sworn to observe or from getting money from the people without their consent  he was very angry but he was in their power and had to submit to swear that so it should be and simon de montfort earl of leicester who had married his sister was appointed among the lords who were to keep watch over him  henry could not bear this he felt himself to be less than ever a king and tried to break loose  he had never cared for his promises but his brave son edward who was now grown up cared a great deal and they put the question to louis king of france whether the king was bound by the oath he had made to be under montfort and his council  this louis was son to the one who had been driven back by hubert de burgh  he was one of the best men and kings that ever lived and he tried to judge rightly but he scarcely thought how much provocation henry had given when he said that subjects had no right to frighten their king and so that henry and edward were not obliged to keep the oath  thereupon they got an army together and so did simon de montfort and the barons and they met at a place called lewes in sussex  edward got the advantage at first and galloped away driving his enemies before him but when he turned round and came back he found that simon de montfort had beaten the rest of the army and made his father and uncle richard prisoners  indeed the barons threatened to cut off richards head if edward went on fighting with them and to save his uncles life he too gave himself up to them  simon de montfort now governed all the kingdom  he still called henry king but did not let him do anything and watched him closely that he might not get away and edward was kept a prisonerfirst in one castle then in another  simon was a good and highminded man himself who only wanted to do what was best for everyone but he had a family of proud and overbearing sons who treated all who came in their way so ill that most of the barons quarreled with them  one of these barons sent edward a beautiful horse and one day when he was riding out from hereford castle with his keepers he proposed to them to ride races while he was to look on and decide which was the swiftest  thus they all tired out their horses and as soon as he saw that they could hardly get them along edward spurred his own fresh horse and galloped off to meet the friends who were waiting for him  all who were discontented with the montforts joined him and he soon had a large army  he marched against montfort and met him at evesham  the poor old king was in montforts army and in the battle was thrown down and would have been killed if he had not called outsave me save me i am henry of winchester  his son heard the call and rushing to his side carried him to a place of safety  his army was much the strongest and montfort had known from the first that there was no hope for him  god have mercy on our souls for our bodies are sir edwards he had said and he died bravely on the field of battle  edward brought his father back to reign in all honor but he took the whole management of the kingdom and soon set things in order again taking care that magna carta should be properly observed  when everything was peaceful at home he set out upon a crusade with the good king of france and while he was gone his father died after a reign of fiftysix years  there only three english kings who reigned more than fifty years and these are easy to remember as each was the third of his namehenry iii edward iii and george iii  in the reign of henry iii the custom of having parliaments was established and the king was prevented from getting money from the people unless the parliament granted it  the parliament has ever since been made up of great lords who are born to it and besides them of men chosen by the people in the counties and towns to speak and decide for them  the clergy have a meeting of their own called convocation and these threeclergy lords and commonsare called the three estates of the realm     chapter xv  edward i longshanks  ad 12721307   the son of henry iii returned from the holy land to be one of our noblest best and wisest kings  edward icalled longshanks in a kind of joke because he was the tallest man in the courtwas very grandlooking and handsome and could leap run ride and fight in his heavy armor better than anyone else  he was brave just and affectionate and his sweet wife eleanor of castille was warmly loved by him and all the nation  he built as many churches and was as charitable as his father but he was much more careful to make only good men bishops and he allowed no wasting or idling  he faithfully obeyed magna carta and made everyone else obey the lawindeed many good laws and customs have begun from this time  order was the great thing he cared for and under him the english grew prosperous and happy when nobody was allowed to rob them  the welsh were however terrible robbers  you remember that they are the remains of the old britons who used to have all britain  they had never left off thinking that they had a right to it and coming down out of their mountains to burn the houses and steal the cattle of the saxons as they still called the english  edward tried to make friends with their princesllewellyn and davidand to make them keep their people in order  he gave david lands in england and let llewellyn marry his cousin eleanor de montfort  but they broke their promises shamefully and did such savage things to the english on their borders that he was forced to put a stop to it and went to war  david was made prisoner and put to death as a traitor and llewellyn was met by some soldiers near the bridge of builth and killed without their knowing who he was  edward had in the meantime conquered most of the country and he told the welsh chiefs that if they would come and meet him at caernarvon castle he would give them a prince who had been born in their countryhad never spoken a word of any language but theirs  they all came and the king came down to them with his own little baby son in his arms who had lately been born in caernarvon castle and of course had never spoken any language at all  the welsh were obliged to accept him and he had a welsh nurse that the first words he spoke might be welsh  they thought he would have been altogether theirs as he then had an elder brother but in a year or two the oldest boy died and ever since that time the eldest son of the king of england has always been prince of wales  there was a plan for the little prince edward of caernarvon being married to a little girl who was granddaughter to the king of scotland and would be queen of scotland herselfand this would have led to the whole island being under one kingbut unfortunately the little maiden died  it was so hard to decide who ought to reign out of all her cousins that they asked king edward to choose among them since everyone knew that a great piece of scotland belonged to him as overlord just as his own dukedom of aquitaine belonged to the king of france over him and the kings of scotland always used to pay homage to those of england for it  edward chose john balliol the one who had the best right but he made him understand that as overlord he meant to see that as good order was kept in scotland as in england  now the english kings had never meddled with scottish affairs before and the scots were furious at finding that he did so  they said it was insulting them and their king and poor balliol did not know what to do among them but let them defy edward in his name  this brought edward and his army to scotland  the strong places were taken and filled with english soldiers and balliol was made prisoner adjudged to have rebelled against his lord and forfeited his kingdom and was sent away to france  edward thought it would be much better for the whole country to join scotland to england and rule it himself  and so no doubt it would have been but many scots were not willingand in spite of all the care he could take the soldiers who guarded his castles often behaved shamefully to the people round them  one gentleman named william wallace whose home had been broken up by some soldiers fled to the woods and hills and drew so many scots round him that he had quite an army  there was a great fight at the bridge of stirling the english governors were beaten and wallace led his men over the border into northumberland where they plundered and burnt wherever they went in revenge for what had been done in scotland  edward gathered his forces and came to scotland  the army that wallace had drawn together could not stand before him but was defeated at falkirk and wallace had to take to the woods  edward promised pardon to all who would submitand almost all did but wallace still lurked in the hills till one of his own countrymen betrayed him to the english when he was sent to london and put to death  all seemed quieted and english garrisonsthat is guarding soldiers were in all the scottish towns and castles when suddenly robert bruce one of the half english half scottish nobles between whom edward had judged ran away from the english court with his horses shoes put on backwards  the next thing that was heard of him was that he had quarreled with one of his cousins in the church at dumfries and stabbed him to the heart and then had gone to scone and had been crowned king of scotland  edward was bitterly angry now  he sent on an army to deal unsparingly with the rising and set out to follow with his son now grown to mans estate  crueller things than he had ever allowed before were done to the places where robert bruce had been acknowledged as king and his friends were hung as traitors wherever they were found but bruce himself could not be caught  he was living a wild life among the lakes and hills and edward who was an old man now had been taken so ill at carlisle that he could not come on to keep his own strict rule among his men  all the winter he lay sick there and in the spring he heard that bruce whom he thought quite crushed had suddenly burst upon the english defeated them and was gathering strength every day  edward put on his armor and set out for scotland but at burghon thesands his illness came on again and he died there at seventy years old  he was buried in westminster abbey under a great block of stone and the inscription on it only says edward i 1308the hammer of the scotskeep treaties  his good wife queen eleanor had died many years before him and was also buried at westminster  all the way from grantham in lincolnshirewhere she diedto london edward set up a beautiful stone cross wherever her body rested for the night fifteen of thembut only three are left now     chapter xvi  edward ii of caernarvon  ad 13071327   unlike his father in everything was the young edward who had just come to manhood in mind for he was silly and easily led as his grandfather henry iii had been  he had a frienda gay handsome thoughtless careless young mannamed piers gaveston who had often led him into mischief  his father had banished this dangerous companion and forbidden under pain of his heaviest displeasure the two young men from ever meeting again but the moment the old king was dead edward turned back from scotland where he was so much wanted and sent for piers gaveston again  at the same time his bride arrived isabel daughter to the king of france a beautiful girland there was a splendid wedding feast but the king and gaveston were both so vain and conceited that they cared more about their own beauty and fine dress than the young queens and she found herself quite neglected  the nobles too were angered at the airs that gaveston gave himself he not only dressed splendidly had a huge train of servants and managed the king as he pleased but he was very insolent to them and gave them nicknames  he called the kings cousin the earl of lancaster the old hog the earl of pembroke joseph the jew and the earl of warwick the black dog  meantime the king and he were wasting the treasury and doing harm of all kinds till the barons gathered together and forced the king to send his favorite into banishment  gaveston went but he soon came back again and joined the king who was at last setting out for scotland  the nobles however would not endure his return  they seized him brought him to warwick castle and there held a kind of court which could hardly be called of justice for they had no right at all to sentence him  he spoke them fair now and begged hard for his life but they could not forget the names he had called them and he was beheaded on blacklow hill  edward was full of grief and anger for the cruel death of his friend but he was forced to keep it out of sight for all the barons were coming round him for the scottish war  while he had been wasting his time robert bruce had obtained every strong place in scotland except stirling castle and there the english governor had promised to yield if succor did not come from england within a year and a day  the year was almost over when edward came into scotland with a fine army of english welsh and gascons from aquitaine but robert bruce was a great and able general and he was no general at all so when the armies met at bannockburn under the walls of stirling the english were worse beaten than ever they had been anywhere else except at hastings  edward was obliged to flee away to england and though bruce was never owned by the english to be king of scotland there he really reigned having driven every englishman away and taken all the towns and castles  indeed the english had grown so much afraid of the scots that a hundred would flee at the sight of two  the king comforted himself with a new friendhugh le despencerwho with his old father had his own way just like gaveston  again the barons rose and required that they should be banished  they went but the earl of lancaster carried his turbulence too far and when he hear that the father had come back raised an army and was even found to have asked robert bruce to help him against his own king this made the other barons so angry that they joined the king against him and he was made prisoner and put to death for making war on the king and making friends with the enemies of the country  edward had his le despencers back again and very discontented the sight made the whole countryand especially the queen whom he had always neglected though she now had four children  he had never tried to gain her love and she hated him more and more  there was some danger of a quarrel with her brother the king of france and she offered to go with her son edward now about fourteen and settle it  but this was only an excuse  she went about to the princes abroad telling them how ill she was used by her husband and asking for help  a good many knights believed and pitied her and came with her to england to help  all the english who hated the le despencers joined her and she led the young prince against his father  edward and his friends were hunted across into wales but they were tracked out one by one and the despencers were put to a cruel death though edward gave himself up in hopes of saving them  the queen and her friends made him own that he did not deserve to reign and would give up the crown to his son  then they kept him in prison taking him from one castle to another in great misery the rude soldiers of his guard mocked him and crowned him with hay and gave him dirty ditch water to shave with and when they found he was too strong and healthy to die only of bad food and damp lodging they murdered him one night in berkeley castle  he lies buried in gloucester cathedral not far from that other foolish and unfortunate prince robert of normandy  he had reigned twenty years and was dethroned in 1327  the queen then wanted to get rid of edmund earl of kent the poor kings youngest brother  so a report was spread that edward was alive and edmund was allowed to peep into a dark prison room where he saw a man who he thought was his brother  he tried to stir up friends to set the king free but this was called rebelling and he was taken and beheaded at winchester by a criminal condemned to die for it was such a wicked sentence that nobody else could be found to carry it out     chapter xvii  edward iii  ad 13271377   for about three years the cruel queen isabel and her friends managed all the country but as soon as her sonedward iii who had been crowned instead of his fatherunderstood how wicked she had been and was strong enough to deal with her party he made them prisoners put the worst of them to death and kept the queen shut up in a castle as long as she lived  he had a very good queen of his own named phillipa who brought clothworkers over from he own country hainault now part of belgium to teach the english their trade and thus began to render england the chief country in the world for wool and cloth  queen isabel edwards mother had you remember been daughter of the king of france  all her three brothers died without leaving a son and their cousin whose name was philip began to reign in their stead  edward however fancied that the crown of france properly belonged to him in right of his mother but he did not stir about it at once and perhaps never would have done so at all but for two things  one was that the king of france philip vi had been so foolish as to fancy that one of his lords named robert of artois had been bewitching himby sticking pins into a wax figure and roasting it before the fire  so this robert was driven out of france and coming to england stirred edward up to go and overthrow philip the other was that the english barons had grown so restless and troublesome that they would not stay peacefully at home and mind their own estatebut if they had not wars abroad they always gave the king trouble at home and edward liked better that they should fight for him than against him  so he called himself king of france and england and began a war which lastedwith short space of quiet for full one hundred years and only ended in the time of the great grandchildren of the men who entered upon it  there was one great seafight off sluys when the king sat in his ship in a black velvet dress and gained a great victory but it was a good while before there was any great battle by landso long that the kings eldest son edward prince of wales was sixteen years old  he is generally called the black princeno one quite knows why for his hair like that of all these old english kings was quite light and his eyes were blue  he was such a spirited young soldier that when the french army under king philip came in sight of the english one near the village of crecy king edward said he should have the honor of the day and stood under a windmill on a his watching the fight while the prince led the english army  he gained a very great victory and in the evening came and knelt before his father saying the praise was not his own but the kings who had ordered all so wisely  afterwards while philip had fled away edward besieged calais the town just opposite to dover  the inhabitants were very brave and held out for a long time and while edward was absent the scots under david the son of robert bruce came over the border and began to burn and plunder in northumberland  however phillipa could be brave in time of need  she did not send for her husband but called an army together and the scots were so well beaten at nevilles cross that their king david himself was obliged to give himself up to an english squire  the man would not let the queen have his prisoner but rode day and night to dover and then crossed to calais to tell the king who bade him put king david into queen philippas keeping she came herself to the camp just as the brave men of calais had been starved out and edward had said he would only consent not to burn the town down if six of the chief townsmen would bring him the keys of the gates kneeling with sackcloth on and halters round their necks ready to be hung  queen philippa wept when she saw them and begged that they might be spared and when the king granted them to her she had them led away and gave each a good dinner and a fresh suit of clothes  the king however turned all the french people out of calais and filled it with english and it remained quite an english town for more than 200 years  king philip vi of france died and his son john became king while still the war went on  the black prince and john had a terrible battle at a place called poitiers and the english gained another victory  king john and one of his sons were made prisoners but when they were brought to the tent where the black prince was to sup he made them sit down at the table before him and waited on them as if they had been his guests instead of his prisoners  he did all he could to prevent captivity being a pain to them and when he brought them to london he gave john a tall white horse to ride and only rode a small pony himself by his side  there were two kings prisoners in the tower of london and they were treated as if they were visitors and friends  john was allowed to go home provided he would pay a ransom by degrees as he could get the money together and in the meantime his two elder sons were to be kept at calais in his stead but they would not stay at calais and king john could not obtain the sum for his ransom so rather than cheat king edward he went back to his prison in england again  he died soon after and his son charles was a cleverer and wiser man who knew it was better not to fight battles with the english but made a truce or short peace  prince edward governed that part of the south of france that belonged to his father but he went on a foolish expedition into spain to help a very bad king whom his subjects had driven out and there caught an illness from which he never quite recovered  while he was ill king charles began the war again and though there was no battle he tormented the english and took the castles and towns they held  the black prince tried to fight but he was too weak and ill to do much and was obliged to go home and leave the government to his brother john duke of lancaster  he lived about six years after he came home and then died to the great sorrow of everyone  his father king edward was now too old and feeble to attend to the affairs of the country  queen philippa was dead too and as no one took proper care of the poor old king he fell into the hands of bad servants who made themselves rich and neglected him  when at length he lay dying they stole the ring off his finger before he had breathed his last and left him all alone with the doors open till a priest came by and stayed and prayed by him till his last moment  he had reigned exactly fifty years  you had better learn and remember the names of his sons as you will hear more about some of them  they were edward lionel john edmund and thomas  edward was prince of wales lionel duke of clarence john duke of lancaster edmund duke of york and thomas duke of gloucester  edward and lionel both died before their father  edward had left a son named richard lionel had left a daughter named philippa     chapter xviii  richard ii  ad 13771399   these were not very good times in england  the new king richard was only eleven years old and his three uncles did not care much for his good or the good of the nation  there was not much fighting going on in france but for the little there was a great deal of money was wanting and the great lords were apt to be very hard upon the poor people on their estates  they would not let them be taught to read and if a poor man who belonged to an estate went away to a town his lord could have him brought back to his old home  any tax too fell more heavily on the poor than the rich  one tax especially called the poll tax which was made when richard was sixteen vexed them greatly  everyone above fifteen years old had to pay fourpence and the collectors were often very rude and insolent  a man named wat tyler in kent was so angry with a rude collector as to strike him dead  all the villagers came together with sticks scythes and flails and wat tyler told them they would go to london and tell the king how his poor commons were treated  more people and more joined them on the way and an immense multitude of wild looking men came pouring into london where the lord mayor and aldermen were taken by surprise and could do nothing to stop them  they did not do much harm then they lay on the grass all night round the tower and said they wanted to speak to the king  in the morning he came down to his barge and meant to have spoken to them but his people seeing such a host of wild men took fright and carried him back again  he went out again the next day on horseback but while he was speaking to some of them the worst of them broke into the tower where they seized archbishop simon of canterbury and fancying he was one of the kings bad advisers they cut off his head  richard had to sleep in the house called the royal wardrobe that night but he went out again on horseback among the mob and began trying to understand what they wanted  wat tyler while talking grew violent forgot to whom he was speaking and laid his hand on the kings bridle as if to threaten or take him prisoner  upon this the lord mayor with his macethe large crowned staff that is carried before himdealt the man such a blow that fell from his horse and an attendant thrust him through with a sword  the people wavered and seemed not to know what to do and the young king with great readiness rode forward and saidgood fellows have you lost your leader  this fellow was but a traitor i am your king and will be your captain and guide then he rode at their head out into the fields and the gentlemen who had mustered their men by this time were able to get between them and the city  the people of each county were desired to state their grievances the king engaged to do what he could for them and they went home  richard seems to have really wished to take away some of the laws that were so hard upon them but his lords would not let him and he had as yet very little powerbeing only a boyand by the time he grew up his head was full of vanity and folly  he was very handsome and he cared more for fine clothes and amusements than for business and his youngest uncle the duke of gloucester did all he could to keep him back and hinder him from taking his affairs into his own hands  not till he was twentyfour did richard begin to govern for himself and then the duke of gloucester was always grumbling and setting the people to grumble because the king chose to have peace with france duke thomas used to lament over the glories of the battles of edward iii and tell the people they had taxes to pay to keep the king in ermine robes and rings and jewels and to let him give feasts and tilting matcheswhen the knights in beautiful gorgeous armor rode against one another in sham fight and the king and ladies looked on and gave the prize  now richard knew very well that all this did not cost half so much as his grandfathers wars and he said it did not signify to the people what he wore or how he amused himself as long as he did not tax them and take their lambs and sheaves to pay for it  but the people would not believe him and gloucester was always stirring them up against him and interfering with him in council  at last richard went as if on a visit to his uncle at pleshy castle and there in his own presence caused him to be seized and sent off to calais  in a few days time thomas duke of gloucester was dead and to this day nobody knows whether his grief and rage brought on a fit or if he was put to death  it is certain at least that richards other two uncles do not seem to have treated the king as if he had been to blame  the elder of these uncles the duke of lancaster was called john of gauntbecause he had been born a ghent a town in flanders he was becoming an old man and only tried to help the king and keep things quiet but henry his eldest son was a fine highspirited young mana favorite with everybody and was always putting himself forwardand the king was very much afraid of him  one day when parliament met the king stood up and commanded henry of lancaster to tell all those present what the duke of norfolk had said when they were riding together  henry gave in a written paper saying that the duke had told him that they should all be ruined like the duke of gloucester and that the king would find some way to destroy them  norfolk angrily sprang up and declared he had said no such thing  in those days when no one could tell which spoke the truth the two parties often would offer to fight and it was believed that god would show the right by giving the victory to the sincere one  so henry and norfolk were to fight but just as they were mounted on their horses with their lances in their hands the king threw down his staff before them stopped the combat and sentenced norfolk to be banished from england for life and henry for ten years  not long after henry had gone his old fatherjohn of gauntdied and the king kept all his great dukedom of lancaster  henry would not bear this and knew that many people at home thought it very unfair so he came to england and as soon as he landed at ravenspur in yorkshire people flocked to him so eagerly that he began to think he could do more than make himself duke of lancaster  king richard was in ireland where his cousin the governorroger mortimerhad been killed by the wild irish  he came home in haste on hearing of henrys arrival but everybody turned against him and the earl of northumberland whom he had chiefly trusted made him prisoner and carried him to henry  he was taken to london and there set before parliament to confess that he had ruled so ill that he was unworthy to reign and gave up the crown to his dear cousin henry of lancaster in the year 1399  then he was sent away to pontefract castle and what happened to him there nobody knows but he never came out of it alive     chapter xix  henry iv  ad 13991413   the english people had often chosen their king out of the royal family in old times but from john to richard ii he had always been the son and heir of the last king  now though poor richard had no child henry of lancaster was not the next of kin to him for lionel duke of clarence had come between the black prince and john of gaunt and his great grandson edmund mortimer was thought by many to have a better right to be king than henry  besides people did not know whether richard was alive and they thought him hardly used and wanted to set him free  so henry had a very uneasy time  everyone had been fond of him when he was a bright friendly freespoken noble and he thought that he would be a good king and much loved but he had gained the crown in an evil way and it never gave him any peace or joy  the welsh who always had loved richard took up arms for him and the earl of northumberland who had betrayed richard expected a great deal too much from henry  the earl had a brave sonhenry percywho was so fiery and eager that he was commonly called hotspur he was sent to fight with the welsh and with the kings son henry prince of walesa brave boy of fifteen or sixteenunder his charge to teach him the art of war and they used to climb the mountains and sleep in tents together as good friends  but the scots made an attack on england  henry percy went north to fight with them and beat them in a great battle making many prisoners  the king sent to ask to have the prisoners sent to london and this made the proud percy so angry that he gave up the cause of king henry and went off to wales taking his prisoners with him and therebeing by this time nearly sure that poor richard must be dead he joined the welsh in choosing as the only right king of england young edmund mortimer  henry iv and his sons gathered an army easily for the welsh were so savage and cruel that the english were sure to fight against them if they broke into england  the battle was fought near shrewsbury  it was a very fierce one and in it hotspur was killed the welsh put to flight and the prince of wales fought so well that everyone saw he was likely to be a brave warlike king like edward i or edward iii  the troubles were not over however for the earl of northumberland himself and archbishop scrope of york took up arms against the king but they were put down without a battle  the earl fled and hid himself but the archbishop was taken and beheadedthe first bishop whom a king of england had ever put to death  the welsh went on plundering and doing harm and prince henry had to be constantly on the watch against them and in fact there never was a reign so full of plots and conspiracies  the king never knew whom to trust one friend after another turned against him and he became soured and wretched he was worn out with disappointment and guarding against everyone and at last he grew even suspicious of his brave son henry because he was so bright and bold and was so much loved  the prince was ordered home from wales and obliged to live at windsor with nothing to do while his youngest brothers were put before him and trusted by their fatherone of them even sent to command the army in france  but happily the four brothershenry thomas john and humfreyall loved each other so well that nothing could make them jealous or at enmity with one another  at windsor too the king kept young edmund mortimerwhom the welsh had tried to make king and also the young english princes and they all led a happy life together  there are stories told of henryprince hal as he was calledleading a wild merry life as a sort of madcap playing at being a robber and breaking into the wagons that were bringing treasure for his father and then giving the money back again  also there is a story that when one of his friends was taken before the lord chief justice he went and ordered him to be released and that when the justice refused he drew his sword upon which the justice sent him to prison and he went quietly knowing it was right  the king is said to have declared himself happy to have a judge who maintained the law so well and a son who would submit to it but there does not seem to be good reason for believing the story and it seems clear that young henry if he was full of fun and frolic took care never to do anything really wrong  the king was an old man before his time  he was always ill and often had fits and one of these came on when he was in westminster abbey he was taken to the room called the jerusalem chamber and henry watched him there  another of the stories is that the king lay as if he were dead and the prince took the crown that was by his side and carried it away  when the king revived henry brought it back with many excuses  ah fair son said the king what right have you to the crown you know your father had none  sir said henry with your sword you took it and with my sword i will keep it  may god have mercy on my soul said the king  another story tells show the prince feeling that his father doubted his loyalty presented himself one day in disordered attire before the king and kneeling offered him a dagger and begged his father to take his life if he could no longer trust and love him  we cannot be quite certain about the truth of these conversations for many people will write down stories they have heard without making sure of them  one thing we are certain of which henry told his son which seems less like repentance  it was that unless he made war in france his lords would never let him be quiet on his throne in england and this young henry was quite ready to believe there had never been a real peace between france and england since edward iii had begun the waronly truces which are short rests in the middle of a great warand the english were eager to begin again for people seldom thought then of the misery that comes of a great war but only of the honor and glory that were to be gained of making prisoners and getting ransoms from them  so henry iv died after having made his own life miserable by taking the crown unjustly and as you will see leaving a great deal or harm still to come to the whole country as well as to france  he died in the year 1399  his family is called the house of lancaster because his father had been duke of lancaster  you will be amused to hear that richard whittington really lived in his time  i cannot answer for his cat but he was really lord mayor of london and supplied the wardrobe of king henrys daughter when she married the king of denmark     chapter xx  henry v of monmouth  ad 14131423   the young king henry was full of high good thoughts  he was devout in going to church tried to make good bishops gave freely to the poor and was so kindly and hearty and merry in all his words and ways that everyone loved him  still he thought it was his duty to go and make war in france  he had been taught to believe the kingdom belonged to him and it was in so wretched a state that he thought he could do it good  the poor king charles vi was mad and had a wicked wife besides and his sons and uncles and cousins were always fighting till the streets of paris were often red with blood and the whole country was miserable  henry hoped to set all in order for them and gathering an army together crossed to normandy  he called on the people to own him as their true king and never let any harm be done to them for he hung any soldier who was caught stealing or misusing anyone  he took the town of harfleur on the coast of normandy but not till after a long siege when his camp was in so wet a place that there was much illness among his men  the store of food was nearly used up and he was obliged to march his troops across to calais which you know belonged to england to get some more  but on the way the french army came up to meet hima very grand splendidlooking army commanded by the kings eldest son the dauphin  just as the english kings eldest son was always prince of wales the french kings eldest son was always called dauphin of vienne because vienne the country that belonged to him had a dolphin on its shield  the french army was very largequite twice the number of the english but though henrys men were weary and halfstarved and many of them sick they were not afraid but believed their king when he told them that there were enough frenchmen to kill enough to run away enough to make prisoners  at night however the english had solemn prayers and made themselves ready and the king walked from tent to tent to see that each man was in his place while on the other hand the french were feasting and revelling and settling what they would do the english when they had made them prisoners they were close to a little village which the english called agincourt and though that is not quite its right name it is what we have called the battle ever since  the french owing to the quarrelsome state of the country had no order or obedience among them  nobody would obey any other and when their own archers were in the way the horsemen began cutting them down as if they were the enemy  some fought bravely but it was of little use and by night all the french were routed and king henrys banner waving in victory over the field he went back to england in great glory and all the aldermen of london came out to meet him in red gowns and gold chains and among them was sir richard whittington the great silk mercer  henry was so modest that he would not allow the helmet he had worn at agincourt all knocked about with terrible blows to be carried before him when he rode into london and he went straight to church to give thanks to god for his victory  he soon went back to france and went on conquering it till the queen came to an agreement with him that he should marry his daughter catherine and that though poor crazy charles vi should reign to the end of his life when he died henry and catherine should be king and queen of france  so henry and catherine were married and he took her home to england with great joy and pomp leaving his brother thomas duke of clarence to take care of his army in france  for of course though the queen had made this treaty for her mad husband most brave honest frenchmen could not but feel it a wicked and unfair thing to give the kingdom away from her son the dauphin charles  he was not a good man and had consented to the murder of his cousin the duke of burgundy and this had turned some against him but still he was badly treated and the bravest frenchmen could not bear to see their country given up to the english  so though he took no trouble to fight for himself they fought for him and got some scots to help them and by and by news came to henry that his army had been beaten and his brother killed  he came back again in haste to france and his presence made everything go well again but all the winter he was besieging the town of meaux where there was a very cruel robber who made all the roads to paris unsafe and by the time he had taken it his health was much injured his queen came to him and they kept a very grand court at paris at whitsuntide but soon after when henry set out to join his army he found himself so ill and weak that he was obliged to turn back to the castle of vincennes where he grew much worse  he called for all his friends and begged them to be faithful to his little baby son whom he had never even seen and he spoke especially to his brother john duke of bedford to whom he left the charge of all he had gained  he had tried to be a good man and though his attack on france was really wrong and caused great misery he had meant to do right  so he was not afraid to face death and he died when only thirtyfour years old while he was listening to the 51st psalm  everybody grieved for him even the frenchand nobody had ever been so good and dutiful to poor old king charles who sat in a corner lamenting for his good son henry and wasting away till he died only three weeks later so that he was buried the same day at st denys abbey near paris as henry was buried at westminster abbey near london     chapter xxi  henry vi of windsor  ad 14231461   the poor little baby henry vi was but nine months old whenover the grave of his father in england and his grandfather in francehe was proclaimed king of france and england  the crown of england was held over his head and his lords made their oaths to him and when he was nine years old he was sent to paris and there crowned king of france he was a very good little gentle boy as meek and obedient as possible but his friends who knew that a king must be brave strong and firm for his peoples sake began to be afraid that nothing would ever make him manly  the war in france went on all the time the duke of bedford keeping the north and the old lands in the southwest for little henry and the french doing their best for their rightful king though he was so lazy and fond of pleasure that he let them do it all alone  yet a wonderful thing happened in his favor  the english were besieging orleans when a young village girl named joan of arc came to king charles and told him that she had had a commission from heaven to save orleans and to lead him to rheims where french kings were always crowned  and she did  she always acted as one led by heaven many wonderful things are told of her and one circumstance that produced a great impression on the public mind was that when brought into the presence of charles whom she had never before seen she recognized him although he was dressed plainly and one of the courtiers had on the royal apparel  she never let anything wrong be done in her sightno bad words spoken no savage deeds done and she never fought herself only led the french soldiers  the english thought her a witch and fled like sheep whenever they saw her and the french common men were always brave with her to lead them  and so she really saved orleans and brought the king to be crowned at rheims  but neither charles nor his selfish bad nobles liked her she was too good for them so though they would not let her go home to her village as she wished they gave her no proper help and once when there was a fight going on outside the walls of a town the french all ran away and left her outside where she was taken by the english  and then i grieve to say the court that sat to judge her some english and some french of the english partysentenced her to be burnt to death in the market place at rouen as a witch and her own king never tried to save her  but the spirit she had stirred up never died away  the french went on winning back more and more and there were so many quarrels among the english that they had little chance of keeping anything  the kings youngest uncle humfrey duke of gloucester was always disputing with the beaufort family  john of gaunt duke of lancasterfather to henry ivhad late in life married a person of low birth and her children were called beaufort after the castle where they were bornnot plantagenetand were hardly reckoned as princes by other people but they were very proud and thought themselves equal to anybody  the good duke of bedford died quite worn out with trying to keep the peace among them and to get proper help from england to save the lands his brother had won in france  all this time the king liked the beauforts much better than duke humfrey and he followed their advice and that of their friend the earl of suffolk in marrying margaret of anjou the daughter of a french prince who had a right to a great part of the lands the english held  all these were given back to her father and this made the duke of gloucester and all the english more angry and they hated the young queen as the cause  she was as bold and highspirited as the king was gentle and meek  he loved nothing so well as praying praising god and reading and he did one great thing for the countrywhich did more for it than all the fighting kings had donehe founded eton college close to windsor castle and there many of our best clergymen and soldiers and statesmen have had their education  but while he was happy over rules for his scholars and in plans for the beautiful chapel the queen was eagerly taking part in the quarrels and the nation hated her the more for interfering and very strangely humfrey duke of gloucester was at the meeting of parliament accused of high treason and sent to prison where in a few days he was found dead in his bedjust like his greatuncle thomas duke of gloucester nor does anyone understand the mystery in one case better than in the other except that we are more sure that gentle henry vi had nothing to do with it than we can be of richard ii  these were very bad times  there was a rising like wat tylers under a man named jack cade who held london for two or three days before he was put down and almost at the same time the queens first english friend suffolk was exiled by her enemies and taken at sea and murdered by some sailors  moreover the last of the brave old friends of henry v was killed in france while trying to save the remains of the old duchy of aquitaine which had belonged to the english kings ever since henry ii married queen eleanor  that was the end of the hundred years war for peace was made at last and england kept nothing in france but the one city of calais  still things were growing worse  duke humfrey left no children and as time went on and the king had none the question was who should reign  if the beauforts were to be counted as princes they came next but everyone hated them so that people recollected that henry iv had thrust aside the young edmund mortimer grandson to lionel who had been next eldest to the black prince  edmund was dead but his sister anne had married a son of the duke of york youngest son of edward iii and her son richard duke of york could not help feeling that he had a much better right to be king than any beaufort there was a great english noble named richard nevil earl of warwick who liked to manage everythingjust the sort of baron that was always mischievous at home if not fighting in franceand he took up yorks cause hotly  yorks friends used to wear white roses beauforts friends red roses and the two parties kept on getting more bitter but as no one wished any ill to gentle king henrywho to make matters worse sometimes had fits of madness like his poor grandfather in francethey would hardly have fought it in his lifetime if he had not at last had a little son who was born while he was so mad that he did not know of it  then when york found it was of no use to wait he began to make war backed up by warwick and after much fighting they made the king prisoner and forced him to make an agreement that he should reign as long as he lived but that after that richard of york should be king and his son edward be only duke of lancaster  this made the queen furiously angry she would not give up her sons rights and she gathered a great army with which she came suddenly on the duke of york near wakefield and destroyed nearly his whole army  he was killed in the battle and his second son edmund was met on wakefield bridge and stabbed by lord clifford and margaret had their heads set up over the gates of york while she went on to london to free her husband  but edward yorks eldest son was a better captain than he and far fiercer and more cruel  he made the war much more savage than it had been before and after beating the queens friends at mortimers cross he hurried on to london where the peoplewho had always been very fond of his father and hated queen margaretgreeted him gladly  he was handsome and stately looking and though he was really cruel when offended had easy goodnatured manners and everyone in london was delighted to receive him and own him as king  but henry and margaret were in the north with many friends and he followed them thither to towton moor where in a snow storm began the most cruel and savage battle of all the war  edward gained the victory and nobody was spared or made prisonerall were killed who could not flee  poor henry was hidden among his friends and margaret went to seek help in scotland and abroad taking her son with her  once she brought another army and fought at hexham but she was beaten again and before long king henry was discovered by his enemies carried to london and shut up a prisoner in the tower  his reign is reckoned to have ended in 1461     chapter xxii  edward iv  ad 14611483   though edward iv was made king the wars of the red and white roses were not over yet  queen margaret and her friends were always trying to get help for poor king henry  edward had been so base and mean as to have him led into london with his feet tied together under his horse while men struck him on the face and cried out behold the traitor  but henry was meek patient and gentle throughout and when shut up in the tower spent his time in reading and praying or playing with his little dog  queen margaret and her son edward were living with her father in france and she was always trying to have her husband set free and brought back to his throne  in the meantime all england was exceeedingly surprised to find that edward iv had been secretly married to a beautiful lady named elizabeth woodvillelady grey her first husband had been killed fighting for henry and she had stood under an oak tree when king edward was passing to entreat that his lands might not be taken from her little boys  the king fell in love with her and married her but for a long time he was afraid to tell the earl of warwick and when he did warwick was greatly offendedand all the more because elizabeths relations were proud and gay in their dress and tried to set themselves above all the old nobles  warwick himself had no son but he had two daughters whom he meant to marry to the kings two brothersgeorge duke of clarence and richard duke of gloucester  edward thought this would make warwick too powerful and though he could not prevent george from marrying isabel nevil the eldest daughter the discontent grew so strong that warwick persuaded george to fly with him turn against his own brother and offer queen margaret their help  no wonder margaret did not trust them and was very hard to persuade that warwick could mean well by her but at last she consented and gave her son edwarda fine lad of sixteento marry his daughter anne nevil after which warwickwhom men began to call the kingmaker went back to england with clarence to raise their men while she was to follow with her son and his young wife  warwick came so suddenly that he took the yorkists at unawares  edward had to flee for his life to flanders leaving his wife and his babies to take shelter in westminster abbeysince no one durst take any one out of that holy placeand poor henry was taken out of prison and set on the throne again  however edward soon got help in flanders where his sister was married to the duke of burgundy  he came back again gathered his friends and sent messages to his brother clarence that he would forgive him if he would desert the earl  no one ever had less faith or honor than george of clarence  he did desert warwick just as the battle of barnet heath was beginning and warwicks kingmaking all ended for he was killed with his brother and many others in the battle  and this was the first news that met margaret when after being long hindered by foul weather she landed at plymouth  she would have done more wisely to have gone back but her son edward longed to strike a blow for his inheritance and they had friends in wales whom they hope to meet  so they made their way into gloucestershire but there king edward with both his brothers came down upon them at tewkesbury and there their army was routed and the young prince taken and killedsome say by the king himself and his brothers  poor broken hearted queen margaret was made prisoner too and carried to the tower where she arrived a day or two after the meek and crazed captive henry vi had been slain that there might be no more risings in his name  and so ended the long war of york and lancaster though not in peace or joy to the savage faithless family who had conquered  edward was merry and goodnatured when not angered and had quite sense and ability enough to have been a very good king if he had not been lazy selfish and full of vices  he actually set out to conquer france and then let himself be persuaded over and paid off by the cunning king of france and went home again a laughingstock to everybody  the two kings had an interview on a bridge over the river somme in france where they talked through a kind of fence each being too suspicious of the other to meet without such a barrier between them  as to george the king had never trusted him since his shameful behavior when warwick rebelled besides he was always abusing the queens relations and richard was always telling the king of all the bad and foolish things he did or said  at last there was a great outbreak of anger and the king ordered the duke of clarence to be imprisoned in the tower and there before long he too was killed the saying was that he was drowned in a butt of malmsey wine but this is not at all likely to be true  he left two little children a boy and a girl  so much cruel slaughter had taken place that most of the noble families in england had lost many sons and a great deal of their wealth and none of them ever became again so mighty as the king maker had been  his daughter anne the wife of poor edward of lancaster was found by richard duke of gloucester hidden as a cookmaid in london and she was persuaded to marry himas indeed she had always been intended for him  he was a little thin slight man with one shoulder higher than the other and keen cunning dark eyes and as the king was very tall with a handsome blueeyed face people laughed at the contrast called gloucester richard crookback and were very much afraid of him  it was in this reign that books began to be printed in england instead of written  printing had been found out in germany a little before and books had been shown to henry vi but the troubles of his time kept him from attending to them  now however edwards sister the duchess of burgundy much encouraged a printer named caxton whose books she sent her brother and other presses were set up in london another great change had come in  long ago in the time of henry iii a monk name roger bacon had made gunpowder but nobody used it much until in the reign of edward iii it was found out how cannon might be fired with it and some say it was first used in the battle of crecy but it was not till the reign of edward iv that smaller guns such as each soldier could carry one of for himself were invented harquebuses as they were calledand after this the whole way of fighting was gradually altered  printing and gunpowder both made great changes in everything though not all at once  king edward did not live to see the changes  he had hurt his health with his revellings and amusements and died quite in middle age in the year 1483 seeing perhaps at last how much better a king he might have been     chapter xxiii  edward v  ad 1483   edward iv left several daughters and two sonsedward prince of wales who was fourteen years old and richard duke of york who was eleven  edward was at ludlow castlewhere the princes of wales were always brought upwith his mothers brother lord rivers his half brother richard grey and other gentlemen  when the tidings came of his fathers death they set out to bring him to london to be crowned king  but in the meantime the duke of gloucester and several of the noblemen especially the duke of buckingham agreed that it was unbearable that the queen and her brothers should go on having all the power as they had done in edwards time  till the king was old enough to govern his fathers brother the duke of gloucester was the proper person to rule for him and they would soon put an end to the woodvilles  the long wars had made everybody cruel and regardless of the laws so that no one made much objection when gloucester and buckingham met the king and took him from his uncle and halfbrother who were sent off to pontefract castle and in a short time their heads were cut off there  another of the late kings friends was lord hastings and as he sat at the council table in the tower of london with the other lords richard came in and showing his own lean shrunken arm declared that lord hastings had bewitched him and made it so  the other lords began to say the if he done so it was horrible  but richard would listen to no ifs and said he would not dine till hastings head was off  and his cruel word was done  the queen saw that harm was intended and went with all her other children to her former refuge in the sanctuary at westminster nor would she leave it when her son edward rode in state into london and was taken to the tower which was then a palace as well as a prison  the duke of gloucester and the council said that this pretence at fear was very foolish and that the little duke of york ought to be with his brother and they sent the archbishop of canterbury to desire her to give the boy up  he found the queen sitting desolate with all her long light hair streaming about her and her children round her and he spoke kindly to her at first and tried to persuade her of what he really believed himselfthat it was all her foolish fears and fancies that the duke of gloucester could mean any ill to his little nephew and that the two brothers ought to be together in his keeping  elizabeth cried and said that the boys were better apart for they quarrelled when they were together and that she could not give up little richard  in truth she guessed that their uncle wanted to get rid of them and to reign himself and she knew that while she had richard edward would be safe since it would not make him king to destroy one without the other  archbishop morton who believed richards smooth words and was a very good kind man thought this all a womans nonsense and told her that if she would not give up the boy freely he would be taken from her by force  if she had been really a wise brave mother she would have gone to the tower with her boy as queen and mother and watched over her children herself but she had always been a silly selfish woman and she was afraid for herself  so she let the archbishop lead her child away and only sat crying in the sanctuary instead of keeping sight of him  the next thing that happened was that the duke of gloucester caused one dr shaw to preach a sermon to the people of london in the open air explaining that king edward iv had been a very bad man and had never been properly married to lady grey and so that she was no queen at all and her children had no right to reign  the londoners liked gloucester and hated the woodvilles and all belonging to them and after some sermons and speeches of this sort there were so many people inclined to take as their king the man rather than the boy that the duke of buckingham led a deputation to request richard to accept the crown in his nephews stead  he met it as if the whole notion was quite new to him but of course accepted the crown sent for his wife anne nevil and her son and was soon crowned as king richard iii of england  as for the two boys they were never seen out of the tower again they were sent into the prison part of it and nobody exactly knows what became of them there but there cannot be much doubt that they must have been murdered  some years later two men confessed that they had been employed to smother the two brothers with pillows as they slept and though they added some particulars to the story that can hardly be believed it is most likely that this was true  full two hundred years later a chest was found under a staircase in what is called the white tower containing bones that evidently had belonged to boys of about fourteen and eleven years old and these were placed in a marble urn among the tombs of the kings in westminster abbey  but even to this day there are some people who doubt whether edward v and richard of york were really murdered or if richard were not a person who came back to england and tried to make himself king     chapter xxiv  richard iii  ad 14831485   richard iii seems to have wished to be a good and great king but he had made his way to the throne in too evil a manner to be likely to prosper  how many people he had put to death we do not know for when the english began to suspect the he had murdered his two nephews they also accused him of the death of everyone who had been secretly slain ever since edward iv came to the throne when he had been a mere boy he found he must be always on the watch and his home was unhappy for his son for whose sake he had striven so hard to be king died while yet a boy and anne his wife not long after  then his former staunch friend the duke of buckingham began to feel that though he wanted the sons of elizabeth woodville to be set aside from reigning it was quite another thing to murder them  he was a vain proud man who had a little royal bloodbeing descended from thomas the first duke of gloucester son of edward iiiand he bethought himself that now all the house of lancaster was gone and so many of the house of york he might possibly become king  but he had hardly begun to make a plot before the keensighted watchful richard found it out and had him seized and beheaded  there was another plot though that richard did not find out in time the real house of lancaster had ended when poor young edward was killed at tewkesbury but the beaufortsthe children of that younger family of john of gaunt who had first begun the quarrel with the duke of yorkwere not all dead  lady margaret beaufort the daughter of the eldest son had married a welsh gentleman named edmund tudor and had a son called henry tudor earl of richmond  edward iv had always feared that this youth might rise against him and he had been obliged to wander about in france and brittany since the death of his father but nobody was afraid of lady margaret and she had married a yorkist nobleman lord stanley  now the eldest daughter of edward ivelizabeth or lady bessee as she was calledwas older than her poor young brothers and she heard to her great horror that her uncle wanted to commit the great wickedness of making her his wife after poor anne nevils death there is a curious old set of verses written by lord stanleys squire which says that lady bessee called lord stanley to a secret room and begged him to send to his stepson richmond to invite him to come to england and set them all free  stanley said he could not write well enough and that he could not trust a scribe but lady bessee said she could write as well as any scribe in england  so she told him to come to her chamber at nine that evening with his trusty squire and there she wrote letters kneeling by the table to all the noblemen likely to be discontented with richard and appointing a place of meeting with stanley and she promised herself that if henry tudor would come and overthrow the cruel tyrant richard she would marry him and she sent him a ring in pledge of her promise  henry was in brittany when he received the letter  he kissed the ring but waited long before he made up his mind to try his fortune at last he sailed in a french ship and landed at milford havenfor he knew the welsh would be delighted to see him and as he was really descended from the great british chiefs they seemed to think that to make him king of england would be almost like having king arthur back again  they gathered round him and so did a great many english nobles and gentlemen  but richard though very angry was not much alarmed for he knew henry tudor had never seen a battle  he marched out to meet him and a terrible fight took place at redmore heath near market bosworth where after long and desperate struggling richard was overwhelmed and slain his banner taken and his men either killed or driven from the field  his body was found gashed bleeding and stripped and thus was thrown across a horse and carried into leicester where he had slept the night before  the crown he had worn over his helmet was picked up from the branches of a hawthorn and set on the head of henry tudor  richard was the last king of the plantagenet family who had ruled over england for more than three hundred years  this battle of bosworth likewise finished the whole bloody war of the red and white roses     chapter xxv  henry vii  ad 14851509   henry tudor married the lady bessee as soon as he came to london and by this marriage the causes of the red and white roses were united so that he took for his badge a great rosehalf red and half white you may see it carved all over the beautiful chapel that he built on to westminster abbey to be buried in  he was not a very pleasant person he was stiff and cold and dry and very mean and covetous in some waysthough he liked to make a grand show and dress all his court in cloth of gold and silver and the very horses in velvet housings whenever there was any state occasion  nobody greatly cared for him but the whole country was so worn out with the troubles of the wars of the roses that there was no desire to interfere with him and people only grumbled and said he did not treat his gentle beautiful wife elizabeth as he ought to do but was jealous of her being a kings daughter  there was one person who did hate him most bitterly and that was the duchess of burgundy the sister of edward iv and richard iii the same who as i told you encouraged printing so much  she felt as if a mean upstart had got into the place of her brothers and his having married her niece did not make it seem a bit the better to her there was one nephew leftthe poor young orphan son of george duke of clarencebut he had always been quite silly and henry vii had him watched carefully for fear some one should set him up to claim the crown  he was called earl of warwick as heir to his grandfather the kingmaker  suddenly a young man came to ireland and pretended to be this earl of warwick  he deceived a good many of the irish and the mayor of dublin actually took him to st patricks cathedral where he was crowned as king edward the sixth and then he was carried to the banquet upon an irish chieftains back  he came to england with some irish followers and some german soldiers hired by the duchess and a few but not many english joined him  henry met him at a village called stoke near newark and all his germans and irish were killed and he himself made prisoner  then he confessed that he was really a bakers son named lambert simnel and as he turned out to be a poor weak lad whom designing people had made to do just what they pleased the king took him into his kitchen as a scullion and as he behaved well there afterwards set him to look after the falcons that people used to keep to go out with to catch partridges and herons  but after this a young man appeared under the protection of the duchess of burgundy who said he was no other than the poor little duke of york richard who had escaped from the tower when his brother was murdered  englishmen who came from flanders said that he was a clever cowardly lad of the name of peter or perkin warbeck the son of a townsman of tournay but the duchess persuaded king james iv of scotland to believe him a real royal plantagenet  he went to edinburgh married a beautiful lady cousin to the king and james led him into england at the head of an army to put forward his claim but nobody would join him and the scots did not care about him so james sent him away to ireland whence he went to cornwall  however he soon found fighting was of no use and fled away to the new forest where he was taken prisoner  he was set in the stocks and there made to confess that he was really perkin warbeck and no duke and then he was shut up in the tower  but there he made friends with the real earl of warwick and persuaded him into a plan for escape but this was found out and henry thinking that he should never have any peace or safety whilst either of them was alive caused perkin to be hanged and poor innocent edward of warwick to be beheaded  it was thought that this cruel deed was done because henry found that foreign kings did not think him safe upon the throne while one plantagenet was left alive and would not give their children in marriage to his sons and daughters  he was very anxious to make grand marriages for his children and make peace with scotland by a wedding between king james and his eldest daughter margaret  for his eldest son arthur prince of wales he obtained katharine the daughter of the king of aragon and queen of castille and she was brought to england while both were mere children  prince arthur died when only eighteen years old and king henry then said that they had been both such children that they could not be considered really married and so that katharine had better marry his next son henry although everyone knew that no marriage between a man and his brothers widow could be lawful  the truth was that he did not like to give up all the money and jewels she had brought and the matter remained in dispute for some yearsnor was it settled when king henry himself died after an illness that no one expected would cause his death  nobody was very sorry for him for he had been hard upon everyone and had encouraged two wicked judges named dudley and empson who made people pay most unjust demands and did everything to fill the kings treasury and make themselves rich at the same time  it was a time when many changes were going on peacefully  the great nobles had grown much poorer and less powerful and the country squires and chief people in the towns reckoned for much more in the state  moreover there was much learning and study going on everywhere  greek began to be taught as well as latin and the new testament was thus read in the language in which the apostles themselves wrote and that led people to think over some of the evil ways that had grown up in their churches and abbeys during those long grievous years when no one thought of much but fighting or of getting out of the way of the enemy  the king himself and all his family loved learning and nobody more than his son henry whoif his elder brother had livedwas to have been archbishop of canterbury  it was in this reign too that america was discoveredthough not by the english but by christopher columbus an italian who came out in ships that were lent to him by isabel the queen of spain mother to katharine princess of wales  henry had been very near sending columbus only he did not like spending so much money  how ever he afterwards did send out some ships which discovered newfoundland henry died in the year 1509     chapter xxvi  henry viii and cardinal wolsey  ad 15091529   the new king was very fond of the princess katharine and he married her soon after his fathers death without asking any more questions about the right or wrong of it  he began with very gallant and prosperous times  he was very handsome and skilled in all sports and games and had such frank free manners that the people felt as if they had one of their best old plantagenets back again  they were pleased too when he quarreled with the king of france and like an old plantagenet led an army across the sea and besieged the town of tournay  again it was like the time of edward iii for james iv of scotland was a friend of the french king and came across the border with all the strength of scotland to ravage england while henry was away  but there were plenty of stout englishmen left and under the earl of surrey they beat the scots entirely at the battle of flodden field and king james himself was not taken but left dead upon the field while his kingdom went to his poor little baby son though there had been a battle in france it was not another crecy for the french ran away so fast that it was called the battle of the spurs  however henrys expedition did not come to much for he did not get all the help he was promised and he made peace with the french king giving him in marriage his beautiful young sister mary though king louis was an old helpless sickly man  indeed he only lived six weeks after the wedding and before there was time to fetch queen mary home again she had married a gentleman named charles brandon  she told he brother that she had married once to please him and now she had married to please herself  but he forgave her and made her husband duke of suffolk  henrys chief adviser at this time was thomas wolsey archbishop of york a very able man and of most splendid tastes and habits outdoing even the tudors in love of show  the pope had made him a cardinalthat is one of the clergy who are counted as parish priests in the diocese of rome and therefore have a right to choose the pope  they wear scarlet hats capes and shoes and are the highest rank of all the clergy except the pope  indeed cardinal wolsey was in hopes of being chosen pope himself and setting the whole church to rightsfor there had been several very wicked men reigning at rome one after the other and they had brought things to such a pass that everyone felt there would be some great judgment from god if some improvement were not made  most of wolseys arrangements with foreign princes had this end in view  the new king of france francis i was young brilliant and splendid like henry and the two had a conference near calais when they brought their queens and their whole court and put up tents of velvet silk and goldwhile everything was so extraordinarily magnificent that the meeting has ever since been called the field of the cloth of gold  however nothing came of it all  cardinal wolsey thought franciss enemythe emperor charles vmore likely to help him to be pope and make his master go over to that side but after all an italian was chosen in his stead  and there came a new trouble in his way the king and queen had been married a good many years and they had only one child alive and that was a girl the lady maryall the others had died as soon as they were bornand statesmen began to think that if there never was a son at all there might be fresh wars when henry died while others said that the loss of the children was to punish them for marrying unlawfully  wolsey himself began to wish that the pope would say that it had never been a real marriage and so to set the king free to put katharine away and take another wife some grand princess abroad  this was thinking more of what seemed prudent than of the right and it turned out ill for wolsey and all besides for no sooner had the notion of setting aside poor katharine come into his mind than the king cast his eyes on anne boleyn one of her maids of honora lively lady who had been to france with his sister mary  he was bent on marrying her and insisted on the popes giving sentence against katharine  but the pope would not make any answer at all first because he was enquiring and then because he could not well offend katharines nephew the emperor  time went on and the king grew more impatient and at last a clergyman named thomas cranmer said that he might settle the matter by asking the learned men at the universities whether it was lawful for a man to marry his brothers widow  he has got the right sow by the ear cried henry who was not choice in his words and he determined that the universities should decide it  but wolsey would not help the king here  he knew that the pope had been the only person to decide such questions all over the western church for many centuries and besides he had never intended to assist the king to lower himself by taking a wife like anne boleyn  but his secretary thomas crumwell told the king all of wolseys disapproval and between them they found out something that the cardinal had done by the kings own wish but which did not agree with the old disused laws  he was put down from all his offices of state and accused of treason against the king but while he was being brought to london to be tried he became so ill at the abbey at leicester that he was forced to remain there and in a few days he died saying sadlyif i had served god as i have served my king he would not have forsaken me in my old age  with cardinal wolsey ended the first twenty years of henrys reign and all that had ever been good in it     chapter xxvii  henry viii and his wives  ad 15281547   when henry viii had so ungratefully treated cardinal wolsey there was no one to keep him in order  he would have no more to do with the pope but said he was head of the church of england himself and could settle matters his own way  he really was a very learned man and had written a book to uphold the doctrines of the church which had caused the people to call him the defender of the faith  after the kings or queens name on an english coin you may see fdfidei defensor this stands for that name in latin  but henry used his learning now against the pope  he declared that his marriage with katharine was good for nothing and sent her away to a house in huntingdonshire where in three years time she pined away and died  in the meantime he had married anne boleyn taken crumwell for his chief adviser and had made thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury  then calling himself the head of the church he insisted that all his people should own him as such but the good ones knew that our lord jesus christ is the only real head of the church and they had learnt to believe that the pope is the father bishop of the west though he had sometimes taken more power than he ought and no king could ever be the same as a patriarch or father bishop  so they refused and henry cut off the heads of two of the bestbishop fisher and sir thomas more though they had been his great friends  sir thomas mores good daughter margaret came and kissed him on his way to be executed and afterwards when his head was placed on a spike on london bridge she came by night in a boat and took it home in her arms  there were many people however who were glad to break with the pope because so much had gone amiss in the church and they wanted to set it to rights  there was so much more reading now that printing had been invented that many could read who had never learnt latin and so a translation of the bible was to be made for them and there was a great desire that the church servicesmany of which had also been in latinshould likewise be put into english and the litany was first translated but no more at present  the king and crumwell had taken it upon them to go on with what had been begun in wolseys timethe looking into the state of all the monasteries  some were found going on badly and the messengers took care to make the worst of everything so all the worst houses were broken up and the monks sent to their homes with a small payment to maintain them for the rest of their lives  as to the lands that good men of old had given to keep up the convents that god might be praised there henry made gifts of them to the lords about court  whoever chose to ask for an abbey could get it from the kings good nature and as they wanted more and more henry went on breaking up the monasteries till the whole of them were gone  a good deal of their riches he kept for himself and two new bishoprics were endowed from their spoils but most of them were bestowed on the courtiers  the king however did not at all intend to change the teaching of the church and whenever a person was detected in teaching any thing contrary to her doctrines as they were at the time understood he was tried by a court of clergymen and lawyers before the bishop and if convicted wasaccording to the cruel custom of those timesburnt to death at a stake in the market place of the next town  meantime the new queen anne boleyn whom the king had married privately in may 1533 had not prospered  she had one little daughter named elizabeth and a son who died and then the king began to admire one of her ladies named jane seymour  seeing this annes enemies either invented stories against her or made the worst of some foolish unladylike and unqueenlike things she had said and done so that the king thought she wished for his death  she was accused of high treason sentenced to death and beheaded thus paying a heavy price for the harm she had done good queen katharine  the king directly after married jane seymour but she lived only a very short time dying immediately after the christening of her first son who was named edward  then the king was persuaded by lord crumwell to marry a foreign princess called anne of cleves  a great painter was sent to bring her picture and made her very beautiful in it but when she arrived she proved to be not only plainfeatured but large and clumsy and the king could not bear the sight of her and said they had sent him a great flanders mare by way of queen  so he made cranmer find some foolish excuse for breaking this marriage also and was so angry with thomas crumwell for having led him into it that this favorite was in turn thrown into prison and beheaded  the king chose another english wife named katharine howard but after he had married her it was found out that she had been very ill brought up and the bad people with whom she had been left came and accused her of the evil into which they had led her  so the king cut off her head likewise and then wanted to find another wife but no foreign princess would take a husband who had put away two wives and beheaded two more and one italian lady actually answered that she was much obliged to him but she could not venture to marry him because she had only one neck  at last he found an english widow lady latimer whose maiden name was katharine parr and married her  he was diseased now lame with gout and very large and fat and she nursed him kindly and being a goodnatured woman persuaded him to be kinder to his daughters mary and elizabeth than he had ever been since the disgrace of their mothers and she did her best to keep him in good humor but he went on doing cruel things even to the end of his life and at the very last had in prison the very same duke of norfolk who had won the battle of flodden and would have put him to death in a few days time only that his own death prevented it  yet strange to say henry viii was not hated as might have been expected  his cruelties were chiefly to the nobles not to the common people and he would do goodnatured things and speak with a frank open manner that was much liked  england was prosperous too and shopkeepers farmers and all were well off there was plenty of bread and meat for all and the foreign nations were afraid to go to war with us  so the english people on the whole loved bluff king hal as they called him and did not think much about his many wickednesses or care how many heads he cut off  he died in the year 1547  the changes in his time are generally called the beginning of the reformation     chapter xxviii  edward vi  ad 15471553   the little son of henry viii and jane seymour of course reigned after him as edward vi  he was a quiet gentle boy exceedingly fond of  learning and study and there were great expectations of him but as he was only nine years old the affairs of state were managed by his council  the chief of the council were his two uncleshis mothers brothers edward and thomas seymour the elder of whom had been made duke of somersettogether with archbishop cranmer but it was not long before the duke quarreled with his brother thomas put him into the tower and cut off his head so that it seemed as if the days of henry viii were not yet over  the duke of somerset and archbishop cranmer wanted to make many more changes in the church of england than henry viii had ever allowed they had all the prayerbook services translated into english leaving out such parts as they did not approve the lessons were read from the english bible and people were greatly delighted at being able to worship and to listen to gods word in their own tongue  the first day on which the english prayerbook was used was the whitsunday of 1548  the bibles were chained to the desks as being so precious and valuable and crowds would stand or sit and listen for hours together to any one who would read to them without caring if he were a clergyman or not and men who tried to explain without being properly taught often made great mistakes  indeed in germany and france a great deal of the same kind had been going on for some time past though not with any sort of leave from the kings or bishops as there was in england and thus the reformers there broke quite off from the church and fancied they could do without bishops  this great break was called the reformation because it professed to set matters of religion to rights and in germany the reformers called themselves protestants because they protested some of the teachings of the church of rome  cranmer had at one time been in germany and had made friends with some of these german and swiss protestants and he invited them to england to consult and help him and his friends  several of them came and they found fault with our old english prayerbookthough it had never been the same as the roman oneand it was altered again to please them and their friends and brought out as king edwards second book  indeed they tried to persuade the english to be like themselveswith very few services no ornaments in the churches and no bishops and things seemed to be tending more and more to what they desired for the king was too young not to do what his tutors and governors wished and his uncle and cranmer were all on their side  however there was another great nobleman the duke of northumberland who wanted to be as powerful as the duke of somerset  he was the son of dudley the wicked judge under henry vii who had made himself so rich and he managed to take advantage of the people being discontented with somerset to get the king into his own hands accuse somerset of treason send him to the tower and cut off his head  the king at this time was sixteen  he had never been strong and he had learnt and worked much more than was good for him  he wrote a journal and though he never says he grieved for his uncles most likely he did for he had few near him who really loved or cared for him and he was fast falling into decline so that it became quite plain that he was not likely ever to be a grownup king  there was a great difficulty as to who was to reign after him  the natural person would have been his eldest sister mary but king henry had forbidden her and elizabeth to be spoken of as princesses or heiresses of the crown and besides mary held so firmly to the church as she had learnt to believe in it in her youth that the reformers knew she would undo all their work  there was a little scottish girl also named marythe granddaughter of margaret eldest daughter of henry vii  poor child she had been a queen from babyhood for her father had died of grief when she was but a week old and there had been some notion of marrying her to king edward and so ending the wars but the scots did not like this and sent her away to be married to the dauphin francois eldest son of the king of france  if edwards sisters were not to reign she came next but the english would not have borne to be joined on to the french and there were the granddaughters of mary that other sister of henry viii who were thorough englishwomen  lady jane grey the eldest of them was a good sweet pious and diligent girl of fifteen wonderfully learned  but it was not for that reason only for the sake of the royal blood that the duke of northumberland asked her in marriage for his son guildford dudley  when they were married the duke and cranmer began to persuade the poor sick young king that it was his duty to leave his crown away from his sister mary to lady jane who would go on with the reformation while mary would try to overthrow it  in truth young edward had not right to will away the crown but he was only sixteen and could only trust to what the archbishop and his council told him  so he signed the parchment they brought him and after that he quickly grew worse  the people grew afraid that northumberland was shutting him up and misusing him and once he came to the window of his palace and looked out at them to show he was alive but he died only a fortnight later and we cannot guess what he would have been when he was grown up     chapter xxix  mary i  ad 15531588   the duke of northumberland kept king edwards death a secret till he had proclaimed jane queen of england  the poor girl knew that a great wrong was being done in her name  she wept bitterly and begged that she might not be forced to accept the crown but she could do nothing to prevent it when her father and husband and his father all were bent on making her obey them and so she had to sit as a queen in the royal apartments in the tower of london  but as soon as the news reached mary she set off riding towards london and as everyone knew her to be the right queen and no one would be tricked by dudley the whole of the people joined her and even northumberland was obliged to throw up his hat and cry god save queen mary  jane and her husband were safely kept but mary meant no harm by them if their friends would have been quiet  however the people became discontented when mary began to have the latin service used again and put archbishop cranmer in prison for having favored jane  she showed in every way that she thought all her brothers advisers had done very wrong  she wanted to be under the pope again and she engaged herself to marry the king of spain her cousin philip ii  this was very foolish of her for she was a middleaged woman pale and lowspirited and he was much younger and of a silent gloomy temper so that everyone was afraid of him  all her best friends advised her not and the english hated the notion so much that the little children played at the queens wedding in their games and always ended by pretending to hang the king of spain  northumberland thought this discontent gave another chance for his plan and tried to raise the people in favor of jane but so few joined him that mary very soon put them down and beheaded northumberland  she thought too that the quiet of the country would never be secure while jane lived and so she consented to her being put to death  jane behaved with beautiful firmness and patience  her husband was led out first and beheaded and then she followed  she was most good and innocent in herself and it was for the faults of others that she suffered marys sister elizabeth was suspected and sent to the tower  she came in a boat on the thames to the traitors gate but when she found where she was she sat down on the stone steps and said this is a place for traitors and i am none  after a time she was allowed to live in the country but closely watched  philip of spain came and was married to mary  she was very fond of him but he was not very kind to her and he had too much to do in his other kingdoms to spend much time with her so that she was always pining after him  her great wish in choosing him was to be helped in bringing the country back to the old obedience to the pope and she succeeded in having the english church reconciled and received again to communion with rome  the new service she would under no consideration have established in her house  this displeased many of her subjects exceedingly  they thought they should be forbidden to read the biblethey could not endure the latin serviceand those who had been taught by the foreigners fancied that all proper reverence and beauty in church was a sort of idolatry  some fled away into holland and germany and others who staid and taught loudly against the doctrines that were to be brought back again were seized and thrown into prison  those bishops who had been foremost in the changes of course were the first to be tried for their teaching  the punishment was the dreadful one of being burnt alive chained to a stake  bishop hooper died in this way at gloucester and bishop ridley and bishop latimer were both burnt at the same time at oxford encouraging one another to die bravely as martyrs for the truth as they held it  cranmer was in prison already for supporting jane grey and he was condemned to death but he was led to expect that he would be spared the fire if he would allow that the old faith as rome held it was the right one paper after paper was brought such as would please the queen and his judges and he signed them all but after all it turned out that none would do and that he was to be burnt in spite of them  the he felt what a base part he had acted and was ashamed when he thought how bravely his brethren had died on the same spot and when he was chained to the stake and the fire lighted he held his right hand over the flame to be burnt first because it had signed what he did not really believe and he cried out this unworthy hand  altogether about three hundred people were burnt in queen marys reign for denying one or other of the doctrines that the pope thought the right ones  it was a terrible time and the queen who had only longed to do right and restore her country to the church found herself hated and disliked by everyone  even the pope who had a quarrel with her husband did not treat her warmly and the nobles who had taken possession of the abbey lands were determined never to let her restore them  her husband did not love her or like england  however he persuaded her to help him in a war with the french with which england out to have had nothing to do and the consequence was that a brave french duke took the city of calais the very last possession of the english in france  mary was so exceedingly grieved that she said that when she died the name of calais would be found written on her heart  she was already ill and there was a bad fever at the time of which many of those she most loved and trusted had fallen sick  she died in 1558 a melancholy and sorrowful woman after reigning only five years     chapter xxx  elizabeth  ad 15581587   all through queen marys time her sister elizabeth anne boleyns daughter had been in trouble  those who held by queen mary and maintained henrys first marriage said that his wedding with anne was no real one and so that elizabeth ought not to reign but then there was no one else to take in her stead except the young queen mary of scotland wife to the french dauphin  all who wished for the reformation and dreaded marys persecutions had hoped to see elizabeth queen and this had made mary much afraid of her and she was so closely watched and guarded that once she even said she wished she was a milkmaid to be left in peace  while she had been in the tower she had made friends with another prisoner robert dudley brother to the husband of lady jane grey and she continued to like him better than any other person as long as he lived  when mary died elizabeth was twentyfive and the english were mostly willing to have her for their queen  she had read thought and learnt a great deal and she took care to have the advice of wise men especially of the great thomas cecil whom she made lord burleigh and kept as her adviser as long as he lived  she did not always follow even his advice however but whenever she did it was the better for her  she knew robert dudley was not wise so though she was so fond of him she never let him manage her affairs for her  she would have wished to marry but she knew her subjects would think this disgraceful so she only made him earl of leicester and her liking for him prevented her from ever bringing herself to accept any of the foreign princes who were always making proposals to her unfortunately he was not a good man and did not make a good use of her favor and he was much disliked by all the queens best friends  she was very fond of making stately journeys through the country  all the poor people ran to see her and admire her but the noblemen who had to entertain her were almost ruined she brought so many people who ate so much and she expected such presents  these journeys were called progresses  the most famous was to lord leicesters castle of kenilworth but he could quite afford it  he kept the clocks hands at twelve oclock all the time that it might always seem to be dinner time  elizabeth wanted to keep the english church a pure and true branch of the church free of the mistakes that had crept in before her fathers time  so she restored the english prayerbook and cancelled all that mary had done the people who had gone into exile returned and all the protestants abroad reckoned her as on their side  but on the other hand the pope would not regard her as queen at all and cut her and her country off from the church while mary of scotland and her husband called themselves the true queen and king of england and such of the english as believed the pope to have the first right over the church held with him and mary of scotland  they were called roman catholics while elizabeth and her friends were the real catholics for they held with the church universal of old and it was the pope who had broken off with them for not accepting his doctrines not they with the pope  the english who had lived abroad in marys time wanted to have much more altered and to have churches and services much less beautiful and more plain than they were  but elizabeth never would consent to this and these people called themselves puritans and continued to object to the episcopal form of worship  mary of scotland was two years queen of france and then her husband died and she had to come back to scotland  there most of the people had taken up the doctrines that made them hate the sight of the clergy and services she had brought home from france they called her an idolater and would hardly bear that she should hear the old service in her own chapel  she was one of the most beautiful and charming women who ever lived and if she had been as true and good as she was lovely nobody could have done more good but the court of france at that time was a wicked place and she had learnt much of the wickedness  she married a young nobleman named henry stuart a cousin of her own but he turned out foolish selfish and headstrong and made her miserable indeed he helped to kill her secretary in her own bedroom before her eyes  she hated him so much at last that there is only too much reason to fear that she knew of the plot laid by some of her lords to blow the poor mans house up with gunpowder while he lay is his bed ill of smallpox  at any rate she very soon married one of the very worst of the nobles who had committed the murder  her subjects could not bear this and they rose against her and made her prisoner while her husband fled the country  they shut her up in a castle in the middle of a lake and obliged her to give up her crown to her little son james via baby not a year old however her sweet words persuaded a boy who waited on her to steal the keys and row her across the lake and she was soon at the head of an army of her roman catholic subjects  they were defeated however and she found no place safe for her in scotland so she fled across the border to england  queen elizabeth hardly knew what to do  she believed that mary had really had to do with henry stuarts death but she could not bear to make such a crime known in a cousin and queen and what made it all more difficult to judge was that the kings of france and spain and all the roman catholics at home thought mary ought to be queen instead of elizabeth and she might have been set up against england if she might had gone abroad or been left at large while in scotland she would have been murdered the end of it was that elizabeth kept her shut up in different castles  there she managed to interest the english roman catholics in her and get them to lay plots which always were found out then nobles were put to death and mary was more closely watched this went on for nineteen years and at last a worse plot than all was found outfor actually killing queen elizabeth  her servants did not act honorably for when they found out what was going on they pretended not to know so that mary might go on writing worse and worse things and then at last the whole was made known  mary was tried and sentenced to death but elizabeth was a long time making up her mind to sign the order for her execution and at last punished the clerks who sent it off as if it had been their fault  so queen mary of scotland was beheaded at fotheringay castle showing much bravery and piety  there are many people who still believe that she was really innocent of all that she was accused of and that she only was ruined by the plots that were laid against her     chapter xxxi  elizabeths reign  ad 15871602   no reign ever was more glorious or better for the people than queen elizabeths  it was a time when there were many very great men living soldiers sailors writers poetsand they all loved and look up to the queen as the mother of her country  there really was nothing she did love like the good of her people and somehow they all felt and knew it and good queen bess had their heartsthough she was not always right and had some serious faults  the worst of her faults was not telling the truth  somehow kings and rulers had at that time learnt to believe that when they were dealing with other countries anything was fair and that it was not wrong to tell falsehoods to hide a secret nor to make promises they never meant to keep  people used to do so who would never have told a lie on their own account to their neighbor and lord burleigh and queen elizabeth did so very often and often behaved meanly and shabbily to people who had trusted to their promises  her other fault was vanity  she was a little woman with bright eyes and rather hooked nose and sandy hair but she managed to look every inch a queen and her eye when displeased was like a lions  she had really been in love with lord leicester and every now and then he hoped she would marry him indeed there is reason to fear that he had his wife secretly killed in order that he might be able to wed the queen but she saw that the people would not allow her to do so and gave it up  but she liked to be courted  she allowed foreign princes to send her their portraits rings and jewels and sometimes to come and see her but she never made up her mind to take them  and as to the gentlemen at her own court she liked them to make the most absurd and ridiculous compliments to her calling her their sun and goddess and her hair golden beams of the morning and the like and the older she grew the more of these fine speeches she required of them  her dressa huge hoop a tall ruff all over lace and jewels in the utmost profusion was as splendid as it could be made and in wonderful variety  she is said to have had three hundred gowns and thirty wigs  lord burleigh said of her that she was sometimes more than a man and sometimes less than a woman  and so she was when she did not like her ladies to wear handsome dresses  one of the people who had wanted to marry her was her brotherinlaw philip of spain but she was far too wise and he and she were bitter enemies all the rest of their lives  his subjects in holland had become protestants and he persecuted them so harshly that they broke away from him  they wanted elizabeth to be their queen but she would not though she sent lord leicester to help them with an army  with him went his nephew sir philip sydney the most good and learned and graceful gentleman at court  there was great grief when sir philip was struck by a cannon ball in the thigh and died after nine days pain  it was as he was being carried from the field faint and thirsty that some one had just brought him a cup of water when he saw a poor soldier worse hurt than himself looking at it with longing eyes  he put it from him untasted and said take it thy necessity is greater than mine  after the execution of mary of scotland philip of spain resolved to punish elizabeth and the english and force them back to obedience to the pope  he fitted out an immense fleet and filled it with fighting men  so strong was it that as armada is the spanish for a fleet it was called the invincible armada  it sailed for england the men expecting to burn and ruin all before them  but the english ships were ready  little as they were they hunted and tormented the big spaniards all the way up the english channel and just as the armada had passed the straits of dover there came on such dreadful storms that the ships were driven and broken before it and wrecked all round the coastseven in scotland and irelandand very few ever reached home again  the english felt that god had protected them with his wind and storm and had fought for them  lord leicester died not long after and the queen became almost equally fond of his stepson the earl of essex who was a brave highspirited young man only too proud  the sailors of queen elizabeths time were some of the bravest and most skilful that ever lived  sir francis drake sailed round the world in the good ship pelican and when he brought her into the thames the queen went to look at her  sir walter raleigh was another great sailor and a most courtly gentleman besides  he took out the first english settlers to north america and named their new home virginiaafter the virgin queenand he brought home from south america our good friend the potato root and also he learnt their to smoke tobacco  the first time his servant saw this done in england he thought his master must be on fire and threw a bucket of water over him to put it out  the queen valued these brave men much but she liked none so well as lord essex till at last he displeased her and she sent him to govern ireland  there he fell into difficulties and she wrote angry letters which made him think his enemies were setting her against him  so he came back without leave and one morning came straight into her dressing chamber where she was sitting with her thin grey hair being combed before she put on one of her thirty wigs or painted her face she was very angry and would not forgive him and he got into a rage too and she heard he had said she was an old woman crooked in temper as in person  what was far worse he raised the londoners to break out in a tumult to uphold him  he  was taken and sent to the tower tried for treason and found guilty of death  but the queen still loved him and waited and waited for some message or token to ask her pardon  none came and she thought he was too proud to beg for mercy she signed the death warrant and essex died on the block  but soon she found that he had really sent a ring she once had given him to a lady who was to show it to her in token that he craved her pardon the ring had been taken by mistake to a cruel lady who hated him and kept it back  but byandby this lady was sick to death  then she repented and sent for the queen and gave her the ring and confessed her wickedness  poor queen elizabethher very heart was broken  she said to the dying woman god may forgive you but i cannot  she said little more after that  she was old and her strength failed her  day after day she sat on a pile of cushions with her finger on her lips still growing weaker and begging for the prayers the archbishop read her  and thus she who had once been so great and spirited sank into death when seventy years old in the year 1602     chapter xxxii  james i  ad 16021625   after queen elizabeths death the next heir was james the son of mary of scotland and had reigned there ever since his mother had been driven away  he had been brought up very strictly by the scottish reformers who had made him very learned and kept him under great restraint and all that he had undergone had tended to make him awkward and strange in his manners  he was timid and could not bear to see a drawn sword and he was so much afraid of being murdered that he used to wear a dress padded and stuffed out all over with wool which made him look even more clumsy than he was by nature  the english did not much admire their new king though it really was a great blessing that england and scotland should be under the same king at last so as to end all the long and bloody wars that had gone on for so many years  still the puritans thought that as james had been brought up in their way of thinking they would be allowed to make all the changes that queen elizabeth had stopped and the roman catholics recollected that he was queen marys son and that his reformed tutors had not made his life very pleasant to him as a boy so they had hopes from him  but they both were wrong  james had really read and thought much and was a much wiser man at the bottom than anyone would have thought who had seen his disagreeable ways and heard his silly way of talking he thought the english church was much more in the right than either of them and he only wished that things should go on the same in england and that the scots should be brought to have bishops and to use the prayers that christians had used from the very old times instead of each minister praying out of his own head as had become the custom  but though he could not change the ways of the scots at once he caused all the best scholars and clergymen in his kingdom to go to work to make the translation of the bible as right and good as it could be  long before this was finished however some of the roman catholics had formed a conspiracy for getting rid of all the chief people in the kingdom and so as they hoped bringing the rest back to the pope  there were good men among the roman catholics who knew such an act would be horrible but there were some among them who had learnt to hate everyone that they did not reckon as of the right religion and to believe that everything was right that was done for the cause of their church  so these men agreed that on the day of the meeting of parliament when the king with the queen and prince of wales would all be meeting the lords and commons they would blow the whole of them up with gunpowder and while the country was all in confusion the king dead and almost all his lords and the chief country squires they would take the kings younger childrenelizabeth or charles who were both quite littleand bring one up as a roman catholic to govern england  they hired some cellars under the houses of parliament and stored them with barrels of gunpowder hidden by faggots and the time was nearly come when one of the lords called monteagle received a letter that puzzled him very much advising him not to attend the meeting of parliament since a sudden destruction would come upon all who would there be present and yet so that they would not know the doer of it no one knows who wrote the letter but most likely it was one of the gentlemen who had been asked to join in the plot and though he would not betray his friends could not bear that lord monteagle should perish  lord monteagle took the letter to the council and there after puzzling over it and wondering if it were a joke the king said gunpowder was a means of sudden destruction and it was agreed that at any rate it would be safer to look into the vaults  a party was sent to search and there they found all the powder ready prepared and moreover a man with a lantern one guy fawkes who had undertaken to be the one to set fire to the train of gunpowder hoping to escape before the explosion  however he was seized in time and was forced to make confession  most of the gentlemen concerned fled into the country and shut themselves up in a fortified house but there strange to say a barrel of gunpowder chanced to get lighted and thus many were much hurt in the very way that meant to hurt others  there was a great thanksgiving all over the country and it became the custom that on the 5th of novemberthe day when the gunpowder plot was to have taken effectthere should be bonfires and fireworks and guy fawkes figure burnt but people are getting wiser now and think it better not to keep up the memory old crimes and hatreds  henry prince of wales was a fine lad fond of all that was good but a little too apt to talk of wars and of being like henry v he was very fond of ships and  sailors and delighted in watching the building of a grand vessel that was to take his sister elizabeth across the sea when she was to marry the count palatine of the rhine before the wedding however prince henry fell suddenly ill and died  king james was a fond of favorites as ever elizabeth had been though not of the same persons  one of the worst things he ever did was the keeping sir walter raleigh in the tower for many years and a last cutting off his head  it was asserted that sir walter had tried when first james came to set up a lady named arabella stuart to be queen but if he was to be punished for that it ought to have been directly instead of keeping the sentence hanging over his head for years  the truth was that sir walter had been a great enemy to the spaniards and james wanted to please them for he wished his son charles to marry the daughter of the king of spain  charles wanted to see her first and set off for spain in disguise with the duke of buckingham who was his friend and his fathers greatest favorite  but when reached he madrid he found that the princesses were not allowed to speak to any gentleman nor to show their faces and though he climbed over a wall to speak to her when she was walking in the garden an attendant begged him to go away or all her train would be punished  charles went back disappointed and on his way through paris saw henrietta maria the brighteyed sister of the king of france and set his heart on marrying her  before this was settled however king james was seized with an ague and died in the year 1625  he was the first king of the family of stuart and a very strange person he waswonderfully learned and exceedingly conceited indeed he like nothing better than to be called the english solomon  the worst of him was that like elizabeth he thought kings and rulers might tell falsehoods and deceive  he called this kingcraft and took this very bad sort of cunning for wisdom     chapter xxxiii  charles i  ad 16251649   so many of the great nobles had been killed in the wars of the roses that the barons had lost all that great strength and power they had gained when they made king john sign magna carta  the kings got the power instead and all through the reigns of the five tudors the sovereign had very little to hinder him from doing exactly as he pleased  but in the meantime the country squires and the great merchants who sat in the house of commons had been getting richer and stronger and read and thought more  as long as queen elizabeth lived they were contented for they loved her and were proud of her and she knew how to manage them  she scolded them sometimes but when she saw that she was really vexing them she always changed and she had smiles and good words for them so that she could really do what she pleased with them  but james i was a disagreeable man to have to do with and instead of trying to please them he talked a great deal about his own power as king and how they ought to obey him so that they were angered and began to read the laws and wonder how much power properly belonged to him  now when he died his son charles was a much pleasanter person he was a gentleman in all his looks and ways and had none of his fathers awkward ungainly tricks and habits he was good and earnest too and there was nothing to take offence at in himself so for some years all went on quietly and there seemed to be a great improvement  but several things were against him  his friend the duke of buckingham was a proud selfish man who affronted almost everyone and made a bad use of the kings favor and the people were also vexed that the king should marry a roman catholic princess henrietta maria who would not go to church with him nor even let herself be crowned by an english archbishop  you heard that in queen elizabeths time there were puritans who would have liked to have the prayerbook much more altered and who fancied that every pious rule of old times must be wrong  they did not like the cross in baptism nor the ring in marriage and they could not bear to see a clergyman in a surplice  in many churches they took their own way and did just as they pleased  but under james and charles matters changed  dr laud whom charles had made archbishop of canterbury had all the churches visited and insisted on the parishioners setting them in order and if a clergyman would not wear a surplice not make a cross on the baptized childs forehead nor obey the other laws of the prayerbook he was punished  the puritans were greatly displeased  they fancied the king and dr laud wanted to make them all roman catholics again and a great many so hated these church rules that they took ship and went off to north america to found a colony where they might set up their own religion as they liked it  those who staid continued to murmur and struggle against laud  there was another great matter of displeasure and that was the way in which the king raised money  the right way is that he should call his parliament together and the house of commons should grant him what he wanted  but there were other means  one was that every place in england should be called on to pay so much for ship money  this had begun when king alfred raised his fleet to keep off the danes but it had come not to be spent on ships at all but only be money for the king to use  another way that the kings had of getting money was from fines  people who committed some small offence that did not come under the regular laws were brought before the council in a room at westminster that had a ceiling painted with starsand so was called the star chamberand there were sentenced sometimes to pay heavy sums of money sometimes to have their ears cut off  this court of the star chamber had been begun in the days of henry vii and it is only a wonder that the english had borne it so long  one thing charles i did that pleased his people and that was sending help to the french protestants who were having their town of rochelle besieged  but the english were not pleased that the command of the army was given to the duke of buckingham his proud insolent favorite but buckingham never went  as he was going to embark at portsmouth he was stabbed to the heart by a man named felton nobody clearly knows why  charles did not get on much better even when buckingham was dead whenever he called a parliament fault was always found with him and with the laws  then he tried to do without a parliament and as he of course needed money the calls for ship money came oftener and the fines in the star chamber became heavier and more cases for them were hunted out  then murmurs arose  just then too he and archbishop laud were trying to make the scots return to the church by giving them bishops and a prayerbook  but the first time the service was read in a church at edinburgh a fishwoman named jenny geddes jumped up in a rage and threw a threelegged stool at the clergymans head  some scots fancied they were being brought back to rome others hated whatever was commanded in england  all these leagued together and raised an army to resist the king and he was obliged to call a parliament once more to get money enough to resist them     chapter xxxiv  the long parliament  ad 16411649   when charles i was obliged to call his parliament the house of commons met angered at the length of time that had passed since they had been called and determined to use their opportunity  they speedily put an end both to the payment of ship money and to the court of the star chamber and they threw into prison the two among the kings friends whom they most disliked namely archbishop laud and the earl of strafford  the earl had been governor of ireland and had kept great order there but severely and he thought that the king was the only person who ought to have any power and was always advising the king to put down all resistance by the strong hand he was thought a hard man and very much hated and when he was tried the houses of parliament gave sentence against him that he should be beheaded  still this could not be done without the kings warrant and charles at first stood out against giving up his faithful friend but there was a great tumult and the queen and her mother grew frightened and entreated the king to save himself by giving up lord strafford until at last he consented and signed the paper ordering the execution  it was a sad act of weakness and cowardice and he mourned over it all the days of his life  the parliament only asked more and more and at last the king thought he must put a check on them  so he resolved to go down to the house and cause the five members who spoke against his power to be taken prisoners in his own presence  but he told his wife what he intended and henrietta maria was so foolish as to tell lady carlisle one of her ladies and she sent warning to the five gentlemen so that they were not in the house when charles arrived and the londoners rose up in a great mob and showed themselves so angry with him that he took the queen and his children away into the country  the queen took her daughter mary to holland to marry the prince of orange and there she bought muskets and gunpowder for her husbands armyfor things had come to pass now that a civil war began  a civil war is the worst of all wars for it is one between the people of the same country england had had two civil wars before  there were the barons wars between henry iii and simon de montfort about the keeping of magna carta and there were the wars of the roses to settle whether york or lancaster should reign  this war between charles i and the parliament was to decide whether the king or the house of commons should be most powerful  those who held with the king called themselves cavaliers but the friends of the parliament called them malignants and they in turn nicknamed the parliamentary party roundheads because they often chose not to wear their hair in the prevailing fashion long and flowing on their shoulders but cut short round their heads  most of the roundheads were puritans and hated the prayerbook and all the strict rules for religious worship that archbishop laud had brought in and the cavaliers on the other hand held by the bishops and the prayerbook  some of the cavaliers were very good men indeed and led holy and christian lives like their master the king but there were others who were only bold dashing men careless and full of mirth and mischief and the puritans were apt to think all amusements and pleasures wrong so that they made out the cavaliers worse than they really were  i do not think you would understand about all the battles so i shall only tell you now that the kings army was chiefly led by his nephew prince rupert the son of his sister elizabeth  rupert was a fiery brave young man who was apt to think a battle was won before it really was and would ride after the people he had beaten himself without waiting to see whether his help was wanted by the other captains and so he did his uncles cause as much harm as good  the kings party had been the  most used to war and they prospered the most at first but as the soldiers of the parliament became more trained they gained the advantage  one of the members of parliament a gentleman named oliver cromwell soon showed himself to be a much better captain than any one else in england and from the time he came to the chief command the parliament always had the victory  the places of the three chief battles were edgehill marston moor and naseby the first was doubtful but the other two were great victories of the roundheads  just after marston moor the parliament put to death archbishop laud and at the same time they forbade the use of the prayerbook and turned out all the parish priests from the churches putting in their stead men chosen after their own fashion and not ordained by bishops  they likewise destroyed all they disliked in the churchesthe painted glass the organs and the carvings and when the puritan soldiers took possession of a town or village they would stable their horses in the churches use the font for a trough and shoot at the windows as marks  after the battle of naseby king charles was in such distress that he thought he would go to the scots remembering that though he had offended them by trying to make them use the prayerbook he had been born among them and he thought they would prefer him to the english but when he came the scottish army treated him like a prisoner and showed him very few honors and at last they gave him up to the english parliament for a great sum of money  so charles was a prisoner to his own subjects  this parliament is called the long parliament because it sat longer than any other parliament ever did indeed it had passed a resolution that it could not be dissolved     chapter xxxv  death of charles i  ad 16491651   the long parliament did not wish to have no king only to make him do what they pleased and then went on trying whether he would come back to reign according to their notions  he would have given up a great deal but when they wanted him to declare that there should be no bishops in england he would never consent for he thought there could be no real church without bishops as our lord himself had appointed  at last after there had been much debating and it was plain that it would never come to an end oliver cromwell sent some of his officers to take king charles into their hands instead of the persons appointed by parliament  so the king was prisoner to the army instead of to the parliament  cromwell was a very able man and he saw that nobody could settle the difficulties about the law and the rights of the people but himself he saw that things never would be settled while the king lived nor by the parliament so he sent one of his officers named pryde to turnout all the members of parliament who would not do his will and then the fifty who were left appointed a court of officers and lawyers to try the king  charles was brought before them but as they had no right to try him he would not say a word in answer to them nevertheless they sentenced him to have his head cut off  he had borne all his troubles in the most meek and patient way forgiving all his enemies and praying for them and he was ready to die in the same temper  his queen was in france and all his children were safe out of england except his daughter elizabeth who was twelve years old and little henry who was five  they were brought to whitehall palace for him to see the night before he was to die  he took the little boy on his knee and talked a long time to elizabeth telling her what books to read and giving her his message to her mother and brothers and then he told little henry to mark what he said and to mind that he must never be set up as a king while his elder brothers charles and james were alive  the little boy said through his tears i will be torn to pieces first  his father kissed and blessed the two children and left them  the next day was the 30th of january 1649  the king was allowed to have bishop juxon to read and pray with him and to give him the holy communion  after that forgiving his enemies and praying for them he was led to the banqueting house at whitehall and out through a window on to the scaffold hung with black cloth  he said his last prayers and the executioner cut off his head with one blow and held it up to the people  he was buried at nighta light snow falling at the timein st georges chapel at windsor by four faithful noblemen but they were not allowed to use any service over his grave  the scots were so much shocked to find what their selling of their king had come to that they invited his eldest son charles a young man of nineteen to come and reign over them and offered to set him on the english throne again  young charles came but they were so strict that they made his life very dull and weary since they saw sin in every amusement  however they kept their promise of marching into england and some of the english cavaliers joined them but oliver cromwell and his army met them at worcester and they were entirely beaten  young king charles had to go away with a few gentlemen and he was so closely followed that they had to put him in charge of some woodmen named penderel who lived in boscobel forest  they dressed him in a rough leather suit like their own and when the roundhead soldiers came to search he was hidden among the branches of an oak tree above their heads  afterwards a lady named jane lane helped him over another part of his journey by letting him ride on horseback before her as her servant but when she stopped at an inn he was very near being found out because he did not know how to turn the spit in the kitchen when the cook asked him  however he got safely to brighton which was only a little village then and a boat took him to france where his  mother was living  in the meantime his young sister and brother elizabeth and henry had been sent to the isle of wight to carisbrook castle  elizabeth was pining away with sorrow and before long she was found dead with her cheek resting on her open bible  after this little henry was sent to be with his mother in france  the eldest daughter mary had been married just as the war began to the prince of orange who lived in holland and was left a widow with one little son  james duke of york the second brother had at first been in the keeping of a parliamentary nobleman with his brother and sister in london but during a game of hideandseek he crept out of the gardens and met some friends who dressed him in girls clothes and took him to a ship in the thames which carried him to holland little henrietta the youngest had been left when only six weeks old to the care of one of her mothers ladies  when she was nearly three the lady did not think it safe to keep her any longer in england  so she stained her face and hands brown with walnut juice to look like a gipsy took the child upon her back and trudged to the coast  little henrietta could not speak plain but she always called herself by a name she meant to be princess and the lady was obliged to call her piers and pretend that she was a little boy when the poor child grew angry at being treated so differently from usual and did all she possibly could to make the strangers understand that she was no beggar boy  however at last she was safe across the sea and was with her mother at paris where the king of france queen henriettas nephew was very kind to the poor exiles  the misfortune was that the queen brought up little henrietta as a roman catholic and tried to make henry one also but he was old enough to be firm to his fathers church and he went away to his sister in holland  james however did somewhat late become a roman catholic and charles would have been one if he had cared enough about religion to do what would have lessened his chance of getting back to england as king  but these two brothers were learning no good at paris and were growing careless of the right and fond of pleasure  james and henry after a time joined the french army that they might learn the art of war  they were both very brave but it was sad that when france and england went to war they should be in the army of the enemies of their country     chapter xxxvi  oliver cromwell  ad 16491660   oliver cromwell felt as has been said that there was no one who could set matters to rights as he could in england  he had shewn that the country could not do without him if it was to go on without the old government  not only had he conquered and slain charles i and beaten that kings friends and those of his son in scotland but he had put down a terrible rising of the irish and suppressed them with much more cruelty than he generally showed  he found that the old long parliament did nothing but blunder and talk so he marched into the house one day with a company of soldiers and sternly ordered the members all off calling out as he pointed to the mace that lay before the speakers chair take away that bauble after that he called together a fresh parliament but there were very few members and those only men who would do as he bade them  the speaker was a leatherseller named barebones so that this is generally known as barebones parliament  by these people he was named lord protector of england and as his soldiers would still do anything for him he reigned for five years just as a king might have done and a good king too  he was by no means a cruel or unmerciful man and he did not persecute the cavaliers more than he could help if he was to keep up his power though of course they suffered a great deal since they had fines laid upon them and some forfeited their estates for having resisted the parliament  many had to live in holland or france because there was no safety for them in england and their wives went backwards and forwards to their homes to collect their rents and obtain something to live upon  the bishops and clergy had all been driven out and in no church was it allowable to use the prayerbook so there used to be secret meetings in rooms or vaults or in woods where the prayers could be used as of old and the holy sacrament administered  for five years cromwell was lord protector but in the year 1658 he died advising that his son richard should be chosen protector in his stead  richard cromwell was a kind amiable gentleman but not clever or strong like his father and he very soon found that to govern england was quite beyond his power so he gave up and went to live at his own home again while the english people gave him the nickname tumbledowndick  no one seemed well to know what was to be done next but general monk who was now at the head of the army thought the best thing possible would be to bring back the king  a new parliament was elected and sent an invitation to charles ii to come back again and reign like his forefathers  he accepted it the fleet was sent to fetch him and on the 29th of may 1660 he rode into london between his brothers james and henry  the streets were dressed with green boughs the windows hung with tapestry and everyone shewed such intense joy and delight the king said he could not think why he should have stayed away so long since everyone was so glad to see him back again  but the joy of his return was clouded by the deaths of his sister mary the princess of orange and of his brother henry who was only just twenty  mary left a son william prince of orange of whom you will hear more  the bishops were restored and as there had been no archbishop since laud had been beheaded good juxon who had attended king charles at his death was made archbishop in his room  the persons who had been put into the parishes to act as clergymen were obliged to give place to the real original parish priest but if he were dead as was often the case they were told that they might stay if they would be ordained by the bishops and obey the prayerbook  some did so some made an arrangement for keeping the parsonages and paying a curate to take the service in church but those who were the most really in earnest gave up everything and were turned outbut only as they had turned out the former clergymen ten or twelve years before  all oliver cromwells army was broken up and the men sent to their homes except one regiment which came from coldstream in scotland these would not disband and when charles ii heard it he said he would take them as his guards  this was the beginning of there being always a regular army of men whose whole business it is to be soldiers instead of any man being called from his work when he is wanted  charles ii promised pardon to all the rebels but he did try and execute all who had been actually concerned in condemning his father to death     chapter xxxvii  charles ii  ad 16601685   it is sad to have to say that after all his troubles charles ii disappointed everybody  some of these disappointments could not be helped but others were his own fault  the puritan party thought after they had brought him home again he should have been more favorable to them and grumbled at the restoration of the clergymen and of the prayerbook  the cavaliers thought that after all they had gone through for him and his father he ought to have rewarded them more but he said truly enough that if he had made a nobleman of everyone who had deserved well of him no place but salisbury plain would have been big enough for the house of lords to meet upon  then those gentlemen who had got into debt to raise soldiers for the kings service and had paid fines or had to sell their estates felt it hard not to have them again but when a roundhead gentleman had honestly bought the property it would have been still more unjust to turn them out  these two old names of cavaliers and roundheads began to turn into two others even more absurd  the cavalier set came to be called tories an irish name for a robber and the puritans got the scotch name of whigs which means buttermilk  it would have taken a very strong wise and good man to deal rightly with two such different sets of people but though charles ii was a very clever man he was neither wise nor good  he could not bear to vex himself nor anybody else and rather than be teased would grant almost anything that was asked of him  he was so bright and lively and made such droll goodnatured answers that everyone liked him who came near him but he had no steady principle only to stand easy with everybody and keep as much power for himself as he could without giving offence  he loved pleasure much better than duty and kept about him a set of people who amused him but were a disgrace to his court they even took money from the french king to persuade charles against helping the dutch in their war against the french  the dutch went to war with the english upon this and there were many terrible sea fights in which james duke of york the kings brother shewed himself a good and brave sailor  the year 1665 is remembered as that in which there was a dreadful sickness in london called the plague  people died of it often after a very short illness and it was so infectious that it was difficult to escape it  when a person in a house was found to have it the door was fastened up and marked with a red cross in chalk and no one was allowed to go out or in food was set down outside to be fetched in and carts came round to take away the dead who were all buried together in long ditches  the plague was worst in the summer and autumn as winter came on more recovered and fewer sickened and at last this frightful sickness was ended and by gods good mercy it has never since that year come to london  the next year 1666 there was a fire in london which burnt down whole streets with their churches and even destroyed st pauls cathedral perhaps it did good by burning down the dirty old houses and narrow streets where the plague might have lingered but it was a fearsome misfortune  it was only stopped at last by blowing up a space with gunpowder all round it so that the flames might have no way to pass on  the king and his brother came and were very helpful in giving orders about this and in finding shelter for many poor homeless people  there was a good deal of disturbance in scotland when the king wanted to bring back the bishops and the prayerbook  many of the scots would not go to church and met on hills and moors to have their prayers in their own way  soldiers were sent to disperse them and there was much fierce bitter feeling  archbishop sharpe was dragged out of his carriage and killed and then there was a civil war in which the kings men prevailed but the whigs were harshly treated and there was great discontent  the country was much troubled because the king and queen had no children and the duke of york was a roman catholic  a strange story was got up that there was what was called a popish plot for killing the king and putting james on the throne  charles himself laughed at it for he knew everyone liked him and disliked his brother no one would kill me to make you king james he said but in his easy selfish way when he found that all the country believed in it and wanted to have the men they fancied guilty put to death he did not try to save their lives  soon after this false plot there was a real one called the ryehouse plot  long ago the king had pretended to marry a girl named lucy waters and they had a son whom he had made duke of monmouth but who could not reign because there had been no right marriage  however lord russell and some other gentlemen who ought to have know better so hated the idea of the duke of york being king that they joined in the ryehouse plot for killing the duke and forcing the king to make monmouth his heir  some of the more unprincipled sort who had joined them even meant to shoot charles and james together on the way to the newmarket races  however the plot was found out and the leaders were put to death  lord russells wife lady rachel sat by him all the time of his trial and was his great comfort to the last  monmouth was pardoned but fled away into holland  the best thing to be said of charles ii was that he made good men bishops and he never was angry when they spoke out boldly about his wicked ways but then he never tried to leave them off and he spent the very last sunday of his life among his bad companions playing at cards and listening to idle songs  just after this came a stroke of apoplexy and while he lay dying on his bed he sent for a roman catholic priest and was received into the church of rome in which he had really believed most of his lifethough he had never dared to own it for fear of losing his crown  so as he was living a lie of course the fruits showed themselves in his selfish wasted life  it was in this reign that two grand books were written  john milton a blind scholar and poet who before he lost his sight had been oliver cromwells secretary wrote his paradise lost or rather dictated it to his daughters and john bunyan a tinker who had been a puritan preacher wrote the pilgrims progress     chapter xxxviii  james ii  ad 16851688   james ii had at least been honest in openly joining the church in which he believed but the people disliked and distrusted him and he had not the graces of his brother to gain their hearts with but was grave sad and stern  the duke of monmouth came across from holland and was proclaimed king in his uncles stead at exeter  many people in the west of england joined him and at taunton in somersetshire he was received by rows of little girls standing by the gate in white frocks strewing flowers before him  but at sedgemoor he was met by the army and his friends were routed he himself fled away and at last was caught hiding in a ditch dressed in a laborers smock frock and with his pockets full of peas from the fields  he was taken to london tried and executed he did not deserve much pity but james ought not to have let the people who favored him be cruelly treated  sir george jeffreys the chief justice was sent to try all who had been concerned from winchester to exeter and he hung so many and treated all so savagely that his progress was called the bloody assize  even the poor little maids at taunton were thrown into a horrible dirty jail and only released on their parents paying a heavy sum of money for them  this was a bad beginning for jamess reign and the english grew more angry and suspicious when they saw that he favored roman catholics more than anyone else and even put them into places that only clergymen of the church of england could fill  then he put forth a decree declaring that a person might be chosen to any office in the state whether he were a member of the english church or no and he commanded that every clergyman should read it from his pulpit on sunday mornings  archbishop sancroft did not think it a right thing for clergymen to read and he and six more bishops presented a petition to the king against being obliged to read it  one of these was thomas ken bishop of bath and wells who wrote the morning hymn awake my soul and with the sun and the evening hymn all praise to thee my god this night  instead of listening to their petition the king had all the seven bishops sent to the tower and tried for libelthat is for malicious writing  all england was full of anxiety and when at last the jury gave the verdict of not guilty the whole of london rang with shouts of joy and the soldiers in their camp shouted still louder  this might have been a warning to the king for he thought that as he paid the army they were all on his side and would make the people bear whatever he pleased  the chief comfort people had was in thinking their troubles would only last during his reign for his first wife an englishwoman had only left him two daughters mary and anne and mary was married to her cousin william prince of orange who was a great enemy of the king of france and of the pope and annes husband prince george brother to the king of denmark was a protestant  he was a dull man and people laughed at himbecause whenever he heard any news he never said anything but est il possible is it possible  but he had a little son of whom there was much hope  but james had married again mary beatrice deste an italian princess and though none of her babies had lived before at last she had a little son who was healthy and likely to live and who was christened james  poor little boy  everyone was so angry and disappointed that he should have come into the world at all that a story was put about that he was not the son of the king and queen but a strange baby who had been carried into the queens room in a warmingpan because james was resolved to prevent mary and william from reigning  only silly people could believe such a story as this but all the whigs and most of the tories thought in earnest that it was a sad thing for the country to have an heir to the throne brought up by a roman catholic and to think it right to treat his subjects as james was treating them  some would have been patient and have believed that god would bring it right but others were resolved to put a stop to the evils they expected and knowing what was the state of peoples minds william of orange set forth from holland and landed at torbay crowds of people came to meet him and to call on him  it was only three years since the bloody assize and they had not forgotten it in those parts  king james heard that one person after another had gone to the prince of orange and he thought it not safe for his wife and child to be any longer in england  so quietly one night he put them in charge of a french nobleman who had been visiting him and who took them to the thames where after waiting in the dark under a church wall he brought them a boat and they reached a ship which took them safely to france  king james staid a little longer  he did not mind when he heard that prince george of denmark had gone to the prince of orange but only laughed and said est il possible but when he heard his daughter anne to whom he had always been kind was gone too the tears came into his eyes and he said god help me my own children are deserting me  he would have put himself at the head of the army but he found that if he did so he was likely to be made prisoner and carried to william  so he disguised himself and set off for france but at faversham some people who took him for a roman catholic priest seized him and he was sent back to london  however as there was nothing the prince of orange wished so little as to keep him in captivity he was allowed to escape again and this time he safely reached france where he was very kindly welcomed and had the palace of st germain given him for a dwellingplace  it was on the 4th of november 1688 that william landed and the change that now took place is commonly called the english revolution  we must think of the gentlemen during these reigns as going about in very fine laced and ruffled coats and the most enormous wigs you know the roundheads had short hair and the cavaliers long so people were ashamed to have short hair and wore wigs to hide it if it would not grow till everybody came to have shaven heads and monstrous wigs in great curls on their shoulders and even little boys hair was made to look as like a wig as possible  the barber had the wig every morning to fresh curl and make it white with hair powder so that everyone might look like an old man with a huge quantity of white hair     chapter xxxix  william iii and mary ii  16891702   when james ii proved to be entirely gone the parliament agreed to offer the crown to william of orangethe next heir after jamess childrenand mary his wife jamess eldest daughter but not until there had been new conditions made which would prevent the kings from ever being so powerful again as they had been since the time of henry vii  remember magna carta under king john gave the power to the nobles  they lost it by the wars of the roses and the tudor kings gained it but the stuart kings could not keep it and the house of commons became the strongest power in the kingdom by the revolution of 1688  the house of commons is made up of persons chosenwhenever there is a general electionby the men who have a certain amount of property in each county and large town  there must be a fresh election or choosing again every seven years also whenever the sovereign dies and the sovereign can dissolve the parliamentthat is break it up and have a fresh election whenever it is thought right  but above the house of commons stands the house of lords or peers  these are not chosen but the eldest son or next heir of each lord succeeds to his seat upon his death and fresh peerages are given as rewards to great generals great lawyers or people who have deserved well of their country  when a law has to be made it has first to be agreed to by a majoritythat is the larger numberof the commons then by a majority of the lords and lastly by the king or queen  the sovereigns council are called the ministers and if the houses of parliament do not approve of their way of carrying on the government they vote against their proposals and this generally makes them resign that others may be chosen in their place who may please the country better  this arrangement has gone on ever since william and mary came in however james ii still had many friends only they had been out of reach at the first alarm  the latin word for james is jacobus and therefore they were called jacobites  all roman catholics were of course jacobites and there were other persons who though grieved at the kings conduct did not think it right to rise against him and drive him away and having taken an oath to obey him held that it would be wrong to swear obedience to anyone else while he was alive  archbishop sancroft was one of these  he thought it wrong in the new queen mary to consent to take her fathers place and when she sent to ask his blessing he told her to ask her fathers first as without that his own would do her little good  neither he nor bishop ken nor some other bishops nor a good many more of the clergy would take the oaths to william or put his name instead of that of james in the prayers at church  they rather chose to be turned out of their bishoprics and parishes and to live in poverty they were called the nonjurors or notswearers  louis king of france tried to send james back and gave him the service of his fleet but it was beaten by admiral russell off cape la hogue  poor james could not help crying out see my brave english sailors  one of charless old officers lord dundee raised an army of scots in jamess favor but he was killed just as he had won the battle of killicrankie and there was no one to take up the cause just then and the scotch whigs were glad of the change  most of jamess friends the roman catholics were in ireland and louis lent him an army with which to go thither and try to win his crown back  he got on pretty well in the south but in the north where oliver cromwell had given lands to many of his old soldiers he met with much more resistance  at londonderry the apprentice boys shut the gates of the town and barred them against him  a clergyman named george walker took the command of the city and held it out for a hundred and five days against him till everyone was nearly starved to deathand at last help came from england  william himself came to ireland and the father and soninlaw met in battle on the banks of the boyne on the 1st of july 1690  james was routed and large numbers of the irish protestants have ever since kept the 1st of july as a great holidaycommemorating the victory by wearing orange lilies and orangecolored scarfs  james was soon obliged to leave ireland and his friends there were severely punished  in the meantime william was fighting the french in hollandas he had done nearly all his lifewhile mary governed the kingdom at home  she was a handsome stately lady and was much respected and there was great grief when she died of the smallpox never having had any children  it was settled upon this that william should go on reigning as long as he lived and then that princess anne should be queen and if she left no children that the next after her should be the youngest daughter of elizabeth daughter of james i  her name was sophia and she was married to ernest of brunswick elector of hanover  it was also settled that no roman catholic nor even anyone who married a roman catholic could ever be on the english throne  most of the tories disliked this act of settlement and nobody had much love for king william who was a thin spare man with a large hooked nose and very rough sharp mannersperhaps the more sharp because he was never in good health and suffered terribly from the asthma  however he managed to keep all the countries under him in good order and he was very active and always at war with the french towards the end of his reign a fresh quarrel began in which all europe took part  the king of spain died without children and the question was who should reign after him  the king of france had married one sister of this king and the emperor of germany was the son of her aunt  one wanted to make his grandson king of spain the other his son and so there was a great war  william iii took part against the frenchas he had always been their enemy but just as the war was going to begin as he was riding near his palace of hampton court his horse trod into a molehill and he fell breaking his collar bone and this hurt his weak chest so much that he died in a few days in the year 1702  the jacobites were very glad to be rid of him and used to drink the health of the little gentleman in a black velvet coat meaning the mole which had caused his death     chapter xl  anne  ad 17021714   queen anne the second daughter of james ii began to reign on the death of william iii  she was a wellmeaning woman but very weak and silly and any person who knew how to manage her could make her have no will of her own  the person who had always had such power over her has sarah jennings a lady in her train who had married an officer named john churchill  as this gentleman had risen in the army he proved to be one of the most able generals who ever lived he was made a peer and step by step came to be duke of marlborough it was he and his wife who being whigs had persuaded anne to desert her father and now she was queen she did just as they pleased the duchess was mistress of the robes and more queen at home than anne was and the duke commanded the army which was sent to fight against the french to decide who should be king of spain  an expedition was sent to spain which gained the rock of gibraltar and this has been kept by the english ever since  never were there greater victories than were gained by the english and german forces together under the duke of marlborough and prince eugene of savoy who commanded the emperors armies  the first and greatest battle of them all was fought at blenheim in bavaria when the french were totally defeated with great loss  marlborough was rewarded by the queen and nation buying an estate for him which was called blenheim where woods were planted so as to imitate the position of his army before the battle and a grand house built and filled with pictures recording his adventures  the other battles were all in the low countriesat ramillies oudenard and malplaquet the city of lisle was taken after a long siege and not a summer went by without tidings coming of some great victory and the queen going in a state coach to st pauls cathedral to return thanks for it  but all this glory of her husband made the duchess of marlborough more proud and overbearing  she thought the queen could not do without her and so she left off taking any trouble to please her nay she would sometimes scold her more rudely than any real lady would do to any woman however much below her in rank  sometimes she brought the poor queen to tears and on the day on which anne went in state to st pauls to return thanks for the victory of oudenarde she was seen to be crying all the way from st jamess palace in her coach with the six creamcolored horses because the duchess had been scolding her for putting on her jewels in the way she liked best instead of in the duchesss way  now duchess sarah had brought to the palace to help to wait on the queen a poor cousin of her own named abigail masham a much more smooth and gentle person but rather deceitful  when the mistress of the robes was unkind and insolent the queen used to complain to mrs masham and byandby abigail told her how to get free  there was a gentleman well known to mrs mashammr harley a member of parliament and a tory and she brought him in by the back stairs to see the queen without the duchess knowing it  he undertook if the queen would stand by him to be her minister and to turn out the churchills and their whig friends send away the tyrant duchess and make peace so that the duke might not be wanted any more  in fact the war had gone on quite long enough the power of the king of france was broken and he was an old man whom it was cruel to press further but this was not what anne cared about so much as getting free of the duchess  there was great anger and indignation among all the whigs at the breaking off the war in the midst of so much glory and besides the nation did not keep its engagements to the others with whom it had allied itself  marlborough himself was not treated as a man deserved who had won so much honor for his country and he did not keep his health many years after his fall  once when he felt his mind getting weak he looked up at his own picture at blenheim taken when he was one of the handsomest most able and active men in europe and said sadly ah that was a man  mr harley was made earl of oxford and managed the queens affairs for her  he and the tories did not at all like the notion of the german family of brunswicksophia and her son georgewho were to reign next and they allowed the queen to look towards her own family a little more  her father had died in exile but there remained the young brother whom she had disowned and whom the french and the jacobites called king james iii  if he would have joined the english church anne would have gladly invited him and many of the english would have owned him as the right king but he was too honest to give up his faith and the queen could do nothing for him  till her time the scotsthough since james i they had been under the same king as englandhad had a separate parliament lords and commons who sat at edinburgh but in the reign of queen anne the scottish parliament was united to the english one and the members of it had to come to westminster  this made many scotsmen so angry that they became jacobites but as every body knew that the queen was a gentle wellmeaning old lady nobody wished to disturb her and all was quiet as long as she lived so that her reign was an unusually tranquil one at home though there were such splendid victories abroad  it was a time too when there were almost as many able writers as in queen elizabeths time  the two books written at that day which you are most likely to have heard of are robinson crusoe written by daniel defoe and alexander popes translation of homers iliad  annes tory friends did not make her happy they used to quarrel among themselves and frightened her and after one of their disputes she had an attack of apoplexy and soon died of it in the year 1714  it was during annes reign that it became the fashion to drink tea and coffee  one was brought from china and the other from arabia not very long before and they were very dear indeed  the ladies used to drink tea out of little cups of eggshell china and the clever gentlemen who were called the wits used to meet and talk at coffeehouses and read newspapers and discuss plays and poems also the first magazine was then begun  it was called the spectator and was managed by mr addison  it came out once a week and laughed at or blamed many of the foolish and mischievous habits of the time  indeed it did much to draw people out of the bad ways that had come in with charles ii     chapter xli  george i  ad 17141725   the electress sophia who had always desired to be queen of england had died a few months before queen anne and her son george who liked his own german home much better than the trouble of reigning in a strange country was in no hurry to come and waited to see whether the english would not prefer the young james stuart  but as no james arrived george set off rather unwillingly and was received in london in a dull kind of way  he hardly knew any english and was obliged sometimes to talk bad latin and sometimes french when he consulted with his ministers  he did not bring a queen with him for he had quarreled with his wife and shut her up in a castle in germany but he had a son also named george who had a very clever handsome wife caroline of anspach a german princess but the king was jealous of them and generally made them live abroad  just when it was too late and george i had thoroughly settled into his kingdom the jacobites in the north of england and in scotland began to make a stir and invited james stuart over to try to gain the kingdom  the jacobites used to call him james iii but the whigs called him the pretender and the tories used by way of a middle course to call him the chevalierthe french word for a knight as that he certainly was whether he were king or pretender  a white rose was the jacobite mark and the whigs still held to the orange lily and orange ribbon for the sake of william of orange  the jacobite rising did not come to any good  two battles were fought between the kings troops and the jacobitesone in england and the other in scotlandon the very same day  the scottish one was at sheriffmuir and was so doubtful that the old scottish song about it ran thus                          some say that we won                        and some say the they won                        some say that none won                             at a man                         but of one thing im sure                        that at sheriffmuir                        a battle there was                                which i saw man                         and we ran and they ran                        and they ran and we ran                        and we ran and they ran                                awa man   the english one was at preston and in it the jacobites were all defeated and made prisoners so that when their friend the chevalier landed in scotland he found that nothing could be done and had to go back again to italy where he generally lived under the popes protection and where he married a polish princess and had two sons whom he named charles edward and henry  this rising of the jacobites took place in the year 1715 and is therefore generally called the rebellion of the fifteen  the chief noblemen who were engaged in it were taken to london to be tried three were beheaded one was saved upon his wifes petition and one the earl of nithsdale by the cleverness of his wife  she was allowed to go and see him in the tower and she took a tall lady in with her who contrived to wear a double set of outer garments  the friend went away after a time and then after waiting till the guard was changed lady nithsdale dressed her husband in the clothes that had been brought in and he too went away with the hood over his face and a handkerchief up to his eyes so that the guard might take him for the other lady crying bitterly at parting with the earl  the wife meantime remained for some time talking and walking up and down as heavily as she could till the time came when she would naturally be obliged to leave himwhen as she passed by his servant she said to him that my lord will not be ready for the candles just yetand then left the tower and went to a little lodging in a back street where she found her husband and where they both lay hid while the search for lord nithsdale was going on and where they heard the knell tolling when his friends the other lords were being led out to have their heads cut off  afterwards they made their escape to france where most of the jacobites who had been concerned in the rising were living as best they could on small meansand some of them by becoming soldiers of the king of france  england was prosperous in the time of george i and the possessions of the country in india were growing from a merchants factory here and there to large lands and towns  but the english never liked king george nor did he like them and he generally spent his time in his own native country of hanover  he was taking a drive there in his coach when a letter was thrown in at the window  as he was reading it a sudden stroke of apoplexy came on and he died in a few hours time  no one ever knew what was in the letter but some thought it was a letter reproaching him with his cruelty to his poor wife who had died in her prison about eight months before  he died in the year 1725  gentlemen were leaving off fullbottomed wigs now and wearing smaller ones and younger men had their own hair powdered and tied up with ribbon in a long tail behind called a queue  ladies powdered their hair and raised it to an immense height and also wore monstrous hoops long ruffles and highheeled shoes  another odd fashion was that ladies put black patches on their faces thinking they made them handsomer  both ladies and gentlemen took snuff and carried beautiful snuffboxes     chapter xlii  george ii  ad 17251760   the reign of george ii was a very warlike one  indeed he was the last king of england who ever was personally in a battle and curiously enough this battlethat of fontenoywas the last that a king of france also was present in  it was however not a very interesting battle and it was not clear who really won it nor are wars of this time very easy to understand  the battle of fontenoy was fought in the course of a great war to decide who would be emperor of germany in which france and england took different sides and this made charles edward stuart the eldest son of james think it was a good moment for trying once again to get back the crown of his forefathers  he was a finelooking young man with winning manners and a great deal more spirit than his father and when he landed in scotland with a very few followers one highland gentleman after another was so delighted with him that they all brought their clans to join him and he was at the head of quite a large force with which he took possession of the town of edinburgh but he never could take the castle  the english army was most of it away fighting in germany and the soldiers who met him at prestonpans close to edinburgh were not well managed and were easily beaten by the highlanders  then he marched straight on into england and there was great terror for the highlanderswith their plaids long swords and strange languagewere thought to be all savage robbers and the londoners expected to have every house and shop ruined and themselves murdered though on the whole the highlanders behaved very well  they would probably have really entered london if they had gone on and reached it before the army could come home but they grew discontented and frightened at being so far away from their own hills and at derby charles edward was obliged to let them turn back to scotland  the english army had come back by this time and the scots were followed closely getting more sad and forlorn and losing men in every days march till at last after they had reached scotland again they made a stand against the english under the kings second son william duke of cumberland at the heath of culloden  there they were entirely routed and the prince had to fly and hide himself in strange places and disguises much as his great uncle charles ii had done before him  a young lady named flora macdonald took him from one of the western isles to another in a boat as her irish maid betty bourke and at another time he was his in a sort of bower called the cage woven of branches of trees on a hill side where he lived with three highlanders who used to go out by turns to get food  one of them once brought him a piece of gingerbread as a treatfor they loved him heartily for being patient cheerful and thankful for all they did for him and when at last he found a way of reaching france and shook hands with them on bidding the farewell one of them tied up his right hand and vowed that no meaner person should ever touch it  the empress maria theresa of germany had a long war with frederick king of prussia who was nephew to george ii and a very clever and brave man who made his little kingdom of prussia very warlike and brave  but he was not a very good man and these were sad times among the great people for few of them thought much about being good and there were clever frenchmen who laughed at all religion  you know one of the psalms the fool hath said in his heart there is no god there were a great many such fools at that time and their ways together with the selfishness of the nobles soon brought terrible times to france and all the countries round  the wars under george ii were by sea as well as by land and likewise in the distant countries where englishmen on the one hand and frenchmen on the other had made those new homes that we call colonies  in north america both english and french had large settlements and when the kings at home were at war there were likewise battles in these distant parts and the indians were stirred up to take part with the one side or the other  they used to attack the homes of the settlers burn them kill and torment the men and keep the children to bring up among their own  the english had in general the advantage especially in canada where the brave young general wolfe led an attack on the very early morning to the heights of abraham close to the town of quebec  he was struck down by a shot early in the fight and lay on the ground with a few officers round him  they run they run he heard them cry  who run he asked  the french run  then i die happy he said and it was by this battle that england won lower canada with many french inhabitants whose descendants still speak their old language  in the east indies too there was much fighting  the english and french both had merchants there and these had native soldiers to guard them and made friends with the native princes  when these princes quarreled they helped them and so obtained a larger footing but in this reign the english power was nearly ended in a very sad way  an indian army came suddenly down on calcutta  many english got on board the ships but those who could not146 in numberwere shut up all night in a small room in the hottest time of the year and they were so crushed together and suffocated by the heat that when the morning came there were only twentythree of them alive this dreadful place was known as the black hole of calcutta  the next year calcutta was won back again and the english under colonel clive gained so much ground that the french had no power left in india and the english could go on obtaining more and more land riches and power  george ii had lost his eldest son frederick prince of wales and his lively and clever wife queen caroline many years before his death  his chief ministers were first sir robert walpole and afterwards the earl of chathamable men who knew how to manage the country through all these wars  the king died at last quite suddenly when sixtyeight years old in the year 1760     chapter xliii  george iii  ad 17601785   after george ii reigned his grandson george iii the son of frederick prince of wales who had died before his father  the princess of wales was a good woman who tried to bring up her children well and george iii was a dutiful son to her and a good faithful manalways caring more to do right than for anything else he had been born in england and did not feel as if hanover were his home as his father and grandfather had done but loved england and english people and ways  when he was at windsor he used to ride or walk about like a country squire and he had a ruddy hearty face and manner that made him sometimes be called farmer george and he had an odd way of saying what what when he was spoken to which made him be laughed at but he was as good and true as any man who ever lived and when he thought a thing was right he was as firm as a rock in holding to it  he married a german princess named charlotte and they did their utmost to make all those about them good  they had a very large familyno less than fourteen childrenand some old people still remember what a beautiful sight it was when after church on sunday the king and queen and their children used to walk up and down the stately terrace at windsor castle with a band playing and everyone who was respectably dressed allowed to come in and look at them  just after george iii came to the crown a great war broke out in the english colonies in america  a new tax had been made  a tax means the money that has to be given to the government of a country to pay the judges and their officers the soldiers and sailors to keep up ships and buy weapons and do all that is wanted to protect us and keep us in order  taxes are sometimes made by calling on everybody to pay money in proportion to what they havesay threepence for every hundred pounds sometimes they are made by putting what is called a duty on something that is bought and soldmaking it sell for more than its natural priceso that the government gets the money above the right cost  this is generally done with things that people could live without and had better not buy too much ofsuch as spirits tobacco and hair powder  and as tea was still a new thing in england which only fine ladies drank it was thought useless and there was a heavy duty laid upon it when the king wanted money  now the americans got their tea straight from china and thought it was unfair that they should pay tax on it  so though they used it much more than the english then did they gave it up threw whole shiploads of it into the harbor at boston and resisted the soldiers  a gentleman named george washington took the command and they declared they would fight for freedom from the mother country  the french were beginning to think freedom was a fine thing and at first a few french gentlemen came over to fight among the americans and then the king louis xvi quarreled with george iii and helped them openly  there was a very clever man among the americans named benjamin franklin a printer by trade but who made very curious discoveries one of them was that lightning comes from the strange power men call electricity and that there are some substances which it will run along so that it came be brought down to the ground without doing any mischiefespecially metallic wires  he made sure of it by flying a kite with such an iron wire up to the clouds when there was a thunder storm  the lightning was attracted by the wire ran down the wet string of the kite and only glanced off when it came to a silk ribbon because electricity will not go along silk  after this such wires were fastened to buildings and carried down into the ground to convey away the force of the lightning  perhaps you have seen them on the tops of churches or tall buildings they are called conductors franklin was a plainspoken homely dressing man and when he was sent to paris on the affairs of the americans all the great ladies and gentlemen went into raptures about his beautiful simplicity and began to imitate him in a very affected ridiculous way  in the meantime the war went on between america and england year after year and the americans became trained soldiers and got the better so that george iii was advised to give up his rights over them  old lord chatham his grandfathers minister who had long been too sick and feeble to undertake any public business thought it so bad for the country to give anything up that he came down to the house of lords to make a speech against doing so but he was not strong enough for the exertion and had only just done speaking when he fainted away and his son william pitt was called out of the house of commons to help carry him away to his coach  he was taken home and died in a few days time  the war went on but when it had lasted seven years the english felt that peace must be made and so george iii gave up his rights to all that country that is called the united states of america  the united states set up a government of their own which has gone on ever since without a king but with a president who is freshly chosen every four years and for whom every citizen has a vote  as if to make up for what was lost in the west the english were winning a great deal in the east indies chiefly from a great prince called tipoo sahib who was very powerful and at one time took a number of english officers prisoners and drove them to his city of seringapatam chained together in pairs and kept them half starved in a prison where several died but he was defeated and killed they were set free by their countrymen after nearly two years of grievous hardship     chapter xliv  george iii  ad 17851810   the chief sorrow of george iii was that his eldest sons were wild disobedient young men  george prince of wales especially was very handsome and extremely proud of his own beauty  he was called the first gentleman in europe and set the fashion in every matter of taste but he spent and wasted money to a shameful amount and was full of bad habits besides which he used to set himself in every way in his power to vex and contradict his father and mother whom he despised for their plain simple ways and their love of duty the next two brothersfrederick duke of york and william duke of clarencehad also very bad habits but they went astray from carelessness and did not wilfully oppose their father like their eldest brother  william pitt son of lord chatham was prime minister  he thought that the roman catholics in england ought to have the same rights as the kings other subjects and not be hindered from being members of parliament judges or indeed from holding any office and he wanted to bring a bill into parliament for this purpose  but the king thought that for him to consent would be contrary to the oath he had sworn when he was crowned and which had been drawn up when william of orange came over  nothing would make george iii break his word and he remained firm though he was so harassed and distressed that he fell ill and lost the use of his reason for a time  there were questions whether the regencythat is the right to act as king should be given to the son who though his heir was so unlike him when he recovered and there was a great day of joy throughout the nation when he went in state to st pauls cathedral to return thanks  in the meantime terrible troubles were going on in france  neither the kings nor nobles had for ages past any notion of their proper duties to people under them but had ground them down so hard that at last they could bear it no longer and there was a great rising up throughout the country which is known as the french revolution  the king who was then reigning was a good and kind man louis xvi who would gladly have put things in better order but he was not as wise or firm as he was good and the people hated him for the evil doings of his forefathers  so while he was trying to make up his mind what to do the power was taken out of his hands and he with his wife sister and two children were shut up in prison  an evil spirit came into the people and made them believe that the only way to keep themselves free would be to get rid of all who had been great people in the former days  so they set up a machine for cutting off heads called the guillotine and there day after day nobles and priests gentlemen and ladieseven the king queen and princess were brought and slain  the two children were not guillotined but the poor little boy only nine years old was worse off than if he had been for the cruel wretches who kept him called him the wolfcub and said he was to be got rid of and they kept him alone in a dark dirty room and used him so ill that he pined to death  many french gentry and clergymen fled to england and there were kindly treated and helped to live and the kings brother now the rightful king himself found a home there too  at last the french grew weary of this horrible bloodshed but as they could not manage themselves a soldier named napoleon bonaparte by his great cleverness and the victories he gained over other nations succeeded in getting all the power  his victories were wonderful  he beat the germans the italians the russians and conquered wherever he went  there was only one nation he never could beat and that was the english though he very much wanted to have come over here with a great fleet and army and have conquered our island  all over england people got ready  all the men learnt something of how to be soldiers and made themselves into regiments of volunteers and careful watch was kept against the quantities of flatbottomed boats that bonaparte had made ready to bring his troops across the english channel  but no one had ships and sailors like the english and besides they had the greatest seacaptain who ever lived whose name was horatio nelson when the french went under napoleon to try to conquer egypt and all the east nelson went after them with his ships and beat the whole french fleet though it was a great deal larger than his own at the mouth of the nile blowing up the admirals ship and taking or burning many more  afterward when the king of denmark was being made to take part against england nelsons fleet sailed to copenhagen fought a sharp battle and took all the danish ships  and lastly when spain had made friends with france and both their fleets had joined together against england lord nelson fought them both off cape trafalgar and gained the greatest of all his victories but it was his last for a frenchman on the masthead shot him through the backbone and he died the same night  no one should ever forget the order he gave to all his sailors in all the ships before the battle england expects every man to do his duty  after the battle of trafalgar the sea was cleared of the enemys ships and there was no more talk of invading england  indeed though bonaparte overran nearly all the continent of europe the smallest strip of sea was enough to stop him for his ships could not stand before the english ones  all this time english affairs were managed by mr pitt lord chathams son but he died the very same year as lord nelson was killed 1805 and then his great rival mr fox was minister in his stead but he too died very soon and affairs were managed by less clever men but who were able to go on in the line that pitt had marked out for them and that was of standing up with all their might against bonaparte though he now called himself the emperor napoleon i and was treading down every country in europe  the war time was a hard one at home in england for everything was very dear and the taxes were high but everyone felt that the only way to keep the french away was to go on fighting with them and trying to help the people in the countries they seized upon  so the whole country stood up bravely against them  sad trouble came on the good old king in his later years  he lost his sight and about the same time died his youngest child the princess amelia of whom he was very fond  his grief clouded his mind again and there was no recovery this time  he was shut up in some rooms at windsor castle where he had music to amuse him and his good wife queen charlotte watched over him carefully as long as she lived     chapter xlv  george iiithe regency  ad 18101820   when george iii lost his senses the government was given to his son the prince of walesthe prince regent as he was called  regent means a person ruling instead of the king  everyone expected that as he had always quarreled with his father he would change everything and have different ministers but instead of that he went on just as had been done before fighting with the french and helping every country that tried to lift up its head against bonaparte  spain was one of these countries  napoleon had managed to get the king and queen and eldest son all into his hands together shut them up as prisoners in france and made his own brother king  but the spaniards were too brave to bear this and they rose up against him calling the english to help them  sir john moore was sent first and he marched an army into spain but though the spaniards were brave they were not steady and when napoleon sent more troops he was obliged to march back over the steep hills covered with snow to corunna where he had left the ships  the french followed him and he had to fight a battle to drive them back that his soldiers might embark in quiet  it was a great victory but in the midst of it sir john moore was wounded by a cannon shot and only live long enough to hear that the battle was won  he was buried at the dead of night on the ramparts of corunna wrapped in his cloak  however before the year was over sir arthur wellesley was sent out to portugal and spain  he never once was beaten and though twice he had had to retreat into portugal he soon won back the ground he had lost and in three years time he had driven the french quite out of spain and even crossed the pyrenean mountains after them forcing them back into their own country and winning the battle of toulouse on their own ground  this grand war had more victories in it than you will easily remember  the chief of them were at salamanca vittoria orthes and toulouse and the whole war was called the peninsular war because it was fought in the peninsular of france and spain  sir arthur wellesley had been made duke of wellington to reward him and he set off across france to meet the armies of the other european countries  for while the english were fighting in spain the other states of europe had all joined together against napoleon and driven him away from robbing them and hunted him at last to paris where they made him give up all his unlawful power the right king of france louis xviii was brought home and napoleon was sent to a little island named elba in the mediterranean sea where it was thought he could do no harm  but only the next year he managed to escape and came back to france where all his old soldiers were delighted to see him again  the king was obliged to fly and napoleon was soon at the head of as large and fierce an army as ever  the first countries that were ready to fight with him were england and prussia  the duke of wellington with the english and marshal blucher with the prussian army met him on the field of waterloo in belgium and there he was so entirely defeated that he had to flee away from the field  but he found no rest or shelter anywhere and at last was obliged to give himself up to the captain of an english ship named the bellerophon  he was taken to plymouth harbor and kept in the ship while it was being determined what should be done with him and at length it was decided to send him to st helena a very lonely island far away in the atlantic ocean whence he would have no chance of escaping  there he was kept for five years at the end of which time he died  the whole of europe was at peace again but the poor old blind king george did not know it nor how much times had changed in his long reign  the war had waked people up from the dull state they had been in so long and much was going on that began greater changes than anyone thought of  sixty years before when he began to reign the roads were so bad that it took three days to go by coach to london from bath now they were smooth and good and fine swift horses were kept at short stages which made the coaches take only a few hours on the journey  letters came much quicker and more safely there were a great many newspapers and everybody was more alive  some great writers there were too the scottish poet walter scott who wrote some of the most delightful tales there are in the world and three who lived at the lakeswordsworth southey and coleridge  it was only in this reign that people cared to write books for children mrs trimmer and another good lady called hannah more were trying to get the poor in the villages better taught and there was a very good yorkshire gentlemanwilliam wilberforcewho was striving to make people better  as to peoples looks in those days they had left off wigsexcept bishops judges and lawyers in their robes  men had their hair short and curly and wore coats shaped like evening onesgenerally blue with brass buttonsbuff waistcoats and tight trousers tucked into their boots tight stocks round their necks and monstrous shirt frills  ladies had their gowns and pelisses made very shortwaisted and as tight and narrow as they could be though with enormous sleeves in them and their hair in little curls on their foreheads old ladies wore turbans in evening dress and both they and their daughters had immense bonnets and hats with a high crown and very large front  in the 1820 the good old king passed away     chapter xlvi  george iv  ad 18201830   george iv was not much under sixty years old when he came to the throne and had really been king in all but the name for eight years past  he had been married to the princess caroline of brunswick much against his will for she was though a princess far from being a lady in any of her ways and he disliked her from the first moment he saw her and though he could not quite treat her as henry viii had treated anne of cleves the two were so unhappy together that after the first year they never lived in the same house  they had had one child a daughter named charlottea good bright sensible high spirited girlon whom all the hopes of the country were fixed but as she grew up there were many troubles between her love and her duty towards her father and mother  as soon as the peace was made the princess of wales went to italy and lived there with a great many people of bad characters about her  princess charlotte was married to prince leopold of saxecoburg and was very happy with him but to the great grief of all england she died in the bloom of her youth the year before her grandfather  george iv though he was much alone in the world prepared to have a most splendid coronation but as soon as his wife heard that he was king she set off to come to england and be crowned with him  he was exceedingly angry forbade her name to be put into the prayerbook as queen and called on the house of lords to break his marriage with one who had proved herself not worthy to be a wife  there was a great uproar about it for though the kings friends wanted him to be rid of her all the country knew that he had been no better to her than she had been to him and felt it unfair that the weaker one should have all the shame and disgrace and the stronger one none  one of carolines defenders said that if her name were left out of the litany yet still she was prayed for there as one who was desolate and oppressed  people took up her cause much more hotly than deserved and the king was obliged to give up the enquiry into her behavior but still he would not let her be crowned  in the midst of all the splendor and solemnity in westminster abbey a carriage was driven to the door and entrance was demanded for the queen but she was kept back and the people did not seem disposed to interrupt the show by doing anything in her favor as she and her friends had expected she went back to her rooms and after being more foolish than ever in her ways died of fretting and pining  it is a sad history where both were much to blame and it shows how hateful to the king she must have been that when napoleon died he was told his greatest enemy was dead and he answered when did she die  but if he had been a good man himself and not selfish he would have borne with the poor ill brought up giddy girl when first she came and that would have prevented her going so far astray  george iv made two journeysone to scotland and the other to ireland  he was the first of the house of brunswick who ever visited these other two kingdoms and he was received in both with great splendor and rejoicing but after this his health began to fail and he disliked showing himself  he spent most of his time at a house he had built for himself at brighton called the pavilion and at windsor where he used to drive about in the park  he was kind and gracious to those with whom he associated but they were as few as possible  he was vexed and angry at having to consent to the bill for letting roman catholics sit in parliament and hold other officethe same that his father had stood out against  it was not that he cared for one religion more than another for he had never been a religious man but he saw that it would be the beginning of a great many changes that would alter the whole state of things  his next brother frederick duke of york died before him and the third william duke of clarence who had been brought up as an officer in the navy was a friend of the whigs and of those who were ready to make alterations  changes were coming of themselves thoughfor inventions were making progress in this time of peace  people had begun to find out the great power of steam and had made it move the ships which had hitherto depended upon the winds and thus it became much easier to travel from one country to another and to send goods  steam was also being used to work engines for spinning and weaving cotton linen and wool and for working metals so that what had hitherto been done by hand by small numbers of skilful people was now brought about by large machines where the labor was done by steam but quantities of people were needed to assist the engine  and as steam cannot be had without fire and most of the coal is in the northern parts of england almost all of these works were set up in them and people flocked to get work there so that the towns began to grow very large  manchester was one with liverpool as the seaport from which to send its calico and get its cotton  sheffield and birmingham grew famous for works in iron and steel and so on and all this tended to make the manufacturers as rich and great as the old lords and squires who had held most of the power in england ever since at the revolution they had got it away from the king  everyone saw that some great change would soon come but before it came to the point george iv fell ill and died after a reign of twenty years in reality but of only ten in name the first five of which were spent in war and the last fifteen in peace  the duke of wellington and sir robert peel were his chief ministersfor the duke was as clearheaded in peace as he was in war     chapter xlvii  william iv  ad 18301837   george iv had as you know no child living at the time of his death his next brother frederick duke of york died before him likewise without children so the crown went to william duke of clarence third son of george iii  he had been a sailor in his younger days but was an elderly man when he came to the throne  he was a dull and not a very wise man but goodnatured and kind and had an open friendly sailor manner and his wife queen adelaide of saxe meiningen was an excellent woman whom everyone respected  they never had any children but two daughters who died in infancy and everyone knew that the next heir must be the princess victoria daughter to the next brother edward duke of kent who had died the year after she was born  king william iv had always been friendly with the whigs who wanted power for the people  those who went furthest among them were called radicals because they wanted a radical reformthat is going to the root  in fact it was time to alter the way of sending members to the house of commons for some of the towns that had once been big enough to choose one were now deserted and grown very small while on the other hand others which used to be little villages like birmingham and brighton had now become very large and full of people  the duke of wellington and his friends wanted to consider the best way of setting these things to rights but the radicals wanted to do much more and much faster than he was willing to grant  the poor fancied that the new rights proposed would make them better off all at once and that every man would get a fat pig in his sty and as much bread as he wanted and they were so angry at any delay that they went about in bands burning the hayricks and stacks of corn to frighten their landlords  and the duke of wellingtons great deeds were forgotten in the anger of the mob who gathered round him ready to abuse and pelt him as he rode along and yet as they saw his quiet calm way of going on taking no heed to them and quite fearless no one raised a hand  they broke the windows of his house in london though and he had iron blinds put up to protect them  he went out of office and the whigs came in and then the act of parliament was passed which was called the reform billbecause it set to rights what had gone wrong as to which towns should have members of their own and besides allowed everyone in a borough town who rented a house at ten pounds a year to vote for the member of parliament  a borough is a town that has a member of parliament and a city is one that is large enough to have a mayor and an alderman to manage its affairs at home  several more changes were made under king william  most of the great union workhouses were built then and it was made less easy to get help from the parish without going to live in one  this was meant to cure people of being idle and liking to live on other folks moneyand it has done good in that way but workhouses are sad places for the poor aged people who cannot work and it is a great kindness to help them to keep out of them  the best thing that was done was the setting the slaves free  look at the map of america and you will see a number of islandsbeautiful places where sugarcanes and coffee and spices grow  many of these belong to the english but it is too hot for englishmen to work there so for more than a hundred years there had been a wicked custom that ships should go to africa and there the crews would steal negro men women and children or buy them of tribes of fierce negroes who had made them captive and carry them off to the west indies islands where they were sold to work for their masters just as cattle are bought and sold  an english gentlemanwilliam wilberforceworked half his life to get this horrible slave trade forbidden and at last he succeeded in the year 1807 whilst george iii was still reigning but though no more blacks were brought from africa still the people in the west indies were allowed to keep and buy and sell the slaves they already had  so wilberforce and his friends still worked on until the time of william iv when in 1834 all the slaves in the british dominions were set free  this reign only lasted seven years and there were no wars in it so the only other thing that i have to tell you about it is that people had gone on from finding that steam could be made to work their ships to making it draw carriages  railways were being made for trains of carriages and vans to be drawn by one steam engine  the oldest of all was opened in 1830 the very year that william iv began to reign and that answered so well that more and more began to be made and the whole country to be covered with a network of railways so the people and goods could be carried about much quicker than ever was dreamt of in old times while steamships were made larger and larger and to go greater distances  besides this many people in england found there was not work or food enough for them at home and went to settle in canada and australia and van diemans land and new zealand making in all these distant places the new english homes called colonies and thus there have come to be english people wherever the sun shines  william iv died in the year 1837  he was the last english king who had the german state of hanover  it cannot belong to a woman so it went to his brother ernest instead of his niece victoria     chapter xlviii  victoria  ad 18371855   the princess victoria daughter of the duke of kent was but eighteen years old when she was queen of england  she went with her mother the duchess of kent to live sometimes at buckingham palace and sometimes at windsor castle and the next year she was crowned in state at westminster abbey  everyone saw then how kind she was for when one of the lords who was very old stumbled on the steps as he came to pay her homage she sprang up from her throne to help him  three years later she was married to prince albert of saxecoburg a most excellent men who made it his whole business to help her in all her duties as sovereign of the great country without putting himself forward  nothing ever has been more beautiful than the way those two behaved to one another she never forgetting that he was her husband and she only his wife and he always remembering that she was really the queen and that he had no power at all  he had a clear head and good judgment that everyone trusted to and yet he always kept himself in the background that the queen might have all the credit of whatever was done  he took much pains to get all that was good and beautiful encouraged and to turn peoples minds to doing things not only in the quickest and cheapest but in the best and most beautiful way possible  one of these plans that he carried out was to set up what he called an international exhibition namelya great building to which every country was invited to send specimens of all its arts and manufactures it was called the worlds fair  the house was of glass and was a beautiful thing in itself  it was opened on the 1st of may 1851 and though there have been many great international exhibitions since not one has come up to the first  people talked as if the worlds fair was to make all nations friends but it is not showing off their laces and their silks their ironwork and brass their pictures and statues that can keep them at peace and only two years after the great exhibition a great war broke out in europeonly a year after the great duke of wellington had died full of years and honors  the only country in europe that is not christian is turkey and the russians have always greatly wished to conquer turkey and join it on to their great empire  the turks have been getting less powerful for a long time past and finding it harder to govern the country and one day the emperor of russia asked the english ambassador sir hamilton seymour if he did not think the turkish power a very sick man who would soon be dead  sir hamilton seymour knew what this meant and he knew the english did not think it right that the russians should drive out the sultan of turkeyeven though he is not a christian so he made the emperor understand that if the sick man did die it would not be for want of doctors  neither the english nor the french could bear that the russians should get so much power as they would have if they gained all the countries down to the mediterranean sea so as soon as ever the russians began to attack the turks the english and french armies were sent to defend them and they found the best way of doing this was to go and fight the russians in their own country namelythe crimea the peninsula which hangs as it were down into the black sea  so in the autumn of the year 1854 the english and french armies under lord raglan and marshal st arnaud were landed in the crimea where they gained a great victory on their first landing called the battle of the alma and then besieged the city of sebastopol  it was a very long siege and in the course of it the two armies suffered sadly from the cold and damp and there was much illness but a brave english lady named florence nightingale went out with a number of nurses to take care of the sick and wounded and thus she saved a great many lives  there were two more famous battles  one was when six hundred english horsemen were sent by mistake against a whole battery of russian cannon and rode on as bravely as if they were not seeing their comrades shot down till scarcely half were left  this was called the charge of balaklava  the other battle was when the russians crept out late in the evening of november 5 to attack the english camp and there was a dreadful fight by night and in the early morning on the heights of inkerman but at last the english won the battle and gave the day a better honor that it had had before  then came a terrible winter of watching the city and firing at the walls and when at last on the 18th of june 1855 it was assaulted the defenders beat the attack off and lord raglan worn out with care and vexation died a few days after  however soon another attack was made and in september half the city was won  the emperor of russia had died during the war and his son made peace on condition that sebastopol should not be fortified again and that the russians should let the turks alone and keep no fleet in the black sea  in this war news flew faster than ever it had done before  you heard how benjamin franklin found that electricitythat strange power of which lightning is the visible signcould be carried along upon metal wire  it has since been made out how to make the touch of a magnet at one end of these wires make the other end move so that letters can be pointed to words spelt out and messages sent to any distance with really the speed of lightning  this is the wonderful electric telegraph of which you see the wires upon the railway     chapter xlix  victoria  ad 18571860   peace had been made after the crimean war and everybody hoped it was going to last when very sad news came from india  you know i told you the english people had gone to live in india and had gradually gained more and more lands there so that they were making themselves rulers and governors over all that great country  they had some of the regiments of the english army to help them to keep up their power and a great many soldiers besideshindoos or natives of india who had english officers and were taught to fight in the english manner these hindoo soldiers were called sepoys  they were not christians but were some of them mahommedans and some believed in the strange religion of india which teached people to believe in a great many godssome of them very savage and cruel ones according to their stories and which forbids them many very simple things  one of the things it forbids is the killing a cow or touching beef or any part of it  now it seems the sepoys had grown discontented with the english and besides that there came out a new sort of cartridgethat is little parcels of powder and shot with which to load firearms  the sepoys took it into their heads that these cartridges had grease in them taken from cows and that it was a trick on the part of the english to make them break the rules of their religion and force them to become christians  in their anger they made a conspiracy together and in many of the places in india they then suddenly turned upon their english officers and shot them down on their parade ground and then they went to the houses and killed every white woman and child they could meet with  some few had very wonderful escapes and were treated kindly by native friends and many showed great bravery and piety in their troubles  after that the sepoys marched away to the city of delhi where an old man lived who had once been king and they set him up to be king while every english person left in the city was murdered  the english regiments in india made haste to come into bengal to try to save their countryfolk who had shut themselves up in the towns or strong places and were being besieged there by the sepoys  a great many were in barracks in cawnpore  it was not a strong place and only had a mud wall round but there was a native prince called the nana sahib who had always seemed a friend to the officershad gone out hunting with them and invited them to his house  they thought themselves safe near him but to their horror he forgot all this and joined the sepoys  the cannon were turned against them and the sepoys watched all day the barrack yard where they were shut in and shot everyone who went for water  at last after more pain and misery than we can bear to think of they gave themselves up to the nana and horrible to tell he killed them all  the men were shot the first day and the women and little children were then shut up in a house where they were kept for a night  then the nana heard that the english army was coming and in his fright and rage he sent in his men who killed everyone of them and threw their bodies into a deep well  the english came up the next day and were nearly mad with grief and anger  they could not lay hands on the nana but they punished all the people he employed and they were so furious that they hardly showed any mercy to another sepoy after that dreadful sight  there were some more english holding out in the city of lucknow and they longed to go to their relief but first delhi where the old king was had to be taken and as it was a very strong place it was a long time before it was conquered but at last the gates of the city were blown up by three brave men and the whole army made their way in  more troops had been sent out from england to help their comrades and they were able at last to march to lucknow  there week after week the english soldiers men of business ladies soldiers wives and little children had bravely waited with the enemy round and shot so often coming through the buildings that they had chiefly to live in the cellars and the food was so scanty and bad that the sickly people and the little babies mostly died and no one seemed able to get well if once he was wounded  help came at last  the brave sir colin campbell who had been sent out from home brought the army to their rescue and they were saved  the sepoys were beaten in every fight and at last the terrible time of the mutiny was over and india quiet again  in 1860 the queen and all the nation had a grievous loss in the death of the good prince consort albert who died of a fever at windsor castle and was mourned for by everyone as if he had been a relation or friend  he left nine children of whom the eldest victoria the princess royal was married to the prince of prussia  he had done everything to help forward improvements and the country only found out how wise and good he was after he was taken away  pains began to be taken to make the great towns healthier  it is true that the plague has never come to england since the reign of charles ii but those sad diseases cholera and typhus fever come where people will not attend to cleanliness  the first time the cholera came was in the year 1833 under william iv and that was the last time of all because it was a new disease and the doctors did not know what to do to cure it  but now they understand it much betterboth how to treat and what is better how to keep it away and that is by keeping everything sweet and clean     chapter l  victoria  ad 18601872   one more chapter which however does not finish the history of good queen victoria and these stories of the history of england will be over  all the nation rejoiced very much when the queens eldest son albert edward the prince of wales married alexandra daughter to the king of denmark  her father and mother brought her to england and the prince met her on board ship in the mouth of the thames and there was a most beautiful and joyous procession through london  when they were married the next day in st georges chapel at windsor the whole of england made merry and there were bonfires on every hill and illuminations in every town so that the whole island was glowing with brightness all that spring evening  there is a country in abyssinia south of egypt  the people there are christians but they have had very little to do with other nations and have grown very dull and half savage indeed they have many horrid and disgusting customs and have forgotten all the teaching that would have made them better  of late years there had been some attempt to wake them up and teach them and they had a clever king named theodore who seemed pleased and willing to improve himself and his nation he allowed missionaries to come and try to teach his people what christianity means a little better than they knew before and invited skilled workmen to come and teach his people  they came but not long after theodore was affronted by the english government and shut them all up in prison  messages were sent to insist upon his releasing them but he did not attend or understand and at last an army was sent to land on the coast from the east under general napier and march to his capital which was called magdala and stood on a hill  general napier managed so well that there was no fighting on the road he came to the gates of magdala and threatened to fire upon it if the prisoners were not given up to him  he waited till the time was up and then caused his troops to begin the attack  the abyssinians fled away and close by one of the gates theodore was found lying dead shot through  no one is quite sure whether one of his servants killed him treacherously or whether he killed himself in his rage and despair  england did not try to keep abyssinia though it was conquered but it was left to the royal family whom theodore had turned out and theodores little son about five years old was brought to england but as he could not bear the cold winter he was sent to a school in india  this which was in the year 1868 was the last war the english have had  there has been fighting all round and about in europe especially a great war between france and prussia in 1870 but the only thing the english had to do with that was the sending out of doctors and nurses with all the good things for sick people that could be thought of to take care of all the poor wounded on both sides and lessen their suffering as much as possible  they all wore red crosses on their sleeves and put up a redcross flag over the houses where they were taking care of the sick and wounded and then no one on either side fired upon them  an act of parliament has given the right to vote at the election of the house of commons to much poorer men than used to have it  it is to be hoped that they will learn to use wisely this power of helping to choose those who make the laws and govern the country  to give them a better chance of doing so a law has been made that no child shall be allowed to grow up without any teaching at all but that those who are too poor to pay for their own schooling shall be paid for by the state and that their parents shall be obliged to send them  the great thing is to learn to know and do ones duty  if one only learns to be clever with ones head without trying to be good at the same time it is of very little use  but i hope you will try to mind your dutyfirst to god and then to man and if you do that god will prosper you and bless you
