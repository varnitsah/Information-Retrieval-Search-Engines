9165611	the scarlet plague  by jack london   illustrated by gordon grant  1915     the scarlet plague     i  the way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a railroad but no train had run upon it for many years the forest on either side swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green wave of trees and bushes the trail was as narrow as a mans body and was no more than a wildanimal runway occasionally a piece of rusty iron showing through the forestmould advertised that the rail and the ties still remained in one place a teninch tree bursting through at a connection had lifted the end of a rail clearly into view the tie had evidently followed the rail held to it by the spike long enough for its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten leaves so that now the crumbling rotten timber thrust itself up at a curious slant old as the road was it was manifest that it had been of the monorail type  an old man and a boy travelled along this runway they moved slowly for the old man was very old a touch of palsy made his movements tremulous and he leaned heavily upon his staff a rude skullcap of goatskin protected his head from the sun from beneath this fell a scant fringe of stained and dirtywhite hair a visor ingeniously made from a large leaf shielded his eyes and from under this he peered at the way of his feet on the trail his beard which should have been snowwhite but which showed the same weatherwear and campstain as his hair fell nearly to his waist in a great tangled mass about his chest and shoulders hung a single mangy garment of goatskin his arms and legs withered and skinny betokened extreme age as well as did their sunburn and scars and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements  the boy who led the way checking the eagerness of his muscles to the slow progress of the elder likewise wore a single garmenta raggededged piece of bearskin with a hole in the middle through which he had thrust his head he could not have been more than twelve years old tucked coquettishly over one ear was the freshly severed tail of a pig in one hand he carried a mediumsized bow and an arrow  on his back was a quiverful of arrows from a sheath hanging about his neck on a thong projected the battered handle of a hunting knife he was as brown as a berry and walked softly with almost a catlike tread in marked contrast with his sunburned skin were his eyesblue deep blue but keen and sharp as a pair of gimlets they seemed to bore into aft about him in a way that was habitual as he went along he smelled things as well his distended quivering nostrils carrying to his brain an endless series of messages from the outside world also his hearing was acute and had been so trained that it operated automatically without conscious effort he heard all the slight sounds in the apparent quietheard and differentiated and classified these soundswhether they were of the wind rustling the leaves of the humming of bees and gnats of the distant rumble of the sea that drifted to him only in lulls or of the gopher just under his foot shoving a pouchful of earth into the entrance of his hole  suddenly he became alertly tense sound sight and odor had given him a simultaneous warning his hand went back to the old man touching him and the pair stood still ahead at one side of the top of the embankment arose a crackling sound and the boys gaze was fixed on the tops of the agitated bushes then a large bear a grizzly crashed into view and likewise stopped abruptly at sight of the humans he did not like them and growled querulously slowly the boy fitted the arrow to the bow and slowly he pulled the bowstring taut but he never removed his eyes from the bear  illustration slowly he pulled the bowstring taut 020  the old man peered from under his green leaf at the danger and stood as quietly as the boy for a few seconds this mutual scrutinizing went on then the bear betraying a growing irritability the boy with a movement of his head indicated that the old man must step aside from the trail and go down the embankment the boy followed going backward still holding the bow taut and ready they waited till a crashing among the bushes from the opposite side of the embankment told them the bear had gone on the boy grinned as he led back to the trail  a big un granser he chuckled  the old man shook his head  they get thicker every day he complained in a thin undependable falsetto whod have thought id live to see the time when a man would be afraid of his life on the way to the cliff house when i was a boy edwin men and women and little babies used to come out here from san francisco by tens of thousands on a nice day and there werent any bears then no sir they used to pay money to look at them in cages they were that rare  what is money granser  before the old man could answer the boy recollected and triumphantly shoved his hand into a pouch under his bearskin and pulled forth a battered and tarnished silver dollar the old mans eyes glistened as he held the coin close to them  i cant see he muttered you look and see if you can make out the date edwin  the boy laughed  youre a great granser he cried delightedly always making believe them little marks mean something  the old man manifested an accustomed chagrin as he brought the coin back again close to his own eyes  2012 he shrilled and then fell to cackling grotesquely that was the year morgan the fifth was appointed president of the united states by the board of magnates it must have been one of the last coins minted for the scarlet death came in 2013 lord lordthink of it sixty years ago and i am the only person alive today that lived in those times where did you find it edwin  the boy who had been regarding him with the tolerant curiousness one accords to the prattlings of the feebleminded answered promptly  i got it off of hoohoo he found it when we was herdin goats down near san jos√© last spring hoohoo said it was money aint you hungry granser  the ancient caught his staff in a tighter grip and urged along the trail his old eyes shining greedily  i hope harlip s found a crab or two he mumbled theyre good eating crabs mighty good eating when youve no more teeth and youve got grandsons that love their old grandsire and make a point of catching crabs for him when i was a boy  but edwin suddenly stopped by what he saw was drawing the bowstring on a fitted arrow he had paused on the brink of a crevasse in the embankment an ancient culvert had here washed out and the stream no longer confined had cut a passage through the fill on the opposite side the end of a rail projected and overhung it showed rustily through the creeping vines which overran it beyond crouching by a bush a rabbit looked across at him in trembling hesitancy fully fifty feet was the distance but the arrow flashed true and the transfixed rabbit crying out in sudden fright and hurt struggled painfully away into the brush the boy himself was a flash of brown skin and flying fur as he bounded down the steep wall of the gap and up the other side his lean muscles were springs of steel that released into graceful and efficient action a hundred feet beyond in a tangle of bushes he overtook the wounded creature knocked its head on a convenient treetrunk and turned it over to granser to carry  illustration rabbit is good very good 026  rabbit is good very good the ancient quavered but when it comes to a toothsome delicacy i prefer crab when i was a boy  why do you say so much that aint got no sense edwin impatiently interrupted the others threatened garrulousness  the boy did not exactly utter these words but something that remotely resembled them and that was more guttural and explosive and economical of qualifying phrases his speech showed distant kinship with that of the old man and the latters speech was approximately an english that had gone through a bath of corrupt usage  what i want to know edwin continued is why you call crab toothsome delicacy crab is crab aint it no one i never heard calls it such funny things  the old man sighed but did not answer and they moved on in silence the surf grew suddenly louder as they emerged from the forest upon a stretch of sand dunes bordering the sea a few goats were browsing among the sandy hillocks and a skinclad boy aided by a wolfishlooking dog that was only faintly reminiscent of a collie was watching them mingled with the roar of the surf was a continuous deepthroated barking or bellowing which came from a cluster of jagged rocks a hundred yards out from shore here huge sealions hauled themselves up to lie in the sun or battle with one another in the immediate foreground arose the smoke of a fire tended by a third savagelooking boy crouched near him were several wolfish dogs similar to the one that guarded the goats  the old man accelerated his pace sniffing eagerly as he neared the fire  mussels he muttered ecstatically mussels and aint that a crab hoohoo aint that a crab my my you boys are good to your old grandsire  hoohoo who was apparently of the same age as edwin grinned  all you want granser i got four  the old mans palsied eagerness was pitiful sitting down in the sand as quickly as his stiff limbs would let him he poked a large rockmussel from out of the coals the heat had forced its shells apart and the meat salmoncolored was thoroughly cooked between thumb and forefinger in trembling haste he caught the morsel and carried it to his mouth but it was too hot and the next moment was violently ejected the old man spluttered with the pain and tears ran out of his eyes and down his cheeks  the boys were true savages possessing only the cruel humor of the savage to them the incident was excruciatingly funny and they burst into loud laughter hoohoo danced up and down while edwin rolled gleefully on the ground the boy with the goats came running to join in the fun  set em to cool edwin set em to cool the old man besought in the midst of his grief making no attempt to wipe away the tears that still flowed from his eyes and cool a crab edwin too you know your grandsire likes crabs  from the coals arose a great sizzling which proceeded from the many mussels bursting open their shells and exuding their moisture they were large shellfish running from three to six inches in length the boys raked them out with sticks and placed them on a large piece of driftwood to cool  when i was a boy we did not laugh at our elders we respected them  the boys took no notice and granser continued to babble an incoherent flow of complaint and censure but this time he was more careful and did not burn his mouth all began to eat using nothing but their hands and making loud mouthnoises and lipsmackings the third boy who was called harelip slyly deposited a pinch of sand on a mussel the ancient was carrying to his mouth and when the grit of it bit into the old fellows mucous membrane and gums the laughter was again uproarious he was unaware that a joke had been played on him and spluttered and spat until edwin relenting gave him a gourd of fresh water with which to wash out his mouth  wheres them crabs hoohoo edwin demanded gransers set upon having a snack  again gransers eyes burned with greediness as a large crab was handed to him it was a shell with legs and all complete but the meat had long since departed with shaky fingers and babblings of anticipation the old man broke off a leg and found it filled with emptiness  the crabs hoohoo he wailed the crabs  i was fooling granser they aint no crabs i never found one  the boys were overwhelmed with delight at sight of the tears of senile disappointment that dribbled down the old mans cheeks then unnoticed hoohoo replaced the empty shell with a freshcooked crab already dismembered from the cracked legs the white meat sent forth a small cloud of savory steam this attracted the old mans nostrils and he looked down in amazement  illustration this attracted the old mans nostrils 033  the change of his mood to one of joy was immediate he snuffled and muttered and mumbled making almost a croon of delight as he began to eat of this the boys took little notice for it was an accustomed spectacle nor did they notice his occasional exclamations and utterances of phrases which meant nothing to them as for instance when he smacked his lips and champed his gums while muttering mayonnaise just thinkmayonnaise and its sixty years since the last was ever made two generations and never a smell of it why in those days it was served in every restaurant with crab  when he could eat no more the old man sighed wiped his hands on his naked legs and gazed out over the sea with the content of a full stomach he waxed reminiscent  to think of it ive seen this beach alive with men women and children on a pleasant sunday and there werent any bears to eat them up either and right up there on the cliff was a big restaurant where you could get anything you wanted to eat four million people lived in san francisco then and now in the whole city and county there arent forty all told and out there on the sea were ships and ships always to be seen going in for the golden gate or coming out and airships in the airdirigibles and flying machines they could travel two hundred miles an hour the mail contracts with the new york and san francisco limited demanded that for the minimum there was a chap a frenchman i forget his name who succeeded in making three hundred but the thing was risky too risky for conservative persons but he was on the right clew and he would have managed it if it hadnt been for the great plague when i was a boy there were men alive who remembered the coming of the first aeroplanes and now i have lived to see the last of them and that sixty years ago  the old man babbled on unheeded by the boys who were long accustomed to his garrulousness and whose vocabularies besides lacked the greater portion of the words he used it was noticeable that in these rambling soliloquies his english seemed to recrudesce into better construction and phraseology but when he talked directly with the boys it lapsed largely into their own uncouth and simpler forms  but there werent many crabs in those days the old man wandered on they were fished out and they were great delicacies the open season was only a month long too and now crabs are accessible the whole year around think of itcatching all the crabs you want any time you want in the surf of the cliff house beach  a sudden commotion among the goats brought the boys to their feet the dogs about the fire rushed to join their snarling fellow who guarded the goats while the goats themselves stampeded in the direction of their human protectors a half dozen forms lean and gray glided about on the sand hillocks and faced the bristling dogs edwin arched an arrow that fell short but harelip with a sling such as david carried into battle against goliath hurled a stone through the air that whistled from the speed of its flight it fell squarely among the wolves and caused them to slink away toward the dark depths of the eucalyptus forest  illustration with a sling such as david carried 036  the boys laughed and lay down again in the sand while granser sighed ponderously he had eaten too much and with hands clasped on his paunch the fingers interlaced he resumed his maunderings  the fleeting systems lapse like foam he mumbled what was evidently a quotation thats itfoam and fleeting all mans toil upon the planet was just so much foam he domesticated the serviceable animals destroyed the hostile ones and cleared the land of its wild vegetation and then he passed and the flood of primordial life rolled back again sweeping his handiwork awaythe weeds and the forest inundated his fields the beasts of prey swept over his flocks and now there are wolves on the cliff house beach he was appalled by the thought where four million people disported themselves the wild wolves roam today and the savage progeny of our loins with prehistoric weapons defend themselves against the fanged despoilers think of it and all because of the scarlet death  the adjective had caught harelips ear  hes always saying that he said to edwin what is scarlet  the scarlet of the maples can shake me like the cry of bugles going by the old man quoted  its red edwin answered the question and you dont know it because you come from the chauffeur tribe they never did know nothing none of them scarlet is redi know that  red is red aint it harelip grumbled then whats the good of gettin cocky and calling it scarlet  granser what for do you always say so much what nobody knows he asked scarlet aint anything but red is red why dont you say red then  red is not the right word was the reply the plague was scarlet the whole face and body turned scarlet in an hours time dont i know didnt i see enough of it and i am telling you it was scarlet becausewell because it was scarlet there is no other word for it  red is good enough for me harelip muttered obstinately my dad calls red red and he ought to know he says everybody died of the red death  your dad is a common fellow descended from a common fellow granser retorted heatedly dont i know the beginnings of the chauffeurs your grandsire was a chauffeur a servant and without education he worked for other persons but your grandmother was of good stock only the children did not take after her dont i remember when i first met them catching fish at lake temescal  what is education edwin asked  calling red scarlet harelip sneered then returned to the attack on granser my dad told me an he got it from his dad afore he croaked that your wife was a santa rosan an that she was sure no account he said she was a hashslinger before the red death though i dont know what a hashslinger is you can tell me edwin  but edwin shook his head in token of ignorance  it is true she was a waitress granser acknowledged but she was a good woman and your mother was her daughter women were very scarce in the days after the plague she was the only wife i could find even if she was a hashslinger as your father calls it but it is not nice to talk about our progenitors that way  dad says that the wife of the first chauffeur was a lady  whats a lady hoohoo demanded  a lady s a chauffeur squaw was the quick reply of harelip  the first chauffeur was bill a common fellow as i said before the old man expounded but his wife was a lady a great lady before the scarlet death she was the wife of van worden he was president of the board of industrial magnates and was one of the dozen men who ruled america he was worth one billion eight hundred millions of dollarscoins like you have there in your pouch edwin and then came the scarlet death and his wife became the wife of bill the first chauffeur he used to beat her too i have seen it myself  hoohoo lying on his stomach and idly digging his toes in the sand cried out and investigated first his toenail and next the small hole he had dug the other two boys joined him excavating the sand rapidly with their hands till there lay three skeletons exposed two were of adults the third being that of a partgrown child the old man hudged along on the ground and peered at the find  plague victims he announced thats the way they died everywhere in the last days this must have been a family running away from the contagion and perishing here on the cliff house beach theywhat are you doing edwin  this question was asked in sudden dismay as edwin using the back of his hunting knife began to knock out the teeth from the jaws of one of the skulls  going to string em was the response  the three boys were now hard at it and quite a knocking and hammering arose in which granser babbled on unnoticed  you are true savages already has begun the custom of wearing human teeth in another generation you will be perforating your noses and ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell i know the human race is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization when we increase and feel the lack of room we will proceed to kill one another and then i suppose you will wear human scalplocks at your waist as wellas you edwin who are the gentlest of my grandsons have already begun with that vile pigtail throw it away edwin boy throw it away  what a gabble the old geezer makes harelip remarked when the teeth all extracted they began an attempt at equal division  they were very quick and abrupt in their actions and their speech in moments of hot discussion over the allotment of the choicer teeth was truly a gabble they spoke in monosyllables and short jerky sentences that was more a gibberish than a language and yet through it ran hints of grammatical construction and appeared vestiges of the conjugation of some superior culture even the speech of granser was so corrupt that were it put down literally it would be almost so much nonsense to the reader this however was when he talked with the boys  when he got into the full swing of babbling to himself it slowly purged itself into pure english the sentences grew longer and were enunciated with a rhythm and ease that was reminiscent of the lecture platform  tell us about the red death granser harelip demanded when the teeth affair had been satisfactorily concluded  the scarlet death edwin corrected  an dont work all that funny lingo on us harelip went on talk sensible granser like a santa rosan ought to talk other santa rosans dont talk like you     ii  the old man showed pleasure in being thus called upon he cleared his throat and began  twenty or thirty years ago my story was in great demand but in these days nobody seems interested  there you go harelip cried hotly cut out the funny stuff and talk sensible whats interested you talk like a baby that dont know how  let him alone edwin urged or hell get mad and wont talk at all skip the funny places well catch on to some of what he tells us  let her go granser hoohoo encouraged for the old man was already maundering about the disrespect for elders and the reversion to cruelty of all humans that fell from high culture to primitive conditions  the tale began  there were very many people in the world in those days san francisco alone held four millions  what is millions edwin interrupted  granser looked at him kindly  i know you cannot count beyond ten so i will tell you hold up your two hands on both of them you have altogether ten fingers and thumbs very well i now take this grain of sandyou hold it hoohoo he dropped the grain of sand into the lads palm and went on now that grain of sand stands for the ten fingers of edwin i add another grain thats ten more fingers and i add another and another and another until i have added as many grains as edwin has fingers and thumbs that makes what i call one hundred remember that wordone hundred now i put this pebble in harelips hand it stands for ten grains of sand or ten tens of fingers or one hundred fingers i put in ten pebbles they stand for a thousand fingers i take a musselshell and it stands for ten pebbles or one hundred grains of sand or one thousand fingers and so on laboriously and with much reiteration he strove to build up in their minds a crude conception of numbers as the quantities increased he had the boys holding different magnitudes in each of their hands for still higher sums he laid the symbols on the log of driftwood and for symbols he was hard put being compelled to use the teeth from the skulls for millions and the crabshells for billions it was here that he stopped for the boys were showing signs of becoming tired  there were four million people in san franciscofour teeth  the boys eyes ranged along from the teeth and from hand to hand down through the pebbles and sandgrains to edwins fingers and back again they ranged along the ascending series in the effort to grasp such inconceivable numbers  that was a lot of folks granser edwin at last hazarded  like sand on the beach here like sand on the beach each grain of sand a man or woman or child yes my boy all those people lived right here in san francisco and at one time or another all those people came out on this very beachmore people than there are grains of sand moremoremore and san francisco was a noble city and across the baywhere we camped last year even more people lived clear from point richmond on the level ground and on the hills all the way around to san leandroone great city of seven million peopleseven teeth there thats it seven millions  again the boys eyes ranged up and down from edwins fingers to the teeth on the log  the world was full of people the census of 2010 gave eight billions for the whole worldeight crabshells yes eight billions it was not like today mankind knew a great deal more about getting food and the more food there was the more people there were in the year 1800 there were one hundred and seventy millions in europe alone one hundred years latera grain of sand hoohooone hundred years later at 1900 there were five hundred millions in europefive grains of sand hoohoo and this one tooth this shows how easy was the getting of food and how men increased and in the year 2000 there were fifteen hundred millions in europe and it was the same all over the rest of the world eight crabshells there yes eight billion people were alive on the earth when the scarlet death began  i was a young man when the plague cametwentyseven years old and i lived on the other side of san francisco bay in berkeley you remember those great stone houses edwin when we came down the hills from contra costa that was where i lived in those stone houses i was a professor of english literature  illustration i was a professor of english literature 054  much of this was over the heads of the boys but they strove to comprehend dimly this tale of the past  what was them stone houses for harelip queried  you remember when your dad taught you to swim the boy nodded well in the university of californiathat is the name we had for the houseswe taught young men and women how to think just as i have taught you now by sand and pebbles and shells to know how many people lived in those days there was very much to teach the young men and women we taught were called students we had large rooms in which we taught i talked to them forty or fifty at a time just as i am talking to you now i told them about the books other men had written before their time and even sometimes in their time  was that all you didjust talk talk talk hoohoo demanded who hunted your meat for you and milked the goats and caught the fish  a sensible question hoohoo a sensible question as i have told you in those days foodgetting was easy we were very wise a few men got the food for many men the other men did other things as you say i talked i talked all the time and for this food was given memuch food fine food beautiful food food that i have not tasted in sixty years and shall never taste again i sometimes think the most wonderful achievement of our tremendous civilization was foodits inconceivable abundance its infinite variety its marvellous delicacy o my grandsons life was life in those days when we had such wonderful things to eat  this was beyond the boys and they let it slip by words and thoughts as a mere senile wandering in the narrative  our foodgetters were called freemen this was a joke we of the ruling classes owned all the land all the machines everything these foodgetters were our slaves we took almost all the food they got and left them a little so that they might eat and work and get us more food  id have gone into the forest and got food for myself harelip announced and if any man tried to take it away from me id have killed him  the old man laughed  did i not tell you that we of the ruling class owned all the land all the forest everything any foodgetter who would not get food for us him we punished or compelled to starve to death and very few did that they preferred to get food for us and make clothes for us and prepare and administer to us a thousanda musselshell hoohooa thousand satisfactions and delights and i was professor smith in those daysprofessor james howard smith and my lecture courses were very popularthat is very many of the young men and women liked to hear me talk about the books other men had written  and i was very happy and i had beautiful things to eat and my hands were soft because i did no work with them and my body was clean all over and dressed in the softest garments  he surveyed his mangy goatskin with disgust  we did not wear such things in those days even the slaves had better garments and we were most clean we washed our faces and hands often every day you boys never wash unless you fall into the water or go swimming  neither do you granzer hoohoo retorted  i know i know i am a filthy old man but times have changed nobody washes these days there are no conveniences it is sixty years since i have seen a piece of soap  illustration sixty years since i have seen a piece of soap 059  you do not know what soap is and i shall not tell you for i am telling the story of the scarlet death you know what sickness is we called it a disease very many of the diseases came from what we called germs remember that wordgerms a germ is a very small thing it is like a woodtick such as you find on the dogs in the spring of the year when they run in the forest only the germ is very small it is so small that you cannot see it  hoohoo began to laugh  youre a queer un granser talking about things you cant see if you cant see em how do you know they are thats what i want to know how do you know anything you cant see  a good question a very good question hoohoo but we did seesome of them we had what we called microscopes and ultramicroscopes and we put them to our eyes and looked through them so that we saw things larger than they really were and many things we could not see without the microscopes at all our best ultramicroscopes could make a germ look forty thousand times larger a musselshell is a thousand fingers like edwins take forty musselshells and by as many times larger was the germ when we looked at it through a microscope and after that we had other ways by using what we called moving pictures of making the fortythousandtimes germ many many thousand times larger still and thus we saw all these things which our eyes of themselves could not see take a grain of sand break it into ten pieces take one piece and break it into ten break one of those pieces into ten and one of those into ten and one of those into ten and one of those into ten and do it all day and maybe by sunset you will have a piece as small as one of the germs the boys were openly incredulous harelip sniffed and sneered and hoohoo snickered until edwin nudged them to be silent  the woodtick sucks the blood of the dog but the germ being so very small goes right into the blood of the body and there it has many children in those days there would be as many as a billiona crabshell pleaseas many as that crabshell in one mans body we called germs microorganisms when a few million or a billion of them were in a man in all the blood of a man he was sick these germs were a disease there were many different kinds of themmore different kinds than there are grains of sand on this beach we knew only a few of the kinds the microorganic world was an invisible world a world we could not see and we knew very little about it yet we did know something there was the bacillus anthracis there was the micrococcus there was the bacterium termo and the bacterium lactisthats what turns the goat milk sour even to this day harelip and there were schizomycetes without end and there were many others  here the old man launched into a disquisition on germs and their natures using words and phrases of such extraordinary length and meaninglessness that the boys grinned at one another and looked out over the deserted ocean till they forgot the old man was babbling on  but the scarlet death granser edwin at last suggested  granser recollected himself and with a start tore himself away from the rostrum of the lecturehall where to another world audience he had been expounding the latest theory sixty years gone of germs and germdiseases  yes yes edwin i had forgotten sometimes the memory of the past is very strong upon me and i forget that i am a dirty old man clad in goatskin wandering with my savage grandsons who are goatherds in the primeval wilderness the fleeting systems lapse like foam and so lapsed our glorious colossal civilization i am granser a tired old man i belong to the tribe of santa rosans i married into that tribe my sons and daughters married into the chauffeurs the sacramentos and the paloaltos you harelip are of the chauffeurs you edwin are of the sacramentos and you hoohoo are of the paloaltos your tribe takes its name from a town that was near the seat of another great institution of learning it was called stanford university yes i remember now it is perfectly clear i was telling you of the scarlet death where was i in my story  you was telling about germs the things you cant see but which make men sick edwin prompted  yes thats where i was a man did not notice at first when only a few of these germs got into his body but each germ broke in half and became two germs and they kept doing this very rapidly so that in a short time there were many millions of them in the body then the man was sick he had a disease and the disease was named after the kind of a germ that was in him it might be measles it might be influenza it might be yellow fever it might be any of thousands and thousands of kinds of diseases  now this is the strange thing about these germs there were always new ones coming to live in mens bodies long and long and long ago when there were only a few men in the world there were few diseases but as men increased and lived closely together in great cities and civilizations new diseases arose new kinds of germs entered their bodies thus were countless millions and billions of human beings killed and the more thickly men packed together the more terrible were the new diseases that came to be long before my time in the middle ages there was the black plague that swept across europe it swept across europe many times there was tuberculosis that entered into men wherever they were thickly packed a hundred years before my time there was the bubonic plague and in africa was the sleeping sickness the bacteriologists fought all these sicknesses and destroyed them just as you boys fight the wolves away from your goats or squash the mosquitoes that light on you the bacteriologists  but granser what is a whatyoucallit edwin interrupted  you edwin are a goatherd your task is to watch the goats you know a great deal about goats a bacteriologist watches germs thats his task and he knows a great deal about them so as i was saying the bacteriologists fought with the germs and destroyed themsometimes there was leprosy a horrible disease a hundred years before i was born the bacteriologists discovered the germ of leprosy they knew all about it they made pictures of it i have seen those pictures but they never found a way to kill it but in 1984 there was the pantoblast plague a disease that broke out in a country called brazil and that killed millions of people but the bacteriologists found it out and found the way to kill it so that the pantoblast plague went no farther they made what they called a serum which they put into a mans body and which killed the pantoblast germs without killing the man and in 1910 there was pellagra and also the hookworm these were easily killed by the bacteriologists but in 1947 there arose a new disease that had never been seen before it got into the bodies of babies of only ten months old or less and it made them unable to move their hands and feet or to eat or anything and the bacteriologists were eleven years in discovering how to kill that particular germ and save the babies  in spite of all these diseases and of all the new ones that continued to arise there were more and more men in the world this was because it was easy to get food the easier it was to get food the more men there were the more men there were the more thickly were they packed together on the earth and the more thickly they were packed the more new kinds of germs became diseases there were warnings soldervetzsky as early as 1929 told the bacteriologists that they had no guaranty against some new disease a thousand times more deadly than any they knew arising and killing by the hundreds of millions and even by the billion you see the microorganic world remained a mystery to the end they knew there was such a world and that from time to time armies of new germs emerged from it to kill men  and that was all they knew about it for all they knew in that invisible microorganic world there might be as many different kinds of germs as there are grains of sand on this beach and also in that same invisible world it might well be that new kinds of germs came to be it might be there that life originatedthe abysmal fecundity soldervetzsky called it applying the words of other men who had written before him  it was at this point that harelip rose to his feet an expression of huge contempt on his face  illustration granser you make me sick with your gabble 071  granser he announced you make me sick with your gabble why dont you tell about the red death if you aint going to say so an well start back for camp  the old man looked at him and silently began to cry the weak tears of age rolled down his cheeks and all the feebleness of his eightyseven years showed in his griefstricken countenance  sit down edwin counselled soothingly gransers all right hes just gettin to the scarlet death aint you granser hes just goin to tell us about it right now sit down harelip go ahead granser     iii  the old man wiped the tears away on his grimy knuckles and took up the tale in a tremulous piping voice that soon strengthened as he got the swing of the narrative  it was in the summer of 2013 that the plague came i was twentyseven years old and well do i remember it wireless despatches  harelip spat loudly his disgust and granser hastened to make amends  we talked through the air in those days thousands and thousands of miles and the word came of a strange disease that had broken out in new york there were seventeen millions of people living then in that noblest city of america nobody thought anything about the news it was only a small thing there had been only a few deaths it seemed though that they had died very quickly and that one of the first signs of the disease was the turning red of the face and all the body within twentyfour hours came the report of the first case in chicago and on the same day it was made public that london the greatest city in the world next to chicago had been secretly fighting the plague for two weeks and censoring the news despatchesthat is not permitting the word to go forth to the rest of the world that london had the plague  it looked serious but we in california like everywhere else were not alarmed we were sure that the bacteriologists would find a way to overcome this new germ just as they had overcome other germs in the past but the trouble was the astonishing quickness with which this germ destroyed human beings and the fact that it inevitably killed any human body it entered no one ever recovered there was the old asiatic cholera when you might eat dinner with a well man in the evening and the next morning if you got up early enough you would see him being hauled by your window in the deathcart but this new plague was quicker than thatmuch quicker  illustration but this new plague was quicker 078  from the moment of the first signs of it a man would be dead in an hour some lasted for several hours many died within ten or fifteen minutes of the appearance of the first signs  the heart began to beat faster and the heat of the body to increase then came the scarlet rash spreading like wildfire over the face and body most persons never noticed the increase in heat and heartbeat and the first they knew was when the scarlet rash came out usually they had convulsions at the time of the appearance of the rash but these convulsions did not last long and were not very severe if one lived through them he became perfectly quiet and only did he feel a numbness swiftly creeping up his body from the feet the heels became numb first then the legs and hips and when the numbness reached as high as his heart he died they did not rave or sleep their minds always remained cool and calm up to the moment their heart numbed and stopped and another strange thing was the rapidity of decomposition no sooner was a person dead than the body seemed to fall to pieces to fly apart to melt away even as you looked at it that was one of the reasons the plague spread so rapidly all the billions of germs in a corpse were so immediately released  and it was because of all this that the bacteriologists had so little chance in fighting the germs they were killed in their laboratories even as they studied the germ of the scarlet death they were heroes as fast as they perished others stepped forth and took their places it was in london that they first isolated it the news was telegraphed everywhere trask was the name of the man who succeeded in this but within thirty hours he was dead then came the struggle in all the laboratories to find something that would kill the plague germs all drugs failed you see the problem was to get a drug or serum that would kill the germs in the body and not kill the body they tried to fight it with other germs to put into the body of a sick man germs that were the enemies of the plague germs  and you cant see these germthings granser harelip objected and here you gabble gabble gabble about them as if they was anything when theyre nothing at all anything you cant see aint thats what fighting things that aint with things that aint they must have been all fools in them days thats why they croaked i aint goin to believe in such rot i tell you that  granser promptly began to weep while edwin hotly took up his defence  look here harelip you believe in lots of things you cant see  harelip shook his head  you believe in dead men walking about you never seen one dead man walk about  i tell you i seen em last winter when i was wolfhunting with dad  well you always spit when you cross running water edwin challenged  thats to keep off bad luck was harelips defence  you believe in bad luck  sure  an you aint never seen bad luck edwin concluded triumphantly youre just as bad as granser and his germs you believe in what you dont see go on granser  harelip crushed by this metaphysical defeat remained silent and the old man went on often and often though this narrative must not be clogged by the details was gransers tale interrupted while the boys squabbled among themselves also among themselves they kept up a constant lowvoiced exchange of explanation and conjecture as they strove to follow the old man into his unknown and vanished world  the scarlet death broke out in san francisco the first death came on a monday morning by thursday they were dying like flies in oakland and san francisco they died everywherein their beds at their work walking along the street it was on tuesday that i saw my first deathmiss collbran one of my students sitting right there before my eyes in my lectureroom i noticed her face while i was talking it had suddenly turned scarlet i ceased speaking and could only look at her for the first fear of the plague was already on all of us and we knew that it had come the young women screamed and ran out of the room so did the young men run out all but two miss collbrans convulsions were very mild and lasted less than a minute one of the young men fetched her a glass of water she drank only a little of it and cried out  my feet all sensation has left them  after a minute she said i have no feet i am unaware that i have any feet and my knees are cold i can scarcely feel that i have knees  she lay on the floor a bundle of notebooks under her head and we could do nothing the coldness and the numbness crept up past her hips to her heart and when it reached her heart she was dead in fifteen minutes by the clocki timed itshe was dead there in my own classroom dead and she was a very beautiful strong healthy young woman and from the first sign of the plague to her death only fifteen minutes elapsed that will show you how swift was the scarlet death  yet in those few minutes i remained with the dying woman in my classroom the alarm had spread over the university and the students by thousands all of them had deserted the lectureroom and laboratories when i emerged on my way to make report to the president of the faculty i found the university deserted across the campus were several stragglers hurrying for their homes two of them were running  president hoag i found in his office all alone looking very old and very gray with a multitude of wrinkles in his face that i had never seen before at the sight of me he pulled himself to his feet and tottered away to the inner office banging the door after him and locking it you see he knew i had been exposed and he was afraid he shouted to me through the door to go away i shall never forget my feelings as i walked down the silent corridors and out across that deserted campus i was not afraid i had been exposed and i looked upon myself as already dead it was not that but a feeling of awful depression that impressed me everything had stopped it was like the end of the world to memy world i had been born within sight and sound of the university it had been my predestined career my father had been a professor there before me and his father before him for a century and a half had this university like a splendid machine been running steadily on and now in an instant it had stopped it was like seeing the sacred flame die down on some thricesacred altar i was shocked unutterably shocked  when i arrived home my housekeeper screamed as i entered and fled away and when i rang i found the housemaid had likewise fled i investigated in the kitchen i found the cook on the point of departure but she screamed too and in her haste dropped a suitcase of her personal belongings and ran out of the house and across the grounds still screaming i can hear her scream to this day you see we did not act in this way when ordinary diseases smote us we were always calm over such things and sent for the doctors and nurses who knew just what to do but this was different it struck so suddenly and killed so swiftly and never missed a stroke when the scarlet rash appeared on a persons face that person was marked by death there was never a known case of a recovery  i was alone in my big house as i have told you often before in those days we could talk with one another over wires or through the air the telephone bell rang and i found my brother talking to me he told me that he was not coming home for fear of catching the plague from me and that he had taken our two sisters to stop at professor bacons home he advised me to remain where i was and wait to find out whether or not i had caught the plague  illustration the telephone bell rang 088  to all of this i agreed staying in my house and for the first time in my life attempting to cook and the plague did not come out on me by means of the telephone i could talk with whomsoever i pleased and get the news also there were the newspapers and i ordered all of them to be thrown up to my door so that i could know what was happening with the rest of the world  new york city and chicago were in chaos and what happened with them was happening in all the large cities a third of the new york police were dead their chief was also dead likewise the mayor all law and order had ceased the bodies were lying in the streets unburied all railroads and vessels carrying food and such things into the great city had ceased runnings and mobs of the hungry poor were pillaging the stores and warehouses murder and robbery and drunkenness were everywhere already the people had fled from the city by millionsat first the rich in their private motorcars and dirigibles and then the great mass of the population on foot carrying the plague with them themselves starving and pillaging the farmers and all the towns and villages on the way  illustration fled from the city by millions 092  the man who sent this news the wireless operator was alone with his instrument on the top of a lofty building the people remaining in the cityhe estimated them at several hundred thousandhad gone mad from fear and drink and on all sides of him great fires were raging he was a hero that man who staid by his postan obscure newspaperman most likely  for twentyfour hours he said no transatlantic airships had arrived and no more messages were coming from england he did state though that a message from berlinthats in germanyannounced that hoffmeyer a bacteriologist of the metchnikoff school had discovered the serum for the plague that was the last word to this day that we of america ever received from europe if hoffmeyer discovered the serum it was too late or otherwise long ere this explorers from europe would have come looking for us we can only conclude that what happened in america happened in europe and that at the best some several score may have survived the scarlet death on that whole continent  for one day longer the despatches continued to come from new york then they too ceased the man who had sent them perched in his lofty building had either died of the plague or been consumed in the great conflagrations he had described as raging around him and what had occurred in new york had been duplicated in all the other cities it was the same in san francisco and oakland and berkeley by thursday the people were dying so rapidly that their corpses could not be handled and dead bodies lay everywhere thursday night the panic outrush for the country began imagine my grandsons people thicker than the salmonrun you have seen on the sacramento river pouring out of the cities by millions madly over the country in vain attempt to escape the ubiquitous death you see they carried the germs with them even the airships of the rich fleeing for mountain and desert fastnesses carried the germs  hundreds of these airships escaped to hawaii and not only did they bring the plague with them but they found the plague already there before them this we learned by the despatches until all order in san francisco vanished and there were no operators left at their posts to receive or send it was amazing astounding this loss of communication with the world it was exactly as if the world had ceased been blotted out for sixty years that world has no longer existed for me i know there must be such places as new york europe asia and africa but not one word has been heard of themnot in sixty years with the coming of the scarlet death the world fell apart absolutely irretrievably ten thousand years of culture and civilization passed in the twinkling of an eye lapsed like foam  i was telling about the airships of the rich they carried the plague with them and no matter where they fled they died i never encountered but one survivor of any of themmungerson he was afterwards a santa rosan and he married my eldest daughter he came into the tribe eight years after the plague he was then nineteen years old and he was compelled to wait twelve years more before he could marry you see there were no unmarried women and some of the older daughters of the santa rosans were already bespoken so he was forced to wait until my mary had grown to sixteen years it was his son gimpleg who was killed last year by the mountain lion  mungerson was eleven years old at the time of the plague his father was one of the industrial magnates a very wealthy powerful man it was on his airship the condor that they were fleeing with all the family for the wilds of british columbia which is far to the north of here but there was some accident and they were wrecked near mount shasta you have heard of that mountain it is far to the north the plague broke out amongst them and this boy of eleven was the only survivor for eight years he was alone wandering over a deserted land and looking vainly for his own kind and at last travelling south he picked up with us the santa rosans  but i am ahead of my story when the great exodus from the cities around san francisco bay began and while the telephones were still working i talked with my brother i told him this flight from the cities was insanity that there were no symptoms of the plague in me and that the thing for us to do was to isolate ourselves and our relatives in some safe place we decided on the chemistry building at the university and we planned to lay in a supply of provisions and by force of arms to prevent any other persons from forcing their presence upon us after we had retired to our refuge  all this being arranged my brother begged me to stay in my own house for at least twentyfour hours more on the chance of the plague developing in me to this i agreed and he promised to come for me next day we talked on over the details of the provisioning and the defending of the chemistry building until the telephone died it died in the midst of our conversation that evening there were no electric lights and i was alone in my house in the darkness no more newspapers were being printed so i had no knowledge of what was taking place outside  illustration i heard sounds of rioting and of pistol shots 098  i heard sounds of rioting and of pistol shots and from my windows i could see the glare of the sky of some conflagration in the direction of oakland it was a night of terror i did not sleep a wink a manwhy and how i do not knowwas killed on the sidewalk in front of the house i heard the rapid reports of an automatic pistol and a few minutes later the wounded wretch crawled up to my door moaning and crying out for help arming myself with two automatics i went to him by the light of a match i ascertained that while he was dying of the bullet wounds at the same time the plague was on him i fled indoors whence i heard him moan and cry out for half an hour longer  in the morning my brother came to me i had gathered into a handbag what things of value i purposed taking but when i saw his face i knew that he would never accompany me to the chemistry building the plague was on him he intended shaking my hand but i went back hurriedly before him  look at yourself in the mirror i commanded  illustration look at yourself in the mirror 100  he did so and at sight of his scarlet face the color deepening as he looked at it he sank down nervelessly in a chair  my god he said ive got it dont come near me i am a dead man  then the convulsions seized him he was two hours in dying and he was conscious to the last complaining about the coldness and loss of sensation in his feet his calves his thighs until at last it was his heart and he was dead  that was the way the scarlet death slew i caught up my handbag and fled the sights in the streets were terrible one stumbled on bodies everywhere some were not yet dead and even as you looked you saw men sink down with the death fastened upon them there were numerous fires burning in berkeley while oakland and san francisco were apparently being swept by vast conflagrations the smoke of the burning filled the heavens so that the midday was as a gloomy twilight and in the shifts of wind sometimes the sun shone through dimly a dull red orb truly my grandsons it was like the last days of the end of the world  there were numerous stalled motor cars showing that the gasoline and the engine supplies of the garages had given out i remember one such car a man and a woman lay back dead in the seats and on the pavement near it were two more women and a child strange and terrible sights there were on every hand people slipped by silently furtively like ghostswhitefaced women carrying infants in their arms fathers leading children by the hand singly and in couples and in familiesall fleeing out of the city of death some carried supplies of food others blankets and valuables and there were many who carried nothing  there was a grocery storea place where food was sold the man to whom it belongedi knew him wella quiet sober but stupid and obstinate fellow was defending it the windows and doors had been broken in but he inside hiding behind a counter was discharging his pistol at a number of men on the sidewalk who were breaking in in the entrance were several bodiesof men i decided whom he had killed earlier in the day even as i looked on from a distance i saw one of the robbers break the windows of the adjoining store a place where shoes were sold and deliberately set fire to it i did not go to the grocerymans assistance the time for such acts had already passed civilization was crumbling and it was each for himself     iv  i went away hastily down a crossstreet and at the first corner i saw another tragedy two men of the working class had caught a man and a woman with two children and were robbing them i knew the man by sight though i had never been introduced to him he was a poet whose verses i had long admired yet i did not go to his help for at the moment i came upon the scene there was a pistol shot and i saw him sinking to the ground the woman screamed and she was felled with a fistblow by one of the brutes i cried out threateningly whereupon they discharged their pistols at me and i ran away around the corner here i was blocked by an advancing conflagration the buildings on both sides were burning and the street was filled with smoke and flame from somewhere in that murk came a womans voice calling shrilly for help but i did not go to her a mans heart turned to iron amid such scenes and one heard all too many appeals for help  returning to the corner i found the two robbers were gone the poet and his wife lay dead on the pavement it was a shocking sight the two children had vanishedwhither i could not tell and i knew now why it was that the fleeing persons i encountered slipped along so furtively and with such white faces in the midst of our civilization down in our slums and laborghettos we had bred a race of barbarians of savages and now in the time of our calamity they turned upon us like the wild beasts they were and destroyed us and they destroyed themselves as well  illustration now in the time of calamity they turned on us 108  they inflamed themselves with strong drink and committed a thousand atrocities quarreling and killing one another in the general madness one group of workingmen i saw of the better sort who had banded together and with their women and children in their midst the sick and aged in litters and being carried and with a number of horses pulling a truckload of provisions they were fighting their way out of the city they made a fine spectacle as they came down the street through the drifting smoke though they nearly shot me when i first appeared in their path as they went by one of their leaders shouted out to me in apologetic explanation he said they were killing the robbers and looters on sight and that they had thus banded together as the onlymeans by which to escape the prowlers  it was here that i saw for the first time what i was soon to see so often one of the marching men had suddenly shown the unmistakable mark of the plague immediately those about him drew away and he without a remonstrance stepped out of his place to let them pass on a woman most probably his wife attempted to follow him she was leading a little boy by the hand but the husband commanded her sternly to go on while others laid hands on her and restrained her from following him this i saw and i saw the man also with his scarlet blaze of face step into a doorway on the opposite side of the street i heard the report of his pistol and saw him sink lifeless to the ground  after being turned aside twice again by advancing fires i succeeded in getting through to the university on the edge of the campus i came upon a party of university folk who were going in the direction of the chemistry building they were all family men and their families were with them including the nurses and the servants professor badminton greeted me i had difficulty in recognizing him somewhere he had gone through flames and his beard was singed off about his head was a bloody bandage and his clothes were filthy  illustration he told me he had been cruelly beaten 112  he told me he had prowlers and that his brother had been killed the previous night in the defence of their dwelling  midway across the campus he pointed suddenly to mrs swintons face the unmistakable scarlet was there immediately all the other women set up a screaming and began to run away from her her two children were with a nurse and these also ran with the women but her husband doctor swinton remained with her  go on smith he told me keep an eye on the children as for me i shall stay with my wife i know she is as already dead but i cant leave her afterwards if i escape i shall come to the chemistry building and do you watch for me and let me in  i left him bending over his wife and soothing her last moments while i ran to overtake the party we were the last to be admitted to the chemistry building after that with our automatic rifles we maintained our isolation by our plans we had arranged for a company of sixty to be in this refuge instead every one of the number originally planned had added relatives and friends and whole families until there were over four hundred souls but the chemistry building was large and standing by itself was in no danger of being burned by the great fires that raged everywhere in the city  a large quantity of provisions had been gathered and a food committee took charge of it issuing rations daily to the various families and groups that arranged themselves into messes a number of committees were appointed and we developed a very efficient organization i was on the committee of defence though for the first day no prowlers came near we could see them in the distance however and by the smoke of their fires knew that several camps of them were occupying the far edge of the campus drunkenness was rife and often we heard them singing ribald songs or insanely shouting while the world crashed to ruin about them and all the air was filled with the smoke of its burning these low creatures gave rein to their bestiality and fought and drank and died and after all what did it matter everybody died anyway the good and the bad the efficients and the weaklings those that loved to live and those that scorned to live they passed everything passed  when twentyfour hours had gone by and no signs of the plague were apparent we congratulated ourselves and set about digging a well you have seen the great iron pipes which in those days carried water to all the citydwellers we feared that the fires in the city would burst the pipes and empty the reservoirs so we tore up the cement floor of the central court of the chemistry building and dug a well there were many young men undergraduates with us and we worked night and day on the well and our fears were confirmed three hours before we reached water the pipes went dry  a second twentyfour hours passed and still the plague did not appear among us we thought we were saved but we did not know what i afterwards decided to be true namely that the period of the incubation of the plague germs in a humans body was a matter of a number of days it slew so swiftly when once it manifested itself that we were led to believe that the period of incubation was equally swift so when two days had left us unscathed we were elated with the idea that we were free of the contagion  but the third day disillusioned us i can never forget the night preceding it i had charge of the night guards from eight to twelve and from the roof of the building i watched the passing of all mans glorious works so terrible were the local conflagrations that all the sky was lighted up one could read the finest print in the red glare all the world seemed wrapped in flames san francisco spouted smoke and fire from a score of vast conflagrations that were like so many active volcanoes oakland san leandro haywardsall were burning and to the northward clear to point richmond other fires were at work it was an aweinspiring spectacle civilization my grandsons civilization was passing in a sheet of flame and a breath of death at ten oclock that night the great powder magazines at point pinole exploded in rapid succession so terrific were the concussions that the strong building rocked as in an earthquake while every pane of glass was broken it was then that i left the roof and went down the long corridors from room to room quieting the alarmed women and telling them what had happened  an hour later at a window on the ground floor i heard pandemonium break out in the camps of the prowlers there were cries and screams and shots from many pistols as we afterward conjectured this fight had been precipitated by an attempt on the part of those that were well to drive out those that were sick at any rate a number of the plaguestricken prowlers escaped across the campus and drifted against our doors we warned them back but they cursed us and discharged a fusillade from their pistols professor merryweather at one of the windows was instantly killed the bullet striking him squarely between the eyes we opened fire in turn and all the prowlers fled away with the exception of three one was a woman the plague was on them and they were reckless like foul fiends there in the red glare from the skies with faces blazing they continued to curse us and fire at us one of the men i shot with my own hand after that the other man and the woman still cursing us lay down under our windows where we were compelled to watch them die of the plague  the situation was critical the explosions of the powder magazines had broken all the windows of the chemistry building so that we were exposed to the germs from the corpses the sanitary committee was called upon to act and it responded nobly two men were required to go out and remove the corpses and this meant the probable sacrifice of their own lives for having performed the task they were not to be permitted to reenter the building one of the professors who was a bachelor and one of the undergraduates volunteered they bade goodbye to us and went forth they were heroes they gave up their lives that four hundred others might live after they had performed their work they stood for a moment at a distance looking at us wistfully then they waved their hands in farewell and went away slowly across the campus toward the burning city  and yet it was all useless the next morning the first one of us was smitten with the plaguea little nursegirl in the family of professor stout it was no time for weakkneed sentimental policies on the chance that she might be the only one we thrust her forth from the building and commanded her to be gone  illustration we thrust her forth from the building 121  she went away slowly across the campus wringing her hands and crying pitifully we felt like brutes but what were we to do there were four hundred of us and individuals had to be sacrificed  in one of the laboratories three families had domiciled themselves and that afternoon we found among them no less than four corpses and seven cases of the plague in all its different stages  then it was that the horror began leaving the dead lie we forced the living ones to segregate themselves in another room the plague began to break out among the rest of us and as fast as the symptoms appeared we sent the stricken ones to these segregated rooms we compelled them to walk there by themselves so as to avoid laying hands on them it was heartrending but still the plague raged among us and room after room was filled with the dead and dying and so we who were yet clean retreated to the next floor and to the next before this sea of the dead that room by room and floor by floor inundated the building  the place became a charnel house and in the middle of the night the survivors fled forth taking nothing with them except arms and ammunition and a heavy store of tinned foods we camped on the opposite side of the campus from the prowlers and while some stood guard others of us volunteered to scout into the city in quest of horses motor cars carts and wagons or anything that would carry our provisions and enable us to emulate the banded workingmen i had seen fighting their way out to the open country  i was one of these scouts and doctor hoyle remembering that his motor car had been left behind in his home garage told me to look for it we scouted in pairs and dombey a young undergraduate accompanied me we had to cross half a mile of the residence portion of the city to get to doctor hoyles home here the buildings stood apart in the midst of trees and grassy lawns and here the fires had played freaks burning whole blocks skipping blocks and often skipping a single house in a block and here too the prowlers were still at their work we carried our automatic pistols openly in our hands and looked desperate enough forsooth to keep them from attacking us but at doctor hoyles house the thing happened untouched by fire even as we came to it the smoke of flames burst forth  the miscreant who had set fire to it staggered down the steps and out along the driveway sticking out of his coat pockets were bottles of whiskey and he was very drunk my first impulse was to shoot him and i have never ceased regretting that i did not staggering and maundering to himself with bloodshot eyes and a raw and bleeding slash down one side of his bewhiskered face he was altogether the most nauseating specimen of degradation and filth i had ever encountered i did not shoot him and he leaned against a tree on the lawn to let us go by it was the most absolute wanton act just as we were opposite him he suddenly drew a pistol and shot dombey through the head the next instant i shot him but it was too late dombey expired without a groan immediately i doubt if he even knew what had happened to him  leaving the two corpses i hurried on past the burning house to the garage and there found doctor hoyles motor car the tanks were filled with gasoline and it was ready for use and it was in this car that i threaded the streets of the ruined city and came back to the survivors on the campus the other scouts returned but none had been so fortunate professor fairmead had found a shetland pony but the poor creature tied in a stable and abandoned for days was so weak from want of food and water that it could carry no burden at all some of the men were for turning it loose but i insisted that we should lead it along with us so that if we got out of food we would have it to eat  there were fortyseven of us when we started many being women and children the president of the faculty an old man to begin with and now hopelessly broken by the awful happenings of the past week rode in the motor car with several young children and the aged mother of professor fairmead wathope a young professor of english who had a grievous bulletwound in his leg drove the car the rest of us walked professor fairmead leading the pony  it was what should have been a bright summer day but the smoke from the burning world filled the sky through which the sun shone murkily a dull and lifeless orb bloodred and ominous but we had grown accustomed to that bloodred sun with the smoke it was different it bit into our nostrils and eyes and there was not one of us whose eyes were not bloodshot we directed our course to the southeast through the endless miles of suburban residences travelling along where the first swells of low hills rose from the flat of the central city it was by this way only that we could expect to gain the country  our progress was painfully slow the women and children could not walk fast they did not dream of walking my grandsons in the way all people walk today in truth none of us knew how to walk it was not until after the plague that i learned really to walk so it was that the pace of the slowest was the pace of all for we dared not separate on account of the prowlers there were not so many now of these human beasts of prey the plague had already well diminished their numbers but enough still lived to be a constant menace to us many of the beautiful residences were untouched by fire yet smoking ruins were everywhere the prowlers too seemed to have got over their insensate desire to burn and it was more rarely that we saw houses freshly on fire  several of us scouted among the private garages in search of motor cars and gasoline but in this we were unsuccessful the first great flights from the cities had swept all such utilities away calgan a fine young man was lost in this work he was shot by prowlers while crossing a lawn yet this was our only casualty though once a drunken brute deliberately opened fire on all of us luckily he fired wildly and we shot him before he had done any hurt  at fruitvale still in the heart of the magnificent residence section of the city the plague again smote us professor fairmead was the victim making signs to us that his mother was not to know he turned aside into the grounds of a beautiful mansion he sat down forlornly on the steps of the front veranda and i having lingered waved him a last farewell that night several miles beyond fruitvale and still in the city we made camp and that night we shifted camp twice to get away from our dead in the morning there were thirty of us i shall never forget the president of the faculty during the mornings march his wife who was walking betrayed the fatal symptoms and when she drew aside to let us go on he insisted on leaving the motor car and remaining with her there was quite a discussion about this but in the end we gave in it was just as well for we knew not which ones of us if any might ultimately escape  that night the second of our march we camped beyond haywards in the first stretches of country and in the morning there were eleven of us that lived also during the night wathope the professor with the wounded leg deserted us in the motor car he took with him his sister and his mother and most of our tinned provisions it was that day in the afternoon while resting by the wayside that i saw the last airship i shall ever see the smoke was much thinner here in the country and i first sighted the ship drifting and veering helplessly at an elevation of two thousand feet what had happened i could not conjecture but even as we looked we saw her bow dip down lower and lower then the bulkheads of the various gaschambers must have burst for quite perpendicular she fell like a plummet to the earth  illustration she fell like a plummet to the earth 132  and from that day to this i have not seen another airship often and often during the next few years i scanned the sky for them hoping against hope that somewhere in the world civilization had survived but it was not to be what happened with us in california must have happened with everybody everywhere  another day and at niles there were three of us beyond niles in the middle of the highway we found wathope the motor car had broken down and there on the rugs which they had spread on the ground lay the bodies of his sister his mother and himself  wearied by the unusual exercise of continual walking that night i slept heavily in the morning i was alone in the world canfield and parsons my last companions were dead of the plague of the four hundred that sought shelter in the chemistry building and of the fortyseven that began the march i alone remainedi and the shetland pony why this should be so there is no explaining i did not catch the plague that is all i was immune i was merely the one lucky man in a millionjust as every survivor was one in a million or rather in several millions for the proportion was at least that     v  for two days i sheltered in a pleasant grove where there had been no deaths in those two days while badly depressed and believing that my turn would come at any moment nevertheless i rested and recuperated so did the pony and on the third day putting what small store of tinned provisions i possessed on the ponys back i started on across a very lonely land not a live man woman or child did i encounter though the dead were everywhere food however was abundant the land then was not as it is now it was all cleared of trees and brush and it was cultivated the food for millions of mouths was growing ripening and going to waste from the fields and orchards i gathered vegetables fruits and berries around the deserted farmhouses i got eggs and caught chickens and frequently i found supplies of tinned provisions in the storerooms  a strange thing was what was taking place with all the domestic animals everywhere they were going wild and preying on one another the chickens and ducks were the first to be destroyed while the pigs were the first to go wild followed by the cats nor were the dogs long in adapting themselves to the changed conditions there was a veritable plague of dogs they devoured the corpses barked and howled during the nights and in the daytime slunk about in the distance as the time went by i noticed a change in their behavior at first they were apart from one another very suspicious and very prone to fight but after a not very long while they began to come together and run in packs the dog you see always was a social animal and this was true before ever he came to be domesticated by man in the last days of the world before the plague there were many many very different kinds of dogsdogs without hair and dogs with warm fur dogs so small that they would make scarcely a mouthful for other dogs that were as large as mountain lions well all the small dogs and the weak types were killed by their fellows also the very large ones were not adapted for the wild life and bred out as a result the many different kinds of dogs disappeared and there remained running in packs the mediumsized wolfish dogs that you know today  but the cats dont run in packs granser hoohoo objected  the cat was never a social animal as one writer in the nineteenth century said the cat walks by himself he always walked by himself from before the time he was tamed by man down through the long ages of domestication to today when once more he is wild  the horses also went wild and all the fine breeds we had degenerated into the small mustang horse you know today the cows likewise went wild as did the pigeons and the sheep and that a few of the chickens survived you know yourself but the wild chicken of today is quite a different thing from the chickens we had in those days  but i must go on with my story i travelled through a deserted land as the time went by i began to yearn more and more for human beings but i never found one and i grew lonelier and lonelier i crossed livermore valley and the mountains between it and the great valley of the san joaquin you have never seen that valley but it is very large and it is the home of the wild horse there are great droves there thousands and tens of thousands i revisited it thirty years after so i know you think there are lots of wild horses down here in the coast valleys but they are as nothing compared with those of the san joaquin strange to say the cows when they went wild went back into the lower mountains evidently they were better able to protect themselves there  in the country districts the ghouls and prowlers had been less in evidence for i found many villages and towns untouched by fire but they were filled by the pestilential dead and i passed by without exploring them it was near lathrop that out of my loneliness i picked up a pair of collie dogs that were so newly free that they were urgently willing to return to their allegiance to man these collies accompanied me for many years and the strains of them are in those very dogs there that you boys have today but in sixty years the collie strain has worked out these brutes are more like domesticated wolves than anything else  harelip rose to his feet glanced to see that the goats were safe and looked at the suns position in the afternoon sky advertising impatience at the prolixity of the old mans tale urged to hurry by edwin granser went on  there is little more to tell with my two dogs and my pony and riding a horse i had managed to capture i crossed the san joaquin and went on to a wonderful valley in the sierras called yosemite in the great hotel there i found a prodigious supply of tinned provisions the pasture was abundant as was the game and the river that ran through the valley was full of trout i remained there three years in an utter loneliness that none but a man who has once been highly civilized can understand then i could stand it no more i felt that i was going crazy like the dog i was a social animal and i needed my kind i reasoned that since i had survived the plague there was a possibility that others had survived also i reasoned that after three years the plague germs must all be gone and the land be clean again  illustration with my horse and dogs and pony i set out 144  with my horse and dogs and pony i set out again i crossed the san joaquin valley the mountains beyond and came down into livermore valley the change in those three years was amazing all the land had been splendidly tilled and now i could scarcely recognize it such was the sea of rank vegetation that had overrun the agricultural handiwork of man you see the wheat the vegetables and orchard trees had always been cared for and nursed by man so that they were soft and tender the weeds and wild bushes and such things on the contrary had always been fought by man so that they were tough and resistant as a result when the hand of man was removed the wild vegetation smothered and destroyed practically all the domesticated vegetation the coyotes were greatly increased and it was at this time that i first encountered wolves straying in twos and threes and small packs down from the regions where they had always persisted  it was at lake temescal not far from the onetime city of oakland that i came upon the first live human beings oh my grandsons how can i describe to you my emotion when astride my horse and dropping down the hillside to the lake i saw the smoke of a campfire rising through the trees almost did my heart stop beating i felt that i was going crazy then i heard the cry of a babea human babe and dogs barked and my dogs answered i did not know but what i was the one human alive in the whole world it could not be true that here were otherssmoke and the cry of a babe  emerging on the lake there before my eyes not a hundred yards away i saw a man a large man he was standing on an outjutting rock and fishing i was overcome i stopped my horse i tried to call out but could not i waved my hand it seemed to me that the man looked at me but he did not appear to wave then i laid my head on my arms there in the saddle i was afraid to look again for i knew it was an hallucination and i knew that if i looked the man would be gone and so precious was the hallucination that i wanted it to persist yet a little while i knew too that as long as i did not look it would persist  thus i remained until i heard my dogs snarling and a mans voice what do you think the voice said i will tell you it said where in hell did you come from  those were the words the exact words that was what your other grandfather said to me harelip when he greeted me there on the shore of lake temescal fiftyseven years ago and they were the most ineffable words i have ever heard i opened my eyes and there he stood before me a large dark hairy man heavyjawed slantbrowed fierceeyed how i got off my horse i do not know but it seemed that the next i knew i was clasping his hand with both of mine and crying i would have embraced him but he was ever a narrowminded suspicious man and he drew away from me yet did i cling to his hand and cry  gransers voice faltered and broke at the recollection and the weak tears streamed down his cheeks while the boys looked on and giggled  yet did i cry he continued and desire to embrace him though the chauffeur was a brute a perfect brutethe most abhorrent man i have ever known his name was strange how i have forgotten his name everybody called him chauffeurit was the name of his occupation and it stuck that is how to this day the tribe he founded is called the chauffeur tribe  illustration everybody called him chauffeur 149  he was a violent unjust man why the plague germs spared him i can never understand it would seem in spite of our old metaphysical notions about absolute justice that there is no justice in the universe why did he livean iniquitous moral monster a blot on the face of nature a cruel relentless bestial cheat as well all he could talk about was motor cars machinery gasoline and garagesand especially and with huge delight of his mean pilferings and sordid swindlings of the persons who had employed him in the days before the coming of the plague and yet he was spared while hundreds of millions yea billions of better men were destroyed  illustration vesta the one woman 150  i went on with him to his camp and there i saw her vesta the one woman it was glorious and pitiful there she was vesta van warden the young wife of john van warden clad in rags with marred and scarred and toilcalloused hands bending over the campfire and doing scullion workshe vesta who had been born to the purple of the greatest baronage of wealth the world had ever known john van warden her husband worth one billion eight hundred millions and president of the board of industrial magnates had been the ruler of america also sitting on the international board of control he had been one of the seven men who ruled the world and she herself had come of equally noble stock her father philip saxon had been president of the board of industrial magnates up to the time of his death this office was in process of becoming hereditary and had philip saxon had a son that son would have succeeded him but his only child was vesta the perfect flower of generations of the highest culture this planet has ever produced it was not until the engagement between vesta and van warden took place that saxon indicated the latter as his successor it was i am sure a political marriage i have reason to believe that vesta never really loved her husband in the mad passionate way of which the poets used to sing it was more like the marriages that obtained among crowned heads in the days before they were displaced by the magnates  illustration there she was boiling fishchowder 153  and there she was boiling fishchowder in a sootcovered pot her glorious eyes inflamed by the acrid smoke of the open fire hers was a sad story she was the one survivor in a million as i had been as the chauffeur had been on a crowning eminence of the alameda hills overlooking san francisco bay van warden had built a vast summer palace it was surrounded by a park of a thousand acres when the plague broke out van warden sent her there armed guards patrolled the boundaries of the park and nothing entered in the way of provisions or even mail matter that was not first fumigated and yet did the plague enter killing the guards at their posts the servants at their tasks sweeping away the whole army of retainersor at least all of them who did not flee to die elsewhere so it was that vesta found herself the sole living person in the palace that had become a charnel house  now the chauffeur had been one of the servants that ran away returning two months afterward he discovered vesta in a little summer pavilion where there had been no deaths and where she had established herself he was a brute she was afraid and she ran away and hid among the trees that night on foot she fled into the mountainsshe whose tender feet and delicate body had never known the bruise of stones nor the scratch of briars he followed and that night he caught her he struck her do you understand he beat her with those terrible fists of his and made her his slave it was she who had to gather the firewood build the fires cook and do all the degrading camplaborshe who had never performed a menial act in her life these things he compelled her to do while he a proper savage elected to lie around camp and look on he did nothing absolutely nothing except on occasion to hunt meat or catch fish  good for chauffeur harelip commented in an undertone to the other boys i remember him before he died he was a corker but he did things and he made things go you know dad married his daughter an you ought to see the way he knocked the spots outa dad the chauffeur was a sonofagun he made us kids stand around even when he was croaking he reached out for me once an laid my head open with that long stick he kept always beside him  harelip rubbed his bullet head reminiscently and the boys returned to the old man who was maundering ecstatically about vesta the squaw of the founder of the chauffeur tribe  and so i say to you that you cannot understand the awfulness of the situation the chauffeur was a servant understand a servant and he cringed with bowed head to such as she she was a lord of life both by birth and by marriage the destinies of millions such as he she carried in the hollow of her pinkwhite hand and in the days before the plague the slightest contact with such as he would have been pollution oh i have seen it once i remember there was mrs goldwin wife of one of the great magnates it was on a landing stage just as she was embarking in her private dirigible that she dropped her parasol a servant picked it up and made the mistake of handing it to herto her one of the greatest royal ladies of the land she shrank back as though he were a leper and indicated her secretary to receive it also she ordered her secretary to ascertain the creatures name and to see that he was immediately discharged from service and such a woman was vesta van warden and her the chauffeur beat and made his slave  illustration and her the chauffeur beat and made his slave 158  billthat was it bill the chauffeur that was his name he was a wretched primitive man wholly devoid of the finer instincts and chivalrous promptings of a cultured soul no there is no absolute justice for to him fell that wonder of womanhood vesta van warden the grievousness of this you will never understand my grandsons for you are yourselves primitive little savages unaware of aught else but savagery why should vesta not have been mine i was a man of culture and refinement a professor in a great university even so in the time before the plague such was her exalted position she would not have deigned to know that i existed mark then the abysmal degradation to which she fell at the hands of the chauffeur nothing less than the destruction of all mankind had made it possible that i should know her look in her eyes converse with her touch her handay and love her and know that her feelings toward me were very kindly i have reason to believe that she even she would have loved me there being no other man in the world except the chauffeur why when it destroyed eight billions of souls did not the plague destroy just one more man and that man the chauffeur  once when the chauffeur was away fishing she begged me to kill him with tears in her eyes she begged me to kill him but he was a strong and violent man and i was afraid afterwards i talked with him i offered him my horse my pony my dogs all that i possessed if he would give vesta to me and he grinned in my face and shook his head he was very insulting he said that in the old days he had been a servant had been dirt under the feet of men like me and of women like vesta and that now he had the greatest lady in the land to be servant to him and cook his food and nurse his brats you had your day before the plague he said but this is my day and a damned good day it is i wouldnt trade back to the old times for anything such words he spoke but they are not his words he was a vulgar lowminded man and vile oaths fell continually from his lips  also he told me that if he caught me making eyes at his woman hed wring my neck and give her a beating as well what was i to do i was afraid he was a brute that first night when i discovered the camp vesta and i had great talk about the things of our vanished world we talked of art and books and poetry and the chauffeur listened and grinned and sneered he was bored and angered by our way of speech which he did not comprehend and finally he spoke up and said and this is vesta van warden onetime wife of van warden the magnatea high and stuckup beauty who is now my squaw eh professor smith times is changed times is changed here you woman take off my moccasins and lively about it i want professor smith to see how well i have you trained  i saw her clench her teeth and the flame of revolt rise in her face he drew back his gnarled fist to strike and i was afraid and sick at heart i could do nothing to prevail against him so i got up to go and not be witness to such indignity but the chauffeur laughed and threatened me with a beating if i did not stay and behold and i sat there perforce by the campfire on the shore of lake temescal and saw vesta vesta van warden kneel and remove the moccasins of that grinning hairy apelike human brute  oh you do not understand my grandsons you have never known anything else and you do not understand  halterbroke and bridlewise the chauffeur gloated while she performed that dreadful menial task a trifle balky at times professor a trifle balky but a clout alongside the jaw makes her as meek and gentle as a lamb  and another time he said weve got to start all over and replenish the earth and multiply youre handicapped professor you aint got no wife and were up against a regular gardenofeden proposition but i aint proud ill tell you what professor he pointed at their little infant barely a year old theres your wife though youll have to wait till she grows up its rich aint it were all equals here and im the biggest toad in the splash but i aint stuck upnot i i do you the honor professor smith the very great honor of betrothing to you my and vesta van wardens daughter aint it cussed bad that van warden aint here to see     vi  i lived three weeks of infinite torment there in the chauffeurs camp and then one day tiring of me or of what to him was my bad effect on vesta he told me that the year before wandering through the contra costa hills to the straits of carquinez across the straits he had seen a smoke this meant that there were still other human beings and that for three weeks he had kept this inestimably precious information from me i departed at once with my dogs and horses and journeyed across the contra costa hills to the straits i saw no smoke on the other side but at port costa discovered a small steel barge on which i was able to embark my animals old canvas which i found served me for a sail and a southerly breeze fanned me across the straits and up to the ruins of vallejo here on the outskirts of the city i found evidences of a recently occupied camp  illustration found evidences of a recently occupied camp 169  many clamshells showed me why these humans had come to the shores of the bay this was the santa rosa tribe and i followed its track along the old railroad right of way across the salt marshes to sonoma valley here at the old brickyard at glen ellen i came upon the camp there were eighteen souls all told two were old men one of whom was jones a banker the other was harrison a retired pawnbroker who had taken for wife the matron of the state hospital for the insane at napa of all the persons of the city of napa and of all the other towns and villages in that rich and populous valley she had been the onlysurvivor next there were the three young mencardiff and hale who had been farmers and wainwright a common daylaborer all three had found wives to hale a crude illiterate farmer had fallen isadore the greatest prize next to vesta of the women who came through the plague she was one of the worlds most noted singers and the plague had caught her at san francisco she has talked with me for hours at a time telling me of her adventures until at last rescued by hale in the mendocino forest reserve there had remained nothing for her to do but become his wife but hale was a good fellow in spite of his illiteracy he had a keen sense of justice and rightdealing and she was far happier with him than was vesta with the chauffeur  the wives of cardiff and wainwright were ordinary women accustomed to toil with strong constitutionsjust the type for the wild new life which they were compelled to live in addition were two adult idiots from the feebleminded home at eldredge and five or six young children and infants born after the formation of the santa rosa tribe also there was bertha she was a good woman harelip in spite of the sneers of your father her i took for wife she was the mother of your father edwin and of yours hoohoo and it was our daughter vera who married your father harelipyour father sandow who was the oldest son of vesta van warden and the chauffeur  and so it was that i became the nineteenth member of the santa rosa tribe there were only two outsiders added after me one was mungerson descended from the magnates who wandered alone in the wilds of northern california for eight years before he came south and joined us he it was who waited twelve years more before he married my daughter mary the other was johnson the man who founded the utah tribe that was where he came from utah a country that lies very far away from here across the great deserts to the east it was not until twentyseven years after the plague that johnson reached california in all that utah region he reported but three survivors himself one and all men for many years these three men lived and hunted together until at last desperate fearing that with them the human race would perish utterly from the planet they headed westward on the possibility of finding women survivors in california johnson alone came through the great desert where his two companions died he was fortysix years old when he joined us and he married the fourth daughter of isadore and hale and his eldest son married your aunt harelip who was the third daughter of vesta and the chauffeur johnson was a strong man with a will of his own and it was because of this that he seceded from the santa rosans and formed the utah tribe at san jos√© it is a small tribethere are only nine in it but though he is dead such was his influence and the strength of his breed that it will grow into a strong tribe and play a leading part in the recivilization of the planet  there are only two other tribes that we know ofthe los angelitos and the carmelitos the latter started from one man and woman he was called lopez and he was descended from the ancient mexicans and was very black he was a cowherd in the ranges beyond carmel and his wife was a maidservant in the great del monte hotel it was seven years before we first got in touch with the los angelitos they have a good country down there but it is too warm i estimate the present population of the world at between three hundred and fifty and four hundredprovided of course that there are no scattered little tribes elsewhere in the world if there be such we have not heard from them since johnson crossed the desert from utah no word nor sign has come from the east or anywhere else the great world which i knew in my boyhood and early manhood is gone it has ceased to be i am the last man who was alive in the days of the plague and who knows the wonders of that faroff time we who mastered the planetits earth and sea and skyand who were as very gods now live in primitive savagery along the water courses of this california country  but we are increasing rapidlyyour sister harelip already has four children we are increasing rapidly and making ready for a new climb toward civilization in time pressure of population will compel us to spread out and a hundred generations from now we may expect our descendants to start across the sierras oozing slowly along generation by generation over the great continent to the colonization of the easta new aryan drift around the world  but it will be slow very slow we have so far to climb we fell so hopelessly far if only one physicist or one chemist had survived but it was not to be and we have forgotten everything the chauffeur started working in iron he made the forge which we use to this day but he was a lazy man and when he died he took with him all he knew of metals and machinery what was i to know of such things i was a classical scholar not a chemist the other men who survived were not educated only two things did the chauffeur accomplishthe brewing of strong drink and the growing of tobacco it was while he was drunk once that he killed vesta i firmly believe that he killed vesta in a fit of drunken cruelty though he always maintained that she fell into the lake and was drowned  and my grandsons let me warn you against the medicinemen they call themselves doctors travestying what was once a noble profession but in reality they are medicinemen devildevil men and they make for superstition and darkness they are cheats and liars but so debased and degraded are we that we believe their lies they too will increase in numbers as we increase and they will strive to rule us yet are they liars and charlatans look at young crosseyes posing as a doctor selling charms against sickness giving good hunting exchanging promises of fair weather for good meat and skins sending the deathstick performing a thousand abominations yet i say to you that when he says he can do these things he lies i professor smith professor james howard smith say that he lies i have told him so to his teeth why has he not sent me the deathstick because he knows that with me it is without avail but you harelip so deeply are you sunk in black superstition that did you awake this night and find the deathstick beside you you would surely die and you would die not because of any virtues in the stick but because you are a savage with the dark and clouded mind of a savage  the doctors must be destroyed and all that was lost must be discovered over again wherefore earnestly i repeat unto you certain things which you must remember and tell to your children after you you must tell them that when water is made hot by fire there resides in it a wonderful thing called steam which is stronger than ten thousand men and which can do all mans work for him there are other very useful things in the lightning flash resides a similarly strong servant of man which was of old his slave and which some day will be his slave again  illustration i have stored many books in a cave 179  quite a different thing is the alphabet it is what enables me to know the meaning of fine markings whereas you boys know only rude picturewriting in that dry cave on telegraph hill where you see me often go when the tribe is down by the sea i have stored many books in them is great wisdom also with them i have placed a key to the alphabet so that one who knows picturewriting may also know print some day men will read again and then if no accident has befallen my cave they will know that professor james howard smith once lived and saved for them the knowledge of the ancients  there is another little device that men inevitably will rediscover it is called gunpowder it was what enabled us to kill surely and at long distances certain things which are found in the ground when combined in the right proportions will make this gunpowder what these things are i have forgotten or else i never knew but i wish i did know then would i make powder and then would i certainly kill crosseyes and rid the land of superstition  after i am mangrown i am going to give crosseyes all the goats and meat and skins i can get so that hell teach me to be a doctor hoohoo asserted and when i know ill make everybody else sit up and take notice theyll get down in the dirt to me you bet  the old man nodded his head solemnly and murmured  strange it is to hear the vestiges and remnants of the complicated aryan speech falling from the lips of a filthy little skinclad savage all the world is topsyturvy and it has been topsyturvy ever since the plague  you wont make me sit up harelip boasted to the wouldbe medicineman if i paid you for a sending of the deathstick and it didnt work id bust in your headunderstand you hoohoo you  im going to get granser to remember this here gunpowder stuff edwin said softly and then ill have you all on the run you harelip will do my fighting for me and get my meat for me and you hoohoo will send the deathstick for me and make everybody afraid and if i catch harelip trying to bust your head hoohoo ill fix him with that same gunpowder granser aint such a fool as you think and im going to listen to him and some day ill be boss over the whole bunch of you  the old man shook his head sadly and said  the gunpowder will come nothing can stop itthe same old story over and over man will increase and men will fight the gunpowder will enable men to kill millions of men and in this way only by fire and blood will a new civilization in some remote day be evolved and of what profit will it be just as the old civilization passed so will the new it may take fifty thousand years to build but it will pass all things pass only remain cosmic force and matter ever in flux ever acting and reacting and realizing the eternal typesthe priest the soldier and the king out of the mouths of babes comes the wisdom of all the ages some will fight some will rule some will pray and all the rest will toil and suffer sore while on their bleeding carcasses is reared again and yet again without end the amazing beauty and surpassing wonder of the civilized state it were just as well that i destroyed those cavestored bookswhether they remain or perish all their old truths will be discovered their old lies lived and handed down what is the profit  harelip leaped to his feet giving a quick glance at the pasturing goats and the afternoon sun  gee he muttered to edwin the old geezer gets more longwinded every day lets pull for camp  while the other two aided by the dogs assembled the goats and started them for the trail through the forest edwin stayed by the old man and guided him in the same direction when they reached the old right of way edwin stopped suddenly and looked back harelip and hoohoo and the dogs and the goats passed on edwin was looking at a small herd of wild horses which had come down on the hard sand there were at least twenty of them young colts and yearlings and mares led by a beautiful stallion which stood in the foam at the edge of the surf with arched neck and bright wild eyes sniffing the salt air from off the sea  what is it granser queried  horses was the answer first time i ever seen em on the beach its the mountain lions getting thicker and thicker and driving em down  the low sun shot red shafts of light fanshaped up from a cloudtumbled horizon and close at hand in the white waste of shorelashed waters the sealions bellowing their old primeval chant hauled up out of the sea on the black rocks and fought and loved  come on granser edwin prompted and old man and boy skinclad and barbaric turned and went along the right of way into the forest in the wake of the goats  the end
