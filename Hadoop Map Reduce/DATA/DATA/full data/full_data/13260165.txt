governorgeneral of bengal   speech in general reply  continued  june 1794     speech  in  general reply  fifth day saturday june 7 1794   my lordswe will now resume the consideration of the remaining part of our charge and of the prisoners attempts to defend himself against it  mr hastings well knowing what your lordships must also by this time be perfectly satisfied was the case that this unfortunate nabob had no will of his own draws down his poor victim to chunar by an order to attend the governorgeneral if the nabob ever wrote to mr hastings expressing a request or desire for this meeting his letter was unquestionably dictated to him by the prisoner we have laid a ground of direct proof before you that the nabobs being at chunar that his proceedings there and that all his acts were so dictated and consequently must be so construed  i shall now proceed to lay before your lordships the acts of oppression committed by mr hastings through his two miserable instruments the one his passive instrument the nabob the other mr middleton his active instrument in his subsequent plans for the entire destruction of that country in page 513 of the printed minutes you have mr middletons declaration of his promptitude to represent everything agreeably to mr hastingss wishes       my dear siri have this day answered your public letter in the      form you seemed to expect i hope there is nothing in it that may      to you appear too pointed if you wish the matter to be otherwise      understood than i have taken up and stated it i need not say i      shall be ready to conform to whatever you may prescribe and to      take upon myself any share of the blame of the hitherto      nonperformance of the stipulations made on behalf of the nabob      though i do assure you i myself represented to his excellency and      the ministers conceiving it to be your desire that the apparent      assumption of the reins of his government for in that light he      undoubtedly considered it at the first view as specified in the      agreement executed by him was not meant to be fully and literally      enforced but that it was necessary you should have something to      show on your side as the company were deprived of a benefit      without a requital and upon the faith of this assurance alone i      believe i may safely affirm his excellencys objections to signing      the treaty were given up if i have understood the matter wrong or      misconceived your design i am truly sorry for it however it is      not too late to correct the error and i am ready to undertake      and god willing to carry through whatever you may on the      receipt of my public letter tell me is your final resolve       if you determine at all events that the measures of reducing the      nabobs army c shall be immediately undertaken i shall take it      as a particular favor if you will indulge me with a line at      fyzabad that i may make the necessary previous arrangements with      respect to the disposal of my family which i would not wish to      retain here in the event either of a rupture with the nabob or      the necessity of employing our forces on the reduction of his      aumils and troops this done i can begin the work in three days      after my return from fyzabad  besides this letter which i think is sufficiently clear upon the subject there is also another much more clear upon your lordships minutes much more distinct and much more pointed expressive of his being resolved to make such representations of every matter as the governorgeneral may wish now a man who is master of the manner in which facts are represented and whose subsequent conduct is to be justified by such representations is not simply accountable for his conduct he is accountable for culpably attempting to form on false premises the judgment of others upon that conduct this species of delinquency must therefore be added to the rest and i wish your lordships to carry generally in your minds that there is not one single syllable of representation made by any of those parties except where truth may happen to break out in spite of all the means of concealment which is not to be considered as the representation of mr hastings himself in justification of his own conduct  the letter which i have just now read was written preparatory to the transaction which i am now going to state called the treaty of chunar having brought his miserable victim thither he forced him to sign a paper called a treaty but such was the fraud in every part of this treaty that mr middleton himself who was the instrument and the chief agent in it acknowledges that the nabob was persuaded to sign it by the assurance given to him that it never was to be executed here then your lordships have a prince first compelled to enter into a negotiation and then induced to accede to a treaty by false assurances that it should not be executed which he declares nothing but force should otherwise have compelled him to accede to  the first circumstance in this transaction that i shall lay before your lordships is that the treaty is declared to have for its objects two modes of relieving the nabob from his distressesfrom distresses which we have stated and which mr hastings has not only fully admitted but has himself proved in the clearest manner to your lordships the first was by taking away that wicked rabble the british troops represented by mr hastings as totally ruinous to the nabobs affairs and particularly by removing that part of them which was called the new brigade another remedial part of the treaty regarded the british pensioners it is in proof before your lordships that mr hastings agreed to recall from oude that body of pensioners whose conduct there is described in such strong terms as being ruinous to the vizier and to all his affairs these pensioners mr hastings engaged to recall but he never did recall them we refer your lordships to the evidence before you in proof that these odious pensioners so distressing to the nabob so ruinous to his affairs and so disgraceful to our government were not only not recalled by mr hastings but that both afterwards and upon the very day of signing the treaty as mr middleton himself tells you upon that very day i say he recommended to the nabob that these pensioners might remain upon that very establishment which by a solemn treaty of his own making and his own dictating he had agreed to relieve from this intolerable burden  mr hastings your lordships will remember had departed from benares frustrated in his designs of extorting 500000l from the rajah for the companys use he had ravaged the country without obtaining any benefit for his masters the british soldiers having divided the only spoil and nothing remaining for the share of his employers but disgrace he was therefore afraid to return without having something of a lucrative pecuniary nature to exhibit to the company having this object in view oude appears to have first presented itself to his notice as a country from which some advantage of a pecuniary kind might be derived and accordingly he turned in his head a vast variety of stratagems for effecting his purpose  the first article that occurs in the treaty of chunar is a power given to the nabob to resume all the jaghires not guarantied by the company and to give pensions to all those persons who should be removed from their jaghires  now the first thing which would naturally occur to a man who was going to raise a revenue through the intervention of the prince of the country would be to recommend to that prince a better economy in his affairs and a rational and equal assessment upon his subjects in order to furnish the amount of the demand which he was about to make upon him i need not tell your lordships trained and formed as your minds are to the rules and orders of good government that there is no way by which a prince can justly assess his subjects but by assessing them all in proportion to their respective abilities and that if a prince should make such a body as the house of lords in this kingdom which comes near the case i am going to state separately the subject of assessment such a thing would be contrary to all the principles of regular and just taxation in any country in the universe some men may possibly by locality or privileges be excepted from certain taxes but no taxation ever can be just that is thrown upon some particular class only and if that class happen to be small and the demand great the injustice done is directly proportionable to the greatness of the exaction and inversely to the number of the persons who are the objects of it these are clear irrefragable and eternal principles but if instead of exacting a part by a proportionable rate the prince should go further and attempt to shake the whole mass of property itself a mass perhaps not much less than that which is possessed by the whole peers of great britain by confiscating the whole of the estates at once as a government resource without the charge or pretence of any crime i say that such an act would be oppressive cruel and wicked in the highest degree yet this is what mr hastings projected and actually did accomplish  my lords at the treaty of chunar as it is called mr hastings for he always artfully feels his way as he proceeds first says that the nabob shall be permitted to do this act if he pleases he does not assume the government he does not compel the nabob to do anything he does not force upon him this abandoned and wicked confiscation of the property of the whole nobility of a great country all that he says is thisthe nabob may be permitted to resume these jaghires why permitted if the act had been legal proper and justifiable he did not want our permission he was a sovereign in his own dominions but mr hastings recollected that some of these jaghires as they are called and on which i shall say a very few words to your lordships were guarantied by the company the jaghires of his own house of his mother and grandmother were guarantied by us i must inform your lordships that upon some of our other exactions at an earlier period the nabob had endeavored to levy a forced loan upon the jaghiredars this forced loan was made and submitted to by those people upon a direct assurance of their rights in the jaghires which right was guarantied by the british resident not only to the begums and to the whole family of the nabob but also to all the other objects of the tax  before i proceed i will beg leave to state to you briefly the nature of these jaghires the jaghiredars the holders of jaghires form the body of the principal mahometan nobility the great nobility of that country are divided into two parts one part consists of the zemindars who are the ancient proprietors of land and the hereditary nobility of the country these are mostly gentoos the mahometans form the other part whose whole interest in the land consists in the jaghires for very few indeed of them are zemindars anywhere in some of the provinces none of them are so the whole of them are jaghiredars  we have heard my lords much discussion about jaghires it is in proof before your lordships that they are of two sorts that a jaghire signifies exactly what the word fee does in the english language or feodum in the barbarous latin of the feudists that it is a word which signifies a salary or a maintenance as did originally the english word fee derived from the word feod and feodum these jaghires like other fees and like other feods were given in land as a maintenance some with the condition of service some without any condition some were annexed to an office some were granted as the support of a dignity and none were granted for a less term than life except those that were immediately annexed to a lease we have shown your lordships and in this we have followed the example of mr hastings that some of them are fees granted actually in perpetuity and in fact many of them are so granted we are farther to tell your lordships that by the custom of the empire they are almost all grown as the feods in europe are grown by use into something which is at least virtually an inheritance this is the state of the jaghires and jaghiredars  among these jaghires we find what your lordships would expect to find an ample provision for all the nobility of that illustrious family of which the nabob is the head a prince whose family both by father and mother notwithstanding the slander of the prisoner against his benefactor was undoubtedly of the first and most distinguished nobility of the mahometan empire accordingly his uncles all his near relations his mother grandmother all possessed jaghires some of very long standing and most of them not given by the nabob  i take some pains in explaining this business because i trust your lordships will have a strong feeling against any confiscation for the purpose of revenue believe me my lords if there is anything which will root the present order of things out of europe it will begin as we see it has already begun in a neighboring country by confiscating for the purposes of the state grants made to classes of men let them be held by what names or be supposed susceptible of what abuses soever i will venture to say that jacobinism never can strike a more deadly blow against property rank and dignity than your lordships if you were to acquit this man would strike against your own dignity and the very being of the society in which we live  your lordships will find in your printed minutes who the jaghiredars were and what was the amount of their estates the jaghires of which mr hastings authorized the confiscation or what he calls a resumption appear from mr purlings account when first the forced loan was levied upon them under his residentship to amount to 285000l sterling per annum which 285000l if rated and valued according to the different value of provisions and other necessaries of life in that country and in england will amount as near as may be to about 600000l a year i am within compass everybody conversant with india will say it is equivalent at least to 600000l a year in england and what a blow such a confiscation as this would be on the fortunes of the peers of great britain your lordships will judge i like to see your estates as great as they are i wish they were greater than they are but whatever they are i wish above all that they should be perpetual for dignity and property in this country esto perpetua shall be my prayer this day and the last prayer of my life the commons therefore of great britain those guardians of property who will not suffer the monarch they love the government which they adore to levy one shilling upon the subject in any other way than the law and statutes of this kingdom prescribe will not suffer nor can they bear the idea that any single class of people should be chosen to be the objects of a contrary conduct nor that even the nabob of oude should be permitted to act upon such a flagitious principle when an english governor has substituted a power of his own instead of the legal government of the country as i have proved this man to have done if he found the prince going to do an act which would shake the property of all the nobility of the country he surely ought to raise his hand and say you shall not make my name your sanction for such an atrocious and abominable act as this confiscation would be  mr hastings however whilst he gives with an urbanity for which he is so much praised his consent to this confiscation adds there must be pensions secured for all persons losing their estates who had the security of our guaranty your lordships know that mr hastings by his guaranty had secured their jaghires to the nabobs own relations and family one would have imagined that if the estates of those who were without any security were to be confiscated at his pleasure those at least who were guarantied by the company such as the begums of oude and several of the principal nobility of the nabobs family would have been secure he indeed says that pensions shall be given them for at this time he had not got the length of violating without shame or remorse all the guaranties of the company there shall says he be pensions given if pensions were to be given to the value of the estate i ask what has this violent act done you shake the security of property and instead of suffering a man to gather his own profits with his own hands you turn him into a pensioner upon the public treasury i can conceive that such a measure will render these persons miserable dependants instead of independent nobility but i cannot conceive what financial object can be answered by paying that in pension which you are to receive in revenue this is directly contrary to financial economy for when you stipulate to pay out of the treasury of government a certain pension and take upon you the receipts of an estate you adopt a measure by which government is almost sure of being a loser you charge it with a certain fixed sum and even upon a supposition that under the management of the public the estate will be as productive as it was under the management of its private owner a thing highly improbable you take your chance of a reimbursement subject to all the extra expense and to all the accidents that may happen to a public revenue this confiscation could not therefore be justified as a measure of economy it must have been designed merely for the sake of shaking and destroying the property of the country  the whole transaction my lords was an act of gross violence ushered in by a gross fraud it appears that no pensions were ever intended to be paid and this you will naturally guess would be the event when such a strange metamorphosis was to be made as that of turning a great landed interest into a pensionary payment as it could answer no other purpose so it could be intended for no other than that of getting possession of these jaghires by fraud this man my lords cannot commit a robbery without indulging himself at the same time in the practice of his favorite arts of fraud and falsehood  and here i must again remind your lordships that at the time of the treaty of chunar the jaghires were held in the following manner of the 285000l a year which was to be confiscated the old grants of sujah dowlah and the grandfather of the nabob amounted to near two thirds of the whole as you will find in the paper to which we refer you by this confiscation therefore the nabob was authorized to resume grants of which he had not been the grantor      mr burke here read the list of the jaghires  now my lords you see that all these estates except 25782l a year were either jaghires for the nabobs own immediate family settled by his father upon his mother and by his fathers father upon his grandmother and upon salar jung his uncle or were the property of the most considerable nobility to the gross amount of 285000l mr hastings confesses that the nabob reluctantly made the confiscation to the extent proposed why because says he the orderlies namely certain persons so called subservient to his debaucheries were persons whom he wished to spare now i am to show you that this man whatever faults he may have in his private morals with which we have nothing at all to do has been slandered throughout by mr hastings take his own account of the matter the nabob says he would have confiscated all the rest except his orderlies whom he would have spared but i finding where his partiality lay compelled him to sacrifice the whole for otherwise he would have sacrificed the good to save the bad whereas says mr hastings in effect my principle was to sacrifice the good and at the same time to punish the bad now compare the account he gives of the proceedings of asoph ul dowlah with his own asoph ul dowlah to save some unworthy persons who had jaghires would if left to his own discretion have confiscated those only of the deserving while mr hastings to effect the inclusion of the worthless in the confiscation confiscates the jaghires of the innocent and the virtuous men of high rank and of those who had all the ties of nature to plead for the nabobs forbearance and reduced them to a state of dependency and degradation  now supposing these two villanous plans neither of which your lordships can bear to hear the sound of to stand equal in point of morality let us see how they stand in point of calculation the unexceptionable part of the 285000l amounted to 260000l a year whereas supposing every part of the new grants had been made to the most unworthy persons it only amounted to 25000l a year therefore by his own account given to you and to the company upon this occasion he has confiscated 260000l a year the property of innocent if not of meritorious individuals in order to punish by confiscation those who had 25000l a year only this is the account he gives you himself of his honor his justice and his policy in these proceedings  but my lords he shall not escape so it is in your minutes that so far was the nabob from wishing to save the new exceptionable grants that at the time of the forced loan i have mentioned and also when the resumption was proposed he was perfectly willing to give up every one of them and desired only that his mother his uncles and his relations with other individuals the prime of the mahometan nobility of that country should be spared is it not enough that this poor nabob this wretched prince is made a slave to the man now standing at your bar that he is made by him a shame and a scandal to his family his race and his country but he must be cruelly aspersed and have faults and crimes attributed to him that do not belong to him i know nothing of his private character and conduct mr hastings who deals in scandalous anecdotes knows them but i take it upon the face of mr purlings assertion and i say that the nabob would have consented to an arbitrary taxation of the jaghires and would have given up to absolute confiscation every man except those honorable persons i have mentioned  the prisoner himself has called mr wombwell to prove the names of those infamous persons with a partiality for whom mr hastings has aspersed the nabob in order to lay the ground for the destruction of his family they amount to only six in number and when we come to examine these six we find that their jaghires were perfectly contemptible the list of the other jaghiredars your lordships see fills up pages and the amount of their incomes i have already stated your lordships now see how inconsiderable both in number and amount were the culpable jaghires in the destruction of which he has involved the greater number and the meritorious you see that the nabob never did propose any exemption of the former at any time that this was a slander and a calumny on that unhappy man in order to defend the violent acts of the prisoner who has recourse to slander and calumny as a proper way to defend violence outrage and wrongs  we have now gone through the first stage of mr hastingss confiscation of the estates of these unhappy people when it came to be put in execution mr middleton finds the nabob reluctant in the greatest degree to make this sacrifice of his family and of all his nobility it touched him in every way in which shame and sympathy can affect a man he falls at the feet of mr middleton he says i signed the treaty of chunar upon an assurance that it was never meant to be put in force mr middleton nevertheless proceeds he sends the family of the nabob out of the country but he entertains fears of a general revolt as the consequence of this tyrannical act and refers the case back to mr hastings who insists upon its being executed in its utmost extent the nabob again remonstrates in the strongest manner he begs he prays he dissembles he delays one day he pretends to be willing to submit the next he hangs back just as the violence of mr hastings or his own natural feelings and principles of justice dragged him one way or dragged him another mr middleton trembling and under the awe of that dreadful responsibility under which your lordships may remember mr hastings had expressly laid him upon that occasion ventures at once to usurp the nabobs government he usurped it openly and avowedly he declared that he himself would issue his purwannahs as governor of the country for the purpose of executing this abominable confiscation he assumed i say to himself the government of the country and mr hastings had armed him with a strong military force for that purpose he declared he would order those troops to march for his support he at last got this reluctant struggling nabob to consent in the manner we have described  i shall now read to your lordships mr middletons letters that you may hear these men with their own mouths describing their own acts and that your lordships may then judge whether the highest tone and language of crimination comes up to their own description of their own proceedings          lucknow the 6th of dec 1781       finding the nabob wavering in his determination about the      resumption of the jaghires i this day in presence of and with      the ministers concurrence ordered the necessary purwannahs to be      written to the several aumils for that purpose and it was my firm      resolution to have dispatched them this evening with proper people      to see them punctually and implicitly carried into execution but      before they were all transcribed i received a message from the      nabob who had been informed by the minister of the resolution i      had taken entreating that i would withhold the purwannahs till      tomorrow morning when he would attend me and afford me      satisfaction on this point as the loss of a few hours in the      dispatch of the purwannahs appeared of little moment and as it is      possible the nabob seeing that the business will at all events be      done may make it an act of his own i have consented to indulge      him in his request but be the result of our interview whatever it      may nothing shall prevent the orders being issued tomorrow      either by him or myself with the concurrence of the ministers      your pleasure respecting the begums i have learnt from sir elijah      and the measure heretofore proposed will soon follow the resumption      of the jaghires from both or indeed from the former alone i      have no doubt of the complete liquidation of the companys      balance          lucknow the 7th dec 1781       my dear siri had the honor to address you yesterday informing      you of the steps i had taken in regard to the resumption of the      jaghires this morning the vizier came to me according to his      agreement but seemingly without any intention or desire to yield      me satisfaction on the subject under discussion for after a great      deal of conversation consisting on his part of trifling evasion      and puerile excuses for withholding his assent to the measure      though at the same time professing the most implicit submission to      your wishes i found myself without any other resource than the one      of employing that exclusive authority with which i consider your      instructions to vest me i therefore declared to the nabob in      presence of the minister and mr johnson who i desired might bear      witness of the conversation that i construed his rejection of the      measure proposed as a breach of his solemn promise to you and an      unwillingness to yield that assistance which was evidently in his      power towards liquidating his heavy accumulated debt to the      company and that i must in consequence determine in my own      justification to issue immediately the purwannahs which had only      been withheld in the sanguine hope that he would be prevailed upon      to make that his own act which nothing but the most urgent      necessity could force me to make mine he left me without any      reply but afterwards sent for his minister and authorized him to      give me hopes that my requisition would be complied with on which      i expressed my satisfaction but declared that i could admit of no      further delays and unless i received his excellencys formal      acquiescence before the evening i should then most assuredly issue      my purwannahs which i have accordingly done not having had any      assurances from his excellency that could justify a further      suspension i shall as soon as possible inform you of the effect of      the purwannahs which in many parts i am apprehensive it will be      found necessary to enforce with military aid i am not however      entirely without hopes that the nabob when he sees the inefficacy      of further opposition may alter his conduct and prevent the      confusion and disagreeable consequences which would be too likely      to result from the prosecution of a measure of such importance      without his concurrence his excellency talks of going to fyzabad      for the purpose heretofore mentioned in three or four days i wish      he may be serious in this intention and you may rest assured i      shall spare no pains to keep him to it          lucknow 28th december 1781       if your new demand is to be insisted upon which your letter seems      to portend i must beg your precise orders upon it as from the      difficulties i have within these few days experienced in carrying      the points you had enjoined with the nabob i have the best grounds      for believing that he would consider it a direct breach of the late      agreement and totally reject the proposal as such and i must own      to you that in his present fermented state of mind i could      expect nothing less than despair and a declared rupture       he has by no means been yet able to furnish me with means of      paying off the arrears due to the temporary brigade to the      stipulated term of its continuance in his service the funds      necessary for paying off and discharging his own military      establishment under british officers and his pension list have      been raised on the private credit of mr johnson and myself from      the shroffs of this place to whom we are at this moment pledged      for many lacs of rupees and without such aid which i freely and      at all hazards yielded because i conceived it was your anxious      desire to relieve the nabob as soon as possible of this heavy      burden the establishment must have been at his charge to this      time and probably for months to come while his resources were      strained to the utmost to furnish jaidads for its maintenance to      this period i therefore hesitate not to declare it utterly      impossible for him under any circumstances whatever to provide      funds for the payment of the troops you now propose to send him       the wresting furruckabad kyraghur and fyzoola khâns country      from his government for in that light my dear sir i can      faithfully assure you he views the measures adopted in respect to      those countries together with the resumption of all the jaghires      so much against his inclination have already brought the nabob to      a persuasion that nothing less than his destruction or the      annihilation of every shadow of his power is meant and all my      labors to convince him to the contrary have proved abortive a      settled melancholy has seized him and his health is reduced beyond      conception and i do most humbly believe that the march of four      regiments of sepoys towards lucknow under whatever circumstances      it might be represented would be considered by him as a force      ultimately to be used in securing his person in short my dear      sir it is a matter of such immediate moment and involving      apparently such very serious and important consequences that i      have not only taken upon me to suspend the communication of it to      the nabob until i should be honored with your further commands but      have also ventured to write the inclosed letter to colonel morgan      liberties which i confidently trust you will excuse when you      consider that i can be actuated by no other motive than a zeal for      the public service and that if after all you determine that the      measure shall be insisted on it will be only the loss of six or at      most eight days in proposing it but in the last event i earnestly      entreat your orders may be explicit and positive that i may      clearly know what lengths you would wish me to proceed in carrying      them into execution i again declare it is my firm belief and      assure yourself my dear mr hastings i am not influenced in this      declaration by any considerations but my public duty and my      personal attachment to you that the enforcing the measure you have      proposed would be productive of an open rupture between us and the      nabob nay that the first necessary step towards carrying it into      effect must be on our part a declaration of hostility  your lordships have now before your eyes proofs furnished by mr hastings himself from his correspondence with mr middleton irrefragable proofs that this nabob who is stated to have made the proposition himself was dragged to the signature of it and that the troops which are supposed and fraudulently stated and i wish your lordships particularly to observe this to have been sent to assist him in this measure were considered by him as a body of troops sent to imprison him and to free him from all the troubles and pains of government  when mr hastings sent the troops for the purpose as he pretended of assisting the nabob in the execution of a measure which was really adopted in direct opposition to the wishes of that prince what other conclusion could be drawn but that they were sent to overawe not to assist him the march of alien troops into a country upon that occasion could have no object but hostility they could have been sent with no other design but that of bringing disgrace upon the nabob by making him the instrument of his familys ruin and of the destruction of his nobility your lordships therefore will not wonder that this miserable man should have sunk into despair and that he should have felt the weight of his oppression doubly aggravated by its coming from such a man as mr hastings and by its being enforced by such a man as mr middleton  and here i must press one observation upon your lordships i do not know a greater insult that can be offered to a man born to command than to find himself made the tool of a set of obscure men come from an unknown country without anything to distinguish them but an usurped power never shall i out of compliment to any persons because they happen to be my own countrymen disguise my feelings or renounce the dictates of nature and of humanity if we send out obscure people unknowing and unknown to exercise such acts as these i must say it is a bitter aggravation of the victims suffering oppression and robbery are at all times evils but they are more bearable when exercised by persons whom we have been habituated to regard with awe and to whom mankind for ages have been accustomed to bow  now does the history of tyranny furnish does the history of popular violence deposing kings furnish anything like the dreadful deposition of this prince and the cruel and abominable tyranny that has been exercised over him consider too my lords for what object all this was done was mr hastings endeavoring by his arbitrary interference and the use of his superior power to screen a people from the usurpation and power of a tyrantfrom any strong and violent acts against property against dignity against nobility against the freedom of his people no you see here a monarch deposed in effect by persons pretending to be his allies and assigning what are pretended to be his wishes as the motive for using his usurped authority in the execution of these acts of violence against his own family and his subjects you see him struggling against this violent prostitution of his authority he refuses the sanction of his name which before he had given up to mr hastings to be used as he pleased and only begs not to be made an instrument of wrong which his soul abhors and which would make him infamous throughout the world mr middleton however assumes the sovereignty of the country i he says am nabob of oude the jaghires shall be confiscated i have given my orders and they shall be supported by a military force  i am ashamed to have so far distrusted your lordships honorable and generous feelings as to have offered you upon this occasion any remarks which you must have run before me in making those feelings which you have and ought to have feelings born in the breasts of all men and much more in men of your lordships elevated rank render my remarks unnecessary i need not therefore ask what you feel when a foreign resident at a princes court takes upon himself to force that prince to act the part of a tyrant and upon his resistance openly and avowedly assumes the sovereignty of the country you have it in proof that mr middleton did this he not only put his own name to the orders for this horrible confiscation but he actually proceeded to dispossess the jaghiredars of their lands and to send them out of the country and whom does he send in the place of this plundered body of nobility to take possession of the country why the usurers of benares yes my lords he immediately mortgages the whole country to the usurers of benares for the purpose of raising money upon it giving it up to those bloodsuckers dispossessed of that nobility whose interest whose duty whose feelings and whose habits made them the natural protectors of the people  my lords we here see a body of usurers put into possession of all the estates of the nobility let us now see if this act was necessary even for the avowed purposes of its agentsthe relief of the nabobs financial difficulties and the payment of his debts to the company mr middleton has told your lordships that these jaghires would pay the companys debt completely in two years then would it not have been better to have left these estates in the hands of their owners and to have oppressed them in some moderate decent way might they not have left the jaghiredars to raise the sums required by some settlement with the bankers of benares in which the repayment of the money within five or six years might have been secured and the jaghiredars have had in the mean time something to subsist upon oh no these victims must have nothing to live upon they must be turned out and why mr hastings commands it  here i must come in aid of mr middleton a little for one cannot but pity the miserable instruments that have to act under mr hastings i do not mean to apologize for mr middleton but to pity the situation of persons who being servants of the company were converted by the usurpation of this man into his subjects and his slaves the mind of mr middleton revolts you see him reluctant to proceed the nabob begs a respite you find in the resident a willingness to comply even mr middleton is placable mr hastings alone is obdurate his resolution to rob and to destroy was not to be moved and the estates of the whole mahometan nobility of a great kingdom were confiscated in a moment your lordships will observe that his orders to mr middleton allow no forbearance he writes thus to him       sirmy mind has been for some days suspended between two      opposite impulses one arising from the necessity of my return to      calcutta the other from the apprehension of my presence being      more necessary and more urgently wanted at lucknow your answer to      this shall decide my choice       i have waited thus long in the hopes of hearing that some progress      had been made in the execution of the plan which i concluded with      the nabob in september last i do not find that any step towards      it has been yet taken though three months are elapsed and little      more than that period did appear to me requisite to have      accomplished the most essential parts of it and to have brought      the whole into train this tardiness and the opposition prepared      to the only decided act yet undertaken have a bad appearance i      approve the nabobs resolutions to deprive the begums of their      illemployed treasures in both services it must be your care to      prevent an abuse of the powers given to those that are employed in      them you yourself ought to be personally present you must not      allow any negotiation or forbearance but must prosecute both      services until the begums are at the entire mercy of the nabob      their jaghires in the quiet possession of his aumils and their      wealth in such charge as may secure it against private      embezzlement you will have a force more than sufficient to effect      both these purposes       the reformation of his army and the new settlement of his revenues      are also points of immediate concern and ought to be immediately      concluded has anything been done in either       i now demand and require you most solemnly to answer me are you      confident in your own ability to accomplish all these purposes and      the other points of my instructions if you reply that you are i      will depart with a quiet and assured mind to the presidency but      leave you a dreadful responsibility if you disappoint me if you      tell me that you cannot rely upon your power and the other means      which you possess for performing these services i will free you      from the charge i will proceed myself to lucknow and i will      myself undertake them and in that case i desire that you will      immediately order bearers to be stationed for myself and two other      gentlemen between lucknow and allahabad and i will set out from      hence in three days after the receipt of your letter       i am sorry that i am under the necessity of writing in this      pressing manner i trust implicitly to your integrity i am certain      of your attachment to myself and i know that your capacity is      equal to any service but i must express my doubts of your firmness      and activity and above all of your recollection of my      instructions and of their importance my conduct in the late      arrangements will be arraigned with all the rancor of disappointed      rapacity and my reputation and influence will suffer a mortal      wound from the failure of them they have already failed in a      degree since no part of them has yet taken place but the removal      of our forces from the dooab and rohilcund and of the british      officers and pensioners from the service of the nabob and the      expenses of the former thrown without any compensation on the      company       i expect a supply of money equal to the discharge of all the      nabobs arrears and am much disappointed and mortified that i am      not now able to return with it       give me an immediate answer to the question which i have herein      proposed that i may lose no more time in fruitless inaction  about this time mr hastings had received information of our inquiries in the house of commons into his conduct and this is the manner in which he prepares to meet them i must get money i must carry with me that great excuse for everything that salve for every sore that expiation for every crime let me provide that all is well you mr middleton try your nerves are you equal to these services examine yourself see what is in you are you man enough to come up to it says the great robber to the little robber says roland the great to his puny accomplice are you equal to it do you feel yourself a man if not send messengers and dawks to me and i the great master tyrant will come myself and put to shame all the paltry delegate tools of despotism that have not edge enough to cut their way through and do the services i have ordained for them  i have already stated to your lordships his reason and motives for this violence and they are such as aggravated his crime by attempting to implicate his country in it he says he was afraid to go home without having provided for the payment of the nabobs debt afraid of what was he afraid of coming before a british tribunal and saying through justice through a regard for the rights of an allied sovereign through a regard to the rights of his people i have not got so much as i expected of this no man could be afraid the prisoners fear had another origin i have failed says he to himself in my first project i went to benares to rob i have lost by my violence the fruits of that robbery i must get the money somewhere or i dare not appear before a british house of commons a british house of lords or any other tribunal in the kingdom but let me get money enough and they wont care how i get it the estates of whole bodies of nobility may be confiscated a people who had lived under their protection may be given up into the hands of foreign usurers they will care for none of these things they will suffer me to do all this and to employ in it the force of british troops whom i have described as a set of robbers provided i can get money these were mr hastingss views and in accordance with them the jaghires were all confiscated the jaghiredars with their families were all turned out the possessions delivered up to the usurer in order that mr hastings might have the excuse of money to plead at the bar of the house of commons and afterwards at the bar of the house of lords if your lordships in your sacred character of the first tribunal in the world should by your judgment justify those proceedings you will sanction the greatest wrongs that have been ever known in history  but to proceed the next thing to be asked is were the promised pensions given to the jaghiredars i suppose your lordships are not idle enough to put that question to us no compensation no consideration was given or stipulated for them if there had been any such thing the prisoner could have proved ithe would have proved it the means were easy to him but we have saved him the trouble of the attempt we have proved the contrary and if called upon we will show you the place where this is proved  i have now shown your lordships how mr hastings having with such violent and atrocious circumstances usurped the government of oude i hope i need not use any farther proof that the nabob was in effect nonexistent in the country treated all the landed property the next question will be how has he treated whatever moneyed property was left in the country my lords he looked over that immense waste of his own creating not as satan viewed the kingdoms of the world and saw the power and glory of thembut he looked over the waste of oude with a diabolical malice which one could hardly suppose existed in the prototype himself he saw nowhere aboveground one single shilling that he could attachno not one every place had been ravaged no money remained in sight but possibly some might be buried in vaults hid from the gripe of tyranny and rapacity it must be so says he where can i find it how can i get at it there is one illustrious family that is thought to have accumulated a vast body of treasures through a course of three or four successive reigns it does not appear openly but we have good information that very great sums of money are bricked up and kept in vaults under ground and secured under the guard and within the walls of a fortress the residence of the females of the family a guard as your lordships know rendered doubly and trebly secure by the manners of the country which make everything that is in the hands of women sacred it is said that nothing is proof against goldthat the strongest tower will not be impregnable if jupiter makes love in a golden shower this jupiter commences making love but he does not come to the ladies with gold for their persons he comes to their persons for their gold this impetuous lover mr hastings who is not to be stayed from the objects of his passion would annihilate space and time between him and his beloved object the jaghires of these ladies had now first their treasures affection  your lordships have already had a peep behind the curtain in the first orders sent to mr middleton in the treaty of chunar you see a desire obliquely expressed to get the landed estates of all these great families but even while he was meeting with such reluctance in the nabob upon this point and though he also met with some resistance upon the part even of mr middleton mr hastings appears to have given him in charge some other still more obnoxious and dreadful acts while i was meditating says mr middleton in one of his letters upon this the resumption of the jaghires your orders came to me through sir elijah impey what these orders were is left obscure in the letter it is yet but as in a mist or cloud but it is evident that sir elijah impey did convey to him some project for getting at more wealth by some other service which was not to supersede the first but to be concurrent with that upon which mr hastings had before given him such dreadful charges and had loaded him with such horrible responsibility it could not have been anything but the seizure of the begums treasures he thus goaded on two reluctant victimsfirst the reluctant nabob then the reluctant mr middletonforcing them with the bayonet behind them and urging on the former as at last appears to violate the sanctity of his mothers house  your lordships have been already told by one of my able fellow managers that sir elijah impey is the person who carried up the message alluded to in mr middletons letter we have charged it as an aggravation of the offences of the prisoner at your bar that the chiefjustice who by the sacred nature of his office and by the express provisions of the act of parliament under which he was sent out to india to redress the wrongs of the natives should be made an instrument for destroying the property real and personal of this people when it first came to our knowledge that all this private intrigue for the destruction of these high women was carried on through the intrigue of a chiefjustice we felt such shame and such horror both for the instrument and the principal as i think it impossible to describe or for anything but complete and perfect silence to express  but by sir elijah impey was that order carried up to seize and confiscate the treasures of the begums we know that neither the company nor the nabob had any claim whatever upon these treasures on the contrary we know that two treaties had been made for the protection of them we know that the nabob while he was contesting about some elephants and carriages and some other things that he said were in the hands of their steward did allow that the treasures in the custody of his grandmother and of his mothers principal servants were their property this is the nabob who is now represented by mr hastings and his counsel to have become the instrument of destroying his mother and grandmother and everything else that ought to be dear to mankind throughout the whole train of his family  mr hastings having resolved to seize upon the treasures of the begums is at a loss for some pretence of justifying the act his first justification of it is on grounds which all tyrants have ready at their hands he begins to discover a legal title to that of which he wished to be the possessor and on this title sets up a claim to these treasures i say mr hastings set up this claim because by this time i suppose your lordships will not bear to hear the nabobs name on such an occasion the prisoner pretended that by the mahometan law these goods did belong to the nabob but whether they did or did not he had himself been an active instrument in the treaty for securing their possession to the begumsa security which he attempts to unlock by his constructions of the mahometan law having set up this title the guaranty still remained and how is he to get rid of that in his usual way you have rebelled you have taken up arms against your own son for that is the pretext and therefore my guaranty is gone and your goods whether you have a title to them or not are to be confiscated for your rebellion this is his second expedient by way of justification  your lordships will observe the strange situation in which we are here placed if the fact of the rebellion can be proved the discussion of the title to the property in question will be totally useless for if the ladies had actually taken up arms to cut the nabobs throat it would require no person to come from the dead to prove to us that the nabob but not mr hastings had a right for his own security and for his own indemnification to take those treasures which whether they belonged to him or not were employed in hostilities against him the law of selfdefence is above every other law and if any persons draw the sword against you violence on your part is justified and you may use your sword to take from them that property by which they have been enabled to draw their sword against you  but the prisoners counsel do not trust to this justification they set up a title of right to these treasures but how entirely they have failed in their attempts to substantiate either the one or the other of these his alleged justifications your lordships will now judge and first with regard to the title the treasure they say belonged to the state the grandmother and mother have robbed the son and kept him out of his rightful inheritance they then produce the hedaya to show you what proportion of the goods of a mussulman when he dies goes to his family and here certainly there is a question of law to be tried but mr hastings is a great eccentric genius and has a course of proceeding of his own he first seizes upon the property and then produces some mahometan writers to prove that it did not belong to the persons who were in possession of it you would naturally expect that when he was going to seize upon those goods he would have consulted his chiefjustice for as sir elijah impey went with him he might have consulted him and have thus learnt what was the mahometan law for though sir elijah had not taken his degree at a mahometan college though he was not a mufti or a moulavy yet he had always muftis and moulavies near him and he might have consulted them but mr hastings does not even pretend that such consultations or conferences were ever had if he ever consulted sir elijah impey where is the report of the case when were the parties before him where are the opinions of the moulavies where is the judgment of the chiefjustice was he fit for nothing but to be employed as a messenger as a common tipstaff was he not fit to try these rights or to decide upon them he has told you here indeed negatively that he did not know any title mr hastings had to seize upon the property of the begums except upon his hypothesis of the rebellion he was asked if he knew any other he answered no it consequently appears that mr hastings though he had before him his doctors of all laws who could unravel for him all the enigmas of all the laws in the world and who had himself shone upon questions of mahometan law in the case of the nuddea begum did not dare to put this case to sir elijah impey and ask what was his opinion concerning the rights of these people he was tender i suppose of the reputation of the chiefjustice for sir elijah impey though a very good man to write a letter or take an affidavit in a corner or run on a message to do the business of an undersheriff tipstaff or bumbailiff was not fit to give an opinion on a question of mahometan law  you have heard ali ibrahim khân referred to this mahometan lawyer was carried by mr hastings up to benares to be a witness of the vast good he had done in that province and was made chiefjustice there all indeed that we know of him except the high character given of him by mr hastings is i believe that he is the ali ibrahim khân whom in the companys records i find mentioned as a person giving bribes upon some former occasion to mr hastings but whatever he was besides he was a doctor of the mahometan law he was a mufti and was made by mr hastings the principal judge in a criminal court exercising as i believe likewise a considerable civil jurisdiction and therefore he was qualified as a lawyer and mr hastings cannot object to his qualifications either of integrity or of knowledge this man was with him why did not he consult him upon this law why did he not make him out a case of john doe and richard roe of john stokes and john à nokes why not say sinub possesses such things under such and such circumstances give me your opinion upon the legality of the possession no he did no such thing  your lordships i am sure will think it a little extraordinary that neither this chiefjustice made by himself nor that other chiefjustice whom he led about with him in a stringthe one an english chiefjustice with a mahometan suit in his court the other a mahometan chiefjustice of the countrythat neither of them was consulted as lawyers by the prisoner both of them were indeed otherwise employed by him for we find ali ibrahim khân employed in the same subservient capacity in which sir elijah impey wasin order i suppose to keep the law of england and the law of mahomet upon a just par for upon this equality mr hastings always values himself neither of these two chiefjustices i say was ever consulted nor one opinion taken but they were both employed in the correspondence and private execution of this abominable project when the prisoner himself had not either leisure or perhaps courage to give his public order in it till things got to greater ripeness  to sir elijah impey indeed he did put a question and upon my word it did not require an Œdipus or a sphinx to answer it says he i asked sir elijah impey what a question on the title between the nabob and his mother no such thing he puts an hypothetical question supposing says he a rebellion to exist in that country will the nabob be justified in seizing the goods of the rebels that is a question decided in a moment and i must have a malice to sir elijah impey of which i am incapable to deny the propriety of his answer but observe i pray you my lords there is something peculiarly good and correct in it he does not take upon him to say one word of the actual existence of a rebellion though he was at the time in the country and if there had been any he must have been a witness to it but so chaste was his character as a judge that he would not touch upon the juries office i am chiefjustice here says he though a little wandering out of my orbit yet still the sacred office of justice is in me do you take upon you the fact i find the law were it not for this sacred attention to separate jurisdictions he might have been a tolerable judge of the factjust as good a judge as mr hastings for neither of them knew it any other way as it appears afterwards but by rumor and reportsreports i believe of mr hastingss own raising for i do not know that sir elijah impey had anything to do with them  but to proceed with regard to the title of these ladies according to the mahometan law you have nothing laid before you by the prisoners counsel but a quotation cut out with the scissors from a mahometan lawbook which i suspect very much the learned gentlemen have never read through declaring how a mahometans effects are to be distributed but mr hastings could not at the time have consulted that learned counsel who now defends him upon the principles of the hedaya the hedaya not having been then published in english and i will venture to say that neither sir elijah impey nor ali ibrahim khân nor any other person high or low in india ever suggested this defence and that it was never thought of till lately found by the learned counsel in the english translation of the hedaya god bless me now says mr hastings what ignorance have i been in all this time i thought i was seizing this unjustly and that the pretence of rebellion was necessary but my counsel have found out a book since published and from it they produce the law upon that subject and show that the nabob had a right to seize upon the treasures of his mother but are your lordships so ignorantyour lordships are not ignorant of anythingare any men so ignorant as not to know that in every country the common law of distribution of the estate of an intestate amongst private individuals is no rule with regard to the family arrangements of great princes is any one ignorant that from the days of the first origin of the persian monarchy the laws of which have become rules ever since for almost all the monarchs of the east the wives of great men have had independent of the common distribution of their goods great sums of money and great estates in land one for their girdle one for their veil and so on going through the rest of their ornaments and attireand that they held great estates and other effects over which the reigning monarch or his successor had no control whatever indeed my lords a more curious and extraordinary species of trial than this of a question of right never was heard of since the world began mr hastings begins with seizing the goods of the begums at fyzabad nine thousand miles from you and fourteen years after tries the title in an english court without having one person to appear for these miserable ladies i trust you will not suffer this mockery i hope this last and ultimate shame will be spared us for i declare to god that the defence and the principles of it appear to me ten thousand times worse than the act itself  now my lords this criminal through his counsel chooses with their usual flippancy to say that the commons have been cautious in stating this part of the charge knowing that they were on tender ground and therefore did not venture to say entitled but possessed of only a notable discovery indeed we are as far from being taken in by such miserable distinctions as we are incapable of making them we certainly have not said that the begums were entitled to but only that they were possessed of certain property and we have so said because we were not competent to decide upon their title because your lordships are not competent to decide upon their title because no part of this tribunal is competent to decide upon their title you have not the parties before you you have not the cause before youbut are getting it by oblique improper and indecent means you are not a court of justice to try that question the parties are at a distance from you they are neither present themselves nor represented by any counsel advocate or attorney and i hope no house of lords will ever judge and decide upon the title of any human being much less upon the title of the first women in asia sequestered shut up from you at nine thousand miles distance  i believe my lords that the emperor of hindostan little thought while delhi stood that an english subject of mr hastingss description should domineer over the vizier of his empire and give the law to the first persons in his dominions he as little dreamed of it as any of your lordships now dream that you shall have your property seized by a delegate from lucknow and have it tried by what tenure a peer or peeress of great britain hold the one his estate and the other her jointure dower or her share of goods her paraphernalia in any court of adawlut in hindostan if any such thing should happen for we know not what may happen we live in an age of strange revolutions and i doubt whether any more strange than this the commons of great britain would shed their best blood sooner than suffer that a tribunal at lucknow should decide upon any of your titles for the purpose of justifying a robber that has taken your property we should do the best we could if such a strange circumstance occurred  the house of commons who are virtually the representatives of lucknow and who lately took 500000l of their money will not suffer the natives first to be robbed of their property and then the titles which by the laws of their own country they have to the goods they possess to be tried by any tribunal in great britain why was it not tried in india before mr hastings one would suppose that an english governor if called to decide upon such a claim of the nabobs would doubtless be attended by judges muftis lawyers and all the apparatus of legal justice no such thing this man marches into the country not with moulavies not with muftis not with the solemn apparatus of oriental justiceno he goes with colonels and captains and majorsthese are his lawyers and when he gets there he demands from the parties not their titleno give me your money is his cry it is a shame and i will venture to say that these gentlemen upon recollection will feel ashamed to see the bar justify what the sword is ashamed of in reading this correspondence i have found these great muftis and lawyers these great chiefjustices attorneysgeneral and solicitorsgeneral called colonels and captains ashamed of these proceedings and endeavoring to mitigate their cruelty yet we see british lawyers in a british tribunal supporting and justifying these acts on the plea of defective titles  the learned counsel asks with an air of triumph whether these ladies possessed these treasures by jointure dower will or settlement what was the title was it a deed of giftwas it a devisewas it donatio causâ mortiswas it dowerwas it jointurewhat was it to all which senseless and absurd questions we answer you asked none of these questions of the parties when you guarantied to them by a solemn treaty the possession of their goods then was the time to have asked these questions but you asked none of them you supposed their right and you guarantied it though you might then have asked what was their right but besides the force and virtue of the guaranty these unhappy princesses had ransomed themselves from any claim upon their property they paid a sum of money applied to your use for that guaranty they had a treble titleby possession by guaranty by purchase  again did you ask these questions when you went to rob them of their landed estates their money their ornaments and even their wearingapparel when you sent those great lawyers major  major  and the other majors and colonels and captains did you call on them to exhibit their titledeeds no with a pistol at their breast you demanded their money instead of forging a charge of rebellion against these unhappy persons why did you not then call on them for their vouchers no rebellion was necessary to give validity to a civil claim what you could get by an ordinary judgment did not want confiscation called to its aid when you had their eunuchs their ministers their treasurers their agents and attorneys in irons did you then ask any of these questions no discover the money you have in trust or you go to corporal punishmentyou go to the castle of chunarhere is another pair of ironsthis was the only language used  when the court of directors alarmed at the proceedings against these ancient ladies ordered their indian government to make an inquiry into their conduct the prisoner had then an opportunity and a duty imposed upon him of entering into a complete justification of his conduct he might have justified it by every civil and by every criminal mode of process did he do this no your lordships have in evidence the manner equally despotic rebellious insolent fraudulent tricking and evasive by which he positively refused all inquiry into the matter how stands it now more than twelve years after the seizure of their goods at ten thousand miles distance you ask of these women buried in the depths of asia secluded from human commerce what is their title to their estate have you the parties before you have you summoned them where is their attorney where is their agent where is their counsel is this law is this a legal process is this a tribunalthe highest tribunal of allthat which is to furnish the example for and to be a control on all the rest but what is worse you do not come directly to the trial of this right to property you are desired to surround and circumvent it you are desired obliquely to steal an iniquitous judgment which you dare not boldly ravish at this judgment you can only arrive by a side wind you have before you a criminal process against an offender one of the charges against him is that he has robbed matrons of high and reverend place his defence is that they had not the apt deeds to entitle them in law to this property in this cause with only the delinquent party before you you are called upon to try their title on his allegations of its invalidity and by acquitting him to divest them not only of their goods but of their honorto call them disseizors wrongdoers cheats defrauders of their own son no hearing for themno pleadingall appeal cut off was ever a man indicted for a robbery that is for the forcible taking of the goods possessed by another suffered to desire the prosecutor to show the deeds or other instruments by which he acquired those goods the idea is contemptible and ridiculous do these men dream do they conceive in their confused imaginations that you can be here trying such a question and venturing to decide upon it your lordships will never do that which if you did do you would be unfit to subsist as a tribunal for a single hour and if we on our part did not bring before you this attempt as the heaviest aggravation of the prisoners crimes we should betray our trust as representatives of the commons of great britain having made this protest in favor of law of justice and good policy permit me to take a single step more  i will now show your lordships that it is very possible nay very probable and almost certain that a great part of what these ladies possessed was a saving of their own and independent of any grant it appears in the papers before you that these unfortunate ladies had about 70000l a year landed property mr bristow states in evidence before your lordships that their annual expenses did not exceed a lac and a half and that their income was about seven lacs that they had possessed this for twenty years before the death of sujah dowlah and from the death of that prince to the day of the robbery now if your lordships will calculate what the savings from an income of 70000l a year will amount to when the party spends about 15000l a year you will see that by a regular and strict economy these people may have saved considerable property of their own independent of their titles to any other property and this is a rational way of accounting for their being extremely rich it may be supposed likewise that they had all those advantages which ladies of high rank usually have in that countrygifts at marriage c we know that there are deeds of gift by husbands to their wives during their lifetime and many other legal means by which women in asia become possessed of very great property but mr hastings has taught them the danger of much wealth and the danger of economy he has shown them that they are saving not for their families for those who may possibly stand in the utmost need of it but for tyrants robbers and oppressors  my lords i am really ashamed to have said so much upon the subject of their titles and yet there is one observation more to be made and then i shall have done with this part of the prisoners defence it is that the nabob himself never has made a claim on this ground even mr hastings his despotic master could never get him regularly and systematically to make such a claim the very reverse of this is the truth when urged on to the commission of these acts of violence by mr middleton you have seen with what horror and how reluctantly he lends his name and when he does so he is dragged like a victim to the stake at the beginning of this affair where do we find that he entered this claim as the foundation of it upon one occasion only when dragged to join in this wicked act something dropped from his lips which seemed rather to have been forced into his mouth and which he was obliged to spit out again about the possibility that he might have had some right to the effects of the begums  we next come to consider the manner in which these acts of violence were executed they forced the nabob himself to accompany their troops and their resident mr middleton to attack the city and to storm the fort in which these ladies lived and consequently to outrage their persons to insult their character and to degrade their dignity as well as to rob them of all they had  that your lordships may learn something of one of these ladies called the munny begum i will refer you to major brownes evidencea man who was at delhi the fountainhead of all the nobility of india and must have known who this lady was that has been treated with such indignity by the prisoner at your bar major browne was asked what was the opinion at delhi respecting the rank quality and character of the princesses of oude or of either of themthe elder or munny begum was says he a woman of high rank she was i believe the daughter of saadut ali khân a person of high rank in the time of mahommed shahdo you know whether any woman in all hindostan was considered of superior rank or birthhe answers i believe not except those of the royal family she was a near relation to mirza shaffee khân who was a noble of nobles the first person at that day in the empire in answer to another question put by a noble lord in the same examination respecting the conversation which he had with mirza shaffee khân and of which he had given an account he says he mirza shaffee khân spoke of the attempt to seize the treasures of the begums which was then suspected in terms of resentment and as a disgrace in which he participated as being related by blood to the house of sufdar jung who was the husband of the old begum he says afterwards in the same examination that he the begums husband was the second man and that her father was the first man in the mogul empire now the mogul empire when this woman came into the world was an empire of that dignity that kings were its subjects and this very mirza shaffee khân that we speak of her near relation was then a prince with a million a year revenue and a man of the first rank after the great mogul in the whole empire  my lords these were people that ought to have been treated with a little decorum when we consider the high rank of their husbands their fathers and their children a rank so high that we have nothing in great britain to compare with theirs we cannot be surprised that they were left in possession of great revenues great landed estates and great moneyed property all the female parts of these families whose alliance was doubtless much courted could not be proffered in marriage and endowed in a manner agreeably to the dignity of such persons but with great sums of money and your lordships must also consider the multitude of children of which these families frequently consisted the consequences of this robbery were such as might naturally be expected it is said that not one of the females of this family has since been given in marriage  but all this has nothing to do with the rebellion if they had indeed rebelled to cut their own sons throat there is an end of the business but what evidence have you of this fact and if none can be produced does not the prisoners defence aggravate infinitely his crime and that of his agents did they ever once state to these unfortunate women that any such rebellion existed did they ever charge them with it did they ever set the charge down in writing or make it verbally that they had conspired to destroy their son a son whom mr hastings had brought there to rob them no this was what neither mr hastings nor his agent ever did for as they never made a civil demand upon them so they never made a criminal charge against them or against any person belonging to them  i save your lordships the trouble of listening to the manner in which they seized upon these people and dispersed their guard mr middleton states that they found great difficulties in getting at their treasuresthat they stormed their forts successively but found great reluctance in the sepoys to make their way into the inner inclosures of the womens apartments being at a loss what to do their only resource he says was to threaten that they would seize their eunuchs these are generally persons who have been bought slaves and who not having any connections in the country where they are settled are supposed to guard both the honor of the women and their treasures with more fidelity than other persons would do we know that in constantinople and in many other places these persons enjoy offices of the highest trust and are of great rank and dignity and this dignity and rank they possess for the purpose of enabling them to fulfil their great trusts more effectually the two principal eunuchs of the begums were jewar and behar ali khân persons of as high rank and estimation as any people in the country these persons however were seized not says mr hastings for the purpose of extorting money as assumed in the charge but as agents and principal instruments of exciting the insurrection before alluded to c mr hastings declares that they were not seized for the purpose of extorting money but that they were seized in order to be punished for their crimes and eo nomine for this crime of rebellion now this crime could not have been committed immediately by the women themselves for no woman can come forward and head her own troops we have not heard that any woman has done so since the time of zenobia in another part of the east and we know that in persia no person can behold the face of a woman of rank or speak to females of condition but through a curtain therefore they could not go out themselves and be active in a rebellion but i own it would be some sort of presumption against them if jewar ali khân and behar ali khân had headed troops and been concerned in acts of rebellion and the prisoners counsel have taken abundance of pains to show that such persons do sometimes head armies and command legions in the east this we acknowledge that they sometimes do if these eunuchs had behaved in this way if they had headed armies and commanded legions for the purposes of rebellion it would have been a fair presumption that their mistresses were concerned in it but instead of any proof of such facts mr hastings simply says we do not arrest them for the purpose of extorting money but as a punishment for their crimes by mr middletons account you will see the utter falsity of this assertion god knows what he has said that is true it would indeed be singular not to detect him in a falsity but in a truth i will now show your lordships the utter falsity of this wicked allegation  there is a letter from mr middleton to sir elijah impey dated fyzabad the 25th of january 1782 to which i will call your lordships attention       dear sir elijahi have the satisfaction to inform you that we      have at length so far obtained the great object of our expedition      to this place as to commence on the receipt of money of which in      the course of this day we have got about six lacs i know not yet      what amount we shall actually realize but i think i may safely      venture to pronounce it will be equal to the liquidation of the      companys balance it has been at once the most important and the      most difficult point of duty which has ever occurred in my office      and the anxiety the hopes and fears which have alternately      agitated my mind cannot be described or conceived but by those who      have been witness to what has passed in the course of this long      contest the nabobs ministers have supported me nobly and      deserve much commendation without the shrewd discernment and      knowledge of the finesse and tricks of the country which hyder beg      khân possesses i believe we should have succeeded but      indifferently for i soon found that no real advantage was to be      obtained by proceeding at once to violent extremities with the      begum and that she was only to be attacked through the medium of      her confidential servants who it required considerable address to      get hold of however we at last effected it and by using some few      severities with them we at length came at the secret hoards of      this old lady i will write you more particulars hereafter       i am sorry to inform you my little boy still continues in a very      precarious way though somewhat better than when i had last the      honor to address you my respects to lady impey and believe me      with great regard my dear sir elijah your faithful obliged and      most affectionate humble servant         nathaniel middleton  my lords we produce this letter to your lordships because it is a letter which begins with dear sir elijah and alludes to some family matters and is therefore more likely to discover the real truth the true genius of a proceeding than all the formal and official stuff that ever was produced you see the tenderness and affection in which they proceed you see it is his dear sir elijah you see that he does not tell the dear sir elijah the chiefjustice of india the pillar of the law the great conservator of personal liberty and private propertyhe does not tell him that he has been able to convict these eunuchs of any crime he does not tell him he has the pleasure of informing him what matter he has got upon which a decision at law may be grounded he does not tell him that he has got the least proof of the want of title in those ladies not a word of the kind you cannot help observing the soft language used in this tender billetdoux between mr middleton and sir elijah impey you would imagine that they were making love and that you heard the voice of the turtle in the land you hear the soft cooing the gentle addressesoh my hopes today my fears tomorrowall the language of friendship almost heightened into love and it comes at last to i have got at the secret hoards of these ladieslet us rejoice my dear sir elijah this is a day of rejoicing a day of triumph and this triumph we have obtained by seizing upon the old ladys eunuchsin doing which however we found a great deal of difficulty you would imagine from this last expression that it was not two eunuchs with a few miserable women clinging about them that they had to seize but that they had to break through all the guards which we see lovers sometimes breaking through when they want to get at their ladies hardly ever did the beauty of a young lady excite such rapture i defy all the charms this country can furnish to produce a more wonderful effect than was produced by the hoards of these two old women in the bosoms of sir elijah impey and mr middleton we have got he exultingly says we have got to the secret hoards of this old lady and i verily believe there never was a passion less dissembled there nature spoke there was truth triumphant honest truth others may feign a passion but nobody can doubt the raptures of mr hastings sir elijah impey and mr middleton  my lords one would have expected to have found here something of their crimes something of their rebellion for he talks of a few necessary severities but no you find the real criminal the real object was the secret hoards of the old ladies it is true a few severities were necessary to obtain that object however they did obtain it how then did they proceed first they themselves took and received in weight and tale all the money that was in the place i say all for whether there was any more they never have discovered with all their search from that day to this therefore we fairly presume that they had discovered all that there was to discover with regard to money they next took from these unfortunate people an engagement for the amount of treasure at a definite sum without knowing whether they had it or not whether they could procure it or not the bhow begum has told us as your lordships have it in evidence that they demanded from her a million of money that she of course denied having any such sums but mr middleton forced her unfortunate eunuchs or treasurers by some few severities to give their bond for 600000l  you would imagine that when these eunuchs had given up all that was in their power when they had given a bond for what they had not for they were only the treasurers of other people that the bond would not have been rigidly exacted but what do mr hastings and mr middleton as soon as they get their plunder they went to their own assaytable by which they measured the rate of exchange between the coins in currency at oude and those at calcutta and add the difference to the sum for which the bond was given thus they seize the secret hoards they examine it as if they were receiving a debt and they determine what this money would and ought to produce at calcutta not considering it as coming from people who gave all they had to give but as what it would produce at the mint at calcutta according to a custom made for the profit of the residents even though mr hastings upon another occasion charged upon mr bristow as a crime that he had made that profit this money my lords was taken to that assaytable which they had invented for their own profit and they made their victims pay a rupee and a half batta or exchange of money upon each gold mohur by which and other charges they brought them 60000l more in debt and forced them to give a bond for that 60000l  your lordships have seen in what manner these debts were contractedand that they were contracted by persons engaging not for themselves for they had nothing all their property was apparently their mistresses you will now see in what manner the payment of them was exacted and we shall beg leave to read to you their own accounts of their own proceedings your lordships will then judge whether they were proceeding against rebels as rebels or against wealthy people as wealthy people punishing them under pretence of crimes for their own profit  in a letter from mr middleton to mr hastings after two other paragraphs he goes on thus  it remained only to get possession of her wealth and to effect this it was then and is still my firm and unalterable opinion that it was indispensably necessary to employ temporizing expedients and to work upon the hopes and fears of the begum herself and more especially upon those of her principal agents through whose means alone there appeared any probable chance of our getting access to the hidden treasures of the late vizier and when i acquaint you that by far the greatest part of the treasure which has been delivered to the nabob was taken from the most secret recesses in the houses of the two eunuchs whence of course it could not have been extracted without the adoption of those means which could induce the discovery i shall hope for your approbation of what i did i must also observe that no further rigor than that which i exerted could have been used against females in this country to whom there can be no access the nabob and salar jung were the only two that could enter the zenanah the first was a son who was to address a parent and of course could use no language or action but that of earnest and reiterated solicitation and the other was in all appearance a traitor to our cause where force could be employed it was not spared the troops of the begum were driven away and dispersed their guns taken her fort and the outward walls of her house seized and occupied by our troops at the nabobs requisition and her chief agents imprisoned and put in irons no further step was left and in this situation they still remain and are to continue excepting only a remission of the irons until the final liquidation of the payment and if then you deem it proper no possible means of offence being left in her hands or those of her agents all her lands and property having been taken i mean with your sanction to restore her house and servants to her and hope to be favored with your early reply as i expect that a few days will complete the final surrender of all that is further expected from the begum  there are some things in this letter which i shall beg your lordships to remark there is mention made of a few preliminary severities used by mr middleton in order to get at their money well he did get at the money and he got a bond for the payment of an additional sum which they thought proper to fix at about six hundred thousand pounds to which was added another usurious bond for sixty thousand and in order to extort these forced bonds and to make up their aggravated crimes of usury violence and oppression they put these eunuchs into prison without food and water and loaded their limbs with fetters this was their second imprisonment and what followed these few severities your lordships will remarkstill more severities they continued to persecute to oppress to work upon these men by torture and by the fear of torture till at last having found that all their proceedings were totally ineffectual they desire the women to surrender their house though it is in evidence before you that to remove a woman from her own house to another house without her consent is an outrage of the greatest atrocity on account of which many women have not only threatened but have actually put themselves to death mr hastings himself in the case of munny begum had considered such a proposition as the last degree of outrage that could be offered these women offered to go from house to house while their residence was searched but no say their tormentors the treasure may be bricked up in so large a house in such a manner that we cannot find it  but to proceed with the treatment of these unfortunate men i will read to your lordships a letter of mr middleton to captain leonard jaques commanding at fyzabad 18th march 1782       siri have received your letter of the 13th instant the two      prisoners behar and jewar ali khân having violated their written      solemn engagement with me for the payment of the balance due to the      honorable company on the nabobs assignments accepted by them and      declining giving me any satisfactory assurances on that head i am      under the disagreeable necessity of recurring to severities to      enforce the said payment this is therefore to desire that you      immediately cause them to be put in irons and kept so until i      shall arrive at fyzabad to take further measures as may be      necessary  here is the answer of captain jaques to mr middleton          april 23d 1782       sirallow me the honor of informing you that the place the      prisoners behar ali khân and jewar ali khân are confined in is      become so very unhealthy by the number obliged to be on duty in so      confined a place at this hot season of the year and so situated      that no reduction can with propriety be made from their guard it      being at such a distance from the battalion  you see my lords what a condition these unfortunate persons were in at that period you see they were put in irons in a place highly unhealthy and from this you will judge of the treatment which followed the few severities the first yielded a bond for 600000l the second a bond for 60000l the third was intended to extort the payment of these bonds and completed their series  i will now read a letter from captain jaques to mr middleton from the printed minutes dated palace fyzabad may 18th 1782 consequently written nearly a month after the former       sirthe prisoners behar and jewar ali khân who seem to be very      sickly have requested their irons might be taken off for a few      days that they might take medicine and walk about the garden of      the place where they are confined to assist the medicine in its      operation now as i am sure they would be equally as secure      without their irons as with them i think it my duty to inform you      of this request and desire to know your pleasure concerning it         signed leonard jaques  on the 22d may 1782 captain jaquess humane proposal is thus replied to by mr middleton       i am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your proposal of      easing the prisoners for a few days of their fetters much as my      humanity may be touched by their sufferings i should think it      inexpedient to afford them any alleviation while they persist in a      breach of their contract with me and indeed no indulgence could      be shown them without the authority of the nabob who instead of      consenting to moderate the rigors of their situation would be most      willing to multiply them         signed nathaniel middleton  i will now call your lordships attention to other letters connected with this transaction       letter from major gilpin to mr middleton june 5th 1782       siragreeably to your instructions i went to the prisoners      behar and jewar ali khân accompanied by hoolas roy who read the      papers respecting the balance now due c c       in general terms they expressed concern at not being able to      discharge the same without the assistance of the begum and      requested indulgence to send a message to her on that subject and      in the evening they would give an answer       i went at the time appointed for the answer but did not receive a      satisfactory one in consequence of which i desired them to be      ready at the shortest notice to proceed to lucknow and explained      to them every particular contained in your letter of the 1st      instant respecting them       yesterday morning i sent for letafit ali khân and desired him to      go to the bhow begum and deliver the substance of my instructions      to her which he did and returned with the inclosed letter from      her from some circumstances which i have heard today i am      hopeful the prisoners will soon think seriously of their removal      and pay the balance rather than submit themselves to an      inconvenient journey to lucknow        to major gilpin commanding at fyzabad from mr middleton       siri have been favored with your letter of the 5th instant      informing me of the steps you had taken in consequence of my      instructions of the 1st and covering a letter from the bhow begum      which is so unsatisfactory that i cannot think of returning an      answer to it indeed as all correspondence between the begum and      me has long been stopped i request you will be pleased to inform      her that i by no means wish to resume it or maintain any friendly      intercourse with her until she has made good my claim upon her for      the balance due       i have now in conformity to my former instructions to desire      that the two prisoners behar and jewar ali khân may be      immediately sent under a sufficient guard to lucknow unless      upon your imparting to them this intimation either they or the      begum should actually pay the balance or give you such assurances      or security for the assets to be immediately forthcoming as you      think can be relied upon in which case you will of course suspend      the execution of this order        mr richard johnson to major gilpin lucknow 24th june 1782       siri have received the honor of your letter of the 20th the      prisoners arrived here this morning lieutenant crow has delivered      them over to captain waugh and returns to you in a day or two       i think their hint to you a very good one and worth improving      upon was the bhow begum to think that she must go to allahabad or      any other place while her palace is searched for the hidden      treasure of the late vizier it might go further than any other      step that can be immediately taken towards procuring payment of the      balance outstanding       the prisoners are to be threatened with severities tomorrow to      make them discover where the balance may be procurable the fear of      which may possibly have a good effect and the apprehensions of the      begum lest they should discover the hidden treasure may induce her      to make you tenders of payment which you may give any reasonable      encouragement to promote that may occur to you       the jaghire cannot be released to her on any other terms nor even      to the nabob until the five lacs for which it was granted be paid      up and the prisoners must also be detained until the full fifty      lacs be liquidated consequently nothing but the fear of an      increase of demand upon breach of the first engagement on her      part will induce her to prompt payment        letter from mr richard johnson to the commanding officer of the      guard lucknow 23d july 1782       sirsome violent demands having been made for the release of the      prisoners it is necessary that every possible precaution be taken      for their security you will therefore be pleased to be very strict      in guarding them and i herewith send another pair of fetters to      be added to those now upon the prisoners        letter from robert steere allen to richard johnson esq acting      resident lucknow 23d july 1782       siri have received your instructions and ordered the fetters      to be added but they are by much too small for their feet the      utmost regard shall be paid to the security of the prisoners i      have sent back the fetters that you may have them altered if you      think proper        letter from mr johnson to the officer commanding the guard      lucknow 28th june 1782       sirthe nabob having determined to inflict corporal punishment      upon the prisoners under your guard this is to desire that his      officers when they shall come may have free access to the      prisoners and be permitted to do with them as they shall see      proper only taking care that they leave them always under your      charge  i will now trouble your lordships with the following passages from mr holts evidence       q did you ever see the two ministers of the beguma i saw      them brought into lucknowq in what situation were they when      you saw them brought into lucknowa they were brought in their      palanquins attended by a guard of sepoysq under whose      command were the sepoysa that they were brought in byq      yesa i do not recollectq were those sepoys that brought      in the prisoners part of the nabobs army or were they any british      troopsa to the best of my recollection they were detached      from a regiment then stationed at fyzabadq in whose service      was that regimenta in the companysq were they      imprisoned in any house near that in which you resideda they      were imprisoned immediately under the window of the house in which      i resided close to itq did you or did you not ever see any      preparations made for any corporal punishmenta i saw      something of a scaffoldingq for what purposea i heard      it was for the purpose of tying them upq whose prisoners did      you consider these men to bea i considered them as prisoners      of the resident they were close to his house and under an      european officer  your lordships have now seen the whole process except one dreadful part of it which was the threatening to send the begum to the castle at chunar after all these cruelties after all these menaces of further cruelties after erecting a scaffold for actually exercising the last degree of criminal punishment namely by whipping these miserable persons in publicafter everything has been done but execution our inability to prove by evidence this part of their proceedings has secured to your lordships a circumstance of decorum observed on the stage where murders executions whippings and cruelties are performed behind the scenes i know as certainly as a man can know such a thing from a document which i cannot produce in evidence here but i have it in the handwriting of the resident mr bristow that behar ali khân was actually scourged in the manner that we speak of i had it in writing in the mans hand i put the question to him but he refused to answer it because he thought it might criminate himself and criminate us all but if your lordships saw the scaffold erected for the purpose and of this we have evidence would you not necessarily believe that the scourging did follow all this was done in the name of the nabob but if the nabob is the person claiming his fathers effects if the nabob is the person vindicating a rebellion against himself upon his nearest relations why did he not in person take a single step in this matter why do we see nothing but his abused name in it we see no order under his own hand we see all the orders given by the cool mr middleton by the outrageous mr johnson by all that gang of persons that the prisoner used to disgrace the british name who are the officers that stormed their fort who put on the irons who sent them who supplied them they are all all english officers there is not an appearance even of a minister of the nabobs in the whole transaction the actors are all englishmen and we as englishmen call for punishment upon those who have thus degraded and dishonored the english name  we do not use torture or cruelties even for the greatest crimes but have banished them from our courts of justice we never suffer them in any case yet those men in order to force others to break their most sacred trust inflict tortures upon them they drag their poor victims from dungeon to dungeon from one place of punishment to another and wholly on account of an extorted bondfor they owed no money they could not owe anybut to got this miserable balance of 60000l founded upon their tables of exchange after they had plundered these ladies of 500000l in money and 70000l a year in land they could not be satisfied without putting usury and extortion upon tyranny and oppression to enforce this unjust demand the miserable victims were imprisoned ironed scourged and at last threatened to be sent prisoners to chunar this menace succeeded the persons who had resisted irons who had been as the begums say refused food and water stowed in an unwholesome stinking pestilential prison these persons withstood everything till the fort of chunar was mentioned to them and then their fortitude gave way and why the fort of chunar was not in the dominions of the nabob whose rights they pretended to be vindicating to name a british fort in their circumstances was to name everything that is most horrible in tyranny so at least it appeared to them they gave way and thus were committed acts of oppression and cruelty unknown i will venture to say in the history of india the women indeed could not be brought forward and scourged but their ministers were tortured till for their redemption these princesses gave up all their clothes all the ornaments of their persons all their jewels all the memorials of their husbands and fathersall were delivered up and valued by merchants at 50000l and they also gave up 5000l in money or thereabouts so that in reality only about 5000l a mere nothing a sum not worth mentioning even in the calculations of extortion and usury remained unpaid  but my lords what became of all this money when you examine these witnesses here they tell you it was paid to hyder beg khân now they had themselves received the money in tale at their own assaytable and when an account is demanded of the produce of the goods they shrink from it and say it was hyder beg khân who received the things and sold them where is hyder beg khâns receipt the begums say and the thing speaks for itself that even gold and jewels coming from them lost their value that part of the goods were spoilt being kept long unsold in damp and bad warehouses and that the rest of the goods were sold as thieves sell their spoil for little or nothing in all this business mr hastings and mr middleton were themselves the actors chief actors but now when they are called to account they substitute hyder beg khân in their place a man that is dead and gone and you hear nothing more of this part of the business  but the sufferings of these eunuchs did not end here they were on account of this odd 5000l confined for twelve monthsnot prisoners at large like this prisoner who thrusts his sore leg into your lordships faces every day but in harsh and cruel confinement these are the persons that i feel for it is their dungeon it is their unrevenged wrongs that move me it is for these innocent miserable unhappy men who were guilty of no offence but fidelity to their mistresses in order to vex and torture whom the first women in asia in the persons of their ministers these cruelties were exercisedthese are they for whom i feel and not for the miserable sore leg or whining cant of this prisoner he has been the author of all these wrongs and if you transfer to him any of the sympathy you owe to these sufferers you do wrong you violate compassion think of their irons has not this criminal who put on these irons been without one iron has he been threatened with torture has he been locked up without food and water have his sufferings been aggravated as the sufferings of these poor men were aggravated what punishment has been inflicted and what can be inflicted upon him in any manner commensurate with the atrocity of his crimes  at last my lords these unhappy men were released mr bristow who had been sent to lucknow writes to mr hastings and informs him that severities could do no more that imprisonments and menaces could get no more money i believe not for i doubt much whether any more was to be got but whether there was or not all the arts of extortion fortified by all the arts of tyranny of every name and species had failed and therefore mr bristow released the prisonersbut without any warrant for so doing from mr hastings who after having received this letter from mr bristow gets the supreme council to order these very severities to be continued till the last farthing was paid in order to induce the council to sanction this measure he suppressed mr bristows declaration that severities could do nothing more in exacting further payments and the resident i find was afterwards obliquely punished for his humanity by mr hastings  mr bristows letter is dated the 12th of december and he thus writes  the battalion at fyzabad where the begums and their ministers had been confined is recalled and my letter to the board of the 1st instant has explained my conduct to the begum the letter i addressed her a translation of which i beg leave to inclose no 2 was with a view of convincing her that you readily assented to her being freed from the restraints which had been imposed upon her and that your acquiescence in her sufferings was a measure of necessity to which you were forced by her extraordinary conduct i wished to make it appear this was a matter on which you directed me to consult the viziers pleasure that it might be known you were the spring from whence she was restored to her dignity and consequence  on the 3d of march following the council agree to send the following order to mr bristow  we desire you will inform us if any and what means have been taken for recovering the balance due from the begum at fyzabad and if necessary that you recommend it to the vizier to enforce the most effectual means for that purpose  my lords you see the fraud he has put upon the council you will find that mr bristows letters up to the 3d of march had been suppressed and though then communicated yet he instigated his catspaw that blind and ignorant council to demand from the vizier the renewal of these very severities and cruelties the continuance of which the letters in his pocket had shown him were of no effect here you have an instance of his implacable cruelty you see that it never relaxes never remits and that finding all the resources of tyranny useless and ineffective he is still willing to use them and for that purpose he makes a fraudulent concealment of the utter inefficacy of all the means that had been used  but you will ask what could make him persevere in these acts of cruelty after his avarice had been more than satiated you will find it is this he had had some quarrel with these women he believed that they had done him some personal injury or other of which he nowhere informs you but as you find that in the case of cheyt sing he considered his visit to general clavering as an horrid outrage against himself which he never forgave and revenged to the ruin of that miserable person so you find that he has avowed the same malicious disposition towards the begums arising from some similar cause in page 367 of your printed minutes he saysi am sorry that i must in truth add that a part of the resentment of the begums was as i had too much reason to suspect directed to myself personally the incidents which gave rise to it are too light to be mixed with the professed subject and occasion of this detail and as they want the authenticity of recorded evidence i could lay no claim to credit in my relation of them at some period i may be induced to offer them to the world my ultimate and unerring judges both of that and of every other trait in my political character  my lords you have an anecdote here handed to you which is the key of a great part of this transaction he had determined upon some deep and desperate revenge for some injury or affront of some kind or other that he thought he had received from these people he accuses them of a personal quarrel with himself and yet he has not the honor or honesty to tell you what it waswhat it was that could induce them to entertain such a personal resentment against him as to ruin themselves and their country by their supposed rebellion he says that some time or other he will tell it to the world why did he not tell his counsel and authorize them to tell a story which could not be unimportant as it was connected with a rebellion which shook the british power in india to its foundation and if it be true that this rebellion had its rise in some wicked act of this man who had offended these women and made them as he says his mortal enemies you will then see that you never can go so deep with this prisoner that you do not find in every criminal act of his some other criminal act in the lowest deep there is still a lower deep in every act of his cruelty there is some hidden dark motive worse than the act itself of which he just gives you a hint without exposing it to that open light which truth courts and falsehood basely slinks from  but cruelly as they have suffered dreadfully as they have been robbed insulted as they have been in every mode of insult that could be offered to women of their rank all this must have been highly aggravated by coming from such a man as mr middleton you have heard the audacious and insulting language he has held to them his declining to correspond with them and the mode of his doing it there are my lords things that embitter the bitterness of oppression itself contumelious acts and language coming from persons who the other day would have licked the dust under the feet of the lowest servants of these ladies must have embittered their wrongs and poisoned the very cup of malice itself  oh but they deserved it they were concerned in a wicked outrageous rebellion first for expelling their own son from his dominions and secondly for expelling and extirpating the english nation out of indiagood god almighty my lords do you hear this do you understand that the english nation had made themselves so odious so particularly hateful even to women the most secluded from the world that there was no crime no mischief no family destruction through which they would not wade for our extermination is this a pleasant thing to hear of rebellion is in all parts of the world undoubtedly considered as a great misfortune in some countries it must be considered as a presumption of some fault in government nowhere is it boasted of as supplying the means of justifying acts of cruelty and insult but with us  we have indeed seen that a rebellion did exist in baraitch and goruckpore it was an universal insurrection of the people an insurrection for the very extermination of englishmenfor the extermination of colonel hannayfor the extermination of captain gordonfor the extermination of captain williams and of all the other captains and colonels exercising the office of farmergeneral and subfarmergeneral in the manner that we have described we know that there did exist in that country such a rebellion but mark my lords against whomagainst these mild and gracious sovereigns colonel hannay captain gordon captain williams oh unnatural and abominable rebellionbut will any one pretend to say that the nabob himself was ever attacked by any of these rebels no the attacks were levelled against the english the people rose in favor of their lawful sovereign against a rebellion headed by mr middleton who you see usurped his authorityheaded by colonel hannayheaded by captain gordonheaded by all those abominable persons exercising under the nabobs name an authority destructive to himself and his subjects against them there was a rebellion but was this an unnatural rebelliona rebellion against usurped authority to save the prince his children and state from a set of vile usurpers  my lords i shall soon close our proceeding for this day because i wish to leave this part of our charge strongly and distinctly impressed upon your lordships memory and because nothing can aggravate it i shall next proceed in the farther examination of the prisoners defence to dissipate as i trust we have done and as i hope we shall do all the miserable stuff they have given by way of defence i shall often have occasion to repeat and press upon your lordships that that miserable defence is a heavy aggravation of his crime at present i shall conclude leaving this part of our charge with the impression upon your lordships minds that this pretended rebellion was merely an insurrection against the english excited by their oppression  if the rebellion was against the nabob or if he was the author of the oppression which caused it why do the english only appear to be concerned in both of them how comes it that the nabob never appears to have expressed any resentment against the rebels we shall prove beyond a doubt that the begums had nothing to do with it there was indeed as i have already said what may be called a rebellion but it was a rebellion againstnot the nabob but in favor of the lawful prince of the countryagainst the usurpers of his authority and the destroyers of his country with this as a rebellion mr hastings has charged these women he has charged them with a war against their son for the purpose of exterminating the english look i pray you at the whole business consider all the circumstances of it and ask yourselves whether this is not a charge not only so grossly improbable but so perfectly impossible that there is not any evidence which can make it even plausible consider next my lords on the other side the evidence of their innocence and then ask yourselves whether any additional matter could make its probability in the least degree more probable my lords the evidence we have produced is neither more nor less than that of almost all the persons who have had a share in exciting that rebellion and who to justify their own horrible cruelty have attempted to charge the natural consequences of that cruelty upon these unhappy women  but where all this time is the nabob against whom this rebellion is pretended to be directed was it ever even insinuated to him that his mother had raised a rebellion against him when were the proofs shown to him did he ever charge her with it he surely must have been most anxious to prevent and suppress a rebellion against himself but not one word on that subject has ever come out of his mouth nor has any one person been produced to show that he was informed of the existence of such a rebellion the persons said to be rebels are his mother and grandmother and i again ask was there the least intimation given to him by mr middleton or by any other person of their being even suspected of rebellion against him there was indeed a hint of some rebellion which the creatures of mr hastings got at obliquely but neither the person against whom the rebellion is supposed to exist nor the persons who were said to be guilty of it were ever either informed of or charged with it i defy the prisoner and his whole gang to produce one word ever uttered by any one of them from which the nabob or begums could learn that they were supposed to be concerned in the rebellion so that none of those who were said to be the principal actors in the scene ever heard of the parts they were acting from the actual authors and managers of the business not one word was uttered of a charge made much less of proof given nothing was heard but give me the moneyironsnew ironsnew imprisonmentand at last the castle of chunar  and here i beg leave to pause and to leave upon your minds the impression first of the wrong that was done the violence and the robberyand secondly of the pretences both civil and criminal by which they have attempted to justify their proceedings     speech  in  general reply  sixth day wednesday june 11 1794   my lordsyour lordships will recollect that we closed the last day of your proceeding in this trial at a most interesting part of our charge or rather of our observations upon that charge we closed at that awful moment when we found the first women of oude pillaged of all their landed and of all their moneyed property in short of all they possessed we closed by reciting to you the false pretence on which this pillage was defended namely that it was the work of the nabob now we had before proved to you from evidence adduced by the prisoner himself that this nabob was a mere tool in his hands and therefore if this pretence be true it aggravates his guilt for surely the forcing a son to violate the property of his mother must everywhere be considered a crime most portentous and enormous at this point we closed and after the detail which has been given you already of these horrible and iniquitous proceedings some apology may perhaps be necessary for entering again into the refutation of this iniquitous pretence  my honorable fellow manager who preceded me in this business did in his remarks upon the inference drawn by the prisoners counsel from the seizure of the begums treasures by the nabob as evidence of their guilt as he ought to dohe treated it with proper contempt i consider it indeed to be as little an evidence of their guilt as he does and as little a defence of that seizure as he does but i consider it in another and in a new light namely as a heavy aggravation of the prisoners crimes and as a matter that will let you into the whole spirit of his government and i warn your lordships against being imposed on by evasions of which if it were possible for you to be the dupes you would be unfit to be judges of the smallest matters in the world civil or criminal  the first observation which i shall beg leave to make to your lordships is this that the whole of the proceedings from beginning to end has been a mystery of iniquity and that in no part of them have the orders of the company been regarded but on the contrary the whole has been carried on in a secret and clandestine manner  it is necessary that your lordships should be acquainted with the manner in which the correspondence of the companys servants ought to be carried on and their proceedings regulated your lordships therefore will please to hear read the orders given concerning correspondence of every kind with the country powers you will remember the period when these orders were issued namely the period at which the act passed for the better direction of the servants of the company by this act mr hastings was appointed to be governorgeneral and the court of directors was required by that act to prepare orders and instructions which mr hastings was required by the same act to comply with you will see what these instructions and orders were and in what manner he has complied with them        extract of general instructions to the governorgeneral and      council 29th of march 1774       we direct that you assemble in council twice every week and that      all the members be duly summoned that the correspondence with the      princes or country powers in india be carried on by the      governorgeneral only but that all letters sent by him be first      approved in council and that he lay before the council at their      next meeting all letters received by him in the course of such      correspondence for their information we likewise direct that a      copy of such parts of the country correspondence be communicated to      our board of trade to be constituted as hereinafter mentioned as      may any ways relate to the business of their department  you will observe my lords two important circumstances in these instructions first that after the board had regularly met the persian correspondence kept by the governor only was to be communicated to the council and secondly that he should write no answer to any part of the business until he had previously consulted the council upon it here is the law of the landan order given in pursuance of an act of parliament your lordships will consider how mr hastings comported himself with regard to those orders for we charge it as a substantive crime independent of the criminal presumptions arising from it that he violated an act of parliament which imposed direct instructions upon him as to the manner in which he was to conduct all matters of business with the native powers  my lords we contend strongly that all the positive rules and injunctions of the law though they are merely positive and do not contain anything but mere matters of regulation shall be strictly observed the reason is this and a serious reason it is official tyranny and oppression corruption peculation and bribery are crimes so secret in their nature that we can hardly ever get to the proof of them without the assistance of rules orders and regulations of a positive nature intended to prevent the perpetration of these crimes and to detect the offender in case the crimes should be actually perpetrated you ought therefore to presume that whenever such rules or laws are broken these crimes are intended to be committed for you have no means of security against the commission of secret crimes but by enforcing positive laws the breach of which must be always plain open and direct such for instance is the spirit of the laws that although you cannot directly prove bribery or smuggling in a hundred cases where they have been committed you can prove whether the proper documents proper cockets proper entries in regular offices have been observed and performed or not by these means you lock the door against bribery you lock the door against corruption against smuggling and contraband trade but how by falling upon and attacking the offence no by falling upon and attacking the breach of the regulation you prove that the man broke the regulation and as he could have no other motive or interest in breaking it you presume that he broke it fraudulently and you punish the man not for the crime the regulation was meant to prevent but you punish him for the breach of the regulation itself  next to the breach of these positive instructions your lordships will attend to the consequent concealment and mystery by which it was accompanied all government must to preserve its authority be sincere in its declarations and authentic in its acts whenever in any matter of policy there is a mystery you must presume a fraud whenever in any matter of money there is concealment you must presume misconduct you must therefore affix your punishment to the breach of the rule otherwise the conviction of public delinquents would be unattainable  i have therefore put before you that rule which he has violated and we the commons call upon your lordships to enforce that rule and to avenge the breach of it you have seen the consequences of breaking the rule and we have charged and do charge it as a heavy aggravation of those consequences that instead of consulting the council instead of laying the whole correspondence before them instead of consulting them upon his answers he went himself up into the country took his majestys chiefjustice along with him and made that person the instrument of those wrongs violences robberies and concealments which we call upon your lordships to punish  my lords an extraordinary circumstance occurred in the course of our proceedings in another place which i must state to show you in what a horrible manner your laws have been trampled upon and despised none of the proceedings which have been last stated to your lordships respecting the seizure of the treasures of the begums appear upon any public record whatever from the manner in which they came to our knowledge your lordships will perceive what must have been the prisoners own opinion of the horrible nature of proceedings which he thought so necessary to be concealed  whilst we were inquiring into the violences committed against the begums in breach of the treaty entered into with them there came into my hands an anonymous letter containing a full account of all the matter which has lately been stated to you it came anonymously and i did not know from what quarter it came i do not even know with certainty at this hour i say not with certainty for i can only form a conjecture this anonymous communication enabled us to produce all the correspondence with mr middleton respecting the cruelties exercised towards the begums and their eunuchs in order to extort money we found the names of major gilpin and several other persons in these letters we also found in them a strong fox smell of a sir elijah impey that his brush and crime had left behind him we traced him by that scent and as we proceeded we discovered the footsteps of as many of the wolves as mr hastings thought proper to leave there we sent for and examined mr middleton and major gilpin produced his correspondence when we applied to mr middleton we found that all this part of his correspondence had been torn out of his book but having come at it by means of our anonymous communication we subsequently proved and established it in the manner we have done before your lordships here then you have important matter which this anonymous letter has brought to light and otherwise the whole of this correspondence so essential to the interests and justice of great britain would have been concealed by this wicked man thus i say his violation of a positive law would have remained undiscovered if mere accident had not enabled us to trace this iniquity to its source therefore i begin our proceedings this day by stating to your lordships this fact and by calling upon your justice to punish him for this violation of the laws of his country  we have told you who the instruments were by which all this wickedness was committed mr middleton and mr johnson persons who were sent as ambassadors to represent the interests of the company at the court of an independent prince over this prince they usurped an absolute power they even made use of british officers in his own service and receiving his pay to enslave his person and to force him to rob his kindred these agents were aided by an english chiefjustice sent under the authority of an act of parliament to represent the sovereign majesty of english justice and to be a restraint upon the misconduct of the companys servants these are the instruments with which this man works we have shown you his system we have shown you his instruments we will now proceed with the examination of the pretences upon which this horrid and nefarious act is attempted to be justified we have not entered into this examination for the sake of refuting things that want no refutation but for the purpose of showing you the spirit of the whole proceeding and making it appear to your lordships as i trust it will appear that the wicked act done there is not half so bad as the wicked defence made here  the first part of sir elijah impeys commission as your lordships will remember was to seize upon the begums treasures he had likewise another budget of instructions which has been discovered in the trunks of which your lordships have heardsecret instructions to be given by him to mr middleton for the furtherance of this business and that his office of chiefjustice should not lie dormant he was commissioned to seek for affidavits or written testimony from any persons for the purpose of convicting these women of a design of atrociously revolting against their son and deposing him from the government with a view of getting rid of the english inhabitants this was the accusation and the evidence to support it sir elijah impey was sent to collect  my lords i must here observe to your lordships that there is no act of violence which merely as an act of violence may not in some sort be borne because an act of violence infers no principle it infers nothing but a momentary impulse of a bad mind proceeding without law or justice to the execution of its object for at the same time that it pays no regard to law it does not debauch it it does not wrest it to its purposes the law disregarded still exists and hope still exists in the sufferer that when law shall be resorted to violence will cease and wrongs will be redressed but whenever the law itself is debauched and enters into a corrupt coalition with violence robbery and wrong then all hope is gone and then it is not only private persons that suffer but the law itself when so corrupted is often perverted into the worst instrument of fraud and violence it then becomes most odious to mankind and an infinite aggravation of every injury they suffer  we have therefore in our charge strongly reprobated sir elijah impeys going to take such affidavits oh but they say a judge may take an affidavit in his chamber privately and he may take an affidavit though not exactly in the place of his jurisdiction to authenticate a bond or the likewe are not to be cheated by words it is not dirty shreds of wornout parchments the sweepings of westminster hall that shall serve us in place of that justice upon which the world stands affidavits we know that in the language of our courts affidavits do not signify a body of evidence to sustain a criminal charge but are generally relative to matter matters in process collateral to the charge which not coming before the jury are made known to the judge by way of affidavit  but was it ever heard or will it be borne that a person exercising a judicial office under his majesty should walk beyond the sphere of his jurisdictionthat he should desert the station in which he was placed for the protection of the natives and should march to such a place as lucknow in order to take depositions for criminating persons in that country without so much as letting these poor victims know one article in the depositions so taken these depositions my lords were made to criminate they were meant to justify a forfeiture and are not in the nature of those voluntary affidavits which whether made within jurisdiction or without whether made publicly or privately signify comparatively nothing to the cause i do not mean to say that any process of any court has not its weight when the matter is within it in the ordinary course of proceedings it is the extraordinary course the extrajudicial conduct which divests it of that just weight it otherwise would have  this chiefjustice goes to lucknow where he holds his court such as it was he is ready to authenticate any process by the signature of the english chiefjustice in a court which he holds by night in a court which he holds in darkness and secrecy he holds his court in fyzabad he holds it unknown to the nabob of oude in his own capital and without giving him the least knowledge of or any notice of what he was proceeding to do he holds it at the lodgings of colonel morgan a pensioner of the nabob and the person assisting him is mr middleton who is likewise as we have proved to you one of the nabobs pensioners a monopolizer of trade in the country and a person who received much the major part of his emoluments from the nabobs hands  in that clandestine manner in the nabobs own house in his own capital city in the lodging of his dependant and pensioner colonel morgan with no other witness that we know of than mr middleton was this iniquitous dark procedure held to criminate the mother of the nabob we here see a scene of dark mysterious contrivance let us now see what is brought out in the face of open day the attestations themselves which you have seen on the record before you they were brought outwhere there no they were brought out in another place they were brought out at calcuttabut were never communicated to the nabob he never knew anything of the matter let us now see what those attestations were your lordships will bear in mind that i do not advert to this thing which they bring as evidence in the way of imputation of its being weak improper and insufficient evidence but as an incontrovertible proof of crimes and of a systematic design to ruin the accused party by force there and by chicane here these are the principles upon which i am going to talk to you upon this abominable subjectof which i am sorry to say i have no words sufficient to express my horror no words can express it nor can anything but the severity of your lordships judgments find an adequate expression of it it is not to be expressed in words but in punishment  having stated before whom the evidence collected in this body of affidavits was taken i shall now state who the persons were that gave it they were those very persons who were guilty of robbing and ruining the whole country yes my lords the very persons who had been accused of this in the mass by mr hastings himself they were nothing less than the whole body of those english officers who were usurping the office of farmersgeneral and other lucrative offices in the nabobs government and whose pillage and peculations had raised a revolt of the whole kingdom against themselves these persons are here brought in a mass to clear themselves of this charge by criminating other persons and clandestinely imputing to them the effect of their own iniquity  but supposing these witnesses to be good for anything supposing it fit that the least attention should be paid them the matter of their testimony may very possibly be true without criminating the begum it criminates saadut ali khân the brother of the nabob the word begum is never mentioned in the crimination but in conjunction with his and much the greater part of it criminates the nabob himself now my lords i will say that the matter of these affidavits forgetting who the deponents were may possibly be true as far as respects saadut ali khân but that it is utterly as improbable which is the main point and the stress of the thing with respect to the begums as it is impossible with respect to the nabob that saadut ali being a military man a man ambitious and aspiring to greatness should take advantage of the abuses of the english government and of the discontent of the country that he should i say raise a revolt against his brother is very possible but it is scarcely within possibility that the mother of the nabob should have joined with the illegitimate son against her legitimate son i can only say that in human affairs there is the possibility of truth in this it is possible she might wish to depose her legitimate son her only legitimate son and to depose him for the sake of a bastard son of her husbandsto exalt him at the expense of the former and to exalt of course the mother of that bastard at her own expense and to her own wrong but i say that this though possible is grossly improbable the reason why the begum is implicated in this charge with saadut ali by the affidavits cannot escape your notice their own acquittal might be the only object of the deponents in their crimination of the latter but the treasures of the former were the objects of their employers and these treasures could not be come at but by the destruction of the begums  but my lords there are other affidavits or whatever your lordships may call them that go much further in order to give a color to the accusation and make it less improbable they say that the nabob himself was at the bottom of it and that he joined with his brother and his mother to extirpate out of his dominions that horrible grievance the english brigade officersthose english officers who were the farmersgeneral and who as we have proved by mr hastingss own evidence had ruined the country nothing is more natural than that a man sensible of his duty to himself and his subjects should form a scheme to get rid of a band of robbers that were destroying his country and degrading and ruining his family thus you see a family compact naturally accounted for the nabob at the head of it his mother joining her own son and a natural brother joining in the general interests of the family this is a possible case but is this the case pressed by them no they pass lightly over the legitimate son they scarcely touch upon saadut ali khân they sink the only two persons that could give probability or possibility to this business and endeavor to throw the whole design upon these two unfortunate women  your lordships see the wickedness and baseness of the contrivance they first in order to keep the whole family in terror accuse the whole family then having possessed themselves of the treasures of the begums upon another pretence they endeavor to fix upon them that improbable guilt which they had with some degree of probability charged upon the whole family as a farther justification of that spoliation your lordships will see what an insult is offered to the peers of great britain in producing before you by way of defence such gross scandalous and fraudulent proceedings  who the first set of witnesses were which they produced before their knighterrant chiefjustice sir elijah impey who wandered in search of a law adventure i have laid open to your lordships you have now had an account of the scandalous manufacture of that batch of affidavits which was in the budget of sir elijah impeythat pandoras box which i have opened and out of which has issued every kind of evil this chiefjustice went up there with the deathwarrant of the begums treasures and for aught he knew the deathwarrant of their persons at the same time that he took these affidavits he became himself a witness in this business he appears as a witness how did he know any one circumstance of the rebellion no he does not even pretend to do so but says he in my travels i was obliged to avoid fyzabad upon account of the suspected rebellion there another chiefjustice would have gone fifty miles about to avoid lucknow for everybody knows that lucknow was the focus and centre of extortion corruption and peculation and that a worse air for the lungs of a chiefjustice could not be found in the world if his lungs wanted the benefit of pure air he would even have put himself in the focus of a rebellion to have kept at a distance from the smell of carrion and putrid corruption of every kind that was at lucknow a chiefjustice may go to a place where a rebellion is raging he may die a martyr to his honor but a chiefjustice who puts himself into the focus of peculation into the focus of bribery into the focus of everything that is base and corruptwhat can we expect from him but that he will be engaged in clandestine jobs there the former might kill sir elijah impey the knighterrant but the chiefjustice would remain pure and entire whereas sir elijah impey has escaped from lucknow and the chiefjustice is left by mr hastings to shift for himself  after mentioning this violation of the laws of hospitality by sir elijah impey i would ask was any notice given by him or by any of mr hastingss agents to the nabob who was so immediately interested in this matter was any notice given to the begums that any such charge was entertained against them not a word was it notified to the eunuchs was it to saadut ali khân not a word they were all within their power the eunuchs were a year in irons and they were subjected to the want of food and water for a part of that year they were dragged from fyzabad to lucknow and from lucknow to fyzabad during all that time was there a word mentioned to them by any one person on the part of mr hastings that they were accused of this matter not a word  we now submit to your lordships vindictive justice and condemnation this recriminatory defence in which every principle of justice has been violated and now i will ask your lordships whether you would have suffered such a procedure in the case of the prisoner at your bar it was asked by a person of great authority in this house when we were going to produce certain evidence against mr hastings we do not say whether we offered to produce it properly or improperlythat is another matterwe were asked i say whether our intentions of producing that evidence had been communicated to mr hastings had he had an opportunity of crossexamining the witnesses who had given that evidence no he added that evidence must be rejected now i say to your lordships upon the same ground deal with the begums as you dealt with mr hastings do not keep two weights and measures for different persons in the same cause you would not suffer such evidence to be produced against him you will not assuredly suffer such evidence to be produced to you in his favor and against them  my lords the cause between this man and these unfortunate women is at last come into westminster hall the cause is come to a solemn trial and we demand other witnesses and other kinds of proof than what these affidavits furnish my lords the persons who have been examined here are almost all of them the same persons who made these affidavits but there is this material difference in their evidence at your lordships bar they sunk all those parts of their former evidence which criminated the nabob and saadut ali and confined their testimony wholly to what related to the begums we were obliged by a crossexamination to squeeze out of them the disavowal of what they had deposed on the former occasion the whole of their evidence we leave to the judgment of your lordships with these summary remarks first that they are the persons who were to profit by their own wrong they are the persons who had seven months arrears paid to them out of the money of these unfortunate ladies they are the persons who to justify the revolt which they had caused in the country by their robbery charge their own guilt upon others the credibility of their evidence is therefore gone but if it were not affected by these circumstances mr hastings has put an end to it by telling you that there is not one of them who is to be credited upon his oathno not in a courtmartial and can it therefore be expected that in a case of peculation they will do otherwise than acquit the party accused he has himself laid before you the horrible state of the whole service your lordships have it fresh in your memories and ringing in your ears you have also heard from witnesses brought by mr hastings himself that these soldiers committed misdemeanors of the very same kind with those which we have stated they ought not therefore to be listened to for a moment and we aver that it is an aggravation of the prisoners crimes that he has brought the instruments of his guilt the persons of whom he has complained as having ruined and destroyed that country and whom he had engaged at the nabobs desire in the treaty of chunar to send out of the country as being a nuisance in itto bring i say these people here to criminate at a distance of nine thousand miles these unfortunate women where they have neither attorney or agent who can from local knowledge crossexamine them he has the audacity to bring these people here and in what manner they comport themselves when they come here your lordships have seen  there is one of them whom we cannot pass by that is captain gordon the other witnesses who appeared here as evidences to criminate the begums did it by rumors and hearsays they had heard some person say that the begums had encouraged rebellion always coupling them with saadut ali khân and sometimes with the nabob because there might have been some probability for their charge in the transactions with saadut ali khân which though impossible with regard to the begums they thought would implicate him them in his designs but captain gordon is to give a different account of the proceedings  captain gordon was one of colonel hannays underfarmers he was hunted out of the country and as one of the begums says pursued by a thousand of the zemindars for robbing the whole country this woman through respect to the british name that name which guarantied her possessions to her receives this captain gordon and captain williams with every mark of kindness hospitality and protection that could be given them she conveys them from the borders to the city of fyzabad and from fyzabad her capital supposed to be the nest of her rebellion on to their place of destination they both write her letters full of expressions of gratitude and kindness for the services that they had received they then pass on to lucknow to sir elijah impey and there they sink every word of kindness of any service or protection that they had received or of any acknowledgment that they had ever made of it they sink all this not one word of it appears in their affidavits  how then did we come to the knowledge of it we got it from major gilpin who was examined in the course of these proceedings and we used it in our charge from the papers that we hold in our hands mr hastings has confessed the fact and mr middleton has endeavored to slur it over but could not completely conceal it we have established the fact and it is in evidence before your lordships  you have now then in this manner got these testimonials given by english officers in favor of these women and by the same means the letters of the latter accusing the former are come to your hands and now these same english officers come here with their recriminatory accusation now why did they not make it at lucknow why did not mr hastings when mr middleton had such papers for him in his hands why i ask did not mr hastings procure some explanation of the circumstances whilst he was in india i will read your lordships the letter that you may not only know but feel the iniquity of this business        letter from the mother of the vizier to mr hastings received the      6th of january 1782       our situation is pretty well and your good health is constantly      prayed for i had sent behar ali khân to you accordingly people      invented a falsehood that behar ali khân was gone to get the      deputyship of the subah and some persons here were saying      wherefore has she sent behar ali khân to calcutta to the nabob      amaud ul dowlah we will never permit the affair to succeed and      accordingly it has so happened for they say that you also have not      put your seal to the treaty and the people here say why does the      noble lady correspond with the english gentlemen on this account      i did not send a letter at the time when you came this way now the      state of affairs here is thus on the 27th zehedja asoph ul dowlah      banadur without my knowledge sent his own aumils into my      jaghires i accordingly wrote several times to mr middleton on      this business that his seal was to the treaty and writing of      discharge why did he not negotiate in my favor mr middleton      replied the nabob is the master i wrote frequently but without      effect being helpless i represent to you the state of my affairs      that notwithstanding the existence of this treaty i have been      treated in this manner it is useless for me to stay here whatever      is is a compact whenever any one deviates from his compact he      meets with no credit for the future and the light of mine eyes      asoph ul dowlah wrote to me that he had sent his own aumils into      my jaghires and would pay ready money from his treasury reflect      on my security for his adhering to his future engagements from the      consideration of his conduct under his past promises i do not      agree to his ready money let me have my jaghires as formerly      otherwise leaving this place i will wait on you at benares and      thence will go towards shahjehanabad because he has not adhered to      his engagement send letters to asoph ul dowlah and to mr      middleton and hussein reza khân and hyder beg khân not to molest      the begums jaghires and to let them remain as formerly with the      begums aumils and it is here suspected of me that my aumil      plundered the property of mr john gordon the case is this mr      john gordon arrived at taunda a jaghire of mine fighting with the      zemindars of acberpore which belongs to the khalseh accordingly      mr john gordon having come to taunda my aumil performed whatever      appertained to his duty afterwards mr john gordon wrote to me to      send my people that he might come with them to fyzabad i sent      people accordingly to bring mr john gordon and the said gentleman      arrived here in complete safety and mr john gordon is now      present ask him yourself of these matters mr john gordon will      represent matters in detail the truth will then become known how      illfounded the calumny is should you come here for a few days it      will be very well and if not i will wait on you and your coming      here is very necessary that all my affairs may become arranged      and send a speedy answer to my letters and a letter to asoph ul      dowlah and mr middleton and hussein reza khân and hyder beg      khân on the subject of ceasing to molest my jaghires and send me      constantly news of your health for my peace of mind depends      thereon  this letter was transmitted to mr hastings i desire your lordships will remark upon this letter for it is a most important one indeed it is hardly worth observing that all this correspondence came out of the various trunks of which your lordships have already heard and that this letter is out of the trunk of mr hastingss private persian secretary and interpreter mr jonathan scott now my lords in this letter there are several things worthy of your lordships observation the first is that this woman is not conscious of having ever been accused of any rebellion the only accusation that ever came to her ears was that captain gordon said that his baggage had been robbed by one of her aumils she denies the truth of this charge and she produces testimonials of their good behavior to him and what is the essential point of all she desires mr hastings to apply to this mr john gordon and to know from him what truth or falsehood there is in that accusation and what weight there is in the attestation she produces mr gordon is now present says she ask him yourself of these matters this reasonable request was not complied with mr gordon swears before sir elijah impey to the robbery but he never mentions the paper he had written in which he confessed that he owed his life to this very lady no inquiry was made into this matter colonel hannay was then alive captain gordon was alive and she refers to him yet that very man was sworn before sir elijah impey and accuses his prisoner did the prisoner at your bar make that attestation known to the begum whose letter at that very time was in his possession in mr scotts trunkthat very letter in which he is desired to make the inquiry from captain gordon  mr hastings is acquainted with the facts stated by the begum and with captain gordons accusation did he afterwards inform her of this accusation or did he ask this captain gordon one question in india where the matter might be ventilated not one word my lords therefore we fix upon him fraud deceit and the production of false evidence after the woman had desired to have the man who was the evidence against her examined upon the spot this he does not do but with much more prudence he brings him here and for what to discredit his own testimony and the written evidence and how does he discredit them there are two of these papers which i beg leave to read to your lordships        copy of a letter to jewar and behar ali khân from mr gordon       sirs my indulgent friends remain under c c c after      compliments i have the pleasure to inform you that yesterday      having taken leave of you i passed the night at noorgunge and      next morning about ten or eleven oclock through your favor and      benevolence arrived safe at goondah mir aboo buksh zemindar and      mir rustum ali accompanied me       to what extent can i prolong the praises of you my beneficent      friends may the supreme being for this benign compassionate      humane action have you in his keeping and increase your property      and speedily grant me the pleasure of an interview until which      time continue to favor me with friendly letters and oblige me by      any commands in my power to execute may your wishes be ever      crowned with success my compliments c c c        copy of an address from mr gordon to the begum       begum saib of exalted dignity and generosity whom god preserve      after presenting the usual professions of servitude c in the      customary manner my address is presented       your gracious letter in answer to the petition of your servant      from goondah exalted me from the contents i became unspeakably      impressed with the honor it conferred may the almighty protect      that royal purity and bestow happiness increase of wealth and      prosperity the welfare of your servant is entirely owing to your      favor and benevolence a few days have elapsed since i arrived at      goondah with the colonel saib       this is presented for your highnesss information i cherish hopes      from your generosity that considering me in the light of one of      your servants you will always continue to exalt and honor me with      your gracious letters may the sun of prosperity continually      shine  these acknowledgments of the begums friendly disposition and services were concealed when the charge was made against this woman at lucknow before sir elijah impey i wish to impress this upon your lordships mind and that before mr hastings left bengal in the trunk of major scott his private persian interpreter was this letter did he make that inquiry of captain gordon no did he make that inquiry of colonel hannay did he make any inquiry into the matter after his perusal of these letters or did he give this poor woman any opportunity of obtaining justice against this captain gordon who after acknowledging that he owed his life to her favor calumniates and traduces her to her utter destruction no he never did and therefore he is chargeable and i charge him with everything that is wrongful in captain gordons evidence  these papers which carry with them a clear refutation of all the charges against the begum are never once produced though captain gordon was referred to expressly for inquiry and explanation of the whole transaction by the woman herself you hear nothing of them there is no appearance of them in the affidavits no such papers were laid before the supreme council none were transmitted to the court of directors but at last the house of commons having come at the truth of this matter mr hastings not daring to deny the existence of these papers brings captain gordon to be examined here in order to prove that papers which he had himself written were false is this to be tolerated what will your lordships think of a man that comes to attest his own infamyto declare that he has written papers containing falsehoods and to invalidate the false testimony which he had before given is he to be suffered i say to come here and endeavor to prove the absolute falsity of his own deeds by his own evidence  the next point for your lordships consideration is the evidence which he produces to prove the falsity of a paper written by himself why he himself is the sole evidence and how does he prove it why says he the reason of my writing that letter was this she had sent a person with me as an escort and this person was desirous of receiving some proof that he had done his duty and therefore i wrote a complaisant letter i meant nothing by it it was written merely to satisfy the mind of the man now is that the way in which formal and solemn letters written upon great occasions to great people are to be explained away if he had said nothing but your servant such a one has done his duty this explanation might pass but you see it has another complexion it speaks of his owing his life to her but if you admit that it is possible for possibilities have an unknown extent that he wrote such a letter at such a time and for such a purpose and that the letter he wrote was false and that the falsity of the letter is proved by his own testimony given in an affidavit which we have also reason to believe is false your lordships must at the same time admit that it is one of the most complex pieces of fraud and falsehood that i believe ever existed in the world but it is worse than all this there is another letter written some days after which i will read to you and which he has not pretended to say was written only to testify that a messenger had executed his commission properly  your gracious letter he thus writes in answer to the petition of your servant from goondah exalted me from the contents i became unspeakably impressed with the honor it conferred  my lords this letter was not sent back by a messenger in acknowledgment of his having done his duty but was written in consequence of a correspondence in the nature of a petition for something or other which he made to the begum that petition they have suppressed and sunk it is plain however that the petition had been sent and was granted and therefore the apology that is made for the former letter does not apply to this letter which was written afterwards  how then do they attempt to get rid of this difficulty why says captain gordon the colonel saib by whom was meant colonel hannay was not at goondah as stated in the letter but at succara about eighteen miles from it and therefore you ought not to pay much regard to this paper but he does not deny the letter nor was it possible for him to deny it he says colonel hannay was not there but how do we know whether colonel hannay was there or not we have only his own word for it but supposing he was not there and that it was clearly proved that he was eighteen miles distant from it major naylor was certainly with captain gordon at the time might not his persian scribe for he does not pretend to say he wrote the letter himself take major naylor for a colonel for he was the superior officer to captain gordon and think him the colonel saib for errors of that kind may be committed in our own country every day we may take a major for a lieutenantcolonel this was an error that might easily have happened in such a case he was in as high rank as colonel hannay for colonel hannay at that time was only a major i do not believe either of them was properly entitled to the name of colonel saib i am ashamed my lords to be obliged to remark upon this prevarication their own endeavors to get rid of their own written acts by contradictory evidence and false constructions sufficiently clear these women of the crimes of which they were accused and i may now ask the prisoner at your bar how he dares to produce captain gordon here how he dares thus to insult the peers how he dares thus to insult the public justice of his country after not having dared to inquire upon the spot of this man to whom he was referred by the begums for an account of this very transaction  i hope your lordships have got enough of this kind of evidence all the rest is of the same batch and of the same descriptionmade up of nothing but hearsays except in one particular only this i shall now mention to your lordships colonel popham and another gentleman have told you that in a battle with cheyt sings forces they took prisoners two wounded nudjeeves or swordsmen and that these men told them that they were sent there by the begumsthat they had got two rupees and two wounds but that they thought two rupees a bad compensation for two wounds these two men with their two wounds and two rupees had however been dismissed it does not appear that this accident was considered by these officers to be of consequence enough to make them ever tell one word of it to mr hastings though they knew he was collecting evidence of the disaffection of the begums of all kinds good bad and indifferent from all sorts of persons  my lords i must beg leave to say a few words upon this matter because i consider it as one of the most outrageous violations of your lordships dignity and the greatest insult that was ever offered to a court of justice a nudjeeve is a soldier armed with a sword it appears in evidence that the nabob had several corps of nudjeeves in his service that the begums had some nudjeeves and that colonel hannay had a corps of nudjeeves it is well known that every prince in hindostan has soldiers of that descriptionin like manner probably as the princes of europe have their guards the whole then amounts to this that a story told by two men who were wounded in an action far from the place from which they were supposed to come who were not regularly examined not crossexamined not even kept for examination and whose evidence was never reported is to be a reason why you are to believe that these begums were concerned in a rebellion against their son and deserved to forfeit all their lands and goods and to suffer the indignities that we have stated  my lords i am really ashamed to mention so scandalous a thing but let us put a case let us suppose that we had accused mr hastings of instigating the rajah of berar to fall upon some of the country powers and that the evidence we produced at your bar to prove it was that an officer had taken two nudjeeves who declared they were instigated by mr hastings to go into the service of that rajah could you bear such a thing would you suffer such evidence to be produced or do you think that we should have so little regard for our own reputation as to venture to produce such evidence before you again we have charged mr hastings with committing several acts of violence against the begums let us suppose our proof to be that two persons who never appeared before nor since that two grenadiers in english uniforms which would be a great deal stronger than the case of the nudjeeves because they have no particular uniform belonging to them that two english grenadiers i say had been taken prisoners in some action and let go again who said that mr hastings had instigated them to make war upon the begums would your lordships suffer such evidence to be produced before you no and yet two of the first women in india are to be stripped of all they have in the world upon no better evidence than that which you would utterly reject you would not disgrace the british peerage you would not disgrace this court of justice you would not disgrace human reason itself by confiscating on such evidence the meanest property of the meanest wretch you would not subject to the smallest fine for the smallest delinquency upon such evidence i will venture to say that in an action of assault and battery or in an action for the smallest sum such evidence would be scouted as odious and contemptible even supposing that a perfect reliance might be placed upon its truth and yet this is the sort of evidence upon which the property the dignity and the rank of some of the first persons in asia are to be destroyedby which a british guaranty and the honor and dignity of the crown of great britain and of the parliament itself which sent out this man are to be forfeited  observe besides my lords that the two swordsmen said they were sent by the begums now they could not be sent by the begums in their own person this was a thing in india impossible they might indeed have been sent by jewar and behar ali khân and then we ask again how came these ministers not to be called to an account at the time why were they not called upon for their musterrolls of these nudjeeves no these men and women suffer the penalty but they never hear the accusation nor the evidence  but to proceed with the evidence of this pretended rebellion captain williams has told your lordships that he once had a great number of letters and papers to prove this rebellion of the begums but he declares that he has lost all these letters a search was ordered to be made in mr hastingss recordoffice called a trunk and accordingly in the trunk is found a paper worthy of such a place and such a cause this letter which has been made use of to criminate the begums has not their names mentioned nor is there any possibility of their being included in it by this paper which is preserved you may judge of the whole of the papers that are lost such a letter i believe was never before brought as evidence in a court of justice it is a letter said to have been intercepted and is as follows       to the most noble      whose prosperity be everlasting       it is represented that the august purwannah command having      completed his honorable arrival on the 16th of the month in the      evening highly exalted me it is ordered that i should charge      medeporee and the other enrolled sepoys belonging to my district      and take bonds from them that none of them go for service to the      rajah and that when four or five hundred men nudjeeves and      others are collected i should send them to the presence      according to the order i have written to brejunekar shah rehemet      ullah who is in bhooaparah charging him to take bonds from them      and that whatever sepoys fit for service are collected he should      send to the presence as at this time the wind is contrary the      sepoys will not     without travelling charges for i have      learnt from a letter previously received from brejunekar shah      rehemet ullah that the people there also are badly inclined by      the grace of god the unalterable glory shall be      zehan      beg and the nudjeeves who were in the fort of aneelah have gone off      to goruckpore  this is a letter of somebody or other employed by somebody or other for the recruiting serviceit should seem by the word presence somebody employed in enlisting forces for the nabob the charge against the begum was that she had joined with the rebellious rajahs to exterminate her sons government and the english influence in that country in this very paper you see that the soldiers entering into that service and officers who are to contract for soldiers are expressly bound not to join the rajahs and this they produce as proof that the begums had joined the rajahs and had joined them in a rebellion for the purpose of exterminating their son in the first instance and the english afterwards  there is another circumstance which makes their own acts the refutation of their false pretences this letter says that the country is disaffected and it mentions the illdisposed parts of the country now we all know that the country was illdisposed and we may therefore conclude this paper was written by and addressed to some person who was employed against the persons so illdisposednamely the very rajahs so mentioned before the prisoners counsel after producing this paper had the candor to declare that they did not see what use could be made of it no to be sure they do not see what use can be made of it for their cause but i see the use that can be made of it against their cause i say that the lost papers upon which they do so much insist deserve no consideration when the only paper that they have preserved operates directly against them and that therefore we may safely infer that if we had the rest of the contents of this trunk we should probably find them make as strongly against them as this paper does you have no reason to judge of them otherwise than by the specimen for how can you judge of what is lost but from what remains  the man who hid these papers in his trunk never understood one word of the persian language and consequently was liable to every kind of mistake even though he meant well but who is this man why it is captain williamsthe man who in his affidavits never mentioned the begums without mentioning saadut ali it is captain williamswhom we charge to have murdered a principal man of the country by his own hand without law or legal process it is captain williamsone of those british officers whom mr hastings states to be the pests of the country this is the man who comes here as evidence against these women and produces this monstrous paper  all the evidence they had produced to you amounts to no more than that such a man believes such a man heard of something and to close the whole of this hearsay account sir elijah impey who always comes in as a supplement declares that no man doubted of the existence of this rebellion and of the guilt of the begums any more than of the rebellion of 1745 a comparison which i must say is by way of evidence a little indecorous in a chiefjustice of india your lordships are sufficiently acquainted with the history of that rebellion to know that when lord lovat was tried at this bar the proceedings against him were not founded on secondhand hearsay the existence of the rebellion of 1745 was proved notwithstanding its notoriety but neither notoriety nor proof would have signified anything if lord lovats participation in it had not been brought home to him directly personally and particularly yet a chiefjustice sent to india to represent the sacred majesty of the crown of england has gone so far as to say at your bar that no more doubt could be entertained of the existence either of the rebellion or the guilt of the begums than of the rebellion in 1745 besides he forgets that he himself carried the order to confiscate these peoples property without any trial whatever but this is the way of proceeding by an english chiefjustice in indiaa chiefjustice who had rendered himself the instrument the lettercarrier the messenger i had almost said the executioner of mr hastings  from this view of the whole matter your lordships will form an estimate of the spirit of indian government and indian justice but to blow away and to put an end to all their false pretences their hearsays and talk of nudjeeves and wounds and the like i ask who is the first witness that we have produced upon this occasion it is the nabob himself negativing all these pretences did he believe them not a word from him of any rebellion actual or suspected sir elijah impey indeed said that he was obliged to wheel round and to avoid that dangerous place fyzabad his friends urged him to this for gods sake say they have a reverend care of your sacred person what will become of the justice of india what will become of the natives if you their legitimate protector should fall into the hands of these wicked rebellious women at fyzabad but although the chiefjustice does this the nabob whose deposition is said to be the first object of this rebellion takes leave of mr hastings at the very moment when it is raging in the highest possible degree and gallops into its very focus  and under what circumstances does he do this he had brought some considerable forces with him no man of his rank in that country ever goes without them he left a part of these forces with mr hastings notwithstanding he was going into the centre of the rebellion he then went on with a corps of about a thousand horse he even left a part of these with mr middleton and galloped attended by a few horse into the very capital where the begums we are told had ten thousand armed men he put himself into their power and not satisfied with this the very first thing we hear of him after his arrival is that he paid his mother a friendly visitthus rushing into the den of a lioness who was going to destroy her own whelp is it to be credited my lords that a prince would act thus who believed that a conspiracy was formed against him by his own mother is it to be credited that any man would trust a mother who contrary to all the rules of nature and policy had conspired to destroy her own son  upon this matter your lordships have the evidence of captain edwards who was aidedecamp to the nabob who was about his person his attendant at chunar and his attendant back again i am not producing this to exculpate the begumsfor i say you cannot try them here you have not the parties before you they ought to have been tried on the spotbut i am going to demonstrate the iniquity of this abominable plot beyond all doubt for it is necessary your lordships should know the length breadth and depth of this mystery of iniquity  captain edwards being askedwhether he ever heard any native of credit and authority in the nabobs dominions who appeared to believe the rebellion of the begumsa no i never didq have you any reason to believe that the nabob gave credit to ita i really cannot rightly presume to say whether the nabob did or did not but i am apt to believe that he did notq have you any reason and what to form a belief about ita i have i think if he supposed the rebellion ever existed at fyzabad he would have been the first person to take and give the alarm to the british troopsq and no such alarm was taken or given to the british troopsa no i think not as i was always about his person and in the camp i think i certainly must have known it or heard of it but i never did  we assure your lordships you will find upon your printed minutes that captain edwards says he was credibly informed that the nabob left behind him a part of his guard of horse and that so desirous was he to go into the power of this cruel lioness his mother that he advanced as he is a vigorous man and a bold and spirited rider leaving all his guards behind him and rode before them into the middle of fyzabad there is some more evidence to the same purpose in answer to the question put next to that which i read before  q when you did hear of the rebellion did not you understand it to have been alleged that one object of it was to dethrone the nabob himself as well as to extirpate the englisha i understood that the intention of the princesses the begums was to extirpate the english troops out of the country and out of those dominions and likewise to depose her son and set another son who seems to have been a greater favorite of that family upon the throne in the room of the present nabob and that sons name is saadut ali i have only heard this from report i have no other knowledge but mere report i understood from the report she was to extirpate the english and depose her son who is now upon the throneq was it after or before the seizing of the treasures that you heard a circumstantial account of the supposed object of the rebelliona the report was more general after the seizing of the treasures but yet there were reports prevailing in the neighborhood that our troops were sent there in consequence of the charge that was made by colonel hannay and some of his officers of rebellion existing then at fyzabad or having existed i cannot rightly say whichq was that report after the order for the troops to march to fyzabada it was more general it was very general then when the troops did march there and more general after the seizing of the treasuresq when did the troops first marcha it was some time in the month of january i believe in the year 1782q while you was with the nabob in passing from lucknow to chunar and while you was with him or the army returning from chunar did you then out of the whole army regular or irregular ever hear of any report of the begums being in rebelliona no i do not recollect i ever didq upon crossexamination do you recollect at what time in august 1781 you left lucknow to proceed with the nabob to chunara no i cannot rightly mention the date all that i know is this that i accompanied the nabob mr middleton and his attendants all the way from lucknow to chunargur i really cannot recollect i have no notes and it is so distant a time since that i do not recollect the particulars of the month or the day but i recollect perfectly i accompanied the nabob all the way from lucknow to chunar and returned again with him until he struck off on the road for fyzabad  your lordships see plainly the whole of this matter when they had resolved to seize the begums treasures they propagated this report just in proportion to their acts as they proceeded the report grew hotter and hotter this man tells you when it was that the propagation of this report first began when it grew hot and when it was in its greatest heat he tells you that not one native of credit in the country believed itthat he did not think the nabob himself believed it and he gives a reason that speaks for itself namely that he the nabob would have been the first man to give the alarm if he believed in a rebellion as he was to be the object of it he says the english were the principal spreaders of the report it was in fact a wicked report propagated by mr middleton and the english agents for the purpose of justifying their iniquitous spoliation of the begums  this is the manner in which the matter stands upon the ground of rebellion with the exception of major gilpins and hyder beg khâns testimony this last man we have proved to have been kept in his office by mr hastingss influence and to have been entirely under his government when this dependant comes to give his attestation he gives a long account of all the proceedings of cheyt sings rebellion with which the rebellion charged on the begums was supposed to be coincident and he ends it very remarkablythat he tells the whole truth and nothing but the truth but it is also remarkable that even this hyder beg khân never mentions by name the rebellion of the begums nor says that he ever heard a word about it a strong proof that he did not dare in the face of his country to give countenance to such a falsehood  major gilpins evidence leaves not even the shadow of a pretence for this charge he had the begums and their eunuchs under his custody for a full year he was strictly ordered to watch them and to guard them and during all that time he lived at fyzabad he was the man who commanded the troops who had all the witnesses in his power who had daily access to all parties at fyzabad and who moreover was a person attached to mr hastings in the strongest manner your lordships will now be pleased to hear read to you this part of major gilpins evidence  q had you any opportunity of knowing the character of the begums and whether they were disaffected to our governmenta i had a very good opportunity of knowing from the circumstance of my having commanded so long there the elder begum it was generally understood and i have reason to believe was disaffected to our government and my sentiments of her conduct stand recorded in my correspondence to the court of lucknow to that effect but with respect to the bhow begum i acquit her entirely of any disaffection to our government so far as comes to my knowledge appearances were for some time against her but on cool deliberate inquiry i found there was no ground for supposing her guilty of any rebellious principles at the time of cheyt sings rebellionq whether that according to your belief is not your present opiniona i think i have answered that very fully that it was upon those very principles that i did form an opinion of her innocence how far they are justifiable or right i will not take upon me to say upon oath there was no one circumstance that came to my knowledge during my residence at fyzabad or my residence in india that i would wish to withhold from your lordshipsq you state here upon cool deliberate inquiry what was that cool deliberate inquirya that cool deliberate inquiry was the conversations i had with the ministers and the people of fyzabad and the letters from herself expressing her innocence and it appeared to me from those letters that she really was our friend and ally  the same witness goes on afterwards to say  q i understood you to say that originally the report prevailed with respect to both the begums but that you was induced to alter that opinion with respect to the younger begum in consequence of mr gordons letters and the intelligence of some of her ministers and other persons were not those other persons in the interest of the younger beguma in general the town of fyzabad were in her interestq in what sense do you mean generally in her interest were the persons you conversed with merely those who were in her service and household or the inhabitants of fyzabad in generala both i held conversations with both her own bodyservants and the inhabitants of the city  a little lower down in the same page  q what do you mean by the word rebellion as applied to the begums in what sense do you use ita in raising troops and in other acts of rebellion in the common acceptation of the wordq against whoma against the nabobs government and the british government jointly but i beg to know the particular time and circumstance the question alludes toq i understand you to have said you understood the elder begum was in a constant state of rebellion in what sense do you use the word rebellion did you say the elder begum was in a constant state of rebelliona i always understood her to be disaffected to the english government it might not be a proper expression of mine the word rebellionq do you know of any act by the elder begum against the viziera i cannot state anyq do you know of any act which you call rebellion committed by the elder begum against the companya i do not know of any particular circumstance only it was generally supposed that she was disaffected to the companyq what acts of disaffection or hostility towards the english do you allude to when you speak of the conversation of the world at the timea i have answered that question as fully as i canthat it was nothing but conversationthat i knew of no particular act or deed myself  this man then declares as your lordships have heard that upon cool deliberate inquiry made at fyzabad from all the inhabitants he did not believe in the existence of any rebellionthat as to the bhow begum the grandmother who was a person that could only be charged with it in a secondary degree and as conspiring with the other he says he knows no facts against her except that at the battle of buxar in the year 1764 she had used some odd expressions concerning the english who were then at war with her son sujah dowlah this was long before we had any empire or pretence to empire in that part of india therefore the expression of a rebellion which he had used with regard to her was he acknowledged improper and that he only meant he had formed some opinion of her disaffection to the english  as to the begum he positively acquits her of any rebellion if he therefore did not know it who was an active officer in the very centre of the alleged rebellion and who was in possession of all the persons from whom information was to be got who had the eunuchs in prison and might have charged them with this rebellion and might have examined and crossexamined them at his pleasureif this man knew nothing about it your lordships will judge of the falsehood of this wicked rumor spread about from hand to hand and which was circulated by persons who at the same time have declared that they never heard of it before sir elijah impey went up into the country the messenger of mr hastingss orders to seize the treasures of the begums and commissioned to procure evidence in justification of that violence and robbery  i now go to another part of this evidence there is a person they call hoolas roya man in the employment of the resident mr middleton the gentlemen who are counsel for the prisoner have exclaimed oh he was nothing but a newswriter what do you take any notice of him your lordships would imagine that the man whom they treat in this manner and whose negative evidence they think fit to despise was no better than the writers of those scandalous paragraphs which are published in our daily papers to misrepresent the proceedings of this court to the public but who in fact is this hoolas roy whom they represent for the convenience of the day to be nothing but a newswriter i will read to your lordships a letter from major naylor to colonel jaques commanding the second battalion twentieth regiment       sirhoolas roy the person appointed by the nabob for      transacting the business for which the troops are required here      will hold constant communication and intercourse with you and as      he is instructed and acquainted with the best method to accomplish      this business mr middleton requests implicit attention to be paid      to what he may from time to time represent respecting the prisoners      or the business on which he is employed in short as he is the      person nominated by the nabob he wishes hoolas roy to be      considered in the same light as if he himself was present  mr middleton in a letter to lieutenant francis rutledge writes thus of him       sirwhen this note is delivered to you by hoolas roy i have to      desire that you order the two prisoners to be put in irons keeping      them from all food c agreeable to my instructions of      yesterday  you will first see in how confidential a manner hoolas roy was employed and in what light he was held that he was employed to carry some instructions which do not indeed appear but were accompanied by an order from mr middleton when these instructions shall come to you to put these prisoners in irons and keep them without food c the begums say without food and water et cetera are words of large import but he was to keep them without food c agreeable to my instructions of yesterday this was a pretty general warrant for sufferings this hoolas roy this mere newswriter was not only intrusted with this warrant but mr middleton declares him to be a person who was to be received there and to represent the nabob and very justly too for he mr middleton was undoubtedly the real nabob of the country the man therefore whom they talk of in this contemptuous manner in order to make slight of an observation we made and which i shall make again and whom they affect to consider as a mere paragraphmonger in some scandalous newspaper was a man vested by mr middleton with authority equal to that of the nabob himself  mr hastings not only thought him of consequence enough to be a witness to the severities used on the ministers of the begums but he considered that he would afterwards be a fit witness to the rebellion i pray your lordships to mark this he sent for this hoolas roy who is now nothing but a mere paragraphmongerhe sent for him from fyzabad to benaresa pretty long journey and at last caused him to be examined before sir elijah impey he has however sunk his evidence a suppression which is strongly in favor of the begums and equally strong against their accuser here we have a man who was intrusted with all their orderswho represented the english governmentwho represented the nabobs government this man is sent for by mr hastings he gives his deposition before sir elijah impey and the deposition so given is not to be found either upon the companys record in sir elijah impeys trunk in jonathan scotts trunk nor in any other place whatever the evidence of a witness who could speak most clearly as probably he did and most decisively upon this subject is sunk they suppress and dare not produce the affidavit of the man who was at the bottom of every secret of both governments they had the folly to let you know obliquely that he had been sent for by mr hastings but they conceal the information obtained from him a silence more damning than any positive evidence could be you have here a proof of their practice of producing such evidence only as they thought most favorable to their wicked purposes in the destruction of this great and ancient family  but all the english they say believed in the existence of this rebellion this we deny mr purling who was resident the year before its pretended explosion has told you that he never knew of anything like a plot carrying on by these women we were almost ashamed to put the question to him did mr bristow the next resident know or believe in this plot he seems indeed to have been induced to give some oblique hints to mr hastings of improper conduct on the part of the begums but without stating what it was in a letter to mr hastings he appears to endeavor to soften the cruel temper of this inflexible man by going a little way with him by admitting that he thought they had behaved improperly when mr wombwell another resident is asked whether any englishman doubted of it he says mr bristow doubted of it no one indeed who reads these papers can avoid seeing that mr bristow did not believe one word of itno more in fact than did mr hastings or anybody else  but my lords let us go from these inferior agents and servants of the company to their higher officers did mr stables believe it this gentleman was mr hastingss colleague in the councila man of as much honor i really believe as ever went to indiaa faithful old servant of the company and very worthy of credit i believe there is not a spot upon him during all his long service under the company if any it is his being a little too obsequious sometimes to mr hastings did he believe it no he did not and yet he was one of the persons authorized to investigate it coolly and most able to do so  upon the whole then the persons who best knew the state of the country did not believe it the nabob did not believe it the begums were never charged with it no ground of suspicion is suggested except loose rumors and the story of two nudjeeves under these circumstances the treasures of these ancient ladies were seized their property confiscated and the nabob dragged most reluctantly to this act yes my lords this poor miserable victim was forced to violate all the laws of nature all decency all property to rob his own mother for the benefit of mr hastings all this he was forced to do he was made the reluctant instrument of punishing his mother and grandmother for a plot of which even their accusers do not pretend to say that the parties accused had ever received any intimation  my lords in forming your judgment upon this nefarious proceeding your lordships will not fail to advert to the fundamental principles the acknowledged maxims and established rules of all judgment and justicethat conviction ought to precede execution that trial ought to precede conviction and that a prosecutors information and evidence ought to be the preliminary step and substance of the trial here everything was reversed sir elijah impey goes up with the order for execution the party accused is neither arraigned nor tried this same sir elijah then proceeds to seek for witnesses and to take affidavits and in the mean time neither the nabob the ostensible prosecutor nor his mother and grandmother the parties accused knew one word of the matter  but possibly some peculiarity in the circumstances of the case rendered such a proceeding necessary and may justify it no such peculiarity has been proved or even alleged nay it is in the highest degree improbable that it could have existed mr hastings had another opportunity of doing himself justice when an account of this business was transmitted to the court of directors they ordered him to inquire into it and your lordships will see what he did in consequence of this order your lordships will then judge of the extreme audacity of the defence which he has made of this act at your bar after having refused to institute any inquiry into it although he had the positive order of the court of directors and was in the place where that inquiry could be made effectually and in the place where the unfortunate women could have an opportunity of clearing themselves  i will first read to your lordships an extract from the letter of the court of directors to the board at calcutta dated the 14th of february 1783       4 by the second article of the treaty of chunar the nabob is      permitted to resume such jaghires as he shall think proper with a      reserve that all such jaghiredars for the amount of whose      jaghires the company are guaranties shall in case of a resumption      of their lands be paid the amount of the net collections through      the resident       5 we do not see how the governorgeneral could consent to the      resumption of such lands as the company had engaged should remain      in the hands of those who possessed them previous to the execution      of the late treaty without stronger proofs of the begums      defection than have been laid before us neither can we allow it to      be good policy to reduce the several jaghiredars and thus uniting      the territory and the troops maintained for the protection of that      territory under one head who by that means at some future      period may become a very powerful enemy to the company       6 with respect to the resumption of the jaghires possessed by the      begums in particular and the subsequent seizure of the treasure      deposited with the viziers mother which the governorgeneral in      his letter to the board 23d january 1782 has declared he      strenuously encouraged and supported we hope and trust for the      honor of the british nation that the measure appeared to be fully      justified in the eyes of all hindostan the governorgeneral has      informed us that it can be well attested that the begums      principally excited and supported the late commotions and that      they carried their inveteracy to the english nation so far as to      aim at our utter extirpation       7 it must have been publicly known that in 1775 the resident at      the viziers court not only obtained from the begum widow of the      late sujah dowlah on the nabobs account thirty lacs of rupees      half of which was to be paid to the company but also the      forbearance of twentysix lacs for the repayment of which she had      security in land on the nabobs agreeing to renounce all further      claims upon her and that to this agreement the company were      guaranties       8 we find that on the 21st december 1775 the begum complained      of a breach of engagements on the part of the nabob soliciting      your protection for herself her mother and for all the women      belonging to the seraglio of the late nabob from the distresses to      which they were reduced in consequence whereof it was agreed in      consultation 3d january 1776 to remonstrate with the      vizierthe governorgeneral remarking that as the      representative of our government has become an agent in this      business and has pledged the honor and faith of the company for      the punctual observance of the conditions under which the treaty      was concluded you had a right to interfere and justice demanded      it if it should appear that those engagements have been violated      and the board at the same time resolved that as soon as the      begums engagements with the nabob to which mr bristow is a      party shall be fulfilled on her part this government will think      themselves bound to protect her against any further demand or      molestation       9 if therefore the disaffection of the begums was not a matter      of public notoriety we cannot but be alarmed for the effects which      these subsequent transactions must have had on the minds of the      natives of india the only consolation we feel upon this occasion      is that the amount of those jaghires for which the company were      guaranties is to be paid through our resident at the court of the      vizier and it very materially concerns the credit of your      government on no account to suffer such payments to be evaded       10 if it shall hereafter be found that the begums did not take      that hostile part against the company which has been represented      as well in the governorgenerals narrative as in several documents      therein referred toand as it nowhere appears from the papers at      present in our possession that they excited any commotion previous      to the imprisonment of rajah cheyt sing but only armed themselves      in consequence of that transactionand as it is probable that      such a conduct proceeded entirely from motives of selfdefence      under an apprehension that they themselves might likewise be laid      under unwarrantable contributionswe direct that you use your      influence with the vizier that their jaghires may be restored to      them but if they should be under apprehensions respecting the      future conduct of the vizier and wish our further protection it      is our pleasure that you afford those ladies an asylum within the      companys territories and there be paid the amount of the net      collections of their jaghires agreeably to the second article of      the late treaty through the medium of our resident as may be      ascertained upon an average estimate of some years back  you see my lords the directors had received every one of his false impressions they had conceived an idea that after the rebellion of cheyt sing but not before upon his own showing the begums had shown a disposition to arm they here assume a false fact which mr hastings stated in his representation of the business to them they assume a variety of other false facts they assume that the amount of the jaghires of the begums were to be paid them in regular pensions whereas they were totally confiscated without any compensation at all and yet upon mr hastingss own showing they found the transaction to be so dishonorable to the british government that they desire him to make inquiry into it and give redress accordingly  here then is another order of the company another call upon mr hastings to examine to the bottom of this affair the directors after giving him credit for that enormous mass of falsehoods which we have proved him to have stated in his narrative found themselves so utterly dissatisfied that they gave this conditional order to restore the begums to their jaghires your lordships will find it in evidence upon your minutes that he contumaciously disobeyed this orderthat he would not consent to the propositions of the council for inquiring into the conduct of these injured women but stifled every attempt that was made by others to do them justice and yet he here has the effrontery to propose that your lordships should inquire into the business at your barthat you should investigate a matter here which he refused to inquire into on the spot though expressly ordered by his masters so to do  i will now read to your lordships a short extract from his own narrative of his own proceedings it begins with reciting part of a note entered by mr macpherson in the consultations of the council at the time when the orders of the court of directors which i have just alluded to were taken into consideration  what the court of directors seem to have most at heart are first that the engagement of the second article of the benares treaty should be faithfully fulfilledand secondly to guard against the future misconduct of the vizier if he should be disposed to oppress the begums that we should therefore ascertain whether the amount of the jaghires of the begums is regularly paid to them through the companys resident and give them notice that no future demands shall be made upon them this the governorgeneral might i think do in a letter that would make the begums sensible of their past misconduct yet inform them of the lenity and gracious intentions of the company in ordering them an asylum in bengal in case of future distress  in consequence of the foregoing opinion from mr macpherson the following minute was delivered by the governorgeneral  i should gladly acquiesce in the motion made by mr macpherson if i thought it possible to frame a letter to the begums in any terms which should at the same time convey the intimation proposed by it and not defeat the purpose of it or be productive of evils greater than any which exist in consequence of the proceedings which have already taken place and which time has almost obliterated the orders of the court of directors are conditional they require nothing but in the event of discoveries made subsequent to the advices which were before you on the 14th february last in alleviation of the former conduct of the begums nothing has since appeared in relation to them but their refusal or rather that of one to fulfil her engagements for the payment of the remainder of the sum exacted from her by the nabob vizier in the beginning of last year whatever obedience may be due to the clear ascertained spirit of the orders of the court of directors this obligation cannot extend to points to which neither the letter nor evident spirit of their orders apply if i am rightly informed the nabob vizier and the begums are on terms of mutual goodwill it would ill become this government to interpose its influence by any act which might tend to revive their animosities and a very slight occasion would be sufficient to effect it it will be to little purpose to tell them that their conduct has in our estimation of it been very wrong and at the same time to announce to them the orders of our superiors which more than indicate the reverse they will instantly take fire on such a declaration proclaim the judgment of the company in their favor demand a reparation of the acts which they will construe wrongs with such a sentence warranting that constructionand either accept the invitation to the proclaimed scandal of the vizier which will not add to the credit of our government or remain in his dominions but not under his authority to add to his vexations and the disorders of the country by continual intrigues and seditions enough already exists to affect his peace and the quiet of his people if we cannot heal let us not inflame the wounds which have been inflicted  if the begums think themselves aggrieved to such a degree as to justify them in an appeal to a foreign jurisdictionto appeal to it against a man standing in the relation of son and grandson to themto appeal to the justice of those who have been the abettors and instruments of their imputed wrongslet us at least permit them to be the judges of their own feelings and prefer their complaints before we offer to redress them they will not need to be prompted i hope i shall not depart from the simplicity of official language in saying that the majesty of justice ought to be approached with solicitation not descend to provoke or invite it much less to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and the promise of redress with the denunciation of punishment before trial and even before accusation  my lords if since the beginning of the world such a paper as this was ever before written by a person standing in the relation of a servant to his master i shall allow that every word we have said to your lordships upon this occasion to mark his guilt ought to be expunged from your minutes and from our charges  before i proceed to make any observations upon this act of open rebellion against his superiors i must beg your lordships to remark the cruelty of purpose the hostile feeling towards these injured women which were displayed in this daring defiance your lordships will find that he never is a rebel to one party without being a tyrant to some others that rebel and tyrant are correlative terms when applied to him and that they constantly go together  it is suggested by the directors that the nabob is the persecutor the oppressor and that mr hastings is the person who is to redress the wrong but here they have mistaken the matter totally for we have proved to your lordships that mr hastings was the principal in the persecution and that the nabob was only an instrument if i am rightly informed he says the nabob and the begums are on terms of mutual goodwill it would ill become this government to interpose its influence by any act which might tend to revive their animosities and a very slight occasion would be sufficient to effect it what animosities had they towards each other none that we know of mr hastings gets the nabob to rob his mother and then he supposes contrary to truth contrary to fact contrary to everything your lordships have heard that the nabob would fall into a fury if his mother was to obtain any redressand that if the least inquiry into this business was made it would create a flame in the nabobs mind on account of the active energetic spirited part he had taken in these transactions therefore says he oh for gods sake soothe the matter it is a green wound dont uncover it do nothing to irritate it will be to little purpose to tell them that their conduct has in our estimation of it been very wrong and at the same time announce to them the orders of our superiors which more than indicate the reverse now my lords to what does all this amount first says he i will not do them justicei will not enter upon an inquiry into their wrongs why because they charge us with having inflicted them then surely for that reason you ought to commence an inquiry no says he that would be telling them that our superiors suspect we are in the wrong but when his superiors more than indicated suspicions was he not bound tenfold to make that inquiry for his honor and for their satisfaction which they direct him to make no he will not do it because says he the begums would either accept the offer of an asylum in the companys territories to the proclaimed scandal of the vizier which would not add to the credit of our government or they would remain in his dominions but not under his authority to add to his vexations and the disorders of the country by continual intrigues and seditions  you see my lords this man is constantly thrusting this peaceable nabob before him goading and pushing him on as if with a bayonet behind to the commission of everything that is base and dishonorable you have him here declaring that he will not satisfy the directors his masters in their inquiries about those acts for fear of the nabobs taking umbrage and getting into a flame with his motherand for fear the mother supported by the opinion of the directors should be induced to resent her wrongs what i say does all this amount to it amounts to thisthe begums accuse me of doing them injustice the directors indicate a suspicion that they have been injured therefore i will not inquire into the matter why because it may raise disturbances but what disturbance could it raise the mother is disarmed and could not hurt the nabob all her landed estates he knew were confiscated he knew all her money was in his own possession he knew she had not the means if she had been disposed to create intrigues and cabalswhat disturbance then could be created by his sending a letter to know what she had to say upon the subject of her wrongs  if says he the begums think themselves aggrieved observe my lords that the institution of an inquiry is no measure of the begums it is an order of the court of directors made by them upon his own representation of his own case and upon nothing else the begums did not dare to murmur they did not dare to ask for redress god knows the poor creatures were at or about the time his prisonersrobbedstripped of everythingwithout hope and without resource but the directors doing their duty upon that occasion did condemn him upon his own false representations contained in that bundle of affidavits upon which his counsel now contend that your lordships should acquit himbut says he are they to appeal to a foreign jurisdiction when these women were to be robbed we were not foreigners to them on the contrary we adjudged them guilty of rebellion we sent an english chiefjustice to collect materials of accusation against them we sent english officers to take their money the whole was an english transaction when wrong is to be done we have then an interest in the country to justify our acting in it but when the question is of redressing wrongs when the question is of doing justice when the question is of inquiry when the question is of hearing complaints then it is a foreign jurisdiction you are to suffer mr hastingsto make it foreign or to make it domestic just as it answers his purposesbut they are to appeal against a man standing in the relation of son and grandson to them and to appeal to the justice of those who have been the abettors and instruments of their imputed wrongs why my lords if he allows that he is the abettor of and the instrument to which the directors impute these wrongs why i ask does he with those charges lying upon him object to all inquiry in the manner you have seen  but the companys governor is it seems all at once transformed into a great sovereignthe majesty of justice ought to be approached with solicitation here my lords he forgets at once the court of directors he forgets the laws of england he forgets the act of parliament he forgets that any obedience is due to his superiors the begums were to approach him by the orders of the court of directors he sets at nought these orders and asserts that he must be approached with solicitations  time says he has obliterated their sufferings oh what a balm of oblivion time spreads over the wrongs wounds and afflictions of others in the mind of the person who inflicts those wrongs and oppressions the oppressor soon forgets this robbery took place in 1781 it was in the year 1783 when he asserted that the waters of lethe had been poured over all their wrongs and oppressions your lordships will mark this insulting language when he says that both the order of the directors and the application of the begums for redress must be solicitations to him       here mr burke was interrupted by mr hastings who said my      lords there was no order i find a mans patience may be      exhausted i hear so many falsehoods that i must declare there was      no order of the court of directors forgive me my lords he may      say what he pleases i will not again controvert it but there is      no order if there is read it mr burke then proceeded  judge you my lords what the insolence audacity and cruelty of this man must have been from his want of patience in his present situation and when he dares to hold this language here your lordships will reckon with him for it or the world will reckon with you       mr hastings here again interrupted mr burke and said there      was no order for inquiry  mr burkeyour lordships have heard the letter readi mean the letter from the directors which i read just now you will judge whether it is an order or not i did hope within these two days to put an end to this business but when your lordships hear us charged with direct falsehood at your bar when you hear this wicked wretch who is before you       from a lordorder order order  mr burkeorder my lords we call for in the name of the commons your lordships have heard us accused at your bar of falsehood after we had read the order upon which our assertion was founded this man whom we have described as the scourge and terror of india this man gets up and charges us not with a mistake an error a wrong construction but a direct falsehoodand adds that his patience is worn out with the falsehood he hears this is not an english court of justice if such a thing is permitted we beg leave to retire and take instructions from our constituents he ought to be sent to bridewell for going on in this manner       mr wyndham here read the letter again  mr burkewith regard to the ravings of this unhappy man i am sure if i were only considering what passed from him to the managers in this box and knowing what allowance is due to a wounded conscience brought before an awful tribunal and smarting under the impressions of its own guilt i would pass them over but my lords we have the honor of the commons we have the honor of this court to sustain your lordships the other day for an offence committed against a constable who was keeping the way under your orders did very justly and to the great satisfaction of the public commit the party to bridewell for a much slighter insult against the honor and dignify of your court and i leave it therefore for the present till your lordships can seriously consider what the mode of proceeding in this matter ought to bei now proceed                                       we have read to your lordships the orders of the court of directors i again say we consider them as orders your lordships are as good judges of the propriety of the term as we are you have heard them read you have also heard that the council at calcutta considered them as orders for resolutions were moved upon them and mr stables in evidence before you here who was one of the council so considered them and yet this man has the frantic audacity in this place to assert that they were not orders and to declare that he cannot stand the repetition of such abominable falsehoods as are perpetually urged against him we cannot conceive that your lordships will suffer this and if you do i promise you the commons will not suffer the justice of the country to be trifled with and insulted in this manner because if such conduct be suffered by your lordships they must say that very disagreeable consequences will ensue and very disagreeable inferences will be drawn by the public concerning it you will forgive and we know how to forgive the ravings of people smarting under a conscious sense of their guilt but when we are reading documents given in evidence and are commenting upon them the use of this kind of language really deserves your lordships consideration as for us we regard it no more than we should other noise and brawlings of criminals who in irons may be led through the streets raving at the magistrate that has committed them we consider him as a poor miserable man railing at his accusers it is natural he should fall into all these frantic ravings but it is not fit or natural that the court should indulge him in them your lordships shall now hear in what sense mr wheler and mr stables two other members of the council understood this letter  mr wheler thus writesit always has been and always will be my wish to conform implicitly to the orders of the court of directors and i trust that the opinion which i shall give upon that part of the courts letter which is now before us will not be taken up against its meaning as going to a breach of them the orders at present under the boards consideration are entirely provisional nothing has passed since the conclusion of the agreement made by the governorgeneral with the vizier at chunar which induces me to alter the opinion which i before held as well from the governorgenerals reports to this board as the opinions which i have heard of many individuals totally unconcerned in the subject that the begums at fyzabad did take a hostile part against the company during the disturbances in benares and i am impressed with a conviction that the conduct of the begums did not proceed entirely from motives of selfdefence but as the court of directors appear to be of a different opinion and conceive that there ought to be stronger proofs of the defection of the begums than have been laid before them i think that before we decide on their orders the late and present resident at the viziers court and the commanding officers in the viziers country ought to be required to collect and lay before the board all the information they can obtain with respect to the defection of the begums during the troubles in benares and their present disposition to the company  mr stables september 9th 1783 writes thusthe court of directors by their letter of the 14th february 1783 seem not to be satisfied that the disaffection of the begums to this government is sufficiently proved by the evidence before them i therefore think that the late and present resident and commanding officers in the viziers country at the time should be called upon to collect what further information they can on this subject in which the honor and dignity of this government is so materially concerned that such information may be immediately transmitted to the court of directors  when questioned upon this subject at your lordships bar he gives this evidenceq what was your motive for proposing that investigationa a letter from the court of directors i conceived it to be ordered by themq did you conceive the letter of the court of directors positively to direct that inquirya i did so certainly at the time and i beg to refer to the minutes which expressed ita question was put to the same witness by a noble lord q the witness has stated that at the time he has mentioned he conceived the letter from the court of directors to order an inquiry and that it was upon that opinion that he regulated his conduct and his proposal for such inquiry i wish to know whether the expression at the time was merely casual or am i to understand from it that the witness has altered his opinion of the intention of this letter since that timea i certainly retain that opinion and i wished the inquiry to go on  my lords you see that his colleagues so understood it you see that we so understood it and still you have heard the prisoner after charging us with falsehood insultingly tell us we may go on as we please we may go on in our own way if your lordships think that it was not a positive order which mr hastings was bound to obey you will acquit him of the breach of it but it is a most singular thing among all the astonishing circumstances of this case that this man who has heard from the beginning to the end of his trial breaches of the companys orders constantly charged upon himnay i will venture to say that there is not a single step that we have taken in this prosecution or in observations upon evidence in which we have not charged him with an avowed direct breach of the companys orderyou have heard it ten times this dayin his defence before the commons he declares he did intentionally in naming mr markham break the companys ordersit is singular i say that this man should now pretend to be so sore upon this point what is it now that makes him break through all the rules of common decency and common propriety and show all the burnings of guilt upon being accused of the breach of one of the innumerable orders which he has broken of which he has avowed the breaking and attempted to justify himself a thousand times in the companys books for having broken  my lords one of his own body one of the council has sworn at your bar what he repeatedly declared to be his sense of it we consider it as one of the strongest orders that can be given because the reason of the order is added to it the directors declaring that if it should not be found upon inquiry you see my lords it puts the very caseif you do not find such and such things we shall consider the english honor wounded and stained and we direct you to make reparation there are in fact two orders contained in this letter which we take to be equally strong and positiveand we charge him with the breach of both namely the order for inquiry and the conditional order of restoring to the begums their jaghires or making satisfaction for them and in case of any apprehension of reluctance in the nabob to bring them for security into the companys territories the two last positive orders are preceded by the supposition of an inquiry which was to justify him either in the acts he had done or to justify him in making restitution he did neither the one nor the other we aver that he disobeyed all these orders and now let his impatience break out again  your lordships have seen amongst the various pretences by which this man has endeavored to justify his various delinquencies that of fearing to offend the nabob by the restoration of their jaghires to the begums is one your lordships will form your own judgment of the truth or falsehood of this pretence when you shall have heard the letter which i shall now read to you written to mr hastings by the nabob himself        letter from the nabob vizier to mr hastings 25th february      1782       you performed on every occasion towards me whatever was becoming      of friendship i too have done whatever affection required and      you commanded and in future also whatever may be your pleasure      there shall be no deviation therefrom because whatever you direct      is altogether for my benefit the business for which i came to      fyzabad is become settled by your favor particulars will become      known to your wisdom from the writings of mr middleton i am      grateful for your favors if in these matters you sincerely approve      me communicate it for it will be a comfort to me having      appointed my own aumils to the jaghire of the lady mother i have      engaged to pay her cash she has complied with my views her      pleasure is that after receiving an engagement he should deliver      up the jaghires what is your pleasure in this matter if you      command it will comfort the lady mother giving her back the      jaghire after i have obtained my views or i will have it under my      aumil i am obedient to your pleasure  your lordships here see the begum a suppliant to have her jaghire restored after entering into some engagement that might have been required of her and the nabob in a tone equally suppliant expressing his consent at least that her request should be complied with if the command of mr hastings could be procured                                       my lords in order to save your lordships time and that i might not overload this business i did not intend to have troubled you with any observations upon this part of it but the charge of falsehood which the prisoner at your bar has had the audacity to bring against us has induced me to lay it more particularly before you we have now done with it but before we retire your lordships will permit me to recapitulate briefly the substance of what has now been urged respecting his conduct towards these miserable women we accuse him of reiterated breaches of the orders of the court of directors both in the letter and spirit of them and of his contempt of the opinions which his colleagues in office had formed of them we charge him with the aggravation of these delinquencies by the oppression and ruin which they brought upon the family of the nabob by the infraction of treaties and by the disrepute which in his person was sustained by the government he represented and by the stain left upon the justice honor and good faith of the english nation we charge him with their farther aggravation by sundry false pretences alleged by him in justification of this conduct the pretended reluctance of the nabob the fear of offending him the suggestion of the begums having forgotten and forgiven the wrongs they had suffered and of the danger of reviving their discontent by any attempt to redress them and by his insolent language that the majesty of justice with which he impudently invests himself was only to be approached with solicitation we have farther stated that the pretence that he was only concerned in this business as an accessary is equally false it being on the contrary notorious that the nabob was the accessary forced into the service and a mere instrument in his hands and that he and sir elijah impey whose employment in this business we stated as a farther aggravation were the authors and principal agents and we farther contend that each of these aggravations and pretences is itself in fact and in its principle a substantive crime  your lordships witnessed the insolence with which this man stung to the quick by the recital of his crime interrupted me and you heard his recrimination of falsehood against us we again avouch the truth of all and every word we have uttered and the validity of every proof with which we have supported them let his impatience i say now again burst forthhe who feels so sensibly everything that touches him and yet seeks for an act of indemnity for his own atrocities by endeavoring to make you believe that the wrongs of a desolated family are within one year forgotten by them and buried in oblivion  i trust my lords that both his prosecutors and his judges will evince that patience which the criminal wants justice is not to wait to have its majesty approached with solicitation we see that throne in which resides invisibly but virtually the majesty of england we see your lordships representing in succession the juridical authority in the highest court in this kingdom but we do not approach you with solicitation we make it a petition of right we claim it we demand it the right of seeking redress is not suppliant even before the majesty of england it comes boldly forward and never thinks it offends its sovereign by claiming what is the right of all his people  we have now done with this business a business as atrocious as any that is known in the history of mankind a business that has stained throughout all asia the british character and by which our fame for honor integrity and public faith has been forfeited a business which has introduced us throughout that country as breakers of faith destroyers of treaties plunderers of the weak and unprotected and has dishonored and will forever dishonor the british name your lordships have had all this in evidence you have seen in what manner the nabob his country his revenues his subjects his mother his family his nobility and all their fortunes real and personal have been disposed of by the prisoner at your bar and having seen this you will by the impatience of this criminal estimate the patience of the unfortunate women into whose injuries he refused to inquire what he would not do the commons have done they know that you have a feeling different from that which he manifested on this occasion they do not approach you suppliantly but demand justice they insist that as the commons have done their part your lordships will perform yours                                       we shall next proceed to show your lordships how he acted towards another set of women the women of the late sujah dowlah and for whom the directors had ordered a maintenance to be secured by an express treaty you will see that he is cruel towards the weak sex and to all others in proportion as they are weak and powerless to resist him you will see i say when he had usurped the whole government of oude and brought it into a servile dependence on himself how these women fared and then your lordships will judge whether or not and in what degree he is criminal     speech  in  general reply  seventh day thursday june 12 1794   my lordswhen i had last the honor of addressing your lordships from this place my observations were principally directed to the unjust confiscation and seizure of the jaghires and treasures of the begums without previous accusation or trial or subsequent inquiry into their conduct in violation of a treaty made with them and guarantied by the east india companyto the long imprisonment and cruel treatment of their ministers and to the false pretences and abominable principles by which the prisoner at your bar has attempted to justify his conduct the several acts of violence and of oppression were as we have shown your lordships committed with circumstances of aggravated atrocity highly disgraceful to the british name and characterand particularly by his forcing the nabob to become the means and instrument of reducing his mother and grandmother and their families to absolute want and distress  i have now to call your attention to his treatment of another branch of this miserable familythe women and children of the late nabob sujah ul dowlah these persons were dependent upon the begums and by the confiscation of their property and by the ruin of various persons who would otherwise have contributed to their maintenance were reduced to the last extremity of indigence and want being left without the common necessaries of life they were driven to the necessity of breaking through all those local principles of decorum which constitute the character of the female sex in that part of the world and after fruitless supplications and shrieks of famine they endeavored to break the inclosure of the palace and to force their way to the marketplace in order to beg for bread when they had thus been forced to submit to the extremity of disgrace and degradation by exposing themselves to public view with the starving children of their late sovereign the brothers and sisters of the reigning prince they were in this attempt attacked by the sepoys armed with bludgeons and driven back by blows into the palace  my lords we have first laid before you the sufferings and disgraces of women of the first distinction in asia protected by their rank protected by their sex protected by their near relation to the prince of the country protected by two guaranties of the representative of the british government in india we now come to another class of women who suffered by the violent misappropriation of the revenues of the nabob by which their regular allowance was taken from them and your lordships will find that this mans crimes at every step we take ripen in guilt his acts of positive injustice are always aggravated by his conduct with regard to the consequences of them and form but a small part in the mass of oppression and tyranny which we have brought before you  my lords the unjust seizure of the jaghires and treasures of the begums out of which those women were maintained reduced them to a state of indigence and exposed them not only to the sufferings which belong to the physical nature of man but also to the indignities which particularly affected their sex and condition but before i proceed i will beg leave to restate to your lordships and recall to your memory who these women were  the nabob sujah dowlah had but one legitimate wife though the mahometan law admits of this numbers being extended in certain cases even to four yet it is for the most part held disreputable especially when a person is married to a woman of the first distinction to have more than one legitimate wife upon looking into the hedaya your lordships will see with what extreme rigor fornication is forbidden but we know that persons of high rank by customs that supersede both religion and laws add to the number of their wives or substitute in their room wives of a subordinate description and indulge themselves in this license to an unlimited degree you will find in chardins travels where he treats of the subject of marriage that such is the custom of all the princes of the east the wives of this subordinate class though they are in reality no better than concubines and are subject to the power and caprices of their lords are yet allowed in the eye of the severest moralists to have some excuse for their frailty and their weakness and they accordingly always do find a degree of favor in this world and become the object of particular protection  we know that sujah ul dowlah was a man unquestionably in his manners very licentious with regard to women that he had a great number of these women in his family and that his women and the women attendant upon the persons of his favorites had increased to a very great number we know that his sons amounted to twentyor according to mr hastingss own account to nineteen montesquieu supposes that there are more females born in the east than in the west but he says this upon no good ground we know by better and more regular information concerning this matter that the birth of males and females in that country is in the same proportion as it is here and therefore if you suppose that he had twenty sons you may suppose he had about nineteen daughters by the customs of that country all these sons and daughters were considered as persons of eminent distinction though inferior to the legitimate childrenassuming the rank of their father without considering the rank which their mother held all these wives with their children and all their female servants and attendants amounting in the whole to about eight hundred persons were shut up in what they call the khord mohul or lesser palace this place is described by one of the witnesses to be about as large as st jamess square your lordships have been told that in other circumstances as well as this these women were considered as objects of a great degree of respect and of the greatest degree of protection i refer your lordships to the treaty by which their maintenance was guarantied by the english government  in order to let your lordships see that i state nothing to you but what is supported not only by general history which is enough to support an account of general manners but by the particular and peculiar opinions of a person best informed of the nature of the case i will refer you to the nabob himself for undoubtedly the nabob of oude the vizier of the empire the subahdar of the country was most likely to be the best judge of what respect was due to the women of his fathers family i will therefore read to your lordships from his own letters what the nabobs opinion was upon this subject        extract of a letter from the vizier received 23d of august      1782       i never found resource equal to the necessary expenses every      year by taking from the ministers and selling the articles of my      harkhanna i with great distress transacted the business but i      could not take care of my dependants so that some of my brothers      from their difficulties arose and departed and the people of the      khord mohul of the late nabob who are all my mothers from their      distresses are reduced to poverty and involved in difficulties no      man of rank is deficient in the care of his dependants in      proportion to his ability        another letter from the vizier received the 31st july 1784       my brother dear as life saadut ali khân has requested that i      would permit his mother to go and reside with him my friend all      the mothers of my brothers and the women of the late nabob whom i      respect as my own mothers are here and it is incumbent upon me to      support them accordingly i do it and it is improper that they      should be separated nor do i approve it by gods blessing and      your kindness i hope that all the women of the late nabob may      remain here it is the wish also of my grandmother and my mother      that they should  your lordships now see in what degree of estimation the nabob held these women he regarded the wives of his father as his honorary mothers he considers their children as his brethren he thinks it would be highly dishonorable to his government if one of them was taken out of the sanctuary in which they are placed and in which he says the great of the country are obliged to maintain their dependants this is the account given by the person best acquainted with the usages of the country best acquainted with his own duties best acquainted with his own wishes  now my lords you will see in what light another person the agent of a trading company who designates himself under the name of majesty and assumes other great distinctions presumes also to consider these personsand in what contempt he is pleased to hold what is respected and what is held sacred in that country what i am now going to quote is from the prisoners second defence for i must remind your lordships that mr hastings has made three defencesone in the house of commons another in the lobby of the house of commons and a third at your lordships bar the second defence though delivered without name to the members in the lobby of the house of commons has been proved at your lordships bar to be written by himself this lobby this outofdoor defence militates in some respects as your lordships will find with the indoor defence but it probably contains the real sentiments of mr hastings himself delivered with a little more freeness when he gets into the open airlike the man who was so vain of some silly plot he had hatched that he told it to the hackneycoachman and every man he met in the streets  he saysbegums are the ladies of an eastern prince but these women are also styled the ladies of the late vizier and their sufferings are painted in such strong colors that the unsuspecting reader is led to mix the subjects together and to suppose that these latter too were princesses of oude that all their sufferings proceeded from some act of mine or had the sanction of my authority or permission the fact is that the persons of the khord mohul or little seraglio were young creatures picked up wherever youth and beauty could be found and mostly purchased from amongst the most necessitous and meanest ranks of the people for the nabobs pleasures in the indoor defence he says the said women who were mostly persons of low condition and the said children if any such there were lived in the khord mohul on an establishment entirely distinct from the said begums  my lords you have seen what was the opinion of the nabob who ought to know the nature and circumstances of his fathers palace respecting these women you hear what mr hastingss opinion is and now the question is whether your lordships will consider these women in the same light in which the person does who is most nearly connected with them and most likely to know them or in the way in which mr hastings has thought proper within doors and without doors to describe them your lordships will be pleased to observe that he has brought no proof whatever of facts which are so boldly asserted by him in defiance of proof to the contrary totally at variance with the letter of the son of the man to whom these women belonged your lordships i say will remark that he has produced not one word of evidence either within the house of commons or the house of peers or in the lobby or anywhere else to verify any one word he has said he slanders these women in order to lessen that compassion which your lordships might have for the sufferings he inflicted upon them but admitting that some of these women were of a meaner condition and that they derived nothing from their connection with the dignity of the person by whom they had children and we know that in the whole they amounted to about fourscore children the nabob having a race like the patriarchs of old as many great persons in that part of the world still havesupposing i say all this to be true yet when persons are reduced from ease and affluence to misery and distress they naturally excite in the mind a greater degree of compassion by comparing the circumstances in which they once stood with those into which they are fallen for famine degradation and oppression were famine degradation and oppression to those persons even though they were as mean as mr hastings chooses to represent them but i hope as you will sympathize with the great on account of their condition that you will sympathize with all mankind on the ground of the common condition of humanity which belongs to us all therefore i hope your lordships will not consider the calumny of mr hastings against those women as any other than as an aggravation of his offence against them that is the light in which the house of commons considered it for they had heard both his indoor and outdoor defence and they still persevered in making the charge and do persevere in making it still  we have first stated what these women werein what light they stood with the nabobin what light they stood with the country at large i have now to state in what light they stood with the british government previous to this invasion of their rights and we will prove they were the actual subjects of a guaranty by the company        extract from an agreement made by mr middleton to all the      particulars of which he engages to procure a treaty from the nabob      asoph ul dowlah after his arrival and that he will also sign it      as follows       first that whenever the begum shall choose to go to mecca she      shall be permitted to go       second that when the nabob shall arrive i mr middleton will      procure suitable allowances to be made to the ladies of the zenanah      and the children of the late nabob sujah ul dowlah and take care      that they are paid       third that the festivals shadee and marriages of the children      of the late nabob sujah ul dowlah shall be at the disposal of the      begum whenever she thinks proper she shall marry them and      whatever money shall be necessary for these expenses shall be paid      by the nabob       fourth that the syer of coda gunge and ali gunge shall be      retained by the begum as heretofore       fifth that i mr middleton will upon the arrival of the nabob      procure vizier gunge and the garden of sepoy dand khân or their      equivalent for the begum       sixth that i mr middleton will endeavor to obtain from the      nabob the sum of 1150000 rupees on account of the purchase of      metchee bohaun and the house of sahebjee and the fort of the      gossim with the land and garden and the barraderry on the banks of      goomply goomty and bazaar and garden of the house of mahnarain      and the house of beng peofand at lucknow all of which the nabob      asoph ul dowlah has assumed possession of       seventh that i will settle with the nabob the allowances to be      made in ready money to the ladies of the zenanah and others      specified in the following amount total 17 lacs 250 rupees per      month       eighth upon the arrival of the nabob asoph ul dowlah bahadur i      will endeavor with all my influence to settle the monthly      allowances of mohrum ali khân and mahmud eltifant khân c the      attendants of the begums       ninth that if the begum shall go to mecca she shall leave her      mahals and jaghires to the begum the mother of asoph ul dowlah      who shall remit the revenues thereof to the burree begum no one      shall prevent her enjoying her jaghires  now my lords we will read the copy of an engagement under the seal of the nabob asoph ul dowlah and under the seal and signature in english of mr middleton as follows       first i who am the nabob asoph ul dowlah bahadur do agree that      the jaghires and the gunges and monthly allowance of the officers      and servants and of the ladies of the zenanah and of those      specified in the accounts annexed shall be at the disposal and      under the management and authority of the begum and no one shall      oppose or prevent it this i will punctually observe in this      agreement mr middleton and the english are engaged       second whenever the begum may choose to go to mecca i will not      oppose it       third whenever the begum should go to mecca she shall leave her      lands jaghires c either in the care of my mother or of me and      i will procure bills for the amount of their revenues and send      them to her no one shall oppose this       fourth the begum shall have authority over all the ladies of her      zenanah she shall let them remain with me and not let them go      anywhere without my permission or keep them with her       fifth the jaghires coda gunge and ali gunge c with the mahal      and syer belonging to the begum and made over shall remain as      heretofore in her possession total 14460 rupees per month       eighth the begum has authority over the ladies and attendants of      the zenanah neither myself nor any one else will oppose it       ninth the begum my grandmother shall have the authority in all      festivals and in the marriage of the children of the late nabob      sujah ul dowlah and with the consent of my mother and myself      shall regulate them excepting in the festivals shadee the      authority is mine       the english are guaranties to the above engagements so long as      the begum shall exist   your lordships will observe something here worthy of your notice you will first perceive that the very treaty in which mr hastings by his representative mr middleton was a party concerned supposes that the nabob sujah ul dowlah had other children besides the reigning prince by his sole legitimate wife and yet mr hastings in his defence has thought proper with a full knowledge of that circumstance to doubt whether there were any other children you next see that these women have mr middletons that is mr hastingss guaranty for the allowances which are made and settled upon them and for the maintenance of their attendants for the security and enjoyment of their own possessions for their having a law officer of high rank a moulavy of their own in short there is a regular establishment formed for all these women they are not separated as a part distinct from the begums but they are put by this very guaranty entirely under their management the maintenance of the children is secured the whole order and economy of their establishment is delivered entirely to the begum the grandmother and the begum the mother of the nabob  my lords you see that all these arrangements have the solemn guaranty of the company and that these women form a very considerable part of that guaranty and therefore your lordships will not treat their sufferings inflicted in violation of the companys own settlement and guaranty as a matter of no consideration for you  but to proceedwe have proved to your lordships that the nabob was reduced to a state of the greatest possible misery and distress that his whole revenue was sequestered into the hands of mr hastingss agents that by the treaty of chunar he was to be relieved from the expense of a body of troops with which he had been burdened without his own voluntary consentnay more the temporary brigade which mr hastings proposed to take off but kept on which he considers not only as a great distress to his finances but a dreadful scourge and calamity to his countrythere was a whole pensionlist upon it with such enormous pensions as 18000l a year to sir eyre coote and other pensions that mr hastings proposed to take off but did not that in proportion as the nabobs distress increased mr hastingss demands increased too he was not satisfied with taking from him for the company but he took from him for himself he demanded six hundred thousand pounds as a loan when he knew he had neither money nor credit  the consequence of these acts of violence was that these people besieged by the english troops and deprived of every resource even of the funds of charity by which the protectors of the family male and female might have relieved them but which the cruel rapacity of mr hastings had either entirely taken away or greatly diminished were reduced to the last extremity of distress  after the length of time which has elapsed since we first brought these matters with their proofs i shall beg leave before you go to judgment to refresh your memory with a recital of a part of that evidence in order that your lordships may again fully and distinctly comprehend the nature and extent of the oppression cruelty and injustice committed by mr hastings and by which you may estimate the punishment you will inflict upon him        letter from captain leonard jaques to richard johnson esq      resident at the viziers court march 6th 1782       sirthe women belonging to the khord mohul complain of their      being in want of every necessary of life and are at last drove to      that desperation that they at night get on the top of the zenanah      make a great disturbance and last night not only abused the      sentinels posted in the gardens but threw dirt at them they      threatened to throw themselves from the walls of the zenanah and      also to break out of it humanity obliges me to acquaint you of      this matter and to request to know if you have any direction to      give me concerning it i also beg leave to acquaint you i sent for      letafit ali khân the cojah who has the charge of them who informs      me their complaint is well groundedthat they have sold      everything they had even to the clothes from their backs and now      have no means of existing inclosed i transmit you a letter from      mandall on the subject        letter from captain jaques to richard johnson esq march 7th      1782       siri beg leave to address you again concerning the women in the      khord mohul their behavior last night was so furious that there      seemed the greatest probability of their proceeding to the utmost      extremities and that they would either throw themselves from the      walls or force the doors of the zenanah i have made every inquiry      concerning the cause of their complaints and find from letafit ali      khân that they are in a starving condition having sold all their      clothes and necessaries and now have not wherewithal to support      nature and as my instructions are quite silent upon this head      should be glad to know how to proceed in case they were to force      the doors of the zenanah as i suspect it will happen should no      subsistence be very quickly sent to them        letter from major gilpin to john bristow esq resident at the      court of lucknow 30th october 1782       last night about eight oclock the women in the khord mohul      zenanah under the charge of letafit ali khân assembled on the      tops of the buildings crying in a most lamentable manner for      foodthat for the last four days they had got but a very scanty      allowance and that yesterday they had got none the melancholy      cries of famine are more easily imagined than described and from      their representations i fear that the nabobs agents for that      business are very inattentive i therefore think it requisite to      make you acquainted with the circumstance that his excellency the      nabob may cause his agents to be more circumspect in their conduct      to these poor unhappy women        letter from mr bristow to major gilpin fyzabad 4th november      1782       siri have received your letters of the 12th 19th 27th and      30th ultimo i communicated the contents of that of the 30th to the      minister who promised me to issue orders for the payment of a sum      of money to relieve the distress of the khord mohul i shall also      forward a bill for 10000 rupees to you in the course of three or      four days and if in the mean time you may find means to supply to      the amount of that sum i will become personally responsible to      you for the repayment        letter from major gilpin to john bristow esq at the court of      lucknow fyzabad 15th november 1782       sirthe repeated cries of the women in the khord mohul zenanah      for subsistence have been truly melancholy they beg most piteously      for liberty that they may earn their daily bread by laborious      servitude or be relieved from their misery by immediate death in      consequence of their unhappy situation i have this day taken the      liberty of drawing on you in favor of ramnarain at ten days sight      for twenty son kerah rupees ten thousand of which i have paid to      cojah letafit ali khân under whose charge that zenanah is  these my lords are the state of the distresses in the year 1782 and your lordships will see that they continued almost with only occasional reliefs during the period of that whole year now we enter into the year 1783 to show you that it continued during the whole time and then i shall make a very few remarks upon it  i will now read to your lordships a part of mr holts evidence by which it is proved that mr hastings was duly advertised of all these miserable and calamitous circumstances      q whether you saw a letter of intelligence from fyzabad     containing a relation of the treatment of the women in the khord     mohula yes i did and translated itq from whom did it     comea hoolas royq who was hea an agent of the     resident at fyzabad employed for the purpose of transmitting     information to the residentq was that paper transmitted to     mr hastingsa to the best of my recollection it was     transmitted to the board after i had attested itq do you     remember at what distance of time after the receipt of the     intelligence respecting the distresses of the khord mohul that paper     was transmitted to calcuttaa i cannot sayq do you     believe it was transmitted within ten months after the time it was     receiveda i understood it to be a letter received just before     it was transmittedq then you understand it was transmitted     as soon as receiveda yes in the course of three daysq     can you bring to your mind the time at which the translation was     madea to the best of my recollection it was in january     1784q whether the distresses that had been complained of had     ceased for above a twelvemonth before the distresses of the khord     mohula i understood they were new distressesq then you     state that that account transmitted in 1784 was as you understand     an account of new distressesa yes  i shall now refer your lordships to page 899 of your printed minutes       the managers for the commons acquainted the house that they would      next read the paper of intelligence which had been authenticated by      mr holt in his evidence at the bar relative to the miserable      situation of these women which they meant to bring home to mr      hastings        an extract of a consultation of the 17th february 1784       at a council present the honorable warren hastings esq      governorgeneral president edward wheler and john stables      esqrs mr macpherson absent from the presidency for the benefit      of his health the following letter and its inclosures were      received from mr bristow on the 8th instant and circulated       honorable sir and gentlemeni have the honor to forward for      your further information the inclosure no 3 it contains a      relation of the hardships endured by the ladies of the late      viziers zenanah         signed john bristow        translation of a paper of intelligence from fyzabad       the ladies their attendants and servants were still as      clamorous as last night letafit the darogah went to them and      remonstrated with them on the impropriety of their conduct at the      same time assuring them that in a few days all their allowances      would be paid and should that not be the case he would advance      them ten days subsistence upon condition that they returned to      their habitations none of them however consented to his      proposal but were still intent upon making their escape through      the bazaar and in consequence formed themselves in the following      orderthe children in the front behind them the ladies of the      seraglio and behind them again their attendants but their      intentions were frustrated by the opposition which they met with      from letafits sepoys the next day letafit went twice to the      women and used his endeavors to make them return into the zenanah      promising to advance them ten thousand rupees which upon the      money being paid down they agreed to comply with but night coming      on nothing transpired       on the day following their clamors were more violent than usual      letafit went to confer with them on the business of yesterday      offering the same terms depending upon the fidelity of his      promises they consented to return to their apartments which they      accordingly did except two or three of the ladies and most of      their attendants letafit went then to hossmund ali khân to      consult with him about what means they should take they came to a      resolution of driving them in by force and gave orders to their      sepoys to beat any one of the women who should attempt to move      forward the sepoys accordingly assembled and each one being      provided with a bludgeon they drove them by dint of beating into      the zenanah the women seeing the treachery of letafit proceeded      to throw stones and bricks at the sepoys and again attempted to      get out but finding that impossible from the gates being shut      they kept up a continual discharge till about twelve oclock when      finding their situation desperate they returned into the rung      mohul and forced their way from thence into the palace and      dispersed themselves about the house and gardens after this they      were desirous of getting into the begums apartments but she      being apprised of their intentions ordered the doors to be shut      in the mean time letafit and hossmund ali khân posted sentries to      secure the gates of the lesser mohul during the whole of this      conflict the ladies and women remained exposed to the view of the      sepoys       the begum then sent for letafit and hossmund ali khân whom she      severely reprimanded and insisted upon knowing the cause of this      infamous behavior they pleaded in their defence the impossibility      of helping it as the treatment the women had met with had only      been conformable to his excellency the viziers orders the begum      alleged that even admitting that the nabob had given these      orders they were by no means authorized in this manner to disgrace      the family of sujah dowlah and should they not receive their      allowances for a day or two it could be of no great moment what      had passed was now at an end but that the vizier should certainly      be acquainted with the whole of the affair and that whatever he      directed she should implicitly comply with the begum then sent for      two of the children who were wounded in the affray of last night      and after endeavoring to soothe them she again sent to letafit and      hossmund ali khân and in the presence of the children again      expressed her disapprobation of their conduct and the      improbability of asoph ul dowlahs suffering the ladies and      children of sujah dowlah to be disgraced by being exposed to the      view of the sepoys upon which letafit produced the letter from the      nabob representing that he was amenable only to the order of his      excellency and that whatever he ordered it was his duty to obey      and that had the ladies thought proper to have retired quietly to      their apartments he would not have used the means he had taken to      compel them the begum again observed that what had passed was now      over she then gave the children four hundred rupees and dismissed      them and sent word by sumrud and the other eunuchs that if the      ladies would peaceably retire to their apartments letafit would      supply them with three or four thousand rupees for their present      expenses and recommended them not to incur any further disgrace      and that if they did not think proper to act agreeably to her      directions they would do wrong the ladies followed her advice      and about ten at night went back to the zenanah the next morning      the begum waited upon the mother of sujah dowlah and related to      her all the circumstances of the disturbance the mother of sujah      dowlah returned for answer that after there being no accounts      kept by crores of revenue she was not surprised that the family of      sujah dowlah in their endeavors to procure subsistence should be      obliged to expose themselves to the meanest of the people after      bewailing their misfortunes and shedding many tears the begum took      her leave and returned home  as a proof of the extremity of the distress which reigned in the khord mohul your lordships have been told that these women must have perished through famine if their gaolers captain jaques and major gilpin had not raised money upon their own credit and supplied them with an occasional relief and therefore when they talk of his peculation of his taking but a bribe here and a bribe there see the consequences of his system of peculation see the consequences of a usurpation which extinguishes the natural authority of the country see the consequences of a clandestine correspondence that does not let the injuries of the country come regularly before the authorities in oude to relieve it consider the whole mass of crimes and then consider the sufferings that have arisen in consequence of it  my lords it was not corporal pain alone that these miserable women suffered the unsatisfied cravings of hunger and the blows of the sepoys bludgeons could touch only the physical part of their nature but my lords men are made of two partsthe physical part and the moral the former he has in common with the brute creation like theirs our corporeal pains are very limited and temporary but the sufferings which touch our moral nature have a wider range and are infinitely more acute driving the sufferer sometimes to the extremities of despair and distraction man in his moral nature becomes in his progress through life a creature of prejudice a creature of opinions a creature of habits and of sentiments growing out of them these form our second nature as inhabitants of the country and members of the society in which providence has placed us this sensibility of our moral nature is far more acute in that sex which i may say without any compliment forms the better and more virtuous part of mankind and which is at the same time the least protected from the insults and outrages to which this sensibility exposes them this is a new source of feelings that often make corporal distress doubly felt and it has a whole class of distresses of its own these are the things that have gone to the heart of the commons  we have stated first the sufferings of the begum and secondly the sufferings of the two thousand women i believe they are not fewer in number that belong to them and are dependent upon them and dependent upon their wellbeing we have stated to you that the court of directors were shocked and astonished when they received the account of the first before they had heard the second we have proved they desired him to redress the former if upon inquiry he found that his original suspicions concerning their conduct were illfounded he has declared here that he did not consider these as orders whether they were orders or not could anything have been more pressing upon all the duties and all the sentiments of man than at least to do what was justthat is to make such an inquiry as in the result might justify his acts or have entitled them to redress not one trace of inquiry or redress do we find except we suppose as we hear nothing after this of the famine that mr bristow who seems to be a man of humanity did so effectually interpose that they should no longer depend for the safety of their honor on the bludgeons of the sepoys by which alone it seems they were defended from the profane view of the vulgar and which we must state as a matter of great aggravation in this case  the counsel on the other side say that all this intelligence comes in an anonymous paper without date transmitted from a newspaperwriter at fyzabad this is the contempt with which they treat this serious paper sent to mr hastings himself by official authorityby hoolas roy who was the newswriter at fyzabadthe person appointed to convey authentic intelligence concerning the state of it to the resident at lucknow the resident received it as such he transmitted it to mr hastings and it was not till this hour till the counsel were instructed god forgive them for obeying such instructions to treat these things with ridicule that we have heard this hoolas roy called a common newswriter of anonymous information and the like if the information had come in any way the least authentic instead of coming in a manner the most authentic in which it was possible to come to mr hastings he was bound by every feeling of humanity every principle of regard to his own honor and his employers to see whether it was true or false if false to refute it if true to afford redress he has done neither therefore we charge him with being the cause we charge upon him the consequences with all the aggravations attending them and we call both upon justice and humanity for redress as far as it can be afforded to these people and for the severest punishments which your lordships can inflict upon the author of these evils if instead of the mass of crimes that we have brought before you this singly had been charged upon the prisoner i will say that it is a greater crime than any man has ever been impeached for before the house of lords from the first records of parliament to this hour  i need not remind your lordships of one particular circumstance in this cruel outrage no excuse or pretence whatever is brought forward in its justification with respect to the begums they have been charged with rebellion but who has accused the miserable inhabitants of the khord mohul of rebellion or rebellious designs what hearsay is there even against them of it no even the persons permitted by mr hastings to rob and destroy the country and who are stated by him to have been so employednot one of that legion of locusts which he had sent into the country to eat up and devour the bread of its inhabitants and who had been the cause both of the famine itself and of the inability of the begums to struggle with itnone of these people i say ventured even a hearsay about these women  were the sufferers few there were eight hundred of them besides children were they persons of any rank and consequence we are told that they were persons of considerable rank and distinction connected with and living under the protection of women of the first rank in asia were they persons not deserving pity we know that they were innocent women and children not accused and unsuspected of any crime he has taken into his head to speak contemptuously of these women of the khord mohul but your lordships will consider both descriptions generally with some respect and where they are not objects of the highest respect they will be objects of your compassion your lordships by your avenging justice will rescue the name of the british government from the foulest disgrace which this man has brought upon it  an account of these transactions as we have proved by mr holts evidence was regularly transmitted and made known to him but why do i say made known to him do not your lordships know that oude was histhat he treated it like his private estatethat he managed it in all its concerns as if it were his private demesnethat the nabob dared not do a single act without himthat he had a resident there nominated by himself and forced upon the nabob in defiance of the companys orders yet notwithstanding all this we do not find a trace of anything done to relieve the aggravated distresses of these unfortunate people  these are some of the consequences of that abominable system which in defiance of the laws of his country mr hastings established in oude he knew everything there he had spies upon his regular agents and spies again upon them we can prove indeed he has himself proved that besides his correspondence with his avowed agents major palmer and major davy he had secret correspondence with a whole host of agents and pensioners who did and must have informed him of every circumstance of these affairs but if he had never been informed of it at all the commons contend and very well and justly contend that he who usurps the government of a country who extinguishes the authority of its native sovereign and places in it instruments of his own and that in defiance of those whose orders he was bound to obey is responsible for everything that was done in the country we do charge him with these acts of delinquencies and omissions we declare him responsible for them and we call for your lordships judgment upon these outrages against humanity as cruel perhaps as ever were suffered in any country  my lords if there is a spark of manhood if there is in your breasts the least feeling for our common humanity and especially for the sufferings and distresses of that part of human nature which is made by its peculiar constitution more quick and sensibleif i say there is a trace of this in your breasts if you are yet alive to such feelings it is impossible that you should not join with the commons of great britain in feeling the utmost degree of indignation against the man who was the guilty cause of this accumulated distress you see women whom we have proved to be of respectable rank and condition exposed to what is held to be the last of indignities in that countrythe view of a base insulting ridiculing or perhaps vainly pitying populace you have before you the first women in asia who consider their honor as joined with that of these people weeping and bewailing the calamities of their house you have seen that in this misery and distress the sons of the nabob were involved and that two of them were wounded in an attempt to escape and yet this man has had the impudence to declare his doubts of the nabobs having had any children in the place though the account of what was going on had been regularly transmitted to him after this what is there in his conduct that we can wonder at  my lords the maintenance of these women had been guarantied by the company but it was doubly guarantied under the great seal of humanity the conscience of every man and more especially of the great and powerful is the keeper of that great seal and knows what is due to its authority for the violation of both these guaranties without even the vain and frivolous pretence of a rebellion and for all its consequences mr hastings is answerable and he will not escape your justice by those miserable excuses which he has produced to the court of directors and which he has produced here in his justification my lords that justification we leave with your lordships                                       we now proceed to another part of our charge which mr hastings has not thought proper to deny but upon which we shall beg leave to make a few observations you will first hear read to you from the 17th article of our charge the subjectmatter to which we now wish to call your attention       that in or about the month of march 1783 three of the said      brothers of the nabob namely mirza hyder ali mirza imayut ali      and mirza syef ali did represent to the said bristow that they      were in distress for dry bread and clothes and in consequence of      such representation were relieved by the intervention of the said      bristow but soon after the deputation of the said warren hastings      to oude in the year 1784 that is to say some time in or about      the month of september in the said year 1784 the said mirza hyder      ali one of the three princes aforesaid did fly to the province of      benares and did remain there in great distress and that although      the said warren hastings did write to the said nabob an account of      the aforesaid circumstances in certain loose light and      disrespectful expressions concerning the said mirza hyder ali he      did not as he was in duty bound to do in any wise exert that      influence which he actually and notoriously possessed over the mind      of the said nabob for the relief of the said prince the brother      of the said nabob but without obtaining any satisfactory and      specific assurances either from the said nabob or the said      minister the said warren hastings did content himself with      advising the said prince to return to his brother the said nabob  the answer of mr hastings to that part of the 17th article states       and the said warren hastings says that in or about the month of      july in the year 1783 a paper was received inclosed in a letter      to the governorgeneral and council from mr bristow purporting      to be a translation of a letter from three brothers of the said      vizier in which they did represent themselves to be in distress      for dry bread and clothes but whether such distress actually      existed and was relieved by the said bristow the said warren      hastings cannot set forth       and the said warren hastings further says that some time in the      month of september 1784 the said warren hastings being then at      benares did receive information that mirza hyder ali was arrived      there and the said warren hastings not knowing before that time      that there was any such person did write to the nabob vizier to      the purport or effect followinga few days since i learnt that a      person called mirza hyder ali was arrived at benares and calls      himself a son of the deceased nabob sujah ul dowlah and i was also      told that he came from fyzabad as i did not know whether he left      fyzabad with or without your consent i therefore did not pay him      much attention and i now trouble you to give me every information      on this subject how he came here and what your intentions are      about him he remains here in great distress and i therefore wish      to know your sentiments       and the said warren hastings further says that having received      an answer from the said vizier he did on or about the 13th of      october 1784 inclose the same in a letter to the said mirza of      which letter the following is a copyan answer is arrived to      what i wrote on your account to the nabob vizier which i inclose      to you having read it you will send it back i conceive you had      better go to the nabob viziers presence who will certainly afford      you protection and assistance i will write what is proper to carry      with you to the nabob and it will in every respect be for your      good whatever may be your intention on this head you will write      to me       and the said warren hastings submits that it was no part of his      duty as governorgeneral to interfere with the said vizier on      behalf of the said mirza or to obtain from the said vizier any      specific assurances on the subject  continuation of the 17th article of the charge       that in order to avoid famine at home another of the said      nabobs brothers by name mirza jungli was under the necessity of      flying from his native country and did seek protection from a      certain mahometan lord called mirza shuffee khân then      primeminister of the mogul from whom he did go to the camp of the      mahratta chief mahdajee sindia where he did solicit and obtain a      military command together with a grant of lands or jaghire for      the subsistence of himself his family and followers but wishing      again to be received under the protection of the british      government the said mirza jungli in 1783 did apply to the said      resident bristow through david anderson esquire then on an      embassy in the camp of the said sindia and in consequence of such      application the said bristow sensible of the disgrace which the      exile of the said mirza jungli reflected both on the said nabob of      oude and the british nation did negotiate with the said nabob and      his ministers for the return of the said mirza jungli and for the      settlement and regular payment of some proper allowance for the      maintenance of the said mirza jungli but the allowance required      was ultimately refused and although the whole of the transactions      aforesaid were duly represented to the said warren hastings by the      said anderson and by the said bristow and although he had himself      received so early as the 23d of august 1782 a letter from the      vizier grievously complaining of the cruel and extortious demands      made upon him by the said warren hastings in which letter he did      expressly mention the flight of his brothers and the distresses of      the women of his late father who he said were all as his mothers      and that his said brothers from the resumption of their jaghires      were reduced to great affliction and distress and he did attribute      the said flight of some of his brethren and the distresses of the      rest and of the women who stood in a species of maternal relation      to him as owing to the aforesaid oppressive demands yet he the      said warren hastings did cruelly inhumanly and corruptly decline      to make any order for the better provision of any of the said      eminent family or for the return of the said prince who had fled      from his brothers court to avoid the danger of perishing by      famine  answer of mr hastings to that part of the charge       and the said warren hastings further says that he was informed      that mirza jungli in the said article also mentioned did leave      his native country in distress and did go to mirza shuffee khân      in the said article also mentioned and the said warren hastings      likewise admits he was informed that the said mirza jungli did      afterwards leave the said mirza shuffee khân and repair to the      camp of mahdajee sindia with a view of obtaining some      establishment for himself and followers       and the said warren hastings further says that in certain letters      written by david anderson esquire and john bristow esquire it      was represented that the said mirza jungli did apply to the said      bristow through the said anderson then on an embassy in the camp      of the said sindia and that in consequence thereof the said      bristow did amongst other things apply to the said nabob vizier      for a certain allowance to be made for the said mirza and for the      regular payment thereof and that a certain allowance was      accordingly settled by the said vizier on the said mirza and the      said warren hastings says that information of the above      transactions was transmitted to the board of council and that a      letter from the said vizier was received on the 23d of august      1782 containing certain representations of the distresses of      himself and his family and he admits that no order was made by      him the said warren hastings for the provision of any of the said      family or for the return of the said mirza but the said warren      hastings denies that he was guilty of any cruelty inhumanity or      corruption or of any misconduct whatsoever in the matters      aforesaid  continuation of the charge       that some time in or about the month of december 1783 the nabob      bahadur another of the brothers of the said nabob of oude did      represent to the said bristow that he the said nabob bahadur had      not received a farthing of his allowance for the current year and      was without food and being wounded by an assassin who had also      murdered his aunt in the very capital of oude the said nabob      bahadur had not a daum to pay the surgeon who attended him for the      love of god alone that at or about the period of this said      representation the said bristow was recalled and the said warren      hastings proceeded up to lucknow but did not inquire into the said      representations transmitted by the said bristow to calcutta nor      did order any relief  mr hastingss answer to the part of the charge last read       and the said warren hastings further says that on the 29th of      january 1784 after the recall of the said bristow he the said      bristow did transmit to the governorgeneral and council two      letters one dated 28th of december 1783 the other 7th of      january 1784 purporting to be written by the said nabob bahadur      addressed to him the said bristow to the effect in the said      article stated and the said warren hastings admits that when at      lucknow he did not institute any inquiry into the supposed      transaction in the said 17th article stated or make any order      concerning the said bahadur and he denies that it was his duty so      to do  here is the name of this nabob from a list of the jaghiredars stated by mr purling page 485 printed minutes amongst the names of jaghiredars the times when granted and the amount of the jaghires there occurs that of the nabob bahadur with a grant of a jaghire of the amount of 20000 rupees      the lord chancellor here remarked that what had been     just read was matter of the 17th article of the charge     and parts of the answer to it and that upon looking     back to the former proceedings it has escaped his     attention if any matter contained in the 17th article     had been made matter of the charge that it therefore     seemed to him that it could not be brought in upon a     reply not having been made matter of the charge     originally      mr burke my lords i have to say to this that i     believe you have heard these facts made matter of charge     by the house of commons that i conceive they have been     admitted by the prisoner and that the commons have     nothing to do with the proofs of anything in their     charge which is fully and in terms admitted the proofs     which they have produced to your lordships were upon     matters which were contested but here the facts are     admitted in the fullest manner we neither have     abandoned them intended to abandon them or ever shall     abandon them we have made them as a charge upon     record the answers to them have been recorded which     answers are complete admissions of every fact in the     charge      lord chancellor i do not make myself understood the     objection is not that there has not been evidence given     upon the 17th article but at the close of the case on     the part of the managers for the house of commons no     mention having been made of the matter contained in the     17th article that therefore although it may all have     been admitted by the answer to be true yet in justice     if from that answer you ground the charge it is     necessary the defendant should be heard upon it      mr burke if your lordships choose that the defendant     shall be heard upon it we have no kind of objection     nor ever had or proposed an objection to the defendant     being heard upon it your lordships know that the     defendants counsel value themselves upon having     abandoned their defence against certain parts of the     charge your lordships know that they declared that they     broke off thus in the middle of their defence in order     to expedite this business      lord chancellor referring to the proceedings i think     it a matter perfectly clear that in the course of the     charge after certain articles had been gone through     the managers for the commons closed the case there     leaving therefore all the other articles excepting     those that had been discussed as matters standing with     the answers against them but not insisted upon in     making out the charge of course therefore if the     defendant had gone into any of those articles the     defendant must have been stopped upon them because he     would then have been making a case in defence to that     which had not been made a case in the prosecution the     objection therefore is not at all that no evidence has     been examined to be sure it would be an answer to that     to say you are now proceeding upon an admission but     even upon those facts that are admitted if the facts     are admitted that are insisted upon as matter in     charge that should come in the original state of the     cause and the defendant in common justice must be heard     upon that and then and then only come the     observations in reply      mr burke we do not know not are informed that any     charge information or indictment that is before the     court and upon record and is not denied by the     defendant does not stand in full force against him we     conceive it to be so we conceive it to be agreeable to     the analogy of all proceedings and the reason why we     did not go into and insist upon it was that having a     very long cause before us and having the most full and     complete admission upon this subject we did not proceed     further in it the defendant defends himself by averring     that it was not his duty it was not our business to     prove that it was his duty it was he that admitted the     facts assumed to be the foundation of his duty the     negative he was bound to prove and he never offered to     prove it all that i can say upon this point is that     his delinquency in the matter in question appeared to us     to be a clear distinct caseto be a great     offencean offence charged upon the record admitted     upon the record and never by us abandoned as to his     defence having been abandoned we refer your lordships     to the last petition laid by him upon your table that     libellous petition which we speak of as a libel upon     the house of commons and which has no validity but as     it asserts a matter of fact from the petitioner and     there you will find that he has declared explicitly     that for the accommodation and ease of this business     and for its expedition he did abandon his defence at a     certain period      lord chancellor a charge consisting of a variety of     articles in their nature however connected with each     other in their subject but in their nature distinct     and specific if only certain articles are pressed in     the charge to those articles only can a defence be     applied and all the other articles that are not made     matter of charge originally have never in the course     of any proceeding whatever been taken up originally     in reply      mr burke with great respect to your lordships     judgment we conceive that the objection taken from our     not having at a certain period argued or observed upon     the prisoners answer to the articles not insisted upon     is not conclusive inasmuch as the record still stands     and as our charge still stands it was never abandoned     and the defendant might have made a justification to     it if he had thought fit he never did think fit so to     do if your lordships think that we ought not to argue     upon it here in our reply because we did not argue upon     it beforewell and good but we have argued and do     argue in our reply many things to which he never gave     any answer at all i shall beg leave if your lordships     please to retire with my fellow managers for a moment     to consult whether we shall press this point or not we     shall not detain your lordships many minutes      the managers withdrew in a few minutes the managers     returned again into the hall      mr burke my lords the managers have consulted among     themselves upon this business they first referred to     your printed proceedings in order to see the particular     circumstance on which the observation of your lordship     is founded we find it thus statedthen the managers     for the commons informed the lords that saving to     themselves their undoubted rights and privileges the     commons were content to rest their charge here we     rested our charge there not because we meant to efface     any precedent matter of the charge which had been made     by us and of which the facts had been admitted by the     defendant but simply saving our rights and privileges     that is to resume and to make new matter if we     thought fit the commons were content to rest the     charge there      i have further to remark to your lordships that the     counsel for the defendant have opened a vast variety of     matter that is not upon record either on our part or on     theirs in order to illustrate and to support their     cause and they have spoken day after day upon the     principles on which their defence was made my great     object now is an examination of those principles and to     illustrate the effects of these principles by examples     which are not the less cogent the less weighty and the     less known because they are articles in this charge     most assuredly they are not if your lordships recollect     the speeches that were made here you know that great     merit was given to mr hastings for matters that were     not at all in the charge and which would put us under     the greatest difficulties if we were to take no notice     of them in our reply for instance his merits in the     mahratta war and a great mass of matter upon that     subject were obliquely and for other purposes brought     before you upon which they argued that immense mass of     matter containing an immense mass of principles and     which was sometimes supported by alleged facts     sometimes by none they have opened and argued upon as     matter relative to principle in answer to their     argument we propose to show the mischiefs that have     happened from the mischievous principles laid down by     mr hastings and the mischievous consequences of them      if however after this explanation your lordships are     of opinion that we ought not to be allowed to take this     course wishing to fall in with your lordships     sentiments we shall abandon it but we will remind your     lordships that such things stand upon your records that     they stand unanswered and admitted on your records and     consequently they cannot be destroyed by any act of     ours but by a renunciation of the charge which     renunciation we cannot make because the defendant has     clearly and fully admitted it to be founded in fact we     cannot plead error we cannot retract it and why     because he has admitted it we therefore only remind     your lordships that the charge stands uncontradicted     and that the observation we intended to make upon it was     to show your lordships that the principles upon which he     defends all such conduct are totally false and     groundless but though your lordships should be of     opinion that we cannot press it yet we cannot abandon     it it is not in your power it is not in our power it     is not in his power to abandon that charge you cannot     acquit him of that charge it is impossible if     however your lordships for the accommodation of     business method of proceedings or any circumstance of     that kind wish we should say no more upon the subject     we close the subject there your lordships are in     possession both of the charge and the admission and we     wish and we cannot wish better than to leave it as it     is upon the record      the lord chancellor here saidthe opinion of the     lords can only be with me matter of conjecture i     certainly was not commanded by the house to state the     observation that had occurred to me but in the position     in which it now stands i feel no difficulty in saying     as my own judgment that nothing can be matter in reply     that does not relate to those articles that were pressed     in the original charge and therefore in this position     of the business of reply you cannot go into new matter     arising out of other articles that were not originally     insisted upon      mr burke we were aware of the objection that might     be made to admitting our observations if considered as     observations upon the 17th article but not when     considered with reference to facts on the record before     you for the purpose of disproving the principles upon     which the defendant and his counsel had relied that was     the purpose for which we proposed chiefly to make them     but your lordships the lord chancellors own personal     authority will have great weight with us and unless we     perceive some other peer differ from you we will take     it in the course we have constantly done we never have     sent your lordships out of the hall to consent     consult upon a matter upon which that noble lord     appeared to have formed a decision in his own mind we     take for granted that what is delivered from the     woolsack to which no peer expresses a dissent is the     sense of the house as such we take it and as such we     submit to it in this instance      therefore leaving this upon the record as it stands     without observing upon it and submitting to your     lordships decision that we cannot according to order     observe in reply upon what was not declared by us to be     a part of the charges we meant to insist upon we     proceed to another business  we have already stated to your lordships and we beg to remind you of it the state and condition of the country of oude when mr hastings first came to ithis subsequent and immediate usurpation of all the powers of government and the use he made of themthe tyranny he exercised over the nabob himselfthe tyranny he exercised upon his mother and grandmother and all the other females of his family and their dependants of every description to the number of about eight hundred personsthe tyranny exercised though we are not at liberty to press it now upon his brethren we have shown you how he confiscated the property of all the jaghiredars the nobility of the country we have proved to your lordships that he was well acquainted with all the misery and distress occasioned by these proceedings and that he afforded the sufferers no relief we now proceed to review the effect of this general mass of usurpation tyranny and oppression upon the revenues and the prosperity of the country  your lordships will first be pleased to advert to the state in which mr hastings found the countryin what state he found its revenueswho were the executive ministers of the governmentwhat their conduct was and by whom they were recommended and supported for the evidence of these facts we refer your lordships to your printed minutes there my lords they stand recorded they never can be expunged out of your record and the memory of mankind whether we be permitted to press them at this time upon your lordships or not your lordships will there find in what manner the government was carried on in oude in 1775 before the period of mr hastingss usurpation mr hastings you will find has himself there stated that the minister was recommended by the begums and you will remark this because mr hastings afterwards makes her interference in the government of her son a part of his crimination of the begum                                       the resident at the court of oude thus writes on the 2d of march 1775       notwithstanding the confidence the nabob reposes in murtezza khân      the begums are much dissatisfied with his elevation they      recommended to his excellency to encourage the old servants of the      government whose influence in the country and experience might      have strengthened his own authority and seated him firmly on the      musnud in some measure this too may appear consistent with the      interests of the company for as elija khân and the old ministers      have by frequent instances within their own knowledge experienced      the power of our government such men i should conceive are much      more likely to pay deference to the company than a person who at      present can have but a very imperfect idea of the degree of      attention which ought to be paid to our connection with the nabob  your lordships see that the begums recommended the old servants contrary to the maxims of rehoboamthose who had served his father and had served the country and who were strongly inclined to support the english interest there your lordships will remark the effects of the begums influence upon the state of things in 1775 that the nabob had been advised by his mother to employ the confidential servants of his fatherpersons conversant in the affairs of the country persons interested in it and persons who were well disposed to support the english connection your lordships will now attend to a letter from mr bristow at lucknow to the board dated 28th november 1775       i also neglected no part of my duty on the spot but advised the      minister even at lucknow according to my letter of the 3d      instant to recommend it to the nabob to dismiss his useless and      mutinous troops which measure seems by present appearances to have      succeeded beyond expectation as the rest of the army do now pay      the greatest attention to his excellencys orders already the      complaints of the violences the troops used to commit are greatly      decreased they profess obedience and by the best intelligence i      can obtain of their disposition there seems to be little doubt      that the example made by disbanding bussunts corps has every good      effect we could wish which had crossed the river and voluntarily      surrendered their arms the day before yesterday to the nabob  his next letter is dated 13th june 1776       honorable sir and sirsit is elija khâns first object to      regulate the viziers revenue and i must do him the justice to      say that the short time he has been in office he has been      indefatigable and already settled the greater part of the province      of oude and fixed on the districts for the assignments of the army      subsidy corah and allahabad he has disposed of and called for the      dooab and rohilcund accounts in order to adjust them as soon as      possible this activity will i hope produce the most salutary      effectsas the present juncture being the commencement of the      season for the cultivation the aumils by being thus early placed      in their offices have the opportunity of advancing tukavy      encouraging the ryots and making their agreements in their several      districts in letting underfarms or disposing of the lands in      such a manner as they may judge most expedient if though similar      to the late ministers conduct a delay of two or three months      should occur in the settlement of the lands the people throughout      the country would be disheartened and inevitably a very heavy      balance accrue on the revenue i have troubled the honorable board      with this detail in the first place to show the propriety of      elija khâns conduct and in the next the essential service that      will be rendered to the vizier by continuing colonel parkers      detachment during the whole rains in corah if required by the      vizier  my lords you have now had a view of the state of oude previous to the first period of our connection with it your lordships have seen and understand that part of the middle period with which we do not mean to trouble you again you will now be pleased to attend to a letter from fyzoola khân to the governorgeneral received the 13th of february 1778       this country of cuttah which formerly depended on the rohilla      states and which i consider as now appertaining to the company      was very populous and flourishing but since the commencement of      the nabob viziers government the farmers appointed by his      ministers have desolated the country its situation is at present      very ruinous thousands of villages formerly populous are now      utterly deserted and no trace left of them i have already written      to roy buckstowr sing a full account of the tyranny and oppression      exercised by the farmers to be communicated to you the constant      revenue of a country depends on the care of its rulers to preserve      it in a flourishing state i have been induced to make the      representation by my attachment to the interest of the company for      otherwise it is no concern of mine should these oppressions      continue one or two years longer and the rulers take no measures      to put a stop to them the whole country will be a desert  my lords upon these statements i have only to make this remarkthat you have seen the first state of this country and that the period when it had fallen into the state last described was about two years after mr hastings had obtained the majority in the council and began to govern this country by his lieutenants we know that the country was put by him under military collectors you see the consequences the person who makes this representation to mr hastings of the state of the country of its distress and calamity and of the desolation of a thousand of the villages formerly flourishing in it is no less a person than a prince of a neighboring country a person of whom you have often heard and to whom the cause of humanity is much indebted namely fyzoola khâna prince whose country the english resident travelling through declares to be cultivated like a garden that this was the state of the rohilla country is owing to its having very fortunately been one of those that escaped the dominion of mr hastings  we will now read to your lordships a letter from sir eyre coote to the board at calcutta dated the 11th of september 1779       honorable sir and sirsthe day before yesterday i encamped near      allahabad where the vizier did me the honor of a visit and      yesterday morning in my way hither i returned it and was      received by his excellency with every mark of respect and      distinction this morning he called here and we had some general      conversation which principally turned upon the subject of his      attachment to the english and his readiness to show the sincerity      of it upon all occasions it is to be wished we had employed the      influence which such favorable sentiments must have given us more      to the benefit of the country and ourselves but i fear the      distresses which evidently appear on the face of the one and the      failure of the revenues to the other are not to be wholly ascribed      to the viziers mismanagement  this is the testimony of mr hastingss own pensioner sir eyre coote respecting the known state of the country during the time of this horrible usurpation which sir eyre coote mentions under the soft name of our influence but there could be but one voice upon the subject and that your lordships shall now hear from mr hastings himself we refer your lordships to the minute of the governorgenerals consultation fort william 21st may 1781 he is here giving his reasons for going into the upper provinces       the province of oude having fallen into a state of great disorder      and confusion its resources being in an extraordinary degree      diminished and the nabob asoph ul dowlah having earnestly      entreated the presence of the governorgeneral and declared that      unless some effectual measures are taken for his relief he must be      under the necessity of leaving his country and coming down to      calcutta to present his situation to this governmentthe      governorgeneral therefore proposes with the concurrence of mr      wheler to visit the province of oude as speedily as the affairs of      the presidency will admit in hopes that from a minute and      personal observation of the circumstances of that country the      system of management which has been adopted and the characters      and conduct of the persons employed he may possibly be able to      concert and establish some plan by which the province of oude may      in time be restored to its former state of affluence good order      and prosperity  your lordships have now the whole chain of the evidence complete with regard to the state of the country up to the period of mr hastingss journey into the country you see that mr hastings himself admits it to have been formerly in a most flourishing orderly and prosperous state its condition in 1781 he describes to you in words than which no enemy of his can use stronger in order to paint the state in which it then was in this state he found it when he went up in the year 1781 and he left it with regard to any substantial regulation that was executed or could be executed in the state in which he found itafter having increased every one of those grievances which he pretended to redress and taken from it all the little resources that remained in it  we now come to a subsequent period at which time the state of the country is thus described by mr bristow on the 12th december 1782       despotism is the principle upon which every measure is founded      and the people in the interior parts of the country are ruled at      the discretion of the aumil or foujdar for the time being they      exercise within the limits of their jurisdiction the powers of      life and death and decisions in civil and other cases in the same      extent as the sovereign at the capital the forms prescribed by the      ancient institutions of the mogul empire are unattended to and the      will of the provincial magistrate is the sole law of the people      the total relaxation of the viziers authority his inattention and      dislike to business leave the aumils in possession of this      dangerous power unawed uncontrolled by any apprehension of      retrospection or the interference of justice i can hardly quote      an instance since the viziers accession to the musnud of an      aumil having been punished for oppression though the complaints of      the people and the state of the country are notorious proofs of the      violences daily committed it is even become unsafe for travellers      to pass except in large bodies murders thefts and other      enormities shocking to humanity are committed in open day  in another paragraph of the same letter he says       such has been the system of this government that the oppressions      have generally originated with the aumils they have been rarely      selected for their abilities or integrity but from favor or the      means to advance a large sum upon being appointed to their office      the aumil enters upon his trust ruined in reputation and fortune      and unless he accomplishes his engagements which is seldom the      case disgrace and punishment follow though the balance of revenue      may be rigorously demanded of him it has not been usual to      institute any inquiry for oppression the zemindars thus left at      the mercy of the aumils are often driven to rebellion the weak      are obliged to submit to his exactions or fly the country and the      aumil unable to reduce the more powerful is compelled to enter      into a disgraceful compromise every zemindar looks to his fort for      protection and the country is crowded with them almas ali khân      asserts there are not less than seven hundred in his districts      hence it has become a general custom to seize the brother son or      some near relation or dependant of the different zemindars as      hostages for the security of the revenue a great aumil will      sometimes have three or four hundred of these hostages whom he is      obliged to confine in places of security a few men like almas ali      khân and coja ain ul din have from their regularity in the      performance of pecuniary engagements rendered themselves useful to      the vizier a strict scrutiny into his affairs was at all times      irksome to his excellency and none of the ministers or officers      about his person possessing the active persevering spirit      requisite to conduct the detail of engagements for a number of      small farms it became convenient to receive a large sum from a      great farmer without trouble or deficiency this system was      followed by the most pernicious consequences these men were above      all control they exacted their own terms and the districts they      farmed were most cruelly oppressed the revenue of rohilcund is      reduced above a third and almas ali khâns administration is well      known to have been extremely violent  we will next read to your lordships an extract from captain edwardss evidence      q had you any opportunity of observing the general face of the     country in the time of sujah dowlaha i hadq did you     remark any difference in the general state of the country at that     time and the period when you made your latter observationdid you     observe any difference between the condition of the country at that     time that of sujah dowlah in the year 1774 and the latter period     you have mentioneda i dida very material differenceq     in what respecta in the general aspect that the country bore     and the cultivation of the countrythat it was infinitely better     cultivated in 1774 than it was in 1783q you said you had no     opportunity of observing the face of the country till you was     appointed aidedecamp to the naboba noexcept by marching     and countermarching i marched in the year 1774 through the nabob     sujah ul dowlahs provinces into rohilcundq had you those     opportunities from the time of your going there in 1774a i     had but not so much as i had after being appointed aidedecamp to     the vizier because i was always before in a subordinate situation     i marched in a direct line before with the troops but afterwards     when i was aidedecamp to his excellency i was my own master and     made frequent excursions into the different parts of the     countryq had you an opportunity of observing the difference in     the general happiness and disposition of the peoplea i     hadq did you observe a difference in that respect also between     your first coming and the year 1783a yes a very sensible     difference in sujah ul dowlahs time the country was in a very     flourishing state in merchandise cultivation and every article of     commerce and the people then seemed to be very happy under his     government which latterly was not the case because the country in     reality appeared in the year 1774 in a flourishing state and in the     year 1783 it appeared comparatively forlorn and desolateq was     the court of asoph ul dowlah when you left india equal in point     of splendor to what it was in the time of sujah ul dowlaha by     no means it was not equally splendid but far inferiorq were     the dependants and officers belonging to the court paid in the same     punctual mannera no i really cannot say whether they were     paid more regularly in sujah dowlahs time only they appeared more     wealthy and more able to live in a splendid style in his time than     they ever have done since his death  here then your lordships see the state of the country in 1783 your lordships may trace the whole progress of these evils step by step from the death of sujah ul dowlah to the time of mr hastingss obtaining a majority in the council after which he possessed the sole and uncontrolled management of the country you have seen also the consequences that immediately followed till the year 1784 when he went up a second time into the country  i do not know my lords that it is necessary to make any observation upon this state of things you see that the native authority was as we have proved utterly extinguished by mr hastings and that there was no superintendent power but his you have heard of the oppressions of the farmers of the revenues and we have shown you that these farmers generally were english officers we have shown you in what manner colonel hannay one of these farmers sent by mr hastings acted and particularly the accumulation of hostages which were made by him we have shown you that by their arbitrary and tyrannical proceedings all regular government was subverted and that the country experienced the last and most dreadful effects of anarchy we have shown you that no other security was left to any human being but to intrench themselves in such forts as they could make and that these forts in one district only of the country had increased in number to the amount of seven hundred your lordships also know that when the prisons and mud forts in which colonel hannay kept his hostages confined were full he kept them in uncovered cages in the open air you know that all these farmers of revenue were either english and military men or natives under an abject submission to them you know that they had the whole country in assignments that the jaghires were all confiscated for their benefits and you find that the whole system had its origin at the time when mr hastings alone formed in effect the authority of the supreme council the weakness of the nabob as sir eyre coote tells you could not have been alone the cause of these evils and that our influence over him if not actually the cause of the utter ruin desolation and anarchy of that country might have been successfully exerted in preventing  when your lordships shall proceed to judgment upon these accumulated wrongs arising out of the usurped power of the prisoner at your bar and redressed by him in no one instance whatever let not the usurpation itself of the nabobs power be considered as a trivial matter when any prince at the head of a great country is entirely stripped of everything in his government civil or military by which his rank may be distinguished or his virtues exercised he is in danger of becoming a mere animal and of abandoning himself wholly to sensual gratifications feeling no personal interest in the institutions or in the general welfare of the country he suffers the former and many wise and laudable institutions existed in the provinces of the nabob for their good order and government to fall into disuse and he leaves the country itself to persons in inferior situations to be wasted and destroyed by them you find that in oude the very appearance of justice had been banished out of it and that every aumil exercised an arbitrary power over the lives and fortunes of the people my lords we have the proofs of all these facts in our hands they are in your lordships minutes and though we can state nothing stronger than is stated in the papers themselves yet we do not so far forget our duty as not to point out to your lordships such observations as arise out of them  to close the whole your lordships shall how hear read an extract from a most curious and extraordinary letter sent by him to the court of directors preparatory to his return to england       my only remaining fear is that the members of the council seeing      affairs through a different medium from that through which i view      them may be disposed if not to counteract the system which i have      formed to withhold from it their countenance and active support      while i myself remain it will be sufficient if they permit it to      operate without interruption and i almost hope in the event of a      new administration of your affairs which shall confine itself to      the same forbearance and manifest no symptoms of intended      interference the objects of my arrangements will be effectually      attained for i leave them in the charge of agents whose interests      ambition and every prospect of life are interwoven with their      success and the hand of heaven has visibly blest the soil with      every elementary source of progressive vegetation but if a      different policy shall be adopted if new agents are sent into the      country and armed with authority for the purpose of vengeance or      corruption to no other will they be applied if new demands are      raised on the nabob vizier and accounts overcharged on one side      with a wide latitude taken on the other to swell his debt beyond      the means of paymentif political dangers are portended to      ground on them the pleas of burdening his country with unnecessary      defences and enormous subsidiesor if even abstaining from      direct encroachment on the nabobs rights your government shall      show but a degree of personal kindness to the partisans of the late      usurpation or by any constructive indication of partiality and      disaffection furnish ground for the expectation of an approaching      change of system i am sorry to say that all my labors will prove      abortive for the slightest causes will be sufficient to deject      minds sore with the remembrance of past conflicts and to elevate      those whose only dependence is placed in the renewal of the      confusion which i have labored with such zeal to eradicate and      will of course debilitate the authority which can alone insure      future success i almost fear that this denunciation of effects      from causes so incompetent as they will appear to those who have      not had the experience which i have had of the quick sensibility      which influences the habits of men placed in a state of polity so      loose and subject to the continual variations of capricious and      despotic authority will be deemed overcharged or perhaps void of      foundation nor if they should come to pass will it be easy to      trace them with any positive evidence to their connection yet it      is my duty to apprise you of what i apprehend on grounds which i      deem of absolute certainty may come to pass and i rely on your      candor for a fair interpretation of my intention  here my lords the prisoner at your bar has done exactly what his bitterest accuser would do he goes through head by head every one of the measures which he had himself pursued in the destruction of the country and he foretells that if any one of those measures should again be pursued or even if good cause should be given to suspect they would be renewed the country must fall into a state of inevitable destruction this supersedes all observation this paper is a recapitulated minute condemnation of every step which he took in that country and which steps are every one of them upon your lordships minutes  but my lords we know very well the design of these pretended apprehensions and why he wished to have that country left in the state he speaks of he had left a secret agent of his own to control that ostensible government and to enable him sitting in the place where he now sits to continue to govern those provinces in the way in which he now governs them       a murmur having arisen here mr burke proceeded  if i am called upon to reword what i have just said i shall repeat my words and show strong grounds and reasons to indicate that he governs oude now as much as he ever did  you see my lords that the reform which he pretended to make in 1781 produced the calamities which he states to have existed in 1784 we shall now show that the reform which he pretended to make in 1784 brought on the calamities which lord cornwallis states in his evidence to have existed in 1787  we will now read two letters from lord cornwallis the first is dated the 16th november 1787       i was received at allahabad and attended to lucknow by the nabob      and his ministers with every mark of friendship and respect i      cannot however express how much i was concerned during my short      residence at his capital and my progress through his dominions to      be witness of the disordered state of his finances and government      and of the desolate appearances of his country the evils were too      alarming to admit of palliation and i thought it my duty to exhort      him in the most friendly manner to endeavor to apply effectual      remedies to them he began with urging as apology that whilst he      was not certain of the expense extent of our demands upon him      he had no real interest in being economical in his expenses and      that while we interfered in the internal management of his      affairs his own authority and that of his ministers were despised      by his own subjects it would have been useless to discuss these      topics with him but while i repeated my former declarations of our      being determined to give no ground in future for similar      complaints he gave me the strongest assurances of his being      resolved to apply himself earnestly to the encouragement of      agriculture and to endeavor to revive the commerce of his      country  the second is dated the 25th april 1788       till i saw the viziers troops i was not without hope that upon      an emergency he would have been able to have furnished us with some      useful cavalry but i have no reason to believe that he has any in      his service upon which it would be prudent to place any dependence      and i think it right to add that his country appears to be in so      ruined a state and his finances in so much disorder that even in      case of war we ought not to depend upon any material support from      him  my lords i have only to remark upon these letters that so far as they go they prove the effects of mr hastingss reformation from which he was pleased to promise the company such great things but when your lordships know that he had left his dependant and minister hyder beg khân there whose character as your lordships will find by a reference to your minutes he has represented as black as hell to be the real governor there and to carry on private correspondence with him here and that he had left major palmer his private agent for a considerable time in that country to carry on his affairs your lordships will easily see how it has come to pass that the vizier such a man as you have heard him described to be was not alone able to restore prosperity to his country  my lords you have now seen what was the situation of the country in sujah dowlahs time prior to mr hastingss interference with the government of it what it was during his government and what situation it was in when lord cornwallis left it nothing now remains but to call your lordships attention to perhaps the most extraordinary part of these transactions but before we proceed we will beg leave to go back and read to your lordships the nabobs letter of the 24th february 1780       i have received your letter and understand the contents i cannot      describe the solidity of your friendship and brotherly affection      which subsisted between you and my late father from the friendship      of the company he received numberless advantages and i      notwithstanding i was left an orphan from your favor and that of      the company was perfectly at ease being satisfied that everything      would be well and that i should continue in the same security that      i was during my fathers lifetime from your protection i      accordingly from the day of his death have never omitted to      cultivate your favor and the protection of the company and      whatever was the desire and directions of the council at that time      i have ever since conformed to and obeyed with readiness thanks      be given to god that i have never as yet been backward in      performing the will of the english company of the council and of      you and have always been from my heart ready to obey them and      have never given you any trouble from my difficulties or wishes      this i have done simply from my own knowledge of your favor towards      me and from my being certain that you would learn the particulars      of my distresses and difficulties from other quarters and would      then show your friendship and goodwill in whatever was for my      advantage but when the knife had penetrated to the bone and i was      surrounded with such heavy distresses that i could no longer live      in expectations i then wrote an account of my difficulties the      answer which i have received to it is such that it has given me      inexpressible grief and affliction i never had the least idea or      expectation from you and the council that you would ever have      given your orders in so afflicting a manner in which you never      before wrote and which i could not have imagined as i am resolved      to obey your orders and directions of the council without any      delay as long as i live i have agreeably to those orders      delivered up all my private papers to him the resident that      when he shall have examined my receipts and expenses he may take      whatever remains as i know it to be my duty to satisfy you the      company and council i have not failed to obey in any instance      but requested of him that it might be done so as not to distress me      in my necessary expenses there being no other funds but those for      the expenses of my mutsuddies household expenses and servants      c he demanded these in such a manner that being remediless i      was obliged to comply with what he required he has accordingly      stopped the pensions of my old servants for thirty years whether      sepoys mutsuddies or household servants and the expenses of my      family and kitchen together with the jaghires of my grandmother      mother and aunts and of my brothers and dependants which were      for their support i had raised fifteen hundred horse and three      battalions of sepoys to attend upon me but as i have no resources      to support them i have been obliged to remove the people stationed      in the mahals and to send his people into the mahals so that i      have not now one single servant about me should i mention what      further difficulties i have been reduced to it would lay me open      to contempt although i have willingly assented to this which      brings such distress on me and have in a manner altogether ruined      myself yet i failed not to do it for this reason because it was      for your satisfaction and that of the council and i am patient      and even thankful in this condition but i cannot imagine from      what cause you have conceived displeasure against me from the      commencement of my administration in every circumstance i      received strength and security from your favor and that of the      council and in every instance you and the council have shown your      friendship and affection for me but at present that you have sent      these orders i am greatly perplexed  we will not trouble your lordships with the remainder of the letter which is all in the same style of distress and affliction and of the abject dependence of a man who considers himself as insulted robbed and ruined in that state of dependence  in addition to the evidence contained in this letter your lordships will be pleased to recollect the nabobs letter which we read to your lordships yesterday the humble and abject style of which you will never forget oh consider my lords this instance of the fate of human greatness you must remember that there is not a trace anywhere in any of the various trunks of mr hastings that he ever condescended so much as to give an answer to the suppliant letters of that unhappy man there was no mode of indignity with which he did not treat his family there was no mode of indignity with which he did not treat his person there was no mode of indignity with which he did not treat his minister hyder beg khânthis man whom he represents to be the most infamous and scandalous of mankind and of whom he nevertheless at the same time declares that his only support with the vizier was the support which he warren hastings as representative of the english government gave him  we will now read a paper which perhaps ought not to have been received in evidence but which we were willing to enter in your minutes as evidence in order that everything should come before you your lordships have heard the nabob speak of his misery distress and oppression but here he makes a complete defeasance as it were of the whole charge a direct disavowal of every one of the complaints and particularly that of having never received an answer to these complaints oh think i say my lords of the degraded miserable and unhappy state to which human nature may be reduced when you hear this unhappy man declare that all the charges which we have made upon this subject relative to him and which are all either admitted by him or taken from his own representation are now stated by him in a paper before you to be all false and that there is not a word of the representation which he had made of mr hastings that has the least truth in it your lordships will find this in that collection of various papers which ought to be preserved and put into every museum in europe as one of the most extraordinary productions that was ever exhibited to the world        papers received the 8th of march 1788 and translated pursuant to      an order of the governorgeneral in council dated the 21th of      april 1788 under the seal of his excellency the nabob asoph ul      dowlah asoph jah bahadur vizier ul momalik       i have at this time learnt that the gentlemen in power in england      upon the suspicion that mr hastings during his administration      acted contrary to the rules of justice and impartiality and      actuated by motives of avidity was inimical towards men without      cause that he broke such engagements and treaties as had been made      between the company and other chiefs that he extended the hand of      oppression over the properties of men tore up the roots of      security and prosperity from the land and rendered the ryots and      subjects destitute by force and extortionas this accusation in      fact is destitute of uprightness and void of truth therefore      with a view to show the truth in its true colors i have written      upon this sheet with truth and sincerity to serve as an evidence      and to represent real factsto serve also as information and      communication that mr hastings from the commencement of his      administration until his departure for england whether during the      lifetime of the deceased nabob of blessed memory vizier ul moolk      sujah ul dowlah bahadur my father or during my government did      not at any time transact contrary to justice any matter which took      place from the great friendship between me and the company nor in      any business depart from the path of truth and uprightness but      cultivated friendship with integrity and sincerity and in every      respect engaged himself in the duties of friendship with me my      ministers and confidants i am at all times and in every way      pleased with and thankful for his friendly manners and qualities      and my ministers and confidants who have always every one of      them been satisfied with his conduct are forever grateful for his      friendship and thankful for his virtues as these matters are real      facts and according to truth i have written these lines as an      evidence and transmit this paper to england through the      government of calcutta for the information of the gentlemen of      power and rank in england  observe my lords the candor of the commons we produce this evidence which accuses us as mr hastings does of uttering everything that is false we choose to bring our shame before the world and to admit that this man on whose behalf and on the behalf of whose country we have accused mr hastings has declared that this accusation namely this impeachment is destitute of uprightness and without truth but my lords this is not only a direct contradiction to all he has ever said to all that has been proved to you by us but a direct contradiction to all the representations of mr hastings himself your lordships will hence see what credit is to be given to these papers  your lordships shall now hear what hyder beg khân says that hyder beg khân who stands recorded in your minutes as the worst of mankind who is represented as writing letters without the nabobs consent and in defiance of him the man of whom mr hastings says that the nabob is nothing but a tool in his hands and that the nabob is and ever must be a tool of somebody or other now as we have heard the tool speak let us hear how the workman employed to work with this tool speaks        extract from hyder beg khâns letter to the governor and council       it is at this time learnt by the nabob vizier and us his      ministers that the gentlemen of power in england are displeased      with mr hastings on the suspicion that during his administration      in this country from motives of avidity he committed oppressions      contrary to the rules of justice took the properties of men by      deceit and force injured the ryots and subjects and rendered the      country destitute and ruined as the true and upright disposition      of mr hastings is in every respect free of this suspicion we      therefore with truth and sincerity declare by these lines written      according to fact that mr hastings from the first of his      appointment to the government of this country until his departure      for europe during his authority in the management of the affairs      of the country whether in the lifetime of the nabob sujah ul      dowlah bahadur deceased or whether during the present reign did      not in any matters which took place from the great friendship      between this government and the company act in any wise upon      motives of avidity and not having in any respect other than      justice and propriety in intention did not swerve from their      rules he kept his excellency the vizier always pleased and      satisfied you will remember my lords the last expressions of      his pleasure and satisfaction by his friendship and attention in      every matter he at all times showed favor and kindness towards us      the ministers of this government and under his protection having      enjoyed perfect happiness and comfort we are from our hearts      satisfied with and grateful for his benevolence and goodness  here my lords you have the character which hyder beg khân gives of mr hastingsof the man who he knew had loaded him as he had done with every kind of indignity reproach and outrage with which a man can be loaded your lordships will see that this testimony repeats almost word for word the testimony of the vizier nabobwhich shows who the real writer is  my lords it is said that there is no word in the persian language to express gratitude with these signal instances of gratitude before us i think we may venture to put one into their dictionary mr hastings has said he has had the pleasure to find from the people of india that gratitude which he has not met with from his own countrymen the house of commons certainly if he has done us services we have been ungrateful indeed if he has committed enormous crimes we are just of the miserable dependent situation to which these people are reduced that they are not ashamed to come forward and deny everything they have given under their own handall these things show the portentous nature of this government they show the portentous nature of that phalanx with which the house of commons is at present at war the power of that captaingeneral of every species of indian iniquity which under him is embodied arrayed and paid from leadenhall street to the furthermost part of india  we have but one observation more to offer upon this collection of razinamas upon these miserable testimonials given by these wretched people in contradiction to all their own previous representationsdirectly in contradiction to those of mr hastings himselfdirectly in contradiction to those of lord cornwallisdirectly in contradiction to truth itself it is this here is mr hastings with his agents canvassing the country with all that minuteness with which a county is canvassed at an election and yet in this whole book of razinamas not one fact adduced by us is attempted to be disproved not one fact upon which mr hastingss defence can be founded is attempted to be proved there is nothing but bare vile panegyrics directly belied by the state of facts directly belied by the persons themselves directly belied by mr hastings at your bar and by all the whole course of the correspondence of the country  we here leave to your lordships judgment the consideration of the elevated rank of the persons aggrieved and degraded to the lowest state of dependence and actual distressthe consideration of the condition of the country gentlemen who were obliged to hide their heads wherever they could from the plunderers and robbers established under his authority in every part of the country and that of the miserable common people who have been obliged to sell their children through want of food to feed themthe consideration i say of the manner in which this country in the highest in the middle and in the lowest classes of its inhabitants nay in physical works of god was desolated and destroyed by this man  having now done with the province of oude we will proceed to the province of bengal and consider what was the kind of government which he exercised there and in what manner it affected the people that were subjected to it                                       bengal like every part of india subject to the british empire contains as i have already had occasion to mention three distinct classes of people forming three distinct social systems the first is the mahometans which about seven hundred years ago obtained a footing in that country and ever since has in a great degree retained its authority there for the mahometans had settled there long before the foundation of the bengal empire which was overturned by tamerlane so that this people who are represented sometimes loosely as strangers are people of ancient and considerable settlement in that country and though like mahometan settlers in many other countries they have fallen into decay yet being continually recruited from various parts of tartary under the mogul empire and from various parts of persia they continue to be the leading and most powerful people throughout the peninsula and so we found them there these people for the most part follow no trades or occupation their religion and laws forbidding them in the strictest manner to take usury or profit arising from money that is in any way lent they have therefore no other means for their support but what arises from their adherence to and connection with the mogul government and its viceroys they enjoy under them various offices civil and militaryvarious employments in the courts of law and stations in the army accordingly a prodigious number of people almost all of them persons of the most ancient and respectable families in the country are dependent upon and cling to the subahdars or viceroys of the several provinces they therefore who oppress plunder and destroy the subahdars oppress rob and destroy an immense mass of people it is true that a supervening government established upon another always reduces a certain portion of the dependants upon the latter to want you must distress by the very nature of the circumstances of the case a great number of people but then it is your business when by the superiority which you have acquired however you may have acquired it for i am not now considering whether you have acquired it by fraud or force or whether by a mixture of both when i say you have acquired it it is your business not to oppress those people with new and additional difficulties but rather to console them in the state to which they are reduced and to give them all the assistance and protection in your power  the next system is composed of the descendants of the people who were found in the country by the mahometan invaders the system before mentioned comprehends the official interest the judicial interest the court interest and the military interest this latter body includes almost the whole landed interest commercial interest and moneyed interest of the country for the hindoos not being forbidden by their laws or religious tenets as laid down in the shaster many of them became the principal moneylenders and bankers and thus the hindoos form the greatest part both of the landed and moneyed interest in that country  the third and last system is formed of the english interest which in reality whether it appears directly or indirectly is the governing interest of the whole countryof its civil and military interest of its landed moneyed and revenue interest and what to us is the greatest concern of all it is this system which is responsible for the government of that country to the government of great britain it is divided into two parts one emanating from the company and afterwards regulated by act of parliament the other a judicial body sent out by and acting under the authority of the crown itself the persons composing that interest are those whom we usually call the servants of the company they enter into that service as your lordships know at an early period of life and they are promoted accordingly as their merit or their interest may provide for them this body of men with respect to its number is so small as scarcely to deserve mentioning but from certain circumstances the government of the whole country is fallen into their hands amongst these circumstances the most important and essential are their having the public revenues and the public purse entirely in their own hands and their having an army maintained by that purse and disciplined in the european manner  such was the state of that country when mr hastings was appointed governor in 1772 your lordships are now to decide upon the manner in which he has comported himself with regard to all these three interests first whether he has made the ancient mahometan families as easy as he could secondly whether he has made the hindoo inhabitants the zemindars and their tenants as secure in their property and as easy in their tenure as he could and lastly whether he has made the english interest a blessing to the country and whilst it provided moderate safe and proper emoluments to the persons that were concerned in it it kept them from oppression and rapine and a general waste and ravage of the country whether in short he made all these three interests pursue that one object which all interests and all governments ought to pursue the advantage and welfare of the people under them  my lords in support of our charge against the prisoner at your bar that he acted in a manner directly the reverse of this we have proved to you that his first acts of oppression were directed against the mahometan governmentthat government which had been before not only in name but in effect to the very time of his appointment the real government of the country after the company had acquired its right over it some shadow still remained of the ancient government an allowance was settled for the nabob of bengal to support the dignity of his court which amounted to between four and five hundred thousand pounds a year in this was comprehended the support of the whole mass of nobilitythe soldiers serving or retiredall the officers of the court and all the women that were dependent upon themthe whole of the criminal jurisdiction of the country and a very considerable part of the civil law and the civil government these establishments formed the constitutional basis of their political government  the company never had and it is a thing that we can never too often repeat to your lordshipsthe company never had of right despotic power in that country to overturn any of these establishments the mogul who gave them their charters could not give them such a powerhe did not de facto give them such a power the government of this country did not by act of parliament and the company did not and could not by their delegation give him such a power the act by which he was appointed governor did not give him such a power if he exercised it he usurped it and therefore every step we take in the examination of his conduct in bengal as in every step we take upon the same subject everywhere else we look for the justification of his conduct to lawsthe law of nations the laws of this country and the laws of the country he was sent to govern  the government of that country by the ancient constitution of the mogul empire besides the numberless individual checks and counterchecks in the inferior officers offices is divided into the viceroyal part and the subahdarry part the viceroyal part takes in all criminal justice and political government mr hastings found the country under a viceroy governing according to law acting by proper judges and magistrates under him he himself not being the judicial but executive power of the countrythat which sets the other in action and does not supersede it or supply its place the other the subahdarry power which was by the grant of the dewanny conferred upon the company had under its care the revenues as much of the civil government as is concerned with the revenues and many other matters growing out of it these two offices are coördinate and dependent on each other the company after contracting to maintain the army out of it got the whole revenue into their power the army being thus within their power the subahdar by degrees vanished into an empty name  when we thus undertook the government of the country conscious that we had undertaken a task which by any personal exertion of our own we were unable to perform in any proper or rational way the company appointed a native of the country mahomed reza khân who stands upon the records of the company i venture to say with such a character as no man perhaps ever did stand to execute the duties of both offices upon the expulsion of cossim ali khân the nabob of bengal all his children were left in a young feeble and unprotected state and in that state of things lord clive mr sumner who sits near mr hastings and the rest of the council wisely appointed mahomed reza khân to fulfil the two offices of deputyviceroy and deputydewan for which he had immense allowances and great jaghires and revenues i allow he was a man of that dignity rank and consideration added to his knowledge of law and experience in business that lord clive and mr sumner who examined strictly his conduct at that time did not think that 112000l a year the amount of the emoluments which had been allowed him was a great deal too much but at his own desire and in order that these emoluments might be brought to stated and fixed sums they reduced it to 90000lan allowance which they thought was not more than sufficient to preserve the state of so great a magistrate and a man of such rank exercising such great employments the whole revenue of the company depended upon his talents and fidelity and you will find that on the day in which he surrendered the revenues into our hands the dewanny under his management was a million more than it produced on the day mr hastings left it for the truth of this i refer your lordships to a letter of the company sent to the board of control this letter is not in evidence before your lordships and what i am stating is merely historical but i state the facts and with the power of referring for their proof to documents as authentic as if they were absolutely in evidence before you assuming therefore that all these facts may be verified by the records of the company i have now to state that this man by some rumors true or false was supposed to have misconducted himself in a time of great calamity in that country a great famine had about this time grievously afflicted the whole province of bengali must remark by the way that these countries are liable to this calamity but it is greatly blessed by nature with resources which afford the means of speedy recovery if their government does not counteract them nature that inflicts the calamity soon heals the wound it is in ordinary seasons the most fertile country inhabited by the most industrious people and the most disposed to marriage and settlement probably that exists in the whole world so that population and fertility are soon restored and the inhabitants quickly resume their former industrious occupations  during the agitation excited in the country by the calamity i have just mentioned mahomed reza khân through the intrigues of rajah nundcomar one of his political rivals and of some english faction that supported him was accused of being one of the causes of the famine in answer to this charge he alleged what was certainly a sufficient justification that he had acted under the direction of the english board to which his conduct throughout this business was fully known the company however sent an order from england to have him tried but though he frequently supplicated the government at calcutta that his trial should be proceeded in in order that he might be either acquitted and discharged or condemned mr hastings kept him in prison two years under pretence as he wrote word to the directors that mahomed reza khân himself was not very desirous to hasten the matter in the mean time the court of directors having removed him from his great offices authorized and commanded mr hastings and here we come within the sphere of your minutes to appoint a successor to mahomed reza khân fit to fulfil the duties of his station now i shall first show your lordships what sort of person the court of directors described to him as most fit to fill the office of mahomed reza khân what sort of person he did appoint and then we will trace out to you the consequences of that appointment        letter from the court of directors to the president and council at      fort william dated 28th august 1771       though we have not a doubt but that by the exertion of your      abilities and the care and assiduity of our servants in the      superintendency of the revenues the collections will be conducted      with more advantage to the company and ease to the natives than by      means of a naib dewan we are fully sensible of the expediency of      supporting some ostensible minister in the companys interest at      the nabobs court to transact the political affairs of the sircar      and interpose between the company and the subjects of any european      power in all cases wherein they may thwart our interest or      encroach on our authority and as mahomed reza khân can no longer      be considered by us as one to whom such a power can be safely      committed we trust to your local knowledge the selection of some      person well qualified for the affairs of government and of whose      attachment to the company you shall be well assured such person      you will recommend to the nabob to succeed mahomed reza as minister      of the government and guardian of the nabobs minority and we      persuade ourselves that the nabob will pay such regard to your      recommendation as to invest him with the necessary power and      authority       as the advantages which the company may receive from the      appointment of such minister will depend on his readiness to      promote our views and advance our interest we are willing to allow      him so liberal a gratification as may excite his zeal and secure      his attachment to the company we therefore empower you to grant to      the person whom you shall think worthy of this trust an annual      allowance not exceeding three lacs of rupees thirty thousand      pounds which we consider not only as a munificent reward for any      services he shall render the company but sufficient to enable him      to support his station with suitable rank and dignity and here we      must add that in the choice you shall make of a person to be the      active minister of the nabobs government we hope and trust that      you will show yourselves worthy of the confidence we have placed in      you by being actuated therein by no other motives than those of      the public good and the safety and interest of the company  here my lords a person was to be named fit to fill the office and supply the place of mahomed reza khân who was deputyviceroy of bengal at the head of the criminal justice of the country and in short at the head of the whole ostensible mahometan government he was also to supply the place of mahomed reza khân as naib dewan from which reza khân was to be removed for you will observe the directors always speak of a man fit to perform all the duties of mahomed reza khân and amongst these he was to be as the guardian of the nabobs person and the representative of his authority and government  mr hastings having received these orders from the court of directors didwhat he alleges in his defence that no positive commands were given him but a very sufficient description was given of the person who ought to succeed mahomed reza khân in whom the company had before recognized all the necessary qualities and they therefore desire him to name a similar person but what does mr hastings do in consequence of this authority he names no man at all he searches into the seraglio of the nabob and names a woman to be the viceroy of the province to be the head of the ostensible government to be the guardian of the nabobs person the conservator of his authority and a proper representative of the remaining majesty of that government  well my lords he searched the seraglio when you have to take into consideration the guardianship of a person of great dignity there are two circumstances to be attended to one a faithful and affectionate guardianship of his person and the other a strong interest in his authority and the means of exercising that authority in a proper and competent manner mr hastings when he was looking for a woman in the seraglio for he could find women only there must have found actually in authority there the nabobs own mother certainly a person who by nature was most fit to be his guardian and there is no manner of doubt of her being sufficiently competent to that duty here then was a legitimate wife of the nabob jaffier ali khân a woman of rank and distinction fittest to take care of the person and interests as far as a woman could take care of them of her own son in this situation she had been placed before during the administration of mahomed reza khân by the direct orders of the governor sir john cartier she had i say been put in possession of that trust which it was natural and proper to give to such a woman but what does mr hastings do he deposes this woman he strips her of her authority with which he found her invested under the sanction of the english government he finds out a woman in the seraglio called munny begum who was bound to the nabob by no tie whatever of natural affection he makes this woman the guardian of the young nabobs person she had a son who had been placed upon the musnud after the death of his father sujah dowlah and had been appointed his guardian this young nabob died soon afterwards and was succeeded by nujim ul dowlah another natural son of sujah dowlah this prince being left without a mother this woman was suffered to retain the guardianship of the nabob till his death when mobarek ul dowlah a legitimate son of sujah dowlah succeeded him sir john cartier did what his duty was he put the nabobs own mother into the place which she was naturally entitled to hold the guardianship of her own son and displaced munny begum the whole of the arrangement by which munny begum was appointed guardian of the two preceding nabobs stands in the companys records stigmatized as a transaction base wicked and corrupt we will read to your lordships an extract from a letter which has the signature of mr sumner the gentleman who sits here by the side of mr hastings and from which you will learn what the company and the council thought of the original nomination of munny begum and of her son you will find that they considered her as a great agent and instrument of all the corruption there and that this whole transaction by which the bastard son of munny begum was brought forward to the prejudice of the legitimate son of the nabob was considered to be what it upon the very face of it speaks itself to be corrupt and scandalous        extract of a general letter from the president and council at      calcutta bengal to the select committee of the directors       paragraph 5at fort st george we received the first advices of      the demise of mir jaffier and of sujah dowlahs defeat it was      there firmly imagined that no definitive measures would be taken      either with respect to a peace or filling the vacancy in the      nizamut before our arrivalas the lapwing arrived in the month      of january with your general letter and the appointment of a      committee with express powers to that purpose for the successful      exertion of which the happiest occasion now offered however a      contrary resolution prevailed in the council the opportunity of      acquiring immense fortunes was too inviting to be neglected and      the temptation too powerful to be resisted a treaty was hastily      drawn up by the boardor rather transcribed with few      unimportant additions from that concluded with mir jaffierand a      deputation consisting of messrs johnstone senior middleton and      leycester appointed to raise the natural son of the deceased nabob      to the subahdarry in prejudice of the claim of the grandson and      for this measure such reasons assigned as ought to have dictated a      diametrically opposite resolution meerans son was a minor which      circumstance alone would have naturally brought the whole      administration into our hands at a juncture when it became      indispensably necessary we should realize the shadow of power and      influence which having no solid foundation was exposed to the      danger of being annihilated by the first stroke of adverse fortune      but this inconsistence was not regarded nor was it material to the      views for precipitating the treaty which was pressed on the young      nabob at the first interview in so earnest and indelicate a manner      as highly disgusted him and chagrined his ministers while not a      single rupee was stipulated for the company whose interests were      sacrificed that their servants might revel in the spoils of a      treasury before impoverished but now totally exhausted       6 this scene of corruption was first disclosed at a visit the      nabob paid to lord clive and the gentlemen of the committee a few      days after our arrival he there delivered to his lordship a letter      filled with bitter complaints of the insults and indignity he had      been exposed to and the embezzlement of near twenty lacs of rupees      issued from his treasury for purposes unknown during the late      negotiations so public a complaint could not be disregarded and      it soon produced an inquiry we referred the letter to the board in      expectation of obtaining a satisfactory account of the application      of this money and were answered only by a warm remonstrance      entered by mr leycester against that very nabob in whose elevation      he boasts of having been a principal agent       7 mahomed reza khân the naib subah was then called upon to      account for this large disbursement from the treasury and he soon      delivered to the committee the very extraordinary narrative entered      in our proceedings the 6th of june wherein he specifies the      several names and sums by whom paid and to whom whether in cash      bills or obligations so precise so accurate an account as this      of money for secret and venal services was never we believe      before this period exhibited to the honorable court of directors      at least never vouched by undeniable testimony and authentic      documents by juggut seet who himself was obliged to contribute      largely to the sums demanded by muley ram who was employed by mr      johnstone in all these pecuniary transactions by the nabob and      mahomed reza khân who were the heaviest sufferers and lastly by      the confession of the gentlemen themselves whose names are      specified in the distribution list       8 juggut seet expressly declared in his narrative that the sum      which he agreed to pay the deputation amounting to 125000 rupees      was extorted by menaces and since the close of our inquiry and      the opinions we delivered in the proceedings of the 21st of june      it fully appears that the presents from the nabob and mahomed reza      khân exceeding the immense sum of seventeen lacs were not the      voluntary offerings of gratitude but contributions levied on the      weakness of the government and violently exacted from the      dependent state and timid disposition of the minister the charge      indeed is denied on the one hand as well as affirmed on the      other your honorable board must therefore determine how far the      circumstance of extortion may aggravate the crime of disobedience      to your positive ordersthe exposing the government in a manner      to sale and receiving the infamous wages of corruption from      opposite parties and contending interests we speak with boldness      because we speak from conviction founded upon indubitable evidence      that besides the above sums specified in the distribution account      to the amount of 228125l sterling there was likewise to the      value of several lacs of rupees procured from nundcomar and roy      dullub each of whom aspired at and obtained a promise of that very      employment it was predetermined to bestow on mahomed reza khân          signed at the end         clive         wm b sumner         john carnac         h verelst         fras sykes  my lords the persons who sign this letter are mostly the friends and one of them is the gentleman who is bail for and sits near mr hastings they state to you this horrible and venal transaction by which the government was set to sale by which a bastard son was elevated to the wrong of the natural and legitimate heir and in which a prostitute his mother was put in the place of the honorable and legitimate mother of the representative of the family  now if there was one thing more than another under heaven which mr hastings ought to have shunned it was the suspicion of being concerned in any such infamous transaction as that which is here recorded to be soa transaction in which the country government had before been sold to this very woman and her offspring and in which two great candidates for power in that country fought against each other and perhaps the largest offerer carried it  when a governorgeneral sees the traces of corruption in the conduct of his predecessors the traces of injustice following that corruption the traces of notorious irregularity in setting aside the just claimants in favor of those that have no claim at all he has that before his eyes which ought to have made him the more scrupulously avoid and to keep at the farthest distance possible from the contagion and even the suspicion of being corrupted by it moreover my lords it was in consequence of these very transactions that the new covenants were made which bind the servants of the company never to take a present of above two hundred pounds or some such sum of money from any native in circumstances there described this covenant i shall reserve for consideration in another part of this business it was in pursuance of this idea and to prevent the abuse of the prevailing custom of visiting the governing powers of that country with a view of receiving presents from them that the house of commons afterwards in its inquiries took up this matter and passed the regulating act in 1773  but to return to munny begumthis very person that had got into power by the means already mentioned did mr hastings resort to knowing her to be well skilled in the trade of briberyknowing her skilful practice in business of this sortknowing the fitness of her eunuchs instruments and agents to be dealers in this kind of traffic this very woman did mr hastings select stigmatized as she was in the companys record stigmatized by the very gentleman who sits next to him and whose name you have heard read to you as one of those members of the council that reprobated the horrible iniquity of the transaction in which this woman was a principal agent for though neither the young nabob nor his mother ought to have been raised to the stations in which they were placed and were placed there for the purpose of facilitating the receipt of bribes yet the order of nature was preserved and the mother was made the guardian of her own son for though she was a prostitute and he a bastard yet still she was a mother and he a son and both nature and legitimate disposition with regard to the guardianship of a son went together  but what did mr hastings do improving upon the preceding transaction improving on it by a kind of refinement in corruption he drives away the lawful mother from her lawful guardianship the mother of nature he turns out and he delivers her son to the stepmother to be the guardian of his person that your lordships may see who this woman was we shall read to you a paper from your lordships minutes produced before mr hastingss face and never contradicted by him from that day to this       at a consultation 24th july 1775shah chanim deceased was      sister to the nabob mahub ul jung by the same father but different      mothers she married mir mahomed jaffier khân by whom she had a      son and a daughter the name of the former was mir mahomed sadduc      ali khân and the latter was married to mir mahomed cossim khân      sadduc ali khân had two sons and two daughters the sons names      are mir sydoc and mir sobeem who are now living the daughters      were married to sultan mirza daood       baboo begum the mother of the nabob mobarek ul dowlah was the      daughter of summin ali khân and married mir mahomed jaffier khân      the history of munny begum is this at a village called balkonda      near sekundra there lived a widow who from her great poverty      not being able to bring up her daughter munny gave her to a slave      girl belonging to summin ali khân whose name was bissoo during      the space of five years she lived at shahjehanabad and was      educated by bissoo after the manner of a dancinggirl afterwards      the nabob shamut jung upon the marriage of ikram ul dowlah      brother to the nabob surajah ul dowlah sent for bissoo begs set      of dancinggirls from shahjehanabad of which munny begum was one      and allowed them ten thousand rupees for their expenses to dance      at the wedding while this ceremony was celebrating they were kept      by the nabob but some months afterwards he dismissed them and      they took up their residence in this city mir mahomed jaffier khân      then took them into keeping and allowed munny and her set five      hundred rupees per month till at length finding that munny was      pregnant he took her into his own house she gave birth to the      nabob nujim ul dowlah and in this manner she has remained in the      nabobs family ever since  my lords i do not mean to detain you long upon this part of the business but i have thought it necessary to advert to these particulars as to all the rest the honorable and able manager who preceded me has sufficiently impressed upon your lordships minds the monstrous nature of the deposing of the nabobs mother from the guardianship of her son for the purpose of placing this woman there at the head of all his family and of his domestic concerns in the seraglio within doors and at the head of the state without together with the disposal of the whole of the revenue that was allowed him mr hastings pretends indeed to have appointed at the same time a trusty mutsuddy to keep the accounts of the revenue but he has since declared that no account had been kept and that it was in vain to desire it or to call for it this is the state of the case with respect to the appointment of munny begum  with regard to the reappointment of mahomed reza khân you have heard from my worthy fellow manager that he was acquitted of the charges that had been brought against him by mr hastings after a long and lingering trial the company was perfectly satisfied with the acquittal and declared that he was not only acquitted but honorably acquitted and they also declared that he had a fair claim to a compensation for his sufferings they not only declared him innocent but meritorious they gave orders that he should be considered as a person who was to be placed in office again upon the first occasion and that he had entitled himself to this favor by his conduct in the place which he had before filled  the council of the year 1775 whom i can never mention nor shall mention without honor who complied faithfully with the act of parliament who never disobeyed the orders of the company and to whom no man has imputed even the shadow of corruption found that this munny begum had acted in the manner which my honorable fellow manager has stated that she had dissipated the revenue that she had neglected the education of the nabob and had thrown the whole judicature of the country into confusion they ordered that she should be removed from her situation that the nabobs own mother should be placed at the head of the seraglio a situation to which she was entitled and with regard to the rest of the offices that mahomed reza khân should be employed to fill them  mr hastings resisted these propositions with all his might but they were by that happy momentary majority carried against him and mahomed reza khân was placed in his former situation but mr hastings though thus defeated was only waiting for what he considered to be the fortunate moment for returning again to his corrupt vicious tyrannical and disobedient habits the reappointment of mahomed reza khân had met with the fullest approbation of the company and they directed that as long as his good behavior entitled him to it he should continue in the office mr hastings however without alleging any ill behavior and for no reason that can be assigned but his corrupt engagement with munny begum overturned upon the pretence of restoring the nabob to his rights the whole of the companys arrangement as settled by the late majority and approved by the court of directors  i have now to show you what sort of a man the nabob was who was thus set up in defiance of the companys authority what mr hastings himself thought of him what the judges thought of him and what all the world thought of him  i must first make your lordships acquainted with a little preliminary matter a man named roy rada churn had been appointed vakeel or agent to manage the nabobs affairs at calcutta one of this mans creditors attached him there roy rada churn pleaded his privilege as the vakeel or representative of a sovereign prince the question came to be tried in the supreme court and the issue was whether the nabob was a sovereign prince or not i think the court did exceedingly wrong in entertaining such a question because in my opinion whether he was or was not a sovereign prince any person representing him ought to be left free and to have a proper and secure means of concerting his affairs with the council it was however taken otherwise the question was brought to trial whether the nabob was a sovereign prince sufficient to appoint and protect a person to manage his affairs under the name of an ambassador in that cause did mr hastings come forward to prove by a voluntary affidavit that he had no pretensions no power no authority at allthat he was a mere pageant a thing of strawand that the company exercised every species of authority over him in every particular and in every respect and that therefore to talk of him as an efficient person was an affront to the common sense of mankind and this you will find the judges afterwards declared to be their opinion  i will here press again one remark which perhaps you may recollect that i have made before that the chief and most usual mode in which all the villanies perpetrated in india by mr hastings and his copartners in iniquity has been through the medium and instrumentality of persons whom they pretended to have rights of their own and to be acting for themselves whereas such persons were in fact totally dependent upon him mr hastings and did no one act that was not prescribed by him in order therefore to let you see the utter falsehood fraud prevarication and deceit of the pretences by which the native powers of india are represented to be independent and are held up as the instruments of defying the laws of this kingdom under pretext of their being absolute princes i will read the affidavit of warren hastings esquire governorgeneral of bengal made the 31st july 1775       this deponent maketh oath and saith that the late president and      council did in or about the month of august 1772 by their own      authority appoint munny begum relict of the late nabob mir      jaffier ali khân to be guardian to the present nabob mobarek ul      dowlah and rajah gourdas son of maha rajah nundcomar to be dewan      of the said nabobs household allowing to the said munny begum a      salary of 140000 rupees per annum and to the said rajah gourdas      for himself and officers a salary of 100000 rupees per annum      that the said late president and council did in or about the month      of august 1772 plan and constitute regular and distinct courts of      justice civil and criminal by their own authority for      administration of justice to the inhabitants throughout bengal      without consulting the said nabob or requiring his concurrence and      that the said civil courts were made solely dependent on the      presidency of calcutta and the said criminal courts were put under      the inspection and control of the companys servants although      ostensibly under the name of the nazim as appears from the      following extracts from the plan for the administration of justice      constituted by the president and council as aforesaid  my lords we need not go through all the circumstances of this affidavit which is in your minutes and to save time i will refer your lordships to them this affidavit as i have already said was put into the court to prove that the nabob had no power or authority at all but what is very singular in it and which i recommend to the particular notice of your lordships when you are scrutinizing this matter is that there is not a single point stated to prove the nullity of this nabobs authority that was not mr hastingss on particular act well the governorgeneral swears the judge of the court refers to him in his decision he builds and bottoms it upon the governorgenerals affidavithe swears i say that the council by their own authority appointed munny begum to be guardian to the nabob  by what authority the governorgeneral asks did the council erect courts of law and superintend the administration of justice without any communication with the nabob had the nabob himself any idea that he was a sovereign does he complain of the reduction of his stipend or the infringement of treaties no he appears to consider himself to be what in fact he really is absolutely dependent on the company and to be willing to accept any pittance they would allow him for his maintenance he claims no rights does he complain that the administration of justice is taken into the hands of the company no by the treaty the protection of his subjects is delivered up to the company and he well knew that whoever may be held up as the ostensible prince the administration of justice must be in the hands of those who have power to enforce it he goes onthe governorgeneral who i suppose had a delicacy to state more than what had before been made public closes his affidavit with saying that all he has deposed to he believes to be publicly known as it is particularly set forth in the printed book entitled reports of the committee of the house of commons i knew he adds it was there and was therefore surprised at this application it is so notorious that everybody in the settlement must have known it when i say everybody i mean with an exception to the gentlemen who have applied to the court the only reason i can give for their applying is the little time they have been in the country the judge i think it is chiefjustice impey then goes onperhaps this question might have been determined merely on the dates of the letters to the governorgeneral but as the council have made the other a serious question i should not have thought that i had done my duty if i had not given a full and determinate opinion upon it i should have been sorry if i had left it doubtful whether the empty name of a nabob should be thrust between a delinquent and the laws so as effectually to protect him from the hand of justice  my lords the court as you see bottoms its determination on what we stand upon here mr hastingss evidence that the empty name of a pretended sovereign should not be thrust forth between a delinquent and justice  what does mr le maistre the other judge say upon this occasion with regard to this phantom that man of straw mobarek ul dowlah it is an insult on the understanding of the court to have made the question of his sovereignty but as it came from the governorgeneral and council i have too much respect for that body to treat it ludicrously and i confess i cannot consider it seriously and we always shall consider a letter of business from the nabob the same as a letter from the governorgeneral and council  this is the unanimous opinion of all the judges concerning the state and condition of the nabob we have thus established the point we mean to establish that any use which shall be made of the nabobs name for the purpose of justifying any disobedience to the orders of the company or of bringing forward corrupt and unfit persons for the government could be considered as no other than the act of the persons who shall make such a use of it and that no letter that the nabob writes to any one in power was or could be considered as any other than the letter of that person himself this we wish to impress upon your lordships because as you have before seen the use that has been made in this way of the nabob of oude you may judge of the use that has been made of the name of hyder beg khân and of the names of all the eminent persons of the country  one word more and i have done if whilst you remark the use that is made of this mans name your lordships shall find that this use has ever been made of his name for his benefit or for the purpose of giving him any useful or substantial authority or of meliorating his condition in any way whatever forgive the fraud forgive the disobedience but if we have shown your lordships that it was for no other purpose than to disobey the orders of the company to trample upon the laws of his country to introduce back again and to force into power those very corrupt and wicked instruments which had formerly done so much mischief and for which mischief they were removed then we shall not have passed our time in vain in endeavoring to prove that this man in the opinion of a court of justice and by public notoriety and by mr hastingss own opinion was held to be fit for nothing but to be made a tool in his hands                                       having stated to your lordships generally the effects produced upon the mahometan interest of bengal by the misconduct of the prisoner at your bar with respect to the appointment of the guardian of the nabob or subahdar of that province and of the ministers of his government i shall have the honor of attending your lordships another day and shall show you the use that has been made of this government and of the authority of the nabob who as your lordships have seen was the mere phantom of power and i shall show how much a phantom he was for every good purpose and how effectual an instrument he was made for every bad one     speech  in  general reply  eighth day saturday june 14 1794   my lordsyour lordships heard upon the last day of the meeting of this high court the distribution of the several matters which i should have occasion to lay before you and by which i resolved to guide myself in the examination of the conduct of mr hastings with regard to bengal i stated that i should first show the manner in which he comported himself with regard to the people who were found in possession of the government when we first entered into bengal we have shown to your lordships the progressive steps by which the native government was brought into a state of annihilation we have stated the manner in which that government was solemnly declared by a court of justice to be depraved and incompetent to act and dead in law we have shown to your lordships and we have referred you to the document that its death was declared upon a certificate of the principal attending physician of the state namely mr warren hastings himself this was declared in an affidavit made by him wherein he has gone through all the powers of government of which he had regularly despoiled the nabob mobarek ul dowlah part by part exactly according to the ancient formula by which a degraded knight was despoiled of his knighthood they took i say from him all the powers of government article by articlehis helmet his shield his cuirass at last they hacked off his spurs and left him nothing mr hastings laid down all the premises and left the judges to draw the conclusion  your lordships will remark for you will find it on your minutes that the judges have declared this affidavit of mr hastings to be a delicate affidavit we have heard of affidavits that were true we have heard of affidavits that were perjured but this is the first instance that has come to our knowledge and we receive it as a proof of indian refinement of a delicate affidavit this affidavit of mr hastings we shall show to your lordships is not entitled to the description of a good affidavit however it might be entitled in the opinion of those judges to the description of a delicate affidavita phrase by which they appear to have meant that he had furnished all the proofs of the nabobs deposition but had delicately avoided to declare him expressly deposed the judges drew however this indelicate conclusion the conclusion they drew was founded upon the premises it was very just and logical for they declared that he was a mere cipher they commended mr hastingss delicacy though they did not imitate it but they pronounced sentence of deposition upon the said nabob and they declared that any letter or paper that was produced from him could not be considered as an act of government so effectually was he removed by the judges out of the way that no minority no insanity no physical circumstances not even death itself could put a man more completely out of sight they declare that they would consider his letters in no other light than as the letters of the company represented by the governorgeneral and council thus then we find the nabob legally dead  we find next that he was politically dead mr hastings not satisfied with the affidavit he made in court has thought proper upon record to inform the company and the world of what he considered him to be civilly and politically        minute entered by the governorgeneral       the governorgenerali object to this motion a motion      relative to the trial above alluded to because i do not      apprehend that the declaration of the judges respecting the nabobs      sovereignty will involve this government in any difficulties with      the french or other foreign nations mark my lords these      political effects how little the screen of the nabobs name has      hitherto availed will appear in the frequent and inconclusive      correspondence which has been maintained with the foreign      settlements the french especially since the company have thought      proper to stand forth in their real character in the exercise of      the dewanny from that period the government of these provinces has      been wholly theirs nor can all the subtleties and distinctions of      political sophistry conceal the possession of power where the      exercise of it is openly practised and universally felt in its      operation in deference to the commands of the company we have      generally endeavored in all our correspondence with foreigners to      evade the direct avowal of our possessing the actual rule of the      countryemploying the unapplied term government for the power to      which we exacted their submission but i do not remember any      instance and i hope none will be found of our having been so      disingenuous as to disclaim our own power or to affirm that the      nabob was the real sovereign of these provinces in effect i do      not hesitate to say that i look upon this state of indecision to      have been productive of all the embarrassments which we have      experienced with the foreign settlements none of them have ever      owned any dominion but that of the british government in these      provinces mr chevalier has repeatedly declared that he will not      acknowledge any other but will look to that only for the support      of the privileges possessed by his nation and shall protest      against that alone as responsible for any act of power by which      their privileges may be violated or their property disturbed the      dutch the danes have severally applied to this government as to      the ruling power for the grant of indulgences and the redress of      their grievances in our replies to all we have constantly assumed      the prerogatives of that character but eluded the direct avowal of      it under the name of influence we have offered them protection      and we have granted them the indulgences of government under      elusive expressions sometimes applied to our treaties with the      nabobs sometimes to our own rights as the dewan sometimes openly      declaring the virtual rule which we held of these provinces we      have contended with them for the rights of government and      threatened to repel with force the encroachments on it we in one      or two instances have actually put these threats into execution by      orders directly issued to the officers of government and enforced      by detachments from our own military forces the nabob was never      consulted nor was the pretence ever made that his orders or      concurrence were necessary in a word we have always allowed      ourselves to be treated as principals we have treated as      principals but we have contented ourselves with letting our      actions insinuate the character which we effectually possessed      without asserting it       for my own part i have ever considered the reserve which has been      enjoined us in this respect as a consequence of the doubts which      have long prevailed and which are still suffered to subsist      respecting the rights of the british government and the company to      the property and dominion of these provinces not as inferring a      doubt with respect to any foreign power it has however been      productive of great inconveniences it has prevented our acting      with vigor in our disputes with the dutch and french the former      refuse to this day the payment of the bahor peshcush although      the right is incontestably against them and we have threatened to      enforce it both nations refuse to be bound by our decrees or to      submit to our regulations they refuse to submit to the payment of      the duties on the foreign commerce but in their own way which      amounts almost to a total exemption they refuse to submit to the      duty of ten per cent which is levied upon foreign salt by which      unless a stop can be put to it by a more decisive rule they will      draw the whole of that important trade into their own colonies and      even in the single instance in which they have allowed us to      prescribe to them namely the embargo on grain on the      apprehension of a dearth i am generally persuaded that they      acquiesced from the secret design of taking advantage of the      general suspension by exporting grain clandestinely under cover of      their colors which they knew would screen them from the rigorous      examination of our officers we are precluded from forming many      arrangements of general utility because of the want of control      over the european settlements and a great part of the defects      which subsist in the government and commercial state of the country      are ultimately derived from this source i have not the slightest      suspicion that a more open and decided conduct would expose us to      worse consequences from the european nations on the contrary we      have the worst of the argument while we contend with them under      false colors while they know us under the disguise and we have      not the confidence to disown it what we have done and may do under      an assumed character is full as likely to involve us in a war with      france a nation not much influenced by logical weapons if such      can be supposed to be the likely consequence of our own trifling      disagreements with them as if we stood forth their avowed      opponents to conclude instead of regretting with mr francis      the occasion which deprives us of so useless and hurtful a      disguise i should rather rejoice were it really the case and      consider it as a crisis which freed the constitution of our      government from one of its greatest defects  now my lords the delicacy of the affidavit is no more the great arcanum of the state is avowed it is avowed that the government is oursthat the nabob is nothing it is avowed to foreign nations and the disguise which we have put on mr hastings states in his opinion to be hurtful to the affairs of the company here we perceive the exact and the perfect agreement between his character as a delicate affidavitmaker in a court of justice and his indelicate declarations upon the records of the company for the information of the whole world concerning the real arcanum of the bengal government  now i cannot help praising his consistency upon this occasion whether his policy was right or wrong hitherto we find the whole consistent we find the affidavit perfectly supported the inferences which delicacy at first prevented him from producing better recollection and more perfect policy made him here avow in this state things continued the nabob your lordships see is deaddead in law dead in politics dead in a court of justice dead upon the records of the company except in mere animal existence it is all over with him  i have now to state to your lordships that mr hastings who has the power of putting even to death in this way possesses likewise the art of restoring to life but what is the medicine that revives them your lordships i am sure will be glad to know what nostrum not hitherto pretended to by quacks in physic by quacks in politics nor by quacks in law will serve to revive this man to cover his dead bones with flesh and to give him life activity and vigor my lords i am about to tell you an instance of a recipe of such infallible efficacy as was never before discovered his cure for all disorders is disobedience to the commands of his lawful superiors when the orders of the court of directors are contrary to his own opinions he forgets them all let the court of directors but declare in favor of his own system and his own positions and that very moment merely for the purpose of declaring his right of rebellion against the laws of his country he counteracts them then these dead bones ariseor to use a language more suitable to the dignity of the thing bayess men are all revived are these men dead asks mr bayess friend no says he they shall all get up and dance immediately but in this ludicrous view of mr hastingss conduct your lordships must not lose sight of its great importance you cannot have in an abstract as it were any one thing that better develops the principles of the man that more fully develops all the sources of his conduct and of all the frauds and iniquities which he has committed in order at one and the same time to evade his duty to the court of directors that is to say to the laws of his country and to oppress crush rob and illtreat the people that are under him  my lords you have had an account of the person who represented the nabobs dignity mahomed reza khân you have heard of the rank he bore the sufferings that he went through his trial and honorable acquittal and the companys order that the first opportunity should be taken to appoint him naib subah or deputy of the nabob and more especially to represent him in the administering of justice your lordships are also acquainted with what was done in consequence of those orders by the councilgeneral in the restoration and reëstablishment of the executive power in this personnot in the poor nabob a poor helpless illbred illeducated boy but in the first mussulman of the country who had before exercised the office of naib subah or deputy viceroyin order to give some degree of support to the expiring honor and justice of that country the majority namely general clavering colonel monson and mr francis whose names as i have before said will for obedience to the company fidelity to the laws honor to themselves and a purity untouched and unimpeached stand distinguished and honored in spite of all the corrupt and barking virulence of india against themthese men i say obeyed the company they had no secret or fraudulent connection with mahomed reza khân but they reinstated him in his office  the moment that real death had carried away two of the most virtuous of this community and that mr hastings was thereby reëstablished in his power he returned to his former state of rebellion to the company and of fraud and oppression upon the people and here we come to the revivificating medicine i forgot to tell your lordships that this nabob whose letters were declared by a court of law with his own approbation to be in effect letters of the governorgeneral and council concludes a formal application transmitted to them and dated 17th november 1777 with a demand of the restoration of his rights mr hastings upon this enters the following minute       the nabobs demands are grounded upon positive rights which will      not admit of a discussion he has an incontestable right to the      management of his own household he has an incontestable right to      the nizamut  my lords you have heard his affidavit you have heard his avowed and recorded opinion in direct defiance of both because he wishes to make doubtful the orders of the company and to evade his duty he here makes without any delicacy a declaration which if it be true the affidavit is a gross perjury let it be managed with what delicacy he pleases the word nizamut which he uses may be unfamiliar to your lordships in india it signifies the whole executive government though the word strictly means viceroyalty all the princes of that country holding their dominions as representatives of the mogul the great nominal sovereign of the empire to convince you that it does so take his own explanation of it       it is his by inheritance the adawlut and the foujdarry having      been repeatedly declared by the company and by this government to      appertain to the nizamut the adawlut namely the distribution of      civil justice and the foujdarry namely the executive criminal      justice of that country that is to say the whole sovereign      government of the courts of justice have been declared by the      company to appertain to the nizamut  i beg of your lordships to recollect when you take into your consideration the charges of the house of commons that the person they accuse and persons suborned by him have never scrupled to be guilty without sense of shame of the most notorious falsehoods the most glaring inconsistencies and even of perjury itself and that it is thus they make the power of the company dead or alive as best suits their own wicked clandestine and fraudulent purposes and the great end of all their actions and all their politics plunder and peculation  i must here refer your lordships to a minute of mr franciss which i recommend to your reading at large and to your very serious recollection in page 1086 because it contains a complete history of mr hastingss conduct and of its effects upon this occasion  and now to proceedthe nabob in a subsequent application to the companys government at calcutta desires that munny begum may be allowed to take on herself the whole administration of the affairs of the nizamut not the superiority in the administration of the affairs of the seraglio only though this would have been a tyrannical usurpation of the power belonging to the legitimate mother of the nabob without the interference of any person whatever and he adds that by this the governor will give him complete satisfaction in all fraudulent correspondence you are sure to find the true secret of it at last it has been said by somebody that the true sense of a letter is to be learnt from its postscript but this matter is so clumsily managed that in contempt of all decency the first thing the nabob does is to desire he may be put into the hands of munny begum and that without the interference of anybody whatever  the next letter immediately following on the heels of the former was received by the council on the 12th of february 1778 in this letter he desires that mahomed reza khân may be removed from his office in the government and he expresses his hopes that as he himself is now come to years of maturity and by the blessing of god is not so devoid of understanding as to be incapable of conducting his affairs he says i am therefore hopeful from your favor and regard to justice that you will deliver me from the authority of the aforesaid mahomed reza khân and give your permission that i take on myself the management of the adawlut and foujdarry there is no doubt of this latter application in contradiction to the former having arisen from a suspicion that the appointment of munny begum would be too gross and would shock the council and mr hastings therefore orders the second letter to be written from the nabob in which he claims the powers of government for himself then follows a letter from the governorgeneral informing the nabob that it had been agreed that his excellency being now arrived at years of maturity the control of his own household and the courts dependent on the nizamut and foujdarry should be placed in his hands and mahomed reza khân was directed at the same time to resign his authority to the nabob  here your lordships see munny begum in effect completely invested with and you will see how she has used her power for i suppose your lordships are sick of the name of nabob as a real actor in the government you now see the true parties in the transactionnamely the lover warren hastings esquire and munny begum the object of his passion and flame to which he sacrifices as much as antony ever did to cleopatra you see the object of his love and affection placed in the administration of the viceroyalty you see placed at her disposal the administration of the civil judicature and of the executory justicetogether with the salary which was intended for mahomed reza khân  your lordships will be pleased to remember that this distribution of the nabobs government was made in direct defiance of the orders of the company and as a further proof of this defiance it will not escape your lordships that before this measure was carried into execution mr barwell being one day absent from the council mr hastings fell into a minority and it was agreed upon that occasion that the whole affair should be referred home to the court of directors and that no arrangement should be made till the directors had given their opinion mr hastings the very moment after mr barwells return to his seat in the council rescinds this resolution which subjected the orders of the court of directors to their own reconsideration and he hurries headlong and precipitately into the execution of his first determination your lordships will also see in this act what sort of use mr hastings made of the council and i have therefore insisted upon all these practices of the prisoner at your bar because there is not one of them in which some principle of government is not wounded if not mortally wounded  my lords we have laid before you the consequences of this proceeding we have shown what passed within the walls of the seraglio and what tyranny was exercised by this woman over the multitude of women there i shall now show your lordships in what manner she made use of her power over the supreme judicature to peculate and to destroy the country and i shall adduce as proofs of this abuse of her authority the facts i am about to relate and of which there is evidence before your lordships  there was an ostensible man named sudder ul huk khân placed there at the head of the administration of justice with a salary of seven thousand pounds a year of the companys money this man in a letter to the governorgeneral and council received the 1st of september 1778 sayshis highness himself the nabob is not deficient in regard for me but certain bad men have gained an ascendency over his temper by whose instigation he acts you will see my lords how this poor man was crippled in the execution of his duty and dishonored by the corruption of this woman and her eunuchs to whom mr hastings had given the supreme government and with it an uncontrolled influence over all the dependent parts after thus complaining of the slights he receives from the nabob he addsthus they cause the nabob to treat me sometimes with indignity at others with kindness just as they think proper to advise him their view is that by compelling me to displeasure at such unworthy treatment they may force me either to relinquish my station or to join with them and act with their advice and appoint creatures of their recommendation to the different offices from which they might draw profit to themselves in a subsequent letter to the governor sudder ul huk khân saysthe begums ministers before my arrival with the advice of their counsellors caused the nabob to sign a receipt in consequence of which they received at two different times near fifty thousand rupees in the name of the officers of the adawlut foujdarry c from the companys sircar and having drawn up an account current in the manner they wished they got the nabob to sign it and then sent it to me in the same letter he asserts that these people have the nabob entirely in their power  now i have only to remark to your lordships that the first and immediate operation of mr hastingss regulation which put everything into the hands of this wicked woman for her corrupt purposes was that the office of chiefjustice was trampled upon and depraved and made use of to plunder the company of money which was appropriated to their own usesand that the person ostensibly holding this office was forced to become the instrument in the hands of this wicked woman and her two wicked eunuchs this then was the representation which the chiefjustice made to mr hastings as one of the very first fruits of his new arrangement i am now to tell you what his next step was this same mr hastings who had made the nabob master of everything and placed everything at his disposal who had maintained that the nabob was not to act a secondary part and to be a mere instrument in the hands of the company who had as you have seen revived the nabob now puts him to death again he pretends to be shocked at these proceedings of the nabob and not being able to prevent their coming before the council of the directors at home he immediately took sudder ul huk khân under his protection  now your lordships see mr hastings appearing in his own character againexercising the power he had pretended to abdicate whilst the nabob sinks and subsides under him he becomes the supporter of sudder ul huk khân now that the infamy of the treatment he received could no longer be concealed from the council on the 1st of september 1778 the governor informs the nabob that it is highly expedient that sudder ul huk khân should have full control in all matters relative to his office and the sole appointment and dismission of the sudder and mofussil officers and that his seal and signature should be authentic to all papers having relation to the business intrusted to him i therefore intimate to you that he should appoint and dismiss all the officers under him and that your excellency should not interfere in any one way  the nabob in a letter to the governor received the 3d of september 1778 saysagreeably to your pleasure i have relinquished all concern with the affairs of the foujdarry and adawlut leaving the entire management in sudder ul huk khâns hands here you see the nabob again reduced to his former state of subordination this chiefjusticeship which was declared to be his inherent right he is obliged to submit to the control of mr hastings and to declare that he will not interfere at all in a matter which mr hastings had declared to be his incommunicable attribute i do not say that mr hastings interfered improperly certainly it was not fit that the highest court of justice in all bengal should be made the instrument of the rapacity of a set of villains with a prostitute at their head just as if a gang of thieves in england with their prostitutes at their head should seize the judge which ought to punish them and endeavor to make use of his name in their iniquitous transactions but your lordships will find that mr hastings is here acting a merely ostensible part and that he has always a means of defeating privately what he declares publicly to be his intention your lordships will see soon how this ended mr hastings gets the nabob to give up all his authority over the chiefjustice but he says not one word of munny begum the person who had the real authority in her hands and who was not forbidden to interfere with him mr hastingss order is dated the 1st september 1778 on the 3d of september the nabob is said to have relinquished all concern with sudder ul huk khân in a letter received the 30th of september that is about twentyseven days after the date of mr hastingss order you will see how this pretended order was managed sudder ul huk khân thus writes in a letter received the 30th of september       yatibar ali khân munny begums chief eunuch from the amount      of salaries of the officers of the adawlut and foujdarry which      before my arrival he had received for two months from the sircar      made disbursements according to his own pleasure he had before      caused the sum of 7400 rupees on account of the price of mine and      my peshcars khelauts to be carried to account and now      continually sends a man to demand from me 4300 and odd rupees as      a balance of the price of khelauts and constantly presses me to      take it from the amount of the salaries of the officers of the      adawlut and foujdarry and send it to him and i shall be under the      necessity of complying i mention this for your information  my lords you see again how mr hastingss pretended orders were obeyed they were orders addressed to the nabob whom he knew to be nothing and who could neither control or take the least share in the execution of them but he leaves the thing loose as to manny begum and her eunuchs who he knew could alone carry them into effect your lordships see that the first use made of the restored authority of the nabob was under various pretences to leave the salaries of the officers of government unprovided for to rob the public treasury and to give the companys money to the eunuchs who were acting in the manner i have stated to you  information of these proceedings reaches calcutta a regular complaint from a person in the highest situation in the government is made and the governorgeneral is obliged again to take up the matter and i shall now read to your lordships a letter of the 10th of october 1778 which contains a representation so pointed and so very just of the fatal effects which his interference in the administration of justice had produced as not to stand in need of any comment from me it speaks too plainly to require any        the governorgenerals letter to the nabob       at your excellencys request i sent sudder ul huk khân to take on      him the administration of the affairs of the adawlut and foujdarry      and hoped by that means not only to have given satisfaction to your      excellency but that through his abilities and experience these      affairs would have been conducted in such manner as to have secured      the peace of the country and the happiness of the people and it is      with the greatest concern i learn that this measure is so far from      being attended with the expected advantages that the affairs both      of the foujdarry and adawlut are in the greatest confusion      imaginable and daily robberies and murders are perpetrated      throughout the country this is evidently owing to the want of a      proper authority in the person appointed to superintend them i      therefore addressed your excellency on the importance and delicacy      of the affairs in question and of the necessity of lodging full      power in the hands of the person chosen to administer them in      reply to which your excellency expressed sentiments coincident with      mine notwithstanding which your dependants and people actuated      by selfish and avaricious views have by their interference so      impeded the business as to throw the whole country into a state of      confusion from which nothing can retrieve it but an unlimited      power lodged in the hands of the superintendent i therefore      request that your excellency will give the strictest injunctions to      all your dependants not to interfere in any manner with any matter      relative to the affairs of the adawlut and foujdarry and that you      will yourself relinquish all interference therein and leave them      entirely to the management of sudder ul huk khân this is      absolutely necessary to restore the country to a state of      tranquillity and if your excellency has any plan to propose for      the management of the affairs in future be pleased to communicate      it to me and every attention shall be paid to give your excellency      satisfaction  my lords i think i have read enough to you for our present purposereferring your lordships for fuller information to your minutes page 1086 which i beg you to read with the greatest attention  i must again beg your lordships to remark that though mr hastings has the impudence still to pretend that he wishes for the restoration of order and justice in the country yet instead of writing to munny begum upon the business whom he knew to be the very object complained of and whose eunuchs are expressly mentioned in the complaint he writes to the nabob whom he knew to be a pageant in his own court and government and whose name was not even mentioned in this last complaint not one word is said even in this letter to the nabob of munny begum or of her eunuchs my lords when you consider his tacit support of the authors of the grievance and his ostensible application for redress to the man who he knew never authorized and could not redress the grievance you must conclude that he meant to keep the country in the same state for his own corrupt purposes in this state the country in fact continued munny begum and her eunuchs continued to administer and squander the companys money as well as the nabobs robberies and murders continued to prevail throughout the country no appearance was left of order law or justice from one end of bengal to the other  the account of this state of things was received by the court of directors with horror and indignation on the 27th of may 1779 they write as you will find in page 1063 of your printed minutes a letter to their government at calcutta condemning their proceedings and the removal of mahomed reza khân and they order that munny begum shall be displaced and mahomed reza khân restored again to the seat of justice  mr francis upon the arrival of these reiterated orders moved in council for an obedience to them mr hastings notwithstanding he had before his eyes all the horrible consequences that attended his new arrangement still resists that proposition by his casting voice in the council he counterorders the orders of the court of directors and sanctions a direct disobedience to their authority by a resolution that mahomed reza khân should not be restored to his employment but that this sudder ul huk khân who still continued in the condition already described should remain in the possession of his office i say nothing of sudder ul huk khân he seems to be very well disposed to do his duty if mr hastingss arrangements had suffered him to do it and indeed if mahomed reza khân had been reinstated and no better supported by mr hastings than sudder ul huk khân he could probably have kept the country in no better order though perhaps his name and the authority and weight which still adhered to him in some degree might have had some influence  my lords you have seen his defiance of the company you have seen his defiance of all decency you see his open protection of prostitutes and robbers of every kind ravaging bengal you have seen this defiance of the authority of the court of directors flatly directly and peremptorily persisted in to the last order after order was reiterated but his disobedience arose with an elastic spring in proportion to the pressure that was upon it  my lords here there was a pause the directors had been disobeyed and you might suppose that he would have been satisfied with this act of disobedience my lords he was resolved to let the native governments of the country know that he despised the orders of the court of directors and that whenever he pretended to obey them in reality he was resolved upon the most actual disobedience an event now happened the particulars of which we are not to repeat here disputes conducted on mr franciss side upon no other principle that we can discover but a desire to obey the companys orders and to execute his duty with fidelity and disinterestedness had arisen between him and mr hastings mr francis about the time we have been speaking of finding resistance was vain reconciles himself to himbut on the most honorable terms as a public man namely that he should continue to follow and obey the laws and to respect the authority of the court of directors upon this reconciliation it was agreed that mahomed reza khân should be restored to his office for this purpose mr hastings enters a minute and writes to the nabob an ostensible letter but your lordships will here see an instance of what i said respecting a double current in all mr hastingss proceedings even when he obeys or pretends to obey the companys orders there is always a private channel through which he defeats them all        letter from mr hastings to the nabob mobarek ul dowlah written      the 10th of february 1780       the company whose orders are peremptory have directed that      mahomed reza khân shall be restored to the offices he held in      january 1778 it is my duty to represent this to your excellency      and to recommend your compliance with their request that mahomed      reza khân may be invested with the offices assigned to him under      the nizamut by the company  your lordships see here that mr hastings informs the nabob that having received peremptory orders from the company he restores and replaces mahomed reza khân mahomed reza khân then is in possessionand in possession by the best of all titles the orders of the company but you will also see the manner in which he evades his duty and vilifies in the eyes of these miserable country powers the authority of the directors he is prepared as usual with a defeasance of his own act and the manner in which that defeasance came to our knowledge is this we knew nothing of this private affair till mr hastings in his answer before the house of commons finding it necessary to destroy the validity of some of his own acts brought forward sir john doyly he was brought forward before us not as a witness in his own person for the defence of mr hastings but as a narrator who had been employed by mr hastings as a member of that council which as you have heard drew up his defence my lords you have already seen the public agency of this business you have heard read the public letter sent to the nabob there you see the ostensible part of the transaction now hear the banian sir john doyly give an account of his part in it extracted from mr hastingss defence before the house of commons       i was appointed resident at the court of the nabob on the      resignation of mr byam martin in the month of january 1780 and      took charge about the beginning of february of the same year the      substance of the instructions i received was to endeavor by every      means in my power to conciliate the good opinion and regard of the      nabob and his family that i might be able to persuade him to adopt      effectual measures for the better regulation of his expenses which      were understood to have greatly exceeded his income that i might      prevent his forming improper connections or taking any steps      derogatory to his rank and by every means in my power support his      credit and dignify in the eyes of the world and with respect to      the various branches of his family i was instructed to endeavor to      put a stop to the dissensions which had too frequently prevailed      amongst them the nabob on his part was recommended to pay the      same attention to my advice as he would have done to that of the      governorgeneral in person some time i think in the month of      february of the same year i received a letter from mr hastings      purporting that the critical situation of affairs requiring the      union and utmost exertion of every member of the government to give      vigor to the acts necessary for its relief he had agreed to an      accommodation with mr francis but to effect this point he had      been under the necessity of making some painful sacrifices and      particularly that of the restoration of mahomed reza khân to the      office of naib subah a measure which he knew must be highly      disagreeable to the nabob and which nothing but the urgent      necessity of the case should have led him to acquiesce in that he      relied on me to state all these circumstances in the most forcible      manner to the nabob and to urge his compliance assuring him that      it should not continue longer than until the next advices were      received from the court of directors  here mr hastings himself lets us into the secrets of his government he writes an ostensible letter to the nabob declaring that what he does is in conformity to the orders of the company he writes a private letter in which he directs his agent to assure the nabob that what he had done was not in compliance with the orders of the company but in consequence of the arrangement he had made with mr francis which arrangement he thought necessary for the support of his own personal power his design in thus explaining the transaction to the nabob was in order to prevent the native powers from looking to any other authority than his and from having the least hopes of redress of their complaints from the justice of this country or from any legal power in it he therefore tells him that mahomed reza khân was replaced not in obedience to the orders of the company but to gratify mr francis if he quarrels with mr francis he makes that a reason for disobeying the orders of his masters if he agrees with him he informs the people concerned in the transaction privately that he acts not in consequence of the orders that he has received but from other motives but that is not all he promises that he will take the first opportunity to remove mahomed reza khân from his office again thus the country is to be replunged into the same distracted and ruined state in which it was before and all this is laid open fully and distinctly before you you have it on the authority of sir john doyly sir john doyly is a person in the secret and one man who is in the secret is worth a thousand ostensible persons  mahomed reza khân i must now tell you was accordingly reinstated in all his offices and the nabob was reduced to the situation as mr hastings upon another occasion describes it of a mere cipher but mark what followedmark what this sir john doyly is made to tell you or what mr hastings tells you for him for whether sir john doyly has written this for mr hastings or mr hastings for sir john doyly i do not know because they seem as somebody said of two great friends that they had but one will one bed and one hat between them these gentlemen who compose mr hastingss council have but one style of writing among them so that it is impossible for you to determine by which of the masters of this roman school any paper was writtenwhether by doyly by shore or by hastings or any other of them they have a style in common a kind of bank upon which they have a general credit and you cannot tell to whose account anything is to be placed  but to proceedsir john doyly says there that the nabob is reduced again to a cipher now hear what he afterwards says about the month of june 1781 mr hastings being then at moorshedabad communicated to me his intention of performing his promise to the nabob by restoring him to the management of his own affairsthat is to say by restoring munny begum again and by turning out mahomed reza khân your lordships see that he communicated privately his intentions to sir john doyly without communicating one word of them to his colleagues in the supreme council and without entering any minute in the records of the council by which it could be known to the directors  lastly in order to show you in what manner the nabob was to be restored to his power i refer your lordships to the order he gave to sir john doyly for investigating the nabobs accounts and for drawing up articles of instructions for the nabobs conduct in the management of his affairs you will there see clearly how he was restored that is to say that he was taken out of the hands of the first mussulman in that country the man most capable of administering justice and whom the company had expressly ordered to be invested with that authority and to put him into the hands of sir john doyly is sir john doyly a mussulman is sir john doyly fit to be at the head of such a government what was there that any person could see about him that entitled him to or made him a fit person to be intrusted with this power in defiance of the companys orders and yet mahomed reza khân who was to have the management of the nabobs affairs was himself put under the most complete and perfect subjection to this sir john doyly but in fact munny begum had the real influence in everything sir john doyly himself was only mr hastingss instrument there to preserve it and between them they pillaged the nabob in the most shocking manner and must have done so to the knowledge of mr hastings a letter written at this time by mr hastings to the nabob discovers the secret beyond all power of evasion        instructions from the governorgeneral to the nabob mobarek ul      dowlah respecting his conduct in the management of his affairs       9th these i make the conditions of the compliance which the      governorgeneral and council have yielded to your late requisition      it is but just that you should possess what is your acknowledged      right but their intention would be defeated and you would be in a      worse situation if you were to be left a prey without a guide      until you have acquired experience which to the strength and      goodness of your understanding will be the work but of a short      period to the rapacity frauds and artifices of mankind you      have offered to give up the sum of four lacs of rupees to be      allowed the free use of the remainder of your stipend this we have      refused because it would be contrary to justice you should      consider this as a proof of the sincerity of the above      arrangements which have been recommended to you and of their      expediency to your real interests and your attention to them will      be a means of reconciling the company to the resolution which we      have taken and which will be reported to them in a light very      hurtful both to you and to us if an improper effect should attend      it these i have ordered sir john doyly to read in your presence      and to explain them to you that no part of them may escape your      notice and he has my positive orders to remonstrate to you against      every departure from them upon all these occasions i hope and      expect that you will give him a particular and cordial attention      and regard what he shall say as if said by myself for i know him      to be a person of the strictest honor and integrity i have a      perfect reliance on him and you cannot have a more attached or      more disinterested counsellor although i desire to receive your      letters frequently yet as many matters will occur which cannot so      easily be explained by letter as by conversation i desire that you      will on such occasions give your orders to him respecting such      points as you may desire to have imparted to me and i postponing      every other concern will give you an immediate and the most      satisfactory reply concerning them  my lords here is a man who is to administer his own affairs who has arrived at sufficient age to supersede the counsel and advice of the great mahometan doctors and the great nobility of the country and he is put under the most absolute guardianship of sir john doyly but mr hastings has given sir john doyly a great character i cannot confirm it because i can confirm the character of none of mr hastingss instruments they must stand forth here and defend their own character before you  your lordships will now be pleased to advert to another circumstance in this transaction you see here 40000l a year offered by this man for his redemption i will give you he says 40000l a year to have the management of my own affairs good heavens here is a man who according to mr hastingss assertion had an indisputable right to the management of his own affairs but at the same time was notoriously so little fit to have the management of them as to be always under some corrupt tyranny or other offers 40000l a year out of his own revenues to be left his own master and to be permitted to have the disposal of the remainder judge you of the bribery rapine and peculation which here stare you in the face judge of the nature and character of that government for the management of which 40000l out of 160000l a year of its revenue is offered by a subordinate to the supreme authority of the country this offer shows that at this time the nabob had it not himself who had it sir john doyly he is brought forward as the person to whom is given the management of the whole munny begum had the management before but whether it be an englishman a mussulman a white man or a black man a white woman or a black woman it is all warren hastings  with respect to the four lacs of rupees he gets sir john doyly in the narrative that he makes before the house of commons positively to deny in the strongest manner and he says the nabob would give oath of it that the nabob never gave a commission to any one to make such an offer that such an offer was made had been long published and long in print with the remarks such as i have made upon it in the ninth report of the select committee that the committee had so done was well known to mr hastings and sir john doyly not one word on the part of mr hastings not one word on the part of sir john doyly was said to contradict it until the appearance of the latter before the house of commons but my lords there is something much more serious in this transaction it is thisthat the evidence produced by mr hastings is the evidence of witnesses who are mere phantoms they are persons who could not under mr hastingss government eat a bit of bread but upon his own terms and they are brought forward to give such evidence as may answer his purposes  you would naturally have imagined that in the house of commons where clouds of witnesses had been before produced by the friends and agents of mr hastings he would then have brought forward sir john to contradict this reported offer but not a word from sir john doyly at last he is examined before the committee of managers he refuses to answer why because his answers might criminate himself my lords every answer that most of them have been required to make they are sensible they cannot make without danger of criminating themselves being all involved in the crimes of the prisoner he has corrupted and ruined the whole service there is not one of them that dares appear and give a fair and full answer in any case as you have seen in mr middleton and many others at your bar i will not answer this question they say because it tends to criminate myself how comes it that the companys servants are not able to give evidence in the affairs of mr hastings without its tending to criminate themselves  wellsir john doyly is in englandwhy is he not called now i have not the honor of being intimately acquainted with him but he is a man of a reputable and honorable family why is he not called by mr hastings to verify the assertion and why do they suffer this black record to stand before your lordships to be urged by us and to press it as we do against him if he knows that sir john doyly can acquit him of this part of our accusation he would certainly bring him as a witness to your bar but he knows he cannot when therefore i see upon your records that sir john doyly and mr hastings received such an offer for the redemption of the nabobs affairs out of their hands i conclude first that at the time of this offer the nabob had not the disposal of his own affairsand secondly that those who had the disposal of them disposed of them so corruptly and prodigally that he thought they could hardly be redeemed at too high a price what explanation of this matter has been attempted there is no explanation given of it at all it stands clear full bare in all its nakedness before you they have not attempted to produce the least evidence against it therefore in that state i leave it with you and i shall only add that mr hastings continued to make munny begum the first object of his attention and that though he could not entirely remove mahomed reza khân from the seat of justice he was made a cipher in it all his other offices were taken out of his hands and put into the hands of sir john doyly directly contrary to the orders of the company which certainly implied the restitution of mahomed reza khân to all the offices which he had before held he was stripped of everything but a feeble administration of justice which i take for granted could not under the circumstances have been much better in his hands than it had been in sudder ul huk khâns  mr hastingss protection of this woman continued to the last and when he was going away on the 3d of november 1783 he wrote a sentimental letter to the court of directors in her praise this letter was transmitted without having been communicated to the council you have heard of delicate affidavits here you have a sentimental official despatch your lordships will find it in page 1092 and 1093 of your printed minutes he writes in such a delicate sentimental strain of this woman that i will venture to say you will not find in all the arcadia in all the novels and romances that ever were published an instance of a greater a more constant and more ardent affection defying time ugliness and old age did ever exist than existed in mr hastings towards this old woman munny begum as cases of this kind cases of gallantry abounding in sentimental expressions are rare in the companys records i recommend it as a curiosity to your lordships reading as well as a proof of what is the great spring and movement of all the prisoners actions on this occasion he thus speaks of munny begum       she too became the victim of your policy and of the resentments      which succeeded something too she owed of the source of her      misfortunes to the belief of the personal gratitude which she      might entertain for the public attention which i had shown to her      yet exposed as she was to a treatment which a ruffian would have      shuddered at committing and which no recollection of past enmities      shall compel me to believe even for a moment proceeded from any      commission of authority she still maintained the decorum of her      character nor even then nor before nor since that period has      the malice of calumny ever dared to breathe on her      reputationdelicate sentimentalpardon honorable sirs this      freedom of expostulation i must in honest truth repeat that your      commands laid the first foundation of her misfortunes to your      equity she has now recourse through me for their alleviation that      she may pass the remainder of her life in a state which may at      least efface the remembrance of the years of her affliction and to      your humanity she and an unseen multitude of the most helpless of      her sex cry for subsistence  moving and pathetici wish to recommend every word of this letter to your lordships consideration as a model and pattern of perfection observe his pity for a woman who had suffered such treatment from the servants of the company a parcel of ruffianstreatment that a ruffian would be ashamed of your lordships have seen in the evidence what this ruffianism was it was neither more nor less than what was necessary in order to get at the accounts which she concealed as his own corrupt transactions she was told indeed that she must privately remove to another house whilst her papers were examining mr hastings can never forget this he cannot believe that anybody dare send such an order and he calls upon you to consider the helplessness of their sex and the affronts offered to women  for heavens sake my lords recollect the manner in which mr hastings and his creatures treated the begums of oude and consider that this woman was only threatened for the threat was never attempted to be executed that she must if she did not deliver up the accounts probably be removed to another house and leave the accounts behind her this blot can never be effaced and for this he desires the court of directors to make her a large allowance to comfort her in her old age in this situation mr hastings leaves her he leaves in the situation i have described the justice of the country the only concern he has at parting is that this woman may have a large allowance  but i have yet to tell your lordships and it appears upon your printed minutes that this woman had a way of comforting herselffor old ladies of that description who have passed their youth in amusements in dancing and in gallantries in their old age are apt to take comfort in brandy this lady was a smuggler and had influence enough to avoid payment of the duty on spirits in which article she is the largest dealer in the districtas indeed she is in almost every species of trade thus your lordships see that this sentimental lady whom mr hastings recommends to the directors had ways of comforting herself she carried on notwithstanding her dignity a trade in spirits now a mahometan of distinction never carries on any trade at allit is an unknown thingvery few mahometans of any rank carry on any trade at all but that a mahometan should carry on a trade in spirits is a prodigy never heard of before for a woman of quality for a woman of sentiment to become a dealer in spirits is my lords a thing reserved for the sentimental age of mr hastings and i will venture to say that no man or woman could attempt any such a trade in india without being dishonored ruined in character and disgraced by it but she appears not only to have been a dealer in it but through the influence which mr hastings gave her to have monopolized the trade in brandy and to have evaded the duties this then is the state in which we leave the two sentimental loversthe one consoling herself with brandy the other wheedling and whining and as swift describes the progress of an intrigue in some respects similar which he calls the progress of love whereas this is the progress of sentiment      they keep at staines the old blue boar     are cat and dog and rogue and whore  here they set up the sign of the old blue boar munny begum monopolizes the trade in spirits and hence she and mr hastings commence their sentimental correspondenceand now having done with this progress of love we return to the progress of justice                                       we have seen how sudder ul huk khân the chiefjustice of mr hastingss own nomination was treated now you shall see how justice was left to shift for herself under mahomed reza khân in page 1280 of your lordships minutes you will see the progress of all these enormitiesof munny begums dealing in spirits of her engrossing the trade of her evading dutiesand lastly the extinction of all order in that country and the funeral of justice itself mr shores evidence respecting this state of the country will admit of no doubt        mr shores remarks accompanying the governorgenerals minutes of      the 18th may 1785       foujdarry jurisdictionof the foujdarry jurisdiction nothing has      yet been said in this department criminal justice is administered      and it is the only office left to the nabob i do not see any      particular reason for changing the system itself and perhaps it      would on many accounts be improper but some regulations are highly      necessary mahomed reza is at the head of this department and is      the only person i know in the country qualified for it if he were      left to himself i have not a doubt but he would conduct it well      but he is so circumscribed by recommendations of particular      persons and by the protection held out to his officers by      europeans that to my knowledge he has not been able to punish      them even when they have been convicted of the greatest      enormities and he has often on this account been blamed where his      hands were tied up  my lords you now see in this minute of sir john shore now governorgeneral of bengal one of mr hastingss own committee for drawing up his defence the review which he had just then taken of the ruins of the government which had been left to him by mr hastings you see here not the little paltry things which might deserve in their causes the animadversion of a rough satirist like doctor swift whom i have just quoted but you see things ten thousand times more serious things that deserve the thunderbolt of vindictive justice upon the head of the prisoner at your bar for you see that after he had ostensibly restored mahomed reza khân the man who could and would have executed his office with fidelity and effect the man who was fit for and disposed to do his duty there was still neither law order nor justice in the country why because of the interposition of europeans and men who must have been patronized and supported by europeans all this happened before mr hastingss departure so that the whole effect of the new arrangement of government was known to him before he left calcutta the same pretended remedy was applied but in fact he left this woman in the full possession of her power his last thoughts were for her for the justice of the country for the peace and security of the people of bengal he took no kind of care these great interests were left to the mercy of the woman and her european associates  my lords i have taken some pains in giving you this history i have shown you his open acts and secret stratagems in direct rebellion to the court of directorshis double government his false pretences of restoring the nabobs independence leading in effect to a most servile dependence even to the prohibition of the approach of any one native or european near him but through the intervention of sir john doyly i therefore again repeat it that sir john doyly and the english gentlemen who were patronized and countenanced by mr hastings had wrought all that havoc in the country before mr hastings left it  i have particularly dwelt upon the administration of justice because i consider it as the source of all good and the maladministration of it as the source of all evil in the country your lordships have heard how it was totally destroyed by mr hastings through sir john doyly who was sent there by him for the purpose of forming a clandestine government of corruption and peculation this part of our charge speaks for itself and i shall dismiss it with a single observationthat not the least trace of an account of all these vast sums of money delivered into the hands of sir john doyly for the use of the nabob appears in any part of the companys records the undeniable inferences to be drawn from this fact are first that wherever we find concealment of money and the ceasing of an account there has been fraudand secondly that if we find this concealment accompanied with the devastation of a country and the extinction of justice in it that devastation of the country and that extinction of justice have been the result of that fraudulent peculation  i am sure your lordships will not think that a charge of the annihilation of administrative justice in which the happiness and prosperity of a great body of nobility of numerous ancient and respectable families and of the inhabitants in general of extensive and populous provinces are concerned can if it stood single and alone be a matter of trifling moment and in favor of whom do all these sacrifices appear to have been made in favor of an old prostitute who if shown to your lordships here like helen to the counsellors of troy would not i think be admitted to have charms that could palliate this mans abominable conduct you would not cry out with them      Οὐ νέμεσις      Τοιῇδ ἀμφὶ γυναικὶ πολὺν χρόνον ἂλγεα πάσχειν  for i will fairly say that there are some passions that have their excuses but the passion towards this woman was the passion of avarice and rapacity onlya passion indeed which lasted to the end of his government and for which he defied the orders of the court of directors rebelled against his masters and finally subverted the justice of a great country                                       my lords i have done with this business i come next to the third division of the natives those who form the landed interest of the country a few words only will be necessary upon this part of the subject the fact is that mr hastings at one stroke put up the property of all the nobility and gentry and of all the freeholders in short the whole landed interest of bengal to a public auction and let it to the highest bidder i will make no observations upon the nature of this measure to your lordships who represent so large a part of the dignity together with so large a part of the landed interest of this kingdom though i think that even under your lordships restrictive order i am entitled so to do because we have examined some witnesses upon this point in the revenue charge suffice it to say that it is in evidence before your lordships that this sale was ordered mr hastings does not deny it he says indeed he did it not with an ill intention my answer is that it could have been done with no other than a bad intention the owners of the land had no way left to save themselves but to become farmers of their own estates and from the competition which naturally took place and he himself declared that the persons whether owners or strangers to whom he let the lands had agreed to rents which surpassed their abilities to pay i need not tell you what must have been the consequence when it got into such rapacious hands and was taken out of the hands of its natural proprietors that the public revenue had sunk and lost by it and that the country was wasted and destroyed i leave it to your lordships own meditation and reflection and i shall not press it one step further than just to remind you of what has been so well opened and pressed by my fellow managers he mr hastings confesses that he let the lands to his own banians he took his own domestic servants and put them in the houses of the nobility of the country and this he did in direct violation of an express order made by himself that no banian of a collector the spirit of which order implied ten thousand times more strongly the exclusion of any banians of a governorgeneral should have any one of those farms we also find that he made a regulation that no farmers should rent more than a lac of rupees but at the same time we find his banians holding several farms to more than that amount in short we find that in every instance where under some plausible pretence or other the fixed regulations are violated it touches him so closely as to make it absolutely impossible not to suppose that he himself had the advantage of it  for in the first place you have proof that he does take bribes and that he has corrupt dealings this is what he admits but he says that he has done it from publicspirited motives now there is a rule formed upon a just solid presumption of law that if you find a man guilty of one offence contrary to known law whenever there is a suspicious case against him of the same nature the onus probandi that he is not guilty is turned upon him therefore when i find the regulations brokenwhen i find farms given of more than a lac of rupeeswhen i find them given to the governorgenerals own banian contrary to the principle of the regulation contrary i say in the strongest way to itwhen i find that he accumulates farms beyond the regulated numberwhen i find all these things done and besides that the banian has great balances of account against himthen by the presumption of law i am bound to believe that all this was done not for the servants but for the master  it is possible mr hastings might really be in love with munny begum be it somany great men have played the fool for prostitutes from mark antonys days downwards but no man ever fell in love with his own banian the persons for whom mr hastings was guilty of all this rapine and oppression have neither relations nor kindred whom they own nor does any trace of friendship exist among them they do not live in habits of intimacy with any one they are good fellows and bottlecompanions                                       i must now proceed to observe upon another matter which has been stated to your lordshipsnamely that as soon as he obtained the majority in the council that beginning of all evils that opening of pandoras box by the death of general clavering and colonel monson the first thing he did was to appoint a commission called an aumeeny to go through the whole country to enter every mans house to examine his titledeeds and to demand his papers of accounts of every kind for the purpose of enabling himself to take advantage of the hopes and fears of all the parties concerned and thus to ravage and destroy all their property  and whom does he place at the head of this commission to be the manager of the whole affair gunga govind sing another banian of his and one of his own domestic servants this we have discovered lately and not without some surprise for though i knew he kept a rogue in his house yet i did not think that it was a common receptacle of thieves and robbers i did not know till lately that this gunga govind sing was his domestic servant but mr hastings in a letter to the court of directors calls him his faithful domestic servant and as such calls upon the company to reward him to this banian all the companys servants are made subject they are bound to obey all his orders and those of his committee i hope i need not tell your lordships what sort of stuff this committee was made of by which gunga govind sing was enabled to ravage the whole country  but say his counsel mr hastings thought that the value of the lands was thoroughly known they had been investigated three times over and they were all let by public auction to the highest bidderthis may or may not be a true test of their value but it is a test which as it led to the almost entire confiscation of the landed interest of bengal bahar and orissa three great kingdoms by a dash of that mans pen into the hands of his banians and creatures i can never think of it or of its author without horror  some people say you ought to hate the crime and love the criminal no that is the language of false morality you ought to hate the crime and the criminal if the crime is of magnitude if the crime is a small one then you ought to be angry with the crime and reluctant to punish the criminal but when there are great crimes then you may hate them together what am i to love nero to fall in love with heliogabalus is domitian to be the subject of my affection no we hate the crime and we hate the criminal ten times more and if i use indignant language if i use the language of scorn and horror with respect to the criminal i use the language that becomes me  but says one of the counsel the company might possess a knowledge of the country in general but they could not know every bega of it about the third part of an acre of land without such a commission that is to say you could not squeeze everything out of the people without ordering such a villain as gunga govind sing i call things by their names that most atrocious and wicked instrument of the most atrocious and wicked tyranny to examine every mans papers to oblige every man to produce his titles and accounts upon pain of criminal punishment to be inflicted at the discretion of this commissioner this gunga govind sing for an account of these acts and for a description of an aumeeny i refer your lordships to the evidence in your minutes from page 1287 to 1301 and i pass on expressing only my horror and detestation at it and wishing to kindle in your lordships minds the same horror and detestation of it  thus you see that mr hastings was not satisfied with confiscation only he comes just afterwards with a blister upon the sore he lets loose another set of ravagers and inquisitors upon them under gunga govind sing and these poor people are ravaged by the whole tribe of calcutta banians  mr hastings has himself defined an aumeen in page 1022 where he states that nundcomar desired him to make his son an aumeen the promise which he nundcomar says i made him that he should be constituted aumeen that is inquisitorgeneral over the whole country and that i would delegate to him my whole power and influence is something more than a negative falsehood he justly and naturally reprobates the proposition of appointing an inquisitorgeneral over the whole country and yet we see him afterwards appointing gunga govind sing such an inquisitorgeneral over the whole country in order that a bega of land should not escape him  let us see how all this ended and what it is that leads me directly to the presumption of corruption against him in this wicked aumeeny scheme now i will admit the whole scheme to have been well intended i will forgive the letting all the lands of bengal by public auction i will forgive all he has done with regard to his banians i shall forgive him even this commission itself if he will show your lordships that there was the smallest use made of it with regard to the settlement of the revenues of the company if there was not then there is obviously one use only that could be made of it namely to put all the people of the whole country under obedience to gunga govind sing what then was done titles and accounts were exacted the estimate was made acre by acre but we have not been able to find one word on their records of any return that was made to the company of this investigation or of any settlement or assessment of the country founded upon it or of any regulation that was established upon it therefore as an honest man and as a man who is standing here for the commons of great britain i must not give way to any idle doubts and ridiculous suppositions i cannot i say entertain any doubts that the only purpose it was designed to answer was to subject the whole landed interest of the country to the cruel inquisition of gunga govind sing and to the cruel purposes of mr hastings show me another purpose and i will give up the argument for if there are two ways of accounting for the same act it is possible it may be attributed to the better motive but when we see that a bad thing was done under pretence of some good we must attach a bad motive to it if the pretence be never fulfilled                                       i have now done with the landed interest of bengal i have omitted much which might have been pressed upon your lordships not from any indisposition to remark upon the matter more fully but because it has been done already by abler persons i only wished to make some practical inferences which perhaps in the hurry of my brother managers might possibly have escaped them i wished to show you that one system of known or justly presumed corruption pervades the whole of this business from one end to the other having thus disposed of the native landed interest and the native zemindars or landholders of the country i pass to the english government  my lords when we have shown plainly the utter extinction of the native mahometan government when we have shown the extinction of the native landed interest what hope can there be for that afflicted country but in the servants of the company when we have shown the corrupt state of that service what hope but from the court of directors what hope but in the superintending control of british tribunals i think as well of the body of my countrymen as any man can do i do not think that any man sent out to india is sent with an ill purpose or goes out with bad dispositions no i think the young men who go there are fair and faithful representatives of the people of the same ageuncorrupted but corruptible from their age as we all are they are sent there young there is but one thing held out to themyou are going to make your fortune the companys service is to be the restoration of decayed noble families it is to be the renovation of old and the making of new ones now when such a set of young men are sent out with these hopes and views and with little education or a very imperfect onewhen these people from whatever rank of life selected many from the best most from the middling very few from the lowest but high middling or low they are sent out to make two things coincide which the wit of man was never able to unite to make their fortune and form their education at once what is the education of the generality of the world reading a parcel of books no restraint of discipline emulation examples of virtues and of justice form the education of the world if the companys servants have not that education and are left to give loose to their natural passions some would be corrupt of course and some would be uncorrupt but probably the majority of them would be inclined to pursue moderate courses between these two now i am to show you that mr hastings left these servants but this alternative be starved be depressed be ruined disappoint the hopes of your families or be my slaves be ready to be subservient to me in every iniquity i shall order you to commit and to conceal everything i shall wish you to conceal this was the state of the service therefore the commons did well and wisely when they sent us here not to attack this or that servant who may have peculated but to punish the man who was sent to reform abuses and to make bengal furnish to the world a brilliant example of british justice  i shall now proceed to state briefly the abuses of the companys governmentto show you what mr hastings was expected to do for their reformation and what he actually did do i shall then show your lordships the effects of the whole  i shall begin by reading to your lordships an extract from the directors letter to bengal of the 10th april 1773       we wish we could refute the observation that almost every attempt      made by us and our administrations at your presidency for the      reforming of abuses has rather increased them and added to the      miseries of the country we are so anxious to protect and cherish      the truth of this observation appears fully in the late appointment      of supervisors and chiefs instituted as they were to give relief      to the industrious tenants to improve and enlarge our investments      to destroy monopolies and retrench expenses the end has by no      means been answerable to the institution are not the tenants more      than ever oppressed and wretched are our investments improved      have not the raw silk and cocoons been raised upon us fifty per      cent in price we can hardly say what has not been made a monopoly      and as to the expenses of your presidency they are at length      swelled to a degree we are no longer able to support these facts      for such they are should have been stated to us as capital      reasons why neither our orders of 1771 nor indeed any regulations      whatever could be carried into execution but perhaps as this      would have proved too much it was not suggested to us for nothing      could more plainly indicate a state of anarchy and that there was      no government existing in our servants in bengal       and therefore when oppression pervades the whole country when      youths have been suffered with impunity to exercise sovereign      jurisdiction over the natives and to acquire rapid fortunes by      monopolizing of commerce it cannot be a wonder to us or      yourselves that dadney merchants do not come forward to contract      with the company that the manufactures find their way through      foreign channels or that our investments are at once enormously      dear and of a debased quality       it is evident that the evils which have been so destructive to us      lie too deep for any partial plans to reach or correct it is      therefore our resolution to aim at the root of these evils and we      are happy in having reason to believe that in every just and      necessary regulation we shall meet with the approbation and support      of the legislature who consider the public as materially      interested in the companys prosperity       in order to effectuate this great end the first step must be to      restore perfect obedience and due subordination to your      administration our governor and council must reassume and exercise      their delegated powers upon every just occasionpunish      delinquents cherish the meritorious discountenance that luxury      and dissipation which to the reproach of government prevailed in      bengal our president mr hastings we trust will set the example      of temperance economy and application and upon this we are      sensible much will depend and here we take occasion to indulge      the pleasure we have in acknowledging mr hastingss services upon      the coast of coromandel in constructing with equal labor and      ability the plan which has so much improved our investments there      and as we are persuaded he will persevere in the same laudable      pursuit through every branch of our affairs in bengal he in      return may depend on the steady support and favor of his      employers       your settlement being thus put into a train of reform without      which indeed all regulations will prove ineffectual you are      next to revert to the old system when the business of your      presidency was principally performed by our own servants who then      had knowledge of our investments and every other department of our      concerns you will therefore fill the several offices with the      factors and writers upon your establishment for with our present      appointments we are assured there will be sufficient for this      purpose and thus you will banish idleness and its attendants      extravagance and dissipation and here we enjoin you to transmit to      us a faithful and minute state of the pay and every known      emolument of all below council for as it is notorious that even      youths in our service expend in equipage servants dress and      living infinitely more than our stated allowances can afford we      cannot but be anxious to discover the means by which they are      enabled to proceed in this manner and indeed so obnoxious is      this conduct to us and so injurious in its consequences that we      expect and require you to show your displeasure to all such as      shall transgress in this respect contrasting it at the same time      with instances of kindness towards the sober frugal and      industrious  my lords you see the state in which the directors conceived the country to be that it was in this state is not denied by mr hastings who was sent out for the purpose of reforming it the directors had swept away almost the whole body of their bengal servants for supposed corruption and they appointed a set of new ones to regenerate as it were the government of that country  mr hastings says i was brought to india like other people this indeed is true and i hope it will prove an example and instruction to all mankind never to employ a man who has been bred in base and corrupt practices from any hope that his local knowledge may make him the fittest person to correct such practices mr hastings goes on to say that you could not expect more from him than could be done by a man bred up as he was in the common habits of the country this is also true my lords you might as well expect a man to be fit for a perfumers shop who has lain a month in a pigs stye as to expect that a man who has been a contractor with the company for a length of time is a fit person for reforming abuses mr hastings has stated in general his history his merits and his services we have looked over with care the records relative to his proceedings and we find that in 1760 and 1761 he was in possession of a contract for bullocks and a contract for provisions it is no way wrong for any man to take a contract provided he does not do what mr hastings has condemned in his regulationsbecome a contractor with his masters but though i do not bear upon mr hastings for having spent his time in being a bullockcontractor yet i say that he ought to have laid aside all the habits of a bullockcontractor when he was made a great minister for the reformation of a great service full of abuses i will show your lordships that he never did so that on the contrary being bred in those bad habits and having had the education that i speak of he persevered in the habits which had been formed in him to the very last  i understand it has been imputed as a sort of a crime in me that i stated something of the obscurity of mr hastingss birth the imputation has no foundation can it be believed that any man could be so absurd as to attack a mans birth when he is accusing his actions no i have always spoken of the low sordid and mercenary habits in which he was bred i said nothing of his birth but my lords i was a good deal surprised when a friend of his and mine yesterday morning put into my hands who had been attacking mr hastingss life and conduct a pedigree i was appealing to the records of the company they answer by sending me to the heralds office many of your lordships pedigrees are obscure in comparison with that of mr hastings and i only wonder how he came to derogate from such a line of nobles by becoming a contractor for bullocks  a man may be an honest bullockcontractor god forbid that many of them in this country should not be very honest but i find his terms were nearly four times as high as those which the house of commons had condemned as exorbitant they were not only unusually high but the bullocks were badly supplied and the contract had not been fairly advertised it was therefore agreed to declare the same void at the expiration of twelve months on the 1st december 1763 i say again that i do not condemn him for being a bullockcontractor but i am suspicious of his honesty because he has been nursed in bad and vicious habits that of contracting with his masters is a bad habit as he himself has stated in a record which is printed by the house of commons i condemn him for being a fraudulent bullockcontractor for he was turned out of that contract for fraudulent practices it was declared void and given to another at a lower price after it was so disposed of mr hastings himself condemning his own original contract which was at twelve rupees for a certain species of bullocks took the contract again at seven and on these terms it continued what i therefore contend for is this that he carried with him the spirit of a fraudulent bullockcontractor through the whole of the companys service in its greatest and most important parts  my lords the wading through all these corruptions is an unpleasant employment for me but what am i to think of a man who holds up his head so high that when a matter of account is in discussion such as appears in this very defence that i have in my hand he declares he does not know anything about it he cannot keep accounts that is beneath him we trace him throughout the whole of his career engaged in a great variety of mercantile employments and yet when he comes before you you would imagine that he had been bred in the study of the sublimest sciences and had no concern in anything elsethat he had been engaged in writing a poem an iliad or some work that might revive fallen literature there is but one exception to his abhorrence of accounts he always contrives to make up a good account for himself  my lords we have read to you a letter in which the court of directors have described the disorders of their service the utter ruin of it the corruption that prevailed in it and the destruction of the country by it when we are said to exaggerate we use no stronger words than they do we cannot mince the matter your lordships should not mince it no little paltry delicacies should hinder you when there is a country expiring under all these things from calling the authors to a strict account the court of directors sent him that statement they recommended to him a radical reformation what does he do we will read his letter of 1773 in which you will find seeds sown for the propagation of all those future abuses which terminated in the utter and irremediable destruction of the whole service after he has praised the directors for the trust that they had placed in him after expressing his highest gratitude and so on he says       while i indulge the pleasure which i receive from the past      successes of my endeavors i own i cannot refrain from looking back      with a mixture of anxiety on the omissions by which i am sensible i      may since have hazarded the diminution of your esteem all my      letters addressed to your honorable court and to the secret      committee repeat the strongest promises of prosecuting the      inquiries into the conduct of your servants which you have been      pleased to commit particularly to my charge you will readily      perceive that i must have been sincere in those declarations since      it would have argued great indiscretion to have made them had i      foreseen my inability to perform them i find myself now under the      disagreeable necessity of avowing that inability at the same time      i will boldly take upon me to affirm that on whomsoever you might      have delegated that charge and by whatever powers it might have      been accompanied it would have been sufficient to occupy the      entire attention of those who were intrusted with it and even      with all the aids of leisure and authority would have proved      ineffectual i dare appeal to the public records to the testimony      of those who have opportunities of knowing me and even to the      detail which the public voice can report of the past acts of this      government that my time has been neither idly nor uselessly      employed yet such are the cares and embarrassments of this various      state that although much may be done much more even in matters      of moment must necessarily remain neglected to select from the      miscellaneous heap which each days exigencies present to our      choice those points on which the general welfare of your affairs      most essentially depends to provide expedients for future      advantages and guard against probable evils are all that your      administration can faithfully promise to perform for your service      with their united labors most diligently exerted they cannot look      back without sacrificing the objects of their immediate duty which      are those of your interest to endless researches which can      produce no real good and may expose your affairs to all the      ruinous consequences of personal malevolence both here and at      home  my lords you see here that after admitting that he has promised to the court of directors to do what they ordered him to do and he had promised to make a radical reform in their whole service and to cure those abuses which they have stated he declares that he will not execute them he pleads a variety of other occupations but as to that great fundamental grievance he was appointed to eradicate he declares he will not even attempt it why did you promiseit naturally occurs to ask him that question why says he you will readily perceive that i must have been sincere in those declarations since it would have argued great indiscretion to have made them had i known my inability to perform them this is a kind of argument that belongs to mr hastings exclusively most other people would say you may judge of the sincerity of my promises by my zeal in the performance but he says you may judge of the sincerity of my promises because i would not promise if i had not thought i should be able to perform it runs in this ridiculous circle i promised to obey the court of directors therefore i knew that i could obey them but i could not obey them therefore i was absolved from my promise and did not attempt to obey them in fact there is not so much as one grievance or abuse in the country that he reformed and this was systematical in mr hastingss conductthat he was resolved to connive at the whole of the iniquities of the service because he was resolved that every one of those existing iniquities should be practised by himself but says he the reformation required can produce no real good and may expose your affairs to all the ruinous consequences of personal malevolence both here and at home this he gives you as a reason why he will not prosecute the inquiry into abuses abroadbecause he is afraid that you should punish him at home for doing his duty abroadthat it will expose him to malevolence at home and therefore to avoid being subject to malevolence at home he would not do his duty abroad  he follows this with something that is perfectly extraordinary he desires instead of doing his duty which he declares it is impossible to do that he may be invested with an arbitrary power i refer your lordships to pages 2827 2828 and 2829 of the printed minutes where you will find the system of his government to be formed upon a resolution not to use any one legal means of punishing corruption or for the prevention of corruption all that he desires is to have an absolute arbitrary power over the servants of the company there you will see that arbitrary power for corrupt purposes over the servants of the company is the foundation of every part of his whole conduct remark what he says here and then judge whether these inferences are to be eluded by any chicane       in the charge of oppression although supported by the cries of      the people and the most authentic representations it is yet      impossible in most cases to obtain legal proofs of it and unless      the discretionary power which i have recommended be somewhere      lodged the assurance of impunity from any formal inquiry will      baffle every order of the board as on the other hand the fear of      the consequences will restrain every man within the bounds of his      duty if he knows himself liable to suffer by the effects of a      single control  my lords you see two things most material for you to consider in the judgment of this great cause which is the cause of nations the first thing for you to consider is the declaration of the culprit at your bar that a person may be pursued by the cries of a whole peoplethat documents the most authentic and satisfactory but deficient in technical form may be produced against himin short that he may be guilty of the most enormous crimesand yet that legal proofs may be wanting this shows you how seriously you ought to consider before you reject any proof upon the idea that it is not technical legal proof to this assertion of mr hastings i oppose however the opinion of a gentleman who sits near his side mr sumner which is much more probable  mr hastings says that the power of the council is not effectual against the inferior servants that it is too weak to coerce them with much more truth mr sumner has said in his minute you might easily coerce the inferior servants but that the dread of falling upon persons in high stations discourages and puts an end to complaint i quote the recorded authority of the gentleman near him as being of great weight in the affairs of the company to prove what is infinitely more probable the falsehood of mr hastingss assertion that an inferior servant cannot be coerced and that they must riot with impunity in the spoils of the people  but we will go to a much more serious part of the business after desiring arbitrary power in this letter he desires a perpetuation of it and here he has given you a description of a bad governor to which i must call your attention as your lordships will find it in every part of his proceeding to be exactly applicable to himself and to his own government       the first command of a state so extensive as that of bengal is not      without opportunities of private emoluments and although the      allowance which your bounty has liberally provided for your      servants may be reasonably expected to fix the bounds of their      desires yet you will find it extremely difficult to restrain men      from profiting by other means who look upon their appointment as      the measure of a day and who from the uncertainty of their      condition see no room for any acquisition but of wealth since      reputation and the consequences which follow the successful conduct      of great affairs are only to be attained in a course of years      under such circumstances however rigid your orders may be or      however supported i am afraid that in most instances they will      produce no other fruits than either avowed disobedience or the      worst extreme of falsehood and hypocrisy these are not the      principles which should rule the conduct of men whom you have      constituted the guardians of your property and checks on the      morals and fidelity of others the care of selfpreservation will      naturally suggest the necessity of seizing the opportunity of      present power when the duration of it is considered as limited to      the usual term of three years and of applying it to the provision      of a future independency therefore every renewal of this term is      liable to prove a reiterated oppression it is perhaps owing to the      causes which i have described and a proof of their existence that      this appointment has been for some years past so eagerly solicited      and so easily resigned there are yet other inconveniences      attendant on this habit and perhaps an investigation of them all      would lead to endless discoveries every man whom your choice has      honored with so distinguished a trust seeks to merit approbation      and acquire an éclat by innovations for which the wild scene      before him affords ample and justifiable occasion  you see my lords he has stated that if a governor is appointed to hold his office only for a short time the consequence would be either an avowed disobedience or what is worse extreme falsehood and hypocrisy your lordships know that this man has held his office for a long time and yet his disobedience has been avowed and his hypocrisy and his falsehood have been discovered and have been proved to your lordships in the course of this trial you see this man has declared what are the principles which should rule the conduct of men whom you have constituted the guardians of your property and checks upon the morals and fidelity of others mr hastings tells you himself directly what his duty was he tells you himself and he pronounces his own condemnation what was expected from him namely that he should give a great example himself and be a check and guardian of the fidelity of all that are under him he declares at the end of this letter that a very short continuance in their service would enable him to make a fortune up to the height of his desire he has since thought proper to declare to you that he is a beggar and undone notwithstanding all his irregular resources in that very service  i have read this letter to your lordships that you may contrast it with the conduct of the prisoner as stated by us and proved by the evidence we have adduced we have stated and proved that mr hastings did enter upon a systematic connivance at the peculation of the companys servants that he refused to institute any check whatever for the purpose of preventing corruption and that he carried into execution no one measure of government agreeably to the positive and solemn engagements into which he had entered with the directors we therefore charge him not only with his own corruptions but with a systematic premeditated corruption of the whole service from the time when he was appointed in the beginning of the year 1772 down to the year 1785 when he left it he never attempted to detect any one single abuse whatever he never endeavored once to put a stop to any corruption in any man black or white in any way whatever and thus he has acted in a government of which he himself declares the nature to be such that it is almost impossible so to detect misconduct as to give legal evidence of it though a man should be declared by the cries of the whole people to be guilty  my lords he desires an arbitrary power over the companys servants to be given to him god forbid arbitrary power should be given into the hands of any man at the same time god forbid if by power be meant the ability to discover to reach to check and to punish subordinate corruption that he should not be enabled so to do and to get at to prosecute and punish delinquency by law but honesty only and not arbitrary power is necessary for that purpose we well know indeed that a government requiring arbitrary power has been the situation in which this man has attempted to place us  we know also my lords that there are cases in which the act of the delinquent may be of consequence while the example of the criminal from the obscurity of his situation is of little importance in other cases the act of the delinquent may be of no great importance but the consequences of the example dreadful we know that crimes of great magnitude that acts of great tyranny can but seldom be exercised and only by a few persons they are privileged crimes they are the dreadful prerogatives of greatness and of the highest situations only but when a governorgeneral descends into the muck and filth of peculation and corruption when he receives bribes and extorts money he does acts that are imitable by everybody there is not a single man black or white from the highest to the lowest that is possessed in the smallest degree of momentary authority that cannot imitate the acts of such a governorgeneral consider then what the consequences will be when it is laid down as a principle of the service that no man is to be called to account according to the existing laws and that you must either give as he says arbitrary power or suffer your government to be destroyed  we asked mr anderson whether the covenant of every farmer of the revenue did not forbid him from giving any presents to any persons or taking any he answered he did not exactly remember for the memory of this gentleman is very indifferent though the matter was in his own particular province but he thought it did and he referred us to the record of it i cannot get at the record and therefore you must take it as it stands from mr anderson without a reference to the recordthat the farmers were forbidden to take or give any money to any person whatever beyond their engagements now if a governorgeneral comes to that farmer and says you must give a certain sum beyond your engagements he lets him loose to prey upon the landholders and cultivators and thus a way is prepared for the final desolation of the whole country by the malversation of the governor and by the consequent oppressive conduct of the farmers  mr hastings being now put over the whole country to regulate it let us see what he has done he says let me have an arbitrary power and i will regulate it he assumed arbitrary power and turned in and out every servant at his pleasure but did he by that arbitrary power correct any one corruption indeed how could he he does not say he did for when a man gives ill examples in himself when he cannot set on foot an inquiry that does not terminate in his own corruption of course he cannot institute any inquiry into the corruption of the other servants  but again my lords the subordinate servant will say i cannot rise properly here as mr hastings has well observed to the height of greatness power distinction rank or honor in the government but i can make my fortune according to my degree my measure and my place his views will be then directed so to make it and when he sees that the governorgeneral is actuated by no other viewswhen he himself as a farmer is confidently assured of the corruptions of his superiorwhen he knows it to be laid down as a principle by the governorgeneral that no corruption is to be inquired into and that if it be not expressly laid down yet that his conduct is such as to make it the same as if he had actually so laid it downthen i say every part of the service is instantly and totally corrupted                                       i shall next refer your lordships to the article of contracts five contracts have been laid before you the extravagant and corrupt profits of which have been proved to amount to 500000l we have shown you by the strongest presumptive evidence that these contracts were given for the purpose of corrupting the companys servants in india and of corrupting the company itself in england you will recollect that 40000l was given in one morning for a contract which the contractor was never to execute i speak of mr sulivans contract you will also recollect that he was the son of the principal person in the indian direction and who in or out of office was known to govern it and to be supported by the whole indian interest of mr hastings you have seen the corruption of sir eyre coote in giving to mr croftes the bullock contract you have seen the bullock contracts stated to mr hastingss face and not denied to have been made for concealing a number of corrupt interests you have seen mr auriols contract given to the secretary of the company by mr hastings in order that he might have the whole records and registers of the company under his control you have seen that the contract and commission for the purchase of stores and provisions an enormous job was given to mr belli an obscure man for whom mr hastings offers himself as security under circumstances that went to prove that mr belli held this commission for mr hastings these my lords are things that cannot be slurred over the governorgeneral is corrupt he corrupts all about him he does it upon system he will make no inquiry  my lords i have stated the amount of the sums which he has squandered away in these contracts but you will observe that we have brought forward but five of them good god when you consider the magnitude and multiplicity of the companys dealings judge you what must be the enormous mass of that corruption of which he has been the cause and in the profits of which he has partaken when your lordships shall have considered this document his defence which i have read in part to you see whether you are not bound when he imputes to us and throws upon us the cause of all his corruption to throw back the charge by your decision and hurl it with indignation upon himself  but there is another shameless and most iniquitous circumstance which i have forgotten to mention respecting these contracts he not only considered them as means of present power and therefore protected his favorites without the least inquiry into their conduct and with flagrant suspicion of a corrupt participation in their delinquency but he goes still farther he declares that if he should be removed from his government he will give them a lease in these exorbitant profits for the purpose of securing a corrupt party to support and bear him out by their evidence upon the event of any inquiry into his conductto give him a razinama to give him a flourishing character whenever he should come upon his trial hear what his principles are hear what the man himself avows          fort william october 4 1779       in answer to mr franciss insinuation that it is natural enough      for the agent to wish to secure himself before the expiration of      the present government i avow the fact as to myself as well as the      agent when i see a systematic opposition to every measure proposed      by me for the service of the public by which an individual may      eventually benefit i cannot hesitate a moment to declare it to be      my firm belief that should the government of this country be      placed in the hands of the present minority they would seek the      ruin of every man connected with me it is therefore only an act      of common justice in me to wish to secure them as far as i legally      can from the apprehension of future oppression  here is the principle avowed he takes for granted and he gives it the name of oppression that the person who should succeed him would take away those unlawful and wicked emoluments and give them to some other but says he i will put out of the companys power the very means of redress  the document which i am now going to read to your lordships contains a declaration by mr hastings of another mean which he used of corrupting the whole companys service        minute of the governorgeneralextract from that minute       called upon continually by persons of high rank and station both      in national and in the companys councils to protect and prefer      their friends in the army and by the merits and services which      have come under my personal knowledge and observation i suffer      both pain and humiliation at the want of power to reward the      meritorious or to show a proper attention to the wishes of my      superiors without having recourse to means which must be      considered as incompatible with the dignity of my station the      slender relief which i entreat of the board from this state of      mortification is the authority to augment the number of my staff      which will enable me to show a marked and particular attention in      circumstances such as above stated and will be no considerable      burden to the company  my lords you here see what he has been endeavoring to effect for the express purpose of enabling him to secure himself a corrupt influence in england but there is another point much more material which brings the matter directly home to this court and puts it to you either to punish him or to declare yourselves to be accomplices in the corruption of the whole service hear what the man himself says i am first to mention to your lordships the occasion upon which the passage which i shall read to you was written it was when he was making his enormous and shameful establishment of a revenue board in the year 1781of which i shall say a few words hereafter as being a gross abuse in itself he then felt that the world would be so much shocked at the enormous prodigality and corrupt profusion of what he was doing that he at last spoke out plainly        a minute of mr hastings transmitted in a letter by mr wheler       in this as it must be the case in every reformation the interest      of individuals has been our principal if not our only impediment      we could not at once deprive so large a body of our fellowservants      of their bread without feeling that reluctance which humanity must      dictatenot unaccompanied perhaps with some concern for the      consequence which our own credit might suffer by an act which      involved the fortunes of many and extended its influence to all      their connections this added to the justice which was due to your      servants who were removed for no fault of theirs but for the      public convenience induced us to continue their allowances until      other offices could be provided for them and the more cheerfully      to submit to the expediency of leaving others in a temporary or      partial charge of the internal collections in effect the civil      officers offices of this government might be reduced to a very      scanty number were their exigency alone to determine the list of      your covenanted servants which at this time consist of no less a      number than two hundred and fiftytwomany of them the sons of      the first families in the kingdom of great britain and every one      aspiring to the rapid acquisition of lacs and to return to pass      the prime of their lives at home as multitudes have done before      them neither will the revenues of this country suffice for such      boundless pretensions nor are they compatible with yours and the      national interests which may eventually suffer as certain a ruin      from the effects of private competition and the claims of patronage      as from the more dreaded calamities of war or the other ordinary      causes which lead to the decline of dominion  my lords you have here his declaration that patronage which he avows to be one of the principles of his government and to be the principle of the last of his acts is worse than war pestilence and famineand that all these calamities together might not be so effectual as this patronage in wasting and destroying the country and at what time does he tell you this he tells it you when he himself had just wantonly destroyed an old regular establishment for the purpose of creating a new one in which he says he was under the necessity of pensioning the members of the old establishment from motives of mere humanity he here confesses himself to be the author of the whole mischief i could says he have acted better i might have avoided desolating the country by peculation but says he i had sons of the first families in the kingdom of great britain every one aspiring to the rapid acquisition of lacs and this would not suffer me to do my duty i hope your lordships will stigmatize the falsehood of this assertion consider my lords what he has saidtwo hundred and fifty men at once and in succession aspiring to come home in the prime of their youth with lacs you cannot take lacs to be less than two we cannot make a plural less than two two lacs make 20000l then multiply that by 252 and you will find more than 2500000l to be provided for that set of gentlemen and for the claims of patronage undoubtedly such a patronage is worse than the most dreadful calamities of war and all the other causes which lead to decline of dominion  my lords i beseech you to consider this plan of corrupting the companys servants beginning with systematical corruption and ending with an avowed declaration that he will persist in this iniquitous proceeding and to the utmost of his power entail it upon the company for the purpose of securing his accomplices against all the consequences of any change in the companys government i dare not says he be honest if i make their fortunes you will judge favorably of me if i do not make their fortunes i shall find myself crushed with a load of reproach and obloquy from which i cannot escape in any other way than by bribing the house of peers what a shameful avowal this to be made in the face of the world your lordships judgment upon this great cause will obliterate it from the memory of man  but his apprehension of some change in the companys government is not his only pretext for some of these corrupt proceedings he adverts also to the opposition which he had to encounter with his colleagues as another circumstance which drove him to adopt others of these scandalous expediences now there was a period when he had no longer to contend with or to fear that opposition  when he had got rid of the majority in the council which thwarted him what did he do did he himself correct any of the evils and disorders which had prevailed in the service and which his hostile majority had purposed to reform no not onenotwithstanding the court of directors had supported the majority in all their declarations and had accused him of corruption and rebellion in every part of his opposition to them now that he was free from the yoke of all the mischief of that cursed majority which he deprecates and which i have heard certain persons consider as a great calamity a calamity indeed it was to patronageas soon i say as he was free from this you would imagine he had undertaken some great and capital reformation for all the power which the company could give was in his handstotal absolute and unconfined  i must here remind your lordships that the provincial councils was an establishment made by mr hastings so confident was he in his own opinion of the expediency of them that he transmitted to the court of directors a draught of an act of parliament to confirm them by this act it was his intention to place them beyond the possibility of mutation whatever opinion others might entertain of their weakness inefficacy or other defects mr hastings found no such things in them he had declared in the beginning that he considered them as a sort of experiment but that in the progress he found them answer so perfectly well that he proposed even an act of parliament to support them the court of directors knowing the mischiefs that innovation had produced in their service and the desolations which it had brought on the country commanded him not to take any step for changing them without their orders contrary however to his own declarations contrary to the sketch of an act of parliament which for aught he knew the legislature might then have passed i know that it was in contemplation to pass about that time several acts for regulating the companys affairs and for one i should have been as i always have been a good deal concerned in whatever tended to fix some kind of permanent and settled government in bengalin violation i say of his duty and in contradiction to his own opinion he at that time without giving the parties notice turns out of their employments situations and bread the provincial councils  and who were the members of those provincial councils they were of high rank in the companys service they were not junior servants boys of a day but persons who had gone through some probation who knew something of the country who were conversant in its revenues and in the course of its business they were in short men of considerable rank in the companys service what did he do with these people without any regard to their rank in the serviceno more than he had regarded the rank of the nobility of the countryhe sweeps them all in one day from their independent situations without reference to the directors and turns them all into pensioners upon the company and for what purpose was this done it was done in order to reduce the companys servants who in their independent situations were too great a mass and volume for him to corrupt to an abject dependence upon his absolute power it was that he might tell them you have lost your situations you have nothing but small alimentary pensions nothing more than a maintenance and you must depend upon me whether you are to have anything more or not thus at one stroke a large division of the companys servants and one of the highest orders of them were reduced for their next bread to an absolute submissive dependence upon his will and the company was loaded with the pensions of all these discarded servants thus were persons in an honorable independent situation earned by long service in that country and who were subject to punishment for their crimes if proved against them all deprived unheard of their employments you would imagine that mr hastings had at least charged them with corruption no you will see upon your minutes that when he abolished the provincial councils he declared at the same time that he found no fault with the persons concerned in them  thus then he has got rid as your lordships see of one whole body of the companys servants he has systematically corrupted the rest and provided as far as lay in his power for the perpetuation of their corruption he has connived at all their delinquencies and has destroyed the independence of all the superior orders of them  now hear what he does with regard to the councilgeneral itself they had by the act that made mr hastings governor the management of the revenues vested in them you have been shown by an honorable and able fellow manager of mine that he took the business of this department wholly out of the hand of the council that he named a committee for the management of it at an enormous expensecommittee made up of his own creatures and dependants and that after destroying the provincial councils he brought down the whole management of the revenue to calcutta this committee took this important business entirely out of the hands of the council in which the act had vested it and this committee he formed without the orders of the court of directors and directly contrary to the act which put the superintendence in the hands of the council  oh but he reserved a superintendence over themyou shall hear what the superintendence was you shall see feel smell touch it shall enter into every avenue and pore of your soul it will show you what was the real principle of mr hastingss government we will read to you what sir john shore says of that institution and of the only ends and purposes which it could answer your lordships will then see how far he was justifiable in violating an act of parliament and giving out of the councils hands the great trust which the laws of his country had vested in them it is part of a paper written in 1785 by mr shore who was sole acting president of this committee to which all bengal was delivered he was an old servant of the company and he is now at the head of the government of that country he was mr hastingss particular friend and therefore you cannot doubt either of his being a competent evidence or that he is a favorable evidence for mr hastings and that he would not say one word against the establishment of which he himself was at the head that was not perfectly true and forced out of him by the truth of the case there is not a single part of it that does not point out some abuse       in the actual collection of the revenues nothing is more      necessary than to give immediate attention to all complaints which      are preferred daily without number and to dispatch them in a      summary manner this cannot be done where the control is remote in      every purgunnah throughout bengal there are some distinct usages      which cannot be clearly known at a distance yet in all complaints      of oppression or extortion these must be known before a decision      can be pronounced but to learn at calcutta the particular customs      of a district of rajeshahye or dacca is almost impossible and      considering the channel through which an explanation must pass and      through which the complaint is made any coloring may be given to      it and oppression and extortion to the ruin of a district may be      practised with impunity this is a continual source of      embarrassment to the committee of revenue in calcutta       one object of their institution was to bring the revenues without      the expenses of agency to the presidency and to remove all local      control over the farmers who were to pay their rents at calcutta      when complaints are made against farmers by the occupiers of the      lands it is almost impossible to discriminate truth from      falsehood but to prevent a failure in the revenue it is found      necessary in all doubtful cases to support the farmera      circumstance which may give rise to and confirm the most cruel acts      of oppression the real state of any district cannot be known by      the committee an occupier or zemindar may plead that an      inundation has ruined him or that his country is a desert through      want of rain an aumeen is sent to examine the complaint he      returns with an exaggerated account of losses proved in volumes of      intricate accounts which the committee have no time to read and      for which the aumeen is well paid possibly however the whole      account is false suppose no aumeen is employed and the renter is      held to the tenor of his engagement the loss if real must      occasion his ruin unless his assessment is very moderate indeed       i may venture to pronounce that the real state of the districts is      now less known and the revenue less understood than in the year      1774 since the natives have had the disposal of accounts since      they have been introduced as agents and trusted with authority      intricacy and confusion have taken place the records and accounts      which have been compiled are numerous yet when any particular      account is wanted it cannot be found it is the business of all      from the ryots to the dewan to conceal and deceive the simplest      matters of fact are designedly covered with a veil through which no      human understanding can penetrate       with respect to the present committee of revenue it is morally      impossible for them to execute the business they are intrusted      with they are invested with a general control and they have an      executive authority larger than ever was before given to any board      or body of men they may and must get through the business but to      pretend to assert that they really execute it would be folly and      falsehood       the grand object of the native dewannies was to acquire      independent control and for many years they have pursued this      with wonderful art the farmers and zemindars under the committee      prosecute the same plan and have already objections to anything      that has the least appearance of restriction all control removed      they can plunder as they please       the committee must have a dewan or executive officer call him by      what name you please this man in fact has all the revenues paid      at the presidency at his disposal and can if he has any      abilities bring all the renters under contribution it is of      little advantage to restrain the committee themselves from bribery      or corruption when their executive officer has the power of      protecting practising both undetected       to display the arts employed by a native on such an occasion would      fill a volume he discovers the secret resources of the zemindars      and renters their enemies and competitors and by the engines of      hope and fear raised upon these foundations he can work them to his      purpose the committee with the best intentions best abilities      and steadiest application must after all be a tool in the hand      of their dewan  here is the account of mr hastingss new committee of revenue substituted in the place of an establishment made by act of parliament here is what he has substituted for provincial councils here is what he has substituted in the room of the whole regular order of the service which he totally subverted can we add anything to this picture can we heighten it can we do anything more than to recommend it to your lordships serious consideration  but before i finally dismiss this part of our charge i must request your lordships most earnest attention to the true character of these atrocious proceedings as they now stand proved before you by direct or the strongest presumptive evidence upon the companys records and by his own confessions and declarations and those of his most intimate friends and avowed agents  your lordships will recollect that previously to the appointment of mr hastings to be the governorgeneral in 1772 the collection of the revenues was committed to a naib dewan or native collector under the control of the supreme counciland that mr hastings did at that time and upon various occasions afterwards declare it to be his decided and fixed opinion that nothing would be so detrimental to the interests of the company and to the happiness and welfare of the inhabitants of their provinces as changes and more especially sudden changes in the collection of their revenues his opinion was also most strongly and reiteratedly pressed upon him by his masters the court of directors the first step taken after his appointment was to abolish the office of naib dewan and to send a committee through the provinces at the expense of 50000l a year to make a settlement of rents to be paid by the natives for five years at the same time he appointed one of the companys servants to be the collector in each province and he abolished the general board of revenue which had been established at moorshedabad chiefly for the following reasons that by its exercising a separate control the members of the supreme council at calcutta were prevented from acquiring that intimate acquaintance with the revenues which was necessary to persons in their station and because many of the powers necessary for the collection of the revenues could not be delegated to a subordinate council in consideration of these opinions orders and declarations he in 1773 abolished the office of collector and transferred the management of the revenues to several councils of revenue called provincial councils and recommended their perpetual establishment by act of parliament in the year 1774 in contradiction of his former opinion respecting the necessity of the supreme council possessing all possible means of becoming acquainted with the details of the revenue he again recommended the continuance of the provincial councils in all their parts this he again declared to be his deliberate opinion in 1775 and in 1776  in the mean time a majority of the supreme council consisting of members who had generally differed in opinion from mr hastings had transmitted their advice to the court of directors recommending some changes in the system of provincial councils the directors in their reply to this recommendation did in 1777 order the supreme council to form a new plan for the collection of the revenues and to transmit it to them for their consideration  no such plan was transmitted but in the year 1781 mr hastings having obtained a majority in the council he again changed the whole system both of collection of the revenue and of the executive administration of civil and criminal justice and who were the persons substituted in the place of those whom he removed names my lords with which you are already but too well acquainted at their head stands munny begum then comes his own domestic and private bribeagent gunga govind sing then his banian cantoo baboo then that instrument of all evil debi sing then the whole tribe of his dependants white and black whom he made farmers of the revenue with colonel hannay at their head and lastly his confidential residents secret agents and private secretaries mr middleton major palmer c c can your lordships doubt for a single instant of the real spirit of these proceedings can you doubt of the whole design having originated and ended in corruption and peculation  we have fully stated to you from the authority of these parties themselves the effects and consequences of these proceedingsnamely the dilapidation of the revenues and the ruin and desolation of the provinces and my lords what else could have been expected or designed by this sweeping subversion of the control of the companys servants over the collections of the revenue and the vesting of it in a black dewan but fraud and peculation what else i say was to be expected in the inextricable turnings and windings of that black mystery of iniquity but the concealment of every species of wrong violence outrage and oppression  your lordships then have seen that the whole country was put into the hands of gunga govind sing and when you remember who this gunga govind sing was and how effectually mr hastings had secured him against detection in every part of his malpractices and atrocities can you for a moment hesitate to believe that the whole project was planned and executed for the purpose of putting all bengal under contribution to mr hastings but if you are resolved after all this to entertain a good opinion of mr hastingsif you have taken it into your heads for reasons best known to yourselves to imagine that he has some hidden virtues which in the government of bengal he has not displayed and which to us of the house of commons have not been discernible in any one single instancethese virtues may be fit subjects for paragraphs in newspapers they may be pleaded for him by the partisans of his indian faction but your lordships will do well to remember that it is not to mr hastings himself that you are trusting but to gunga govind sing if the committee were tools in his hands must not mr hastings have also been a tool in his hands if they with whom he daily and hourly had to transact business and whose office it was to control and restrain him were unable so to do is this control and restraint to be expected from mr hastings who was his confidant and whose corrupt transactions he could at any time discover to the world my worthy colleague has traced the whole of mr hastingss bribe account in the most clear and satisfactory manner to gunga govind singhim first him last him midst and without end if we fail of the conviction of the prisoner at your bar your lordships will not have acquitted mr hastings merely but you will confirm all the robberies and rapines of gunga govind sing you will recognize him as a faithful governor of india yes my lords let us rejoice in this man let us adopt him as our own let our country let this house be proud of him if mr hastings can be acquitted we must admit gunga govind sings government to be the greatest blessing that ever happened to mankind but if gunga govind sings government be the greatest curse that ever befell suffering humanity as we assert it to have been there is the man that placed him in it there is his father his godfather the first author and origin of all these evils and calamities my lords remember dinagepore remember the bribe of 40000l which gunga govind sing procured for mr hastings in that province and the subsequent horror of that scene  but my lords do you extend your confidence to gunga govind sing not even the face of this man to whom the revenues of the company together with the estates fortunes reputations and lives of the inhabitants of that country were delivered over is known in those provinces he resides at calcutta and is represented by a variety of underagents do you know govind ghose do you know nundulol do you know the whole tribe of peculators whom mr hastings calls his faithful domestic servants do you know all the persons that gunga govind sing must employ in the various ramifications of the revenues throughout all the provinces are you prepared to trust all these the board of revenue has confessed that it could not control them mr hastings himself could not control them the establishment of this system was like sins opening the gates of hell like her he could open the gatebut to shut as milton says exceeded his power the former establishments if defective or if abuses were found in them might have been corrected there was at least the means of detecting and punishing abuse but mr hastings destroyed the means of doing either by putting the whole country into the hands of gunga govind sing  now having seen all these things done look to the account your lordships will now be pleased to look at this business as a mere account of revenue you will find on comparing the three years in which mr hastings was in the minority with the three years after the appointment of this committee that the assessment upon the country increased but that the revenue was diminished and you will also find which is a matter that ought to astonish you that the expenses of the collections were increased by no less a sum than 500000l you may judge from this what riot there was in rapacity and ravage both amongst the european and native agents but chiefly amongst the natives for mr hastings did not divide the greatest part of this spoil among the companys servants but among this gang of black dependants these accounts are in pages 1273 and 1274 of your minutes  my lords weighty indeed would have been the charge brought before your lordships by the commons of great britain against the prisoner at your bar if they had fixed upon no other crime or misdemeanor than that which i am now pressing upon youhis throwing off the allegiance of the company his putting a black master over himself and his subjecting the whole of bengal bahar and orissa the whole of the companys servants the companys revenues the companys farms to gunga govind sing but my lords it is a very curious and remarkable thing that we have traced this man as mr hastingss bribebroker up to the time of the nomination of this committee we have traced him through a regular series of bribery he is mr hastingss bribebroker at patna he is mr hastingss bribebroker at nuddea he is his bribebroker at dinagepore we find him his bribebroker in all these places but from the moment that this committee was constituted it became a gulf in which the prevention the detection and the correction of all kind of abuses were sunk and lost forever from the time when this committee and gunga govind sing were appointed you do not find one word more of mr hastingss bribes had he then ceased to receive any or where are you to look for them you are to look for them in that 500000l excess of expense in the revenue department and in the rest of all that corrupt traffic of gunga govind sing of which we gave you specimens at the time we proved his known bribes to you these are nothing but indexhands to point out to you the immense mass of corruption which had its origin and was daily accumulating in these provinces under the protection of mr hastings and can you think and can we talk of such transactions without feeling emotions of indignation and horror not to be described can we contemplate such scenes as thesecan we look upon those desolated provinces upon a country so ravaged a people so subduedmahometans gentoos our own countrymen all trampled under foot by this tyrantcan we do this without giving expression to those feelings which after animating us in this life will comfort us when we die and will form our best part in another  my lords i am now at the last day of my endeavors to inspire your lordships with a just sense of these unexampled atrocities i have had a great encyclopedia of crimes to deal with i will get through them as soon as i can and i pray your lordships to believe that if i omit anything it is to time i sacrifice itthat it is to want of strength i sacrifice itthat it is to necessity and not from any despair of making from the records and from the evidence matter so omitted as black as anything that i have yet brought before you  the next thing of which i have to remind your lordships respecting these black agents of the prisoner is that we find him just before his departure from india recommending three of them gunga govind sing gunga ghose and nundulol as persons fit and necessary to be rewarded for their services by the company now your lordships will find that of these faithful domestic servants there is not one of them who was not concerned in these enormous briberies and in betraying their own native and natural master if i had time for it i believe i could trace every person to be in proportion to mr hastingss confidence in him the author of some great villany these persons he thinks had not been sufficiently rewarded and accordingly he recommends to the board as his dying legacy provision for these faithful attached servants of his and particularly for gunga govind sing the manner in which this man was to be rewarded makes a part of the history of these transactions as curious perhaps as was ever exhibited to the world your lordships will find it in page 2841 of your minutes  the rajah of dinagepore was a child at that time about eleven years old and had succeeded to the rajahship by what means i shall say nothing when he was about five years old he is made to apply to mr hastings for leave to grant a very considerable part of his estate to gunga govind sing as a reward for his services these services could only be known to the rajahs family by having robbed it of at least 40000l the bribe given to mr hastings but the rajahs family is so little satisfied with this bountiful and liberal donation to gunga govind sing that they desire that several purgunnahs or farms that are mentioned in the application made to the council should be separated from the family estate and given to this man such was this extraordinary gratitude gratitude not for money received but for money taken awaya species of gratitude unknown in any part of the world but in india gratitude pervading every branch of the family his mother coming forward and petitioning likewise that her son should be disinherited his uncle the natural protector and guardian of his minority coming forward and petitioning most earnestly that his nephew should be disinherited all the family join in one voice of supplication to mr hastings that gunga govind sing may have a very large and considerable part of their family estate given to him mr hastings after declaring that certain circumstances respecting this property which are mentioned in his minutes were to his knowledge true but which your lordships upon examination will find to be false and falsified in every particular recommends in the strongest manner to the board a compliance with this application he was at this time on the eve of his departure from india in haste to provide for his faithful servants and he well knew that this his last act would be held binding upon his successors who were devoted to him  here indeed is genuine and heroic gratitudegratitude for money received not for money taken away and yet this gratitude was towards a person who had paid himself out of the benefit which had been conferred at the expense of a third party for gunga govind sing had kept for himself 20000l out of 40000l taken from the rajah for this cheat stated by mr larkins to be such and allowed by mr hastings himself to be such he with a perfect knowledge of that fraud and cheat committed upon the public for he pretends that the money was meant for the company makes this supplication to his colleagues and departs  after his departure gunga govind sing relying upon the continuance of the corrupt influence which he had gained had the impudence to come forward and demand the confirmation of this grant by the councilgeneral the council though willing to accede to mr hastingss proposition were stopped in a moment by petitions much more natural but of a direct contrary tenor the poor infant rajah raises his cries not to be deprived of his inheritance his mother comes forward and conjures the council not to oppress her son and wrong her family the uncle comes and supplicates the board to save from ruin these devoted victims which were under his protection all these counterpetitions come before the council while the ink is hardly dry upon the petitions which mr hastings had left behind him as proofs of the desire of this family to be disinherited in favor of gunga govind sing upon the receipt of these remonstrances the board could not proceed in the business and accordingly gunga govind sing was defeated  but gunga govind sing was unwilling to quit his prey and what does he do i desire your lordships to consider seriously the reply of gunga govind sing as it appears upon your minutes it is a bold answer he denies the right of the rajah to these estates why says he all property in this country depends upon the will of your government how came this rajahs family into possession of this great zemindary why they got it at first by the mere favor of government the whole was an iniquitous transaction this is a family that in some former age has robbed others and now let me rob them in support of this claim he adds the existence of other precedents namely that many clerks or mutsuddies and banians at calcutta had as he says got possession of the lands of other people without any pretence of rightwhy should not i good god what precedents are these  your lordships shall now hear the razinama or testimonial which since mr hastingss arrival in england this rajah has been induced to send to the company from india and you will judge then of the state in which mr hastings has left that country hearken my lords i pray you to the razinama of this man from whom 40000l was taken by mr hastings and gunga govind sing and against whom an attempt was made by the same persons to deprive him of his inheritance listen to this razinama and then judge of all the other testimonials which have been produced on the part of the prisoner at your bar his counsel rest upon them they glory in them and we shall not abate them one of these precious testimonials they put the voice of grateful india against the voice of ungrateful england now hear what grateful india says after our having told you for what it was so grateful       i radanaut zemindar of purgunnah havelly punjera commonly      called dinageporeas it has been learnt by me the mutsuddies and      respectable officers of my zemindary that the ministers of      england are displeased with the late governor warren hastings      esquire upon the suspicion that he oppressed us took money from      us by deceit and force and ruined the country therefore we upon      the strength of our religion which we think it incumbent on and      necessary for us to abide by following the rules laid down in      giving evidence declare the particulars of the acts and deeds of      warren hastings esquire full of circumspection and caution      civility and justice superior to the conduct of the most learned      and by representing what is fact wipe away the doubts that have      possessed the minds of the ministers of england that mr hastings      is possessed of fidelity and confidence and yielding protection to      us that he is clear from the contamination of mistrust and wrong      and his mind is free of covetousness and avarice during the time      of his administration no one saw other conduct than that of      protection to the husbandmen and justice no inhabitant ever      experienced affliction no one ever felt oppression from him our      reputations have always been guarded from attacks by his prudence      and our families have always been protected by his justice  good god my lords our families protected by his justice what after gunga govind sing in concert with mr hastings had first robbed him of 40000l and then had attempted to snatch as it were out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the inheritance of their fathers and to deprive this infant of a great part of his family estate here is a child eleven years old who never could have seen mr hastings who could know nothing of him but from the heavy hand of oppression affliction wrong and robbery brought to bear testimony to the virtues of mr hastings before a british parliament such is the confidence they repose in their hope of having bribed the english nation by the millions and millions of money the countless lacs of rupees poured into it from india that they had dared to bring this poor robbed infant to bear testimony to the character of mr hastings these are the things which are to be opposed to the mass of evidence which the house of commons bring against this manevidence which they bring from his own acts his own writing and his own recordsa cloud of testimony furnished by himself in support of charges brought forward and urged by us agreeably to the magnitude of his crimes with the horror which is inspired by them and with the contempt due to this paltry attempt towards his defence which they had dared to produce from the hands of an infant but eleven years old when mr hastings quitted that country  but to proceed with the razinama       he never omitted the smallest instance of kindness towards us but      healed the wounds of despair with the salve of consolation by      means of his benevolent and kind behavior never permitting one of      us to sink in the pit of despondence he supported every one by his      goodness overset the designs of evilminded men by his authority      tied the hand of oppression with the strong bandage of justice and      by these means expanded the pleasing appearance of happiness and      joy over us he reëstablished justice and impartiality we were      during his government in the enjoyment of perfect happiness and      ease and many of us are thankful and satisfied as mr hastings      was well acquainted with our manners and customs he was always      desirous in every respect of doing whatever would preserve our      religious rites and guard them against every kind of accident and      injury and at all times protected us whatever we have experienced      from him and whatever happened from him we have written without      deceit or exaggeration  my lords before i take leave of this affair of bribes and of the great bribebroker let me just offer a remark to your lordships upon one curious transaction my lords we have charged a bribe taken from the nabob of oude and we have stated the corrupt and scandalous proceeding which attended it i thought i had done with oude but as there is a golden chain between all the virtues so there is a golden chain which links together all the vices mr hastings as you have seen and as my honorable colleague has fully opened it to you received a bribe or corrupt present from the nabob of oude in september 1781 we heard no more of this bribe than what we had stated no other trace of it ever appearing in the companys records except in a private letter written by mr hastings to the court of directors and afterwards in a communication such as you have heard through mr larkins till october 1783  but my lords we have since discovered through and in consequence of the violent disputes which took place between mr hastings and the clan of residents that were in oudethe resident of the company mr bristow the two residents of mr hastings mr middleton and mr johnson and the two residents sent by him to watch over all the rest major palmer and major davyupon quarrels i say between them we discovered that mr middleton had received the offer of a present of 100000l in february 1782 this circumstance is mentioned in a letter of mr middletons in which he informs mr hastings that the nabob had destined such a sum for him  now the first thing that will occur to your lordships upon such an affair will be a desire to know what it was that induced the nabob to make this offer it was but in the september preceding that mr hastings had received for his private use as the nabob conceived so bountiful a present as 100000l what motive then could he have had in february to offer him another 100000l this man at the time was piercing heaven itself with the cries of despondency despair beggary and ruin you have seen that he was forced to rob his own family in order to satisfy the companys demands upon him and yet this is precisely the time when he thinks proper to offer 100000l to mr hastings does not the mind of every man revolt whilst he exclaims and say what another 100000l to mr hastings what reason had the nabob to think mr hastings so monstrously insatiable that having but the september before received 100000l he must give him another in february my lords he must in the interval have threatened the nabob with some horrible catastrophe from which he was to redeem himself by this second present you can assign no other motive for his giving it we know not what answer mr hastings made to mr middleton upon that occasion but we find that in the year 1783 mr hastings asserts that he sent up major palmer and major davy to persuade the nabob to transfer this present which the nabob intended for him to the companys service remark my lords the progress of this affair in a formal accusation preferred against mr middleton he charges him with obstructing this design of his in this accusation my lords you find him at once in the curious character of prosecutor witness and judge  let us see how he comports himself i shall only state to you one of the articles of his impeachment it is the third charge it is in page 1267 of your lordships minutes       for sending repeatedly to the vizier and to his minister hyder      beg khân to advise them against transferring the ten lacs of      rupees intended as a present to the governorgeneral to the      companys account as it would be a precedent for further demands      which if the vizier did not refuse in the first instance the      government would never cease to harass him for money  the first thing that will occur to your lordships is an assertion of the accusersi am morally certain that jaidads or assets for ten lacs either in assignment of land or in bills had been prepared and were in the charge or possession of mr middleton before major palmers arrival and left with mr johnson on mr middletons departure  my lords here is an accusation that mr middleton had actually received money either in bills or assets of some kind or otherand that upon quitting his residency he had handed it over to his successor mr johnson here are then facts asserted and we must suppose substantiated here is a sum of money to be accounted for in which there is a gross malversation directly charged as to these particulars in mr hastingss opinion mr macpherson another member of the council has declared that he understood at the time that the ten lacs were actually deposited in bills and that it was not a mere offer made by the nabob to pay such a sum from the future revenue of the country mr hastings has these facts disclosed to him he declares that he was morally certain of itthat is as certain as a man can be of anything because physical certitude does not belong to such matters the first thing you will naturally ask is why does he not ask mr johnson how he had disposed of that money which mr middleton had put in his hands he does no such thing he passes over it totally as if it were no part of the matter in question and the accusation against mr middleton terminates in the manner you will there find stated when mr johnson is asked why was not that money applied to the companys service he boldly steps forward and says i prevented it from being so applied it never was it never ought to have been so applied such an appropriation of money to be taken from the nabob would have been enormous upon that occasion  what then does mr hastings do does he examine mr middleton upon the subject who charges himself with having received the money mr middleton was at that very time in calcutta called down thither by mr hastings himself one would naturally expect that he would call upon him to explain for what purpose he left the money with mr johnson he did no such thing did he examine mr johnson himself who was charged with having received the money from mr middleton did he ask him what he had done with that money not one word did he send for major palmer and major davy to account for it no did he call any shroff any banker any one person concerned in the payment of the money or any one person in the management of the revenue no not one directly in the face of his own assertions directly contrary to his moral conviction of the fact that the money had been actually deposited he tries mr johnson collusively and obliquely not upon the account of what was done with the money but why it was prevented from being applied to the companys service and he acquits him in a manner that taking the whole of it together will give your lordships the finest idea possible of a bengal judicature as exercised by mr hastings  i am not sorry says he that mr johnson chose to defeat my intentions since it would have added to the nabobs distresses but with no immediate relief to the company if in his own breast he can view the secret motives of this transaction and on their testimony approve it i also acquit him  merciful god here is a man accused by regular articles of impeachment the accuser declares he is morally certain that the money had been received but was prevented from being applied to its destination by the person accused and he acquits him does he acquit him from his own knowledge or from any evidence no but he applies to the mans conscience and says if you in your conscience can acquit yourself i acquit you  here then is a proceeding the most astonishing and shameless that perhaps was ever witnessed a court trying a man for a delinquency and misapplication of money destined in the first instance for the use of the judge but which he declares ought in his own opinion to be set apart for the public use and which he was desirous of applying to the companys service without regard to his own interest and then the judge declaring he is not sorry that his purpose had been defeated by the party accused instead however of censuring the accused he applies to the mans own conscience does your conscience says he acquit you of having acted wrong the accused makes no reply and then mr hastings by an hypothetical conclusion acquits him  mr hastings is accused by the commons for that having a moral certainty of the moneys being intended for his use he would not have ceased to inquire into the actual application of it but from some corrupt motive and intention with this he is charged he comes before you to make his defence mr middleton is in england does he call mr middleton to explain it here does he call upon mr johnson who was the other day in this court to account for it why did he not when he sent for these curious papers and testimonials to major palmer the person authorized as he pretends by him to resign all his pretensions to the money procured send for major palmer who is the person that accused him in this businesswhy not send for him to bear some testimony respecting it no he had time enough but at no one time and in no place did he do this therefore the imputation of the foulest corruption attaches upon him joined with the infamy of a collusive prosecution instituted for the sake of a collusive acquittal  having explained to your lordships the nature and detailed the circumstances as far as we are acquainted with them of this fraudulent transaction we have only further to remind you that though mr middleton was declared guilty of five of the six charges brought against him by mr hastings yet the next thing you hear is that mr hastings after declaring that this conduct of mr middleton had been very bad and that the conduct of the other servants of the company concerned with him had been ten times worse he directly appoints him to one of the most honorable and confidential offices the company had to dispose of he sends him ambassador to the nizamto give to all the courts of india a specimen of the justice honor and decency of the british government  my lords with regard to the bribe for the entertainment i only beg leave to make one observation to you upon that article i could say if the time would admit it a great deal upon that subject but i wish to compress it and i shall therefore only recommend it in general to your lordships deliberate consideration the covenant subsisting between the company and its servants was made for the express purpose of putting an end to all such entertainments by this convention it is ordered that no presents exceeding 200l 400l shall be accepted upon any pretence for an entertainment the covenant was intended to put an end to the custom of receiving money for entertainments even when visiting an independent oriental prince but your lordships know that the nabob was no prince but a poor miserable undone dependant upon the company the present was also taken by mr hastings at a time when he went upon the cruel commission of cutting down the nabobs allowance from 400000l to 260000l 160000l and when he was reducing to beggary thousands of persons who were dependent for bread upon the nabob and ruining perhaps forty thousand others i shall say no more upon that subject though in truth it is a thing upon which much observation might be made                                       i shall now pass on to another article connected with though not making a direct part of that of corrupt bribery i mean the swindling subterfuges by which he has attempted to justify his corrupt practices at one time he defends them by pleading the necessities of his own affairsas when he takes presents and entertainments avowedly for his own profits at another time he defends them by pleading the goodness of his intentions he intended he says to give the money to the company his last plea has something in it which shall i say of a more awful or of a more abandoned character or of both in the settlement of his public account before he left india he takes credit for a bond which he had received from nobkissin upon some account or other he then returns to england and what does he do pay off no give up the bond to the company no he says i will account to the company for this money and when he comes to give this account of the expenditure of this money your lordships will not be a little astonished at the items of it one is for founding a mahometan college it is a very strange thing that rajah nobkissin who is a gentoo should be employed by mr hastings to found a mahometan college we will allow mr hastings who is a christian or would be thought a christian to grow pious at last and as many others have done who have spent their lives in fraud rapacity and peculation to seek amends and to expiate his crimes by charitable foundations nay we will suppose mr hastings to have taken it into his head to turn mahometan gentoo he could not and to have designed by a mahometan foundation to expiate his offences be it so but why should nobkissin pay for it we will pass over this also but when your lordships shall hear of what nature that foundation was i believe you will allow that a more extraordinary history never did appear in the world  in the first place he stated to the council on the 18th of april 1781 that in the month of november 1780 a petition was presented to him by a considerable number of mussulmen in compliance with which this mahometan college appears to have been founded it next appears from his statement that in the april following that is within about six months after the foundation many students had finished their education you see what a hotbed bribery and corruption is our universities cannot furnish an education in six years in india they have completed it within six months and have taken their degrees  mr hastings says i have supported this establishment to this time at my own expense i desire the company will now defray the charge of it he then calculates what the expenses were he calculates that the building would cost about 6000l and he gets from the company a bond to raise money for paying this 6000l you apparently have the building now at the public expense and mr hastings still stands charged with the expense of the college for six months he then proposes that a tract of land should be given for the college to the value of about three thousand odd pounds a yearand that in the mean time there should be a certain sum allotted for its expenses after this mr hastings writes a letter from the ganges to the company in which he says not a word about the expense of the building but says that the college was founded and maintained at his own expense though it was thought to be maintained by the company and he fixes the commencement of the expense in september 1779 but after all we find that the very professor who was to be settled there never so much as arrived in calcutta or showed his face there till some time afterwards and look at mr larkinss private accounts and you will find that he charges the expense to have commenced not until october 1781 it is no error because it runs through and is so accounted in the whole and it thus appears that he has charged falsely and fraudulently a year more for that establishment than it cost him  at last then when he was coming away for i hasten to the conclusion of an affair ludicrous indeed in some respects but not unworthy of your lordships consideration after remarking that he had experienced for three years the utility of this institution he recommends that they will establish a fund for 3000l a year for it and give it to the master he had left gunga govind sing as a gentoo legacy and he now leaves the mussulman as a mahometan legacy to the company  your lordships shall now hear what was the upshot of the whole the company soon afterwards hearing that this college was become the greatest nuisance in calcutta and that it had raised the cries of all the inhabitants against it one of their servants a mr chapman was deputed by the governor sir john shore to examine into it and your lordships will find the account he gives of it in your minutes in short my lords we find that this was a seminary of robbers housebreakers and every nuisance to society so that the company was obliged to turn out the master and to remodel the whole your lordships will now judge of the merits and value of this one of the setsoff brought forward by the prisoner against the charges which we have brought forward against him it began in injustice and peculation and ended in a seminary for robbers and housebreakers                                       nothing now remains to be pressed by me upon your lordships consideration but the account given by the late governorgeneral earl cornwallis of the state in which he found the country left by his predecessor mr hastings the prisoner at your bar but patient as i know your lordships to be i also know that your strength is not inexhaustible and though what i have farther to add will not consume much of your lordships time yet i conceive that there is a necessity for deferring it to another day     speech  in  general reply  ninth day monday june 16 1794   my lordsi should think it necessary to make an apology to your lordships for appearing before you one day more if i were inclined to measure this business either by the standard of my own ability or by my own impatience or by any supposed impatience of yours i know no measure in such a case but the nature of the subject and the duty which we owe to it you will therefore my lords permit me in a few words to lead you back to what we did yesterday that you may the better comprehend the manner in which i mean to conclude the business today  my lords we took the liberty of stating to you the condition of bengal before our taking possession of it and of the several classes of its inhabitants we first brought before you the mahometan inhabitants who had the judicial authority of the country in their hands and we proved to you the utter ruin of that body of people and with them of the justice of the country by their being both one and the other sold to an infamous woman called munny begum we next showed you that the whole landed interest the zemindars or hindoo gentry of the country was likewise ruined by its being given over by letting it on a five years lease to infamous farmers and giving it up to their merciless exactionsand afterwards by subjecting the rank of those zemindars their titledeeds and all their pecuniary affairs to the minutest scrutiny under pain of criminal punishment by a commission granted to a nefarious villain called gunga govind sing we lastly showed you that the remaining third class that of the english was partly corrupted or had its authority dissolved and that the whole superintending english control was subverted or subduedthat the products of the country were diminished and that the revenues of the company were dilapidated by an overcharge of expenses in four years to the amount of 500000l in consequence of these corrupt dangerous and mischievous projects  we have farther stated that the companys servants were corrupted by contracts and jobs we proved that those that were not so corrupted were removed from their stations or reduced to a state of abject dependence we showed you the destruction of the provincial councils the destruction of the councilgeneral and the formation of a committee for no other ends whatever but for the purposes of bribery concealment and corruption we next stated some of the most monstrous instances of that bribery and though we were of opinion that in none of them any satisfactory defence worth mentioning had been made yet we have thought that this should not hinder us from recalling to your lordships recollection the peculiar nature and circumstances of one of those proceedings  the proceedings to which we wish to call your attention are those belonging to the second bribe given by the nabob of oude to mr hastings mr hastingss own knowledge and opinion that that money was set apart for his use either in bills or assets i have before stated and i now wish to call your lordships minute recollection to the manner in which the fraudulent impeachment of mr middleton for the purpose of stifling an inquiry into that business was carried on your lordships will remember that i proved to you upon the face of that proceeding the collusive nature of the accusation and that the real state of the case was not chargedand that mr hastings acquitted the party accused of one article of the charge not upon the evidence of the case contrary to his own avowed declared moral certainty of his guilt but upon a pretended appeal to the conscience of the man accused he did not however give him a complete formal official acquittal but referred the matter to the court of directors who could not possibly know anything of the matter without one article of evidence whatever produced at the time or transmitted we lastly proved to you that after finding him guilty of five charges and leaving the other to the court of directors mr hastings without any reason assigned appointed him to a great office in the companys service  these proceedings were brought before you for two purposes first to show the corrupt principle of the whole proceeding next to show the manner in which the companys servants are treated they are accused and persecuted until they are brought to submit to whatever terms it may be thought proper to impose upon them they are then formally indeed acquitted of the most atrocious crimes charged against them but virtually condemned upon some articles with the scourge hung over themand in some instances rewarded by the greatest most honorable and most lucrative situations in the companys service my lords it is on the same ground of the wicked pernicious and ruinous principles of mr hastingss government that i have charged this with everything that is chargeable against him namely that if your lordships should ratify those principles by your acquittal of him they become principles of governmentrejected indeed by the commons but adopted by the peerage of great britain  there is another article which i have just touched but which i must do more than barely notice upon account of the evil example of it i mean the taking great sums of money under pretence of an entertainment your lordships will recollect that when this business was charged against him in india mr hastings neither affirmed nor denied the fact confession could not be there extorted from him he next appeared before the house of commons and he still evaded a denial or a confession of it he lastly appeared before your lordships and in his answer to our charge he in the same manner evaded either a confession or a denial he forced us to employ a great part of a session in endeavoring to establish what we have at last established the receipt of the sums first charged and of seven lacs more by him at length the proof could not be evaded and after we had fought through all the difficulties which the law could interpose in his defence and of which he availed himself with a degree of effrontery that has i believe no example in the world he confesses avows and justifies his conduct if the custom alleged be well founded and be an honorable and a proper and just practice why did he not avow it in every part and progress of our proceedings here why should he have put us to the necessity of wasting so many months in the proof of the fact and why after we have proved it and not before did he confess it avow it and even glory in it  i must remind your lordships that the sum charged to be so taken by way of entertainment made only a part a single article of the bribes charged by nundcomar to have been received by mr hastings and when we find him confessing what he could not deny that single article and evading all explanation respecting the others and not giving any reason whatever why one was received and the others rejected your lordships will judge of the strong presumption of his having taken them all even if we had given no other proofs of it we think however that we have proved the whole very satisfactorily but whether we have or not the proof of a single present received is sufficient because the principle to be established respecting these bribes is thiswhether or not a governorgeneral paying a visit to any of the poor miserable dependent creatures called sovereign princes in that country men whom mr hastings has himself declared to be nothing but phantoms and that they had no one attribute of sovereignty about them whether i say he can consider them to be such sovereign princes as to justify his taking from them great sums of money by way of a present the nabob in fact was not a sovereign prince nor a country power in any sense but that which the company meant to exempt from the custom of making presents it was their design to prevent their servants from availing themselves of the real dependence of the nominal native powers to extort money from them under the pretence of their sovereignty such presents so far from being voluntary were in reality obtained from their weakness their hopeless and unprotected condition and you are to decide whether or not this custom which is insisted upon by the prisoners counsel with great triumph to be a thing which he could not evade without breaking through all the usages of the country and violating principles established by the most clear law of india is to be admitted as his justification  it was on this very account namely the extortion suffered by these people under the name or pretence of presents that the company first bound their servants by a covenant which your lordships shall now hear read       that they shall not take any grant of lands or rents or revenues      issuing out of lands or any territorial possession jurisdiction      dominion power or authority whatsoever from any of the indian      princes sovereigns subahs or nabobs or any of their ministers      servants or agents for any service or services or upon any      account or pretence whatsoever without the license or consent of      the court of directors  this clause in the covenant had doubtless a regard to lord clive and to sir hector munro and to some others who had received gifts and grants of jaghires and other territorial revenues that were confirmed by the company but though this confirmation might be justifiable at a time when we had no real sovereignty in the country yet the company very wisely provided afterwards that under no pretence whatever should their servants have the means of extorting from the sovereigns or pretended sovereigns of the country any of their lands or possessions afterwards it appeared that there existed abuses of a similar nature and particularly as was proved before us in the year 1773 and reported to our house upon the evidence of mahomed reza khân the practice of frequently visiting the princes and of extorting under pretence of such visits great sums of money all their servants and the governorgeneral particularly were therefore obliged to enter into the following covenant       that they shall not directly or indirectly accept take or      receive or agree to accept take or receive any gift reward      gratuity allowance donation or compensation in money effects      jewels or otherwise howsoever from any of the indian princes      sovereigns subahs or nabobs or any of their ministers servants      or agents exceeding the value of four thousand rupees for any      service or services performed or to be performed by them in india      or upon any other account or pretence whatsoever  by this covenant my lords mr hastings is forbidden to accept upon any pretence and under any name whatsoever any sum above four thousand rupeesthat is to say any sum above four hundred pounds now the sum that was here received is eighteen thousand pounds sterling by way of a present under the name of an allowance for an entertainment which is the precise thing which his covenant was made to prevent the covenant suffered him to receive four hundred pounds if he received more than that money he became a criminal he had broken his covenant and forfeited the obligation he had made with his masters think with yourselves my lords what you will do if you acquit the prisoner of this charge you will avow the validity you will sanction the principle of his defence for as the fact is avowed there is an end of that  good god my lords where are we if they conceal their gifts and presents they are safe by their concealment if they avow them they are still safer they plead the customs of the country or rather the customs which we have introduced into the countrycustoms which have been declared to have their foundation in a system of the most abominable corruption the most flagitious extortion the most dreadful oppressionthose very customs which their covenant is made to abolish think where your lordships are you have before you a covenant declaring that he should take under no name whatever i do not know how words could be selected in the english language more expressive any sum more than four hundred pounds he says i have taken eighteen thousand pounds he makes his counsel declare and he desires your lordships to confirm their declaration that he is not only justifiable in so doing but that he ought to do sothat he ought to break his covenant and act in direct contradiction to it he does not even pretend to say that this money was intended either inwardly or outwardly avowedly or covertly for the companys service he put absolutely into his own pocket eighteen thousand pounds besides his salary  consider my lords the consequences of this species of iniquity if any servant of the company high in station chooses to make a visit from calcutta to moorshedabad which moorshedabad was then the residence of our principal revenue governmentif he should choose to take an airing for his health if he has a fancy to make a little voyage for pleasure as far as moorshedabad in one of those handsome barges or budgeros of which you have heard so much in his charge against nundcomar he can put twenty thousand pounds into his pocket any day he pleases in defiance of all our acts of parliament covenants and regulations  do you make your laws do you make your covenants for the very purpose of their being evaded is this the purpose for which a british tribunal sits here to furnish a subject for an epigram or a tale for the laughter of the world believe me my lords the world is not to be thus trifled with but my lords you will never trifle with your duty you have a gross horrid piece of corruption before youimpudently confessed and more impudently defended but you will not suffer mr hastings to say i have only to go to moorshedabad or to order the nabob to meet me half way and i can set aside and laugh at all your covenants and acts of parliament is this all the force and power of the covenant by which you would prevent the servants of the company from committing acts of fraud and oppression that they have nothing to do but to amuse themselves with a tour of pleasure to moorshedabad in order to put any sum of money in their pocket that they please  but they justify themselves by saying such things have been practised before no doubt they have and these covenants were made that they should not be practised any more but your lordships are desired to say that the very custom which the covenant is made to destroy the very grievance itself may be pleaded the abuse shall be admitted to destroy the law made to prevent it it is impossible i venture to say that your lordships should act thus the conduct of the criminal is not half so abhorrent as the justification is affronting to justice whilst it tends to vilify and degrade the dignity of the peerage and the character of the commons of great britain before the former and against the latter of which such a justification is produced in the face of the world  at the same time that we call for your justice upon this man we beseech you to remember the severest justice upon him is the tenderest pity towards the innocent victims of his crimes consider what was at that time the state of the people from whom in direct defiance of his covenant he took this sum of money were they at this time richer were they more opulent was the state of the country more flourishing than when mr sumner when mr vansittart in short than when the long line of mr hastingss predecessors visited that country no they were not mr hastings at this very time had reduced the nabobs income from 450000l 400000l sterling a year exclusive of other considerable domains and revenues to 160000l he was indeed an object of compassion his revenues had not only been reduced during his state of minority but they were reduced when he afterwards continued in a state in which he could do no one valid act and yet in this state he was made competent to give away under the name of compensation for entertainments the sum of 18000lperhaps at that time nearly all he had in the world  look at your minutes and you will find mr hastings had just before this time said that the bread of ten thousand persons many of them of high rank depended upon the means possessed by the nabob for their supportthat his heart was cut and afflicted to see himself obliged to ruin and starve so many of the mahometan nobility the greatest part of whose yet remaining miserable allowances were now taken away you know and you will forgive me again remarking that it is the nature of the eagles and more generous birds of prey to fall upon living healthy victims but that vultures and carrion crows and birds of that base and degenerate kind always prey upon dead or dying carcases it is upon ruined houses it is upon decayed families it is upon extinguished nobility that mr hastings chooses to prey and to justify his making them his prey  but again we hear my lords that it is a custom upon ceremonial and complimentary visits to receive these presents do not let us deceive ourselves mr hastings was there upon no visit either of ceremony or politics he was a member at that time of the committee of circuit which went to moorshedabad for the purpose of establishing a system of revenue in the country he went up upon that business only as a member of the committee of circuit for which business he was like other members of the committee of circuit amply paid in addition to his emoluments as governor which amounted to about 30000l a year not satisfied with those emoluments and without incurring new known expense of any kind or sort he was paid for the extra expenses of his journey as appears in your minutes like other members of the committee of circuit in fact he was on no visit there at all he was merely executing his duty in the settlement of the revenue as a member of the committee of circuit i do not mean to praise the committee of circuit in anyway god forbid i shouldfor we know that it was a committee of robbers he was there as one of that committee which i am pretty well justified in describing as i have done because the court of directors together with the board of control did in the year 1786 declare that the five years settlement which originated in that committee was a thing bought and sold your lordships may read it whenever you please in the 80th paragraph of their letter  your lordships are now fully in possession of all the facts upon which we charge the prisoner with peculation by extorting or receiving large sums of money upon pretence of visits or in compensation of entertainments i appeal to your lordships consciences for a serious and impartial consideration of our charge this is a business not to be hurried over in the mass as amongst the acts of a great man who may have his little errors among his great services no you cannot as a judicial body huddle all this into a hotchpotch and decide upon it in a heap you will have to ask yourselvesis this justifiable by his covenant is this justifiable by law is this justifiable under the circumstances of the case by an enlarged discretion is it to be justified under any principles of humanity would it be justifiable by local customs if such were applicable to the case in question and even if it were is it a practice fit for an english governorgeneral to follow  i dwell the longer upon this because the fact is avowed the whole is an issue of law between uswhether a governorgeneral in such a case ought to take such money and therefore before i finally dismiss it i beg leave to restate it briefly once more for your lordships consideration  first i wish to leave fixed in your lordships minds what is distinctly fixed and shall never go out of ours that his covenant did not allow him to take above four hundred pounds as a present upon any pretence whatsoever  your lordships will observe we contend that if there was a custom this covenant puts an end to that custom it was declared and intended so to do the fact is that if such custom existed at all it was a custom applicable only to an ambassador or public minister sent on a necessary complimentary visit to a sovereign prince we deny positively that there is any such general custom we say that he never was any such minister or that he ever went upon any such complimentary visit we affirm that when he took this money he was doing an act of quite another nature and came upon that business only to moorshedabad the residence of the prince of the country now do you call a man who is going to execute a commission a commission more severe than those issued against bankrupts a commission to take away half a mans income and to starve a whole body of people dependent upon that incomedo you call this a complimentary visit is this a visit for which a man is to have great entertainments given him no the pretence for taking this money is worse than the act itself when a man is going to execute upon another such harsh cruelty when he is going upon a service at which he himself says his mind must revolt is that precisely the time when he is to take from his undone host a present as if he was upon a visit of compliment or about to confer some honor or benefit upon himto augment his revenues to add to his territories or to conclude some valuable treaty with him was this a proper time to take at all from an helpless minor so large a sum of money  and here i shall leave this matter for your lordships consideration after reminding you that this poor nabob is still at moorshedabad and at the mercy of any english gentleman who may choose to take 18000l or any other given sum of money from him after the example of the prisoner at your bar if it should be sanctioned by your connivance far different was the example set him by general clavering in page 1269 your lordships will find the most honorable testimony to the uprightness and fidelity of this meritorious servant of the company it runs thus conceiving it to be the intention of the legislature that the governorgeneral and members of the council should receive no presents either from the indian powers or any persons whatever he general clavering has strictly complied since his arrival here both with the spirit and the letter of the act of parliament and has accordingly returned all the presents which have been made to him i have dwelt thus long upon this subject not merely upon account of its own corrupt character which has been sufficiently stigmatized by my honorable colleague but upon account of the principle that is laid down by the prisoner in his defence of his conducta principle directly leading to a continuance of the same iniquitous practice and subversive of every attempt to check or control it  i must beg leave to recall your lordships attention to another but similar instance of his peculation another and new mode of taking presents i mean the present which mr hastings took through gunga govind sing from those farmers of the revenues amongst whom he had distributed the pillage of the whole country this scandalous breach of his covenant he attempts to justify by the inward intention of his own mind to apply the money so taken to the public service upon this my lords i shall only observe that this plea of an inward intention in his own mind may if admitted justify any evil act whatever of this kind you have seen how presents from the nabob are justified you have seen how the taking a sum of money or allowance for entertainment directly contrary to the covenant how that is attempted to be justified you see in what manner he justifies this lastmentioned act of peculation and your lordships will now have to decide upon the validity of these pleas  there still remains unobserved upon an instance of his malversation wholly new in its kind to which i will venture to desire your lordships very seriously to turn your attention in all the causes of peculation or malversation in office that ever have been tried before this high court or before any lower court of judicature in all the judicial records of modern crimes or of antiquity you will not find anything in any degree like it we have all in our early education read the verrine orations we read them not merely to instruct us as they will do in the principles of eloquence and to acquaint us with the manners customs and laws of the ancient romans of which they are an abundant repository but we may read them from a much higher motive we may read them from a motive which the great author had doubtless in his view when by publishing them he left to the world and to the latest posterity a monument by which it might be seen what course a great public accuser in a great public cause ought to pursue and as connected with it what course judges ought to pursue in deciding upon such a cause in these orations you will find almost every instance of rapacity and peculation which we charge upon mr hastings undoubtedly many roman and english governors have received corrupt gifts and bribes under various pretences but in the cause before your lordships there is one species of disgrace in the conduct of the party accused which i defy you to find in verres or in the whole tribe of roman peculators in any governorgeneral proconsul or viceroy i desire you to consider it not included in any other class of crimes but as a species apart by itself it is an individual a single case but it is like the phœnixit makes a class or species by itself i mean the business of nobkissin the money taken from him was not money pretended to be received in lieu of entertainment it was not money taken from a farmergeneral of revenue out of an idea that his profits were unreasonable and greater than government ought to allow it was not a donation from a great man as an act of his bounty no it was a sum of money taken from a private individualor rather as has been proved to you by mr larkins his own bookkeeper money borrowed for which he had engaged to give his bond that he had actually deposited his bond for this money mr larkins has proved to youand that the bond was carried to nobkissins credit in his account with the government but mr hastings when he was called upon for the money withdraws the bond he will not pay the money he refused to pay it upon the applications made to him both in india and here at home and he now comes to your lordships and says i borrowed this money i intended to give my bond for it as has been proved before you but i must have it for my own use we have heard of governors being everything that is bad and wicked but a governor putting himself in the situation of a common cheat of a common swindler never was i believe heard of since the creation of the world to this day this does not taste of the common oppressions of power this does not taste of the common abuses of office but it in no way differs from one of those base swindling cases that come to be tried and heavily punished in the kings bench every day this is neither more nor less than a plain barefaced cheat  now my lords let us see how it is justified to justify openly and directly a cheat to justify a fraud upon an individual is reserved for our times but good heavens what a justification have we here oh my lords consider into what a state indian corruption has brought us in this country when any person can be found to come to the bar of the house of lords and say i did cheat i did defraud i did promise and gave my bond i have now withdrawn it but i will account for it to you as to a gang of robbers concerned with me in the transaction i confess i robbed this man but i have acted as trustee for the gang observe what i have done for the gang come forward mr auriol and prove what handsome budgeros i gave the company were not they elegantly painted beautifully gilt charming and commodious i made use of them as long as i had occasion and though they are little worse for wear and would hardly suffer the least percentage deduction from prime cost upon them i gave them to the company oh i did not put the money into my own pocket i provided for myself and wore a suit of lace clothes when i was jew bail for some of this company it will turn for it is hardly the worse for wear though i appeared two or three times in different characters as bail for you on such and such an occasion i therefore set off these items against this money which i gained by swindling on your account it is true i also picked such a ones pocket of a watch here it is i have worn it as long as it was convenient now i give the watch to the company and let them send it to the pawnbroker for what it will bring besides all this i maintained aidedecamps for you and gave them houserent by the way my lords what sort of aidedecamps were these who made him a military man and to have such a legion of aidedecamps but says he i paid houserent for them that is in other words i paid at nightcellars and houses in saint giless sixpence a week for some of the gang this my lords is the real spirit of the whole proceeding and more especially of the last item in it then says he i was the gangs schoolmaster and taught lessons on their account i founded a mahometan school your lordships have already heard something of this shameful affair of this scene of iniquityi think of such iniquity as the world never yet had to blush at i founded a mahometan college for your use and i bore the expense of it from september 1780 when i placed a professor there called mudjedodinthis mudjedodin was to perfect men by contract in all the arts and sciences in about six months and the chief purpose of the school was as mr hastings himself tells you to breed theologians magistrates and moulavies that is to say judges and doctors of law who were to be something like our masters in chancery the assessors of judges to assist them in their judgments such was the college founded by mr hastings and he soon afterwards appropriated one of the companys estates i am speaking of matters of public notoriety worth 3000l a year for its support heaven be praised that mr hastings when he was resolved to be pious and munificent and to be a great founder chose a mahometan rather than a christian foundation so that our religion was not disgraced by such a foundation  observe how he charges the expense of the foundation to the company twice over he first makes them set aside an estate of 3000l a year for its support in what manner this income was applied during mr hastingss stay in india no man living knows but we know that at his departure one of the last acts he did was to desire it should be put into the hands of mudjedodin he afterwards as you have seen takes credit to himself with the company for the expenses relative to this college  i must now introduce your lordships to the last visitation that was made of this college it was visited by order of lord cornwallis in the year 1788 upon the complaints made against it which i have already mentioned to your lordshipsthat it was a sink of filth vermin and misery mr chapman who was the visitor and the friend of mr hastings declares that he could not sit in it even for a few minutes his words arethe wretched squalid figures that from every part ran out upon me appeared to be more like anything else than students in fact a universal outcry was raised by the whole city against it not only as a receptacle of every kind of abuse not only of filth and excrements which made it stink in the natural nostrils but of worse filth which made it insufferably offensive to the moral nostrils of every inhabitant such is the account given of a college supported at an expense of 3000l a year a handsome foundation for a college and for building which the company was charged 5000l though no vouchers of its expenditure were ever given by mr hastings but this is not all when lord cornwallis came to inquire into it he found that mudjedodin had sunk the income of the estate from 3000l to 2000l a yearin short that it had been a scene of peculation both by the masters and scholars as well as of abandonment to every kind of vicious and licentious courses and all this without the shadow of any benefit having been derived from it the visitors expressly inquired whether there was any good mixed with all this evil and they found it was all bad and mischievous from one end to the other your lordships will remark that the greatest part of this disgusting business must have been known to mr hastings when he gave to mudjedodin the disposal of 3000l a year and now my lords can you vote this money expended in the manner which i have stated to you to be a setoff in his favor in an account for money which was itself swindled from a private individual  but there still remains behind another more serious matter belonging to this affair and i hope you will not think that i am laying too much stress upon it when i declare that if i were to select from the whole of his conduct one thing more dishonorable than another to the british nation it would be that which i am now about to mention i will leave your lordships to judge of the sincerity of this declaration when you shall have heard read a paper produced by the prisoner in justification of conduct such as i have stated his to have been it is the razinama or attestation of munny begum the woman whom mr hastings placed in the seat of justice in that country concerning this college made precisely at the time of this inquisition by lord cornwallis into the management of it your lordships will see what sort of things attestations are from that country that they are attestations procured in diametrical contradiction to the certain knowledge of the party attesting it is in page 2350 of your minutes indeed my lords these are pages which unless they are effaced by your judgment will rise up in judgment against us some day or other       he mr hastings respected the learned and wise men and in      order for the propagation of learning he built a college and      endowed it with a provision for the maintenance of the students      insomuch that thousands reaping the benefits thereof offer up their      prayers for the prosperity of the king of england and for the      success of the company  i must here remind your lordships of another attestation of the same character and to the same effect it comes from mahomed reza khân who as your lordships will remember had been reduced by mr hastings from a situation of the highest rank and authority with an income of suitable magnitude to one of comparative insignificance with a small salary annexed this man is made to disgrace himself and to abet the disgrace and injury done to his country by bearing his testimony to the merits of this very college  i hope your lordships will never lose sight of this aggravating circumstance of the prisoners criminalitynamely that you never find any wicked fraudulent and criminal act in which you do not find the persons who suffered by it and must have been well acquainted with it to be the very persons who are brought to attest in its favor o heaven but let shame for one moment veil its face let indignation suppress its feelings whilst i again call upon you to view all this as a mere swindling transaction in which the prisoner was attempting to defraud the company  mr hastings has declared and you will find it upon the companys records that this institution which cost the company not less than 40000l in one way or other did not commence before october in the year 1780 and he brings it before the board in april 1781that is about six months after its foundation now look at his other account in which he makes it to begin in the year 1779 and in which he has therefore overcharged the expenses of it a whole yearbut mr larkins who kept this latter account for him may have been inaccurategood heavens where are we mr hastings who was bred an accountant who was bred in all sorts of trade and business declares that he keeps no accounts then comes mr larkins who keeps an account for him but he keeps a false account indeed all the accounts from india from one end to another are nothing but a series of fraud while mr hastings was concerned in them mr larkins who keeps his private account just as his master kept the public accounts has swindled from the company a whole years expenses of this college i should not thus repeatedly dwell upon this transaction but because i wish your lordships to be cautious how you admit such accounts at all to be given in evidence into the truth of which you cannot penetrate in any regular way upon the face of the two accounts there is a gross fraud it is no matter which is true or false as it is an account which you are in no situation to decide upon i lay down this as a fixed judicial rule that no judge ought to receive an account which is as serious a part of a judicial proceeding as can be the correctness of which he has no means of ascertaining but must depend upon the sole word of the accountant  having stated therefore the nature of the offence which differs nothing from a common dogtrot fraud such as we see amongst the meanest of mankind your lordships will be cautious how you admit these or any other of his pretended services to be set off against his crimes these stand on record confessed before you the former of which you can form no just estimate and into which you cannot enter rest for their truth upon his own assertions and they all are found upon the very face of them to carry marks of fraud as well as of wickedness  i have only further to observe to your lordships that this mudjedodin who under the patronage of mr hastings was to do all these wonders lord cornwallis turned out of his office with every mark of disgrace when he attempted to put into some more respectable state that establishment which mr hastings had made a sink of abuse  i here conclude all that i have to say upon this business trusting that your lordships will feel yourselves more offended and justice more insulted by the defence than by the criminal acts of the prisoner at your bar and that your lordships will concur with us in thinking that to make this unhappy people make these attestations knowing the direct contrary of every word which they say to be the truth is a shocking aggravation of his guilt i say they must know it for lord cornwallis tells you it is notorious and if you think fit to inquire into it you will find that it was unusually notorious                                       my lords we have now brought to a conclusion our observations upon the effects produced by that mass of oppression which we have stated and proved before your lordshipsnamely its effects upon the revenues and upon the public servants of the company we have shown you how greatly the former were diminished and in what manner the latter were reduced to the worst of all bad states a state of subserviency to the will of the governorgeneral i have shown your lordships that in this state they were not only rendered incapable of performing their own duty but were fitted for the worst of all purposes coöperation with him in the perpetration of his criminal acts and collusion with him in the concealment of them i have lastly to speak of these effects as they regard the general state and welfare of the country and here your lordships will permit me to read the evidence given by lord cornwallis a witness called by the prisoner at your bar mr hastings himself        the evidence of lord cornwallis page 2721       q whether your lordship recollects an account that you have      given to the court of directors in your letter of the 2d of      august 1789 concerning the state of those provincesa i      really could not venture to be particular as to any letter i may      have written so long since as i have brought no copies of my      letters with me from india having left them at bengal when i went      to the coastq whether your lordship recollects in any letter      that you wrote about the 2d of august 1789 paragraph 18 any      expressions to this effect namely i am sorry to be obliged to      say that agriculture and internal commerce have for many years      been gradually declining and that at present excepting the class      of shroffs and banians who reside almost entirely in great towns      the inhabitants of these provinces are advancing hastily to a      general state of poverty and wretchednesswhether your lordship      recollects that you have written a letter to that effecta i      cannot take upon me to recollect the words of a letter that i have      written five years ago but i conclude i must have written to that      effectq whether your lordship recollects that in the      immediately following paragraph the 19th you wrote to this      effect in this description namely the foregone description i      must even include almost every zemindar in the companys      territories which though it may have been partly occasioned by      their own indolence and extravagance i am afraid must also be in a      great measure attributed to the defects of our former system of      management paragraph 20 the settlement in conformity to      your orders will only be made for ten years certain with the      notification of its being your intention to declare it a perpetual      an unalterable assessment of these provinces if the amount and the      principles upon which it has been made should meet with your      approbationwhether your lordship recollects to have written      something to the effect of these two last paragraphs as well as of      the firsta i do recollect that i did write it but in that      letter i alluded to the former system of annual assessmentsq      whether your lordship recollects that you wrote on or about the      18th of september 1789 in one of your minutes thus i may      safely assert that one third of the companys territory in      hindostan is now a jungle inhabited only by wild beasts will a      ten years lease induce any proprietor to clear away that jungle      and encourage the ryot to come and cultivate his lands when at the      end of that lease he must either submit to be taxed ad libitum      for the newly cultivated lands or lose all hopes of deriving any      benefit from his labor for which perhaps by that time he will      hardly be repaidwhether your lordship recollects a minute to      that effecta i perfectly recollect to have written that      minuteq now with respect to a letter dated november the 3d      1788 paragraph 38 containing the following sentiments i shall      therefore only remark in general that from frequent changes of      system or other reasons much is wanting to establish good order      and regulations in the internal business of the country and that      from various causes by far the greatest part of the zemindars and      other landholders and renters are fallen into a state much below      that of wealth and affluence this country however when the      fertility of its soil and the industry and ingenuity of its      numerous inhabitants are taken into consideration must      unquestionably be admitted to be one of the finest in the world      and with the uniform attention of government to moderation in      exaction and to a due administration of justice may long prove a      source of great riches both to the company and to britain      paragraph 39 i am persuaded that by a train of judicious      measures the land revenue of these provinces is capable in time of      being increased but consistent with the principles of humanity      and even those of your own interest it is only by adopting      measures for the gradual cultivation and improvement of these waste      lands and by a gentle and cautious plan for the resumption of      lands that have been fraudulently alienated that it ought ever to      be attempted to be accomplished men of speculative and sanguine      dispositions and others either from ignorance of the subject or      with views of recommending themselves to your favor may      confidently hold forth specious grounds to encourage you to hope      that a great and immediate accession to that branch of your revenue      might be practicable my public duty obliges me to caution you in      the most serious manner against listening to propositions which      recommend this attempt because i am clearly convinced that if      carried into execution they would be attended with the most      baneful consequences paragraph 40 desperate adventurers      without fortune or character would undoubtedly be found as has      already been too often experienced to rent the different districts      of the country at the highest rates that could be put upon them      that but the delusion would be of a short duration and the      impolicy and inhumanity of the plan would when perhaps too late      for effectual remedy become apparent by the complaints of the      people and the disappointments at the treasury in the payments of      the revenue and would probably terminate in the ruin and      depopulation of the unfortunate countrywhether your lordship      recollects to have written anything to that effect about that      timea i perfectly recollect having written the extracts that      have been read  my lords lord cornwallis has been called he has been examined before you we stopped our proceedings ten days for the purpose of taking his evidence we do not regret this delay and he has borne the testimony which you have heard to the effects of mr hastingss government of a country once the most fertile and cultivated of a people the most industrious flourishing and happythat the one was wasted and desolated the other reduced to a condition of want and misery and that the zemindars that is the nobility and gentry of the country were so beggared as not to be able to give even a common decent education to their children notwithstanding the foundation of mr hastingss colleges you have heard this noble person who had been an eyewitness of what he relates supplicating for their relief and expressly stating that most of the complicated miseries and perhaps the cruelest of the afflictions they endured arose from the management of the country having been taken out of the hands of its natural rulers and given up to mr hastingss farmers namely the banians of calcutta these are the things that ought to go to your lordships hearts you see a country wasted and desolated you see a third of it become a jungle for wild beasts you see the other parts oppressed by persons in the form and shape of men but with all the character and disposition of beasts of prey this state of the country is brought before you and by the most unexceptionable evidencebeing brought forward through mr hastings himself this evidence whatever opinion you may entertain of the effrontery or of the impudence of the criminal who has produced it is of double and treble force and yet at the very time when lord cornwallis is giving this statement of the country and its inhabitants at the very time when he is calling for pity upon their condition are these people brought forward to bear testimony to the benign and auspicious government of mr hastings directed as your lordships know it was by the merciful and upright gunga govind sing  my lords you have now the evidence of lord cornwallis on the one hand and the razinamas of india on the other but before i dismiss this part of my subject i must call your lordships attention to another authorityto a declaration strictly speaking legal of the state to which our indian provinces were reduced and of the oppressions which they have suffered during the government of mr hastings i speak of the act 24 geo iii cap 25 intituled an act for the better regulation and management of the affairs of the east india company and of the british possessions in india and for establishing a court of judicature for the more speedy and effectual trial of persons accused of offences committed in the east indies § 39  my lords here is an act of parliament here are regulations enacted in consequence of an inquiry which had been directed to be made into the grievances of india for the redress of them this act of parliament declares the existence of oppressions in the country what oppressions were they the oppressions which it suffered by being let out to the farmers of the companys revenues who was the person that sold these revenues to the farmers warren hastings by whom were these oppressions notified to the court of directors by lord cornwallis upon what occasion were these letters written by my lord cornwallis they were answers to inquiries made by the court of directors and ordered by an act of parliament to be made the existence then of the grievances and the cause of them are expressly declared in an act of parliament it orders an inquiry and lord cornwallis in consequence of that inquiry transmits to the court of directors this very information he gives you this identical state of the country so that it is consolidated mixed and embodied with an act of parliament itself which no power on earth i trust but the power that made it can shake i trust i say that neither we the commons nor you the lords nor his majesty the sovereign of this country can shake one word of this act of parliamentcan invalidate the truth of its declaration or the authority of the persons men of high honor and character that made that inquiry and this report your lordships must repeal this act in order to acquit mr hastings  but mr hastings and his counsel have produced evidence against this act of parliament against the order of the court of directors by which an inquiry and report were made under that act against lord cornwalliss return to that inquiry and now once for all hear what the miserable wretches are themselves made to say to invalidate the act of parliament to invalidate the authority of the court of directors to invalidate the evidence of an official return of lord cornwallis under the act pray hear what these miserable creatures describe as an elysium speaking with rapture of their satisfaction under the government of mr hastings       all we zemindars chowdries and talookdars of the district of      akbarnagur commonly called rajamahal in the kingdom of bengal      have heard that the gentlemen in england are displeased with mr      hastings on suspicion that he oppressed us inhabitants of this      place took our money by deceit and force and ruined the country      therefore we upon the strength of our religion and religious      tenets which we hold as a duty upon us and in order to act      conformable to the duties of god in delivering evidence relate the      praiseworthy actions full of prudence and rectitude friendship      and politeness of mr hastings possessed of great abilities and      understanding and by representing facts remove the doubts that      have possessed the minds of the gentlemen in englandthat mr      hastings distributed protection and security to religion and      kindness and peace to all he is free from the charge of      embezzlement and fraud and that his heart is void of covetousness      and avidity during the period of his government no one      experienced from him other than protection and justice never      having felt hardships from him nor did the poor ever know the      weight of an oppressive hand from him our characters and      reputations have always been guarded in quiet from attack by the      vigilance of his power and foresight and preserved by the terror      of his justice he never omitted the smallest instance of kindness      and goodness towards us and those entitled to it but always      applied by soothings and mildness the salve of comfort to the      wounds of affliction not allowing a single person to be      overwhelmed by despair he displayed his friendship and kindness to      all he destroyed the power of the enemies and wicked men by the      strength of his terror he tied the hands of tyrants and oppressors      by his justice and by this conduct he secured happiness and joy to      us he reëstablished the foundation of justice and we at all      times during his government lived in comfort and passed our days      in peace we are many many of us satisfied and pleased with him      as mr hastings was perfectly well acquainted with the manners and      customs of these countries he was always desirous of performing      that which would tend to the preservation of our religion and of      the duties of our sects and guard the religious customs of each      from the effects of misfortune and accidents in every sense he      treated us with attention and respect we have represented without      deceit what we have ourselves seen and the facts that happened      from him  this my lords is in page 2374 of the printed minutes                                       my lords we spare you the reading of a great number of these attestations they are all written in the same style and it must appear to your lordships a little extraordinary that as they are said to be totally voluntary as the people are represented to be crowding to make these testimonials there should be such an unison in the heart to produce a language that is so uniform as not to vary so much as in a single tittlethat every part of the country every province every district men of every caste and of every religion should all unite in expressing their sentiments in the very same words and in the very same phrases i must fairly say it is a kind of miraculous concurrence a miraculous gratitude mr hastings says that gratitude is lost in this part of the world there it blooms and flourishes in a way not to be described in proportion as you hear of the miseries and distresses of these very people in the same proportion do they express their comfort and satisfaction and that they never knew what a grievance was of any sort lord cornwallis finds them aggrieved the court of directors find them aggrieved the parliament of great britain find them aggrieved and the court here find them aggrieved but they never found themselves aggrieved their being turned out of house and home and having all their land given to farmers of revenue for five years to riot in and despoil them of all they had is what fills them with rapture they are the only people i believe upon the face of the earth that have no complaints to make of their government in any instance whatever theirs must be something superior to the government of angels for i verily believe that if one out of the choir of the heavenly angels were sent to govern the earth such is the nature of man that many would be found discontented with it but these people have no complaint they feel no hardships no sorrow mr hastings has realized more than the golden age i am ashamed for human nature i am ashamed for our government i am ashamed for this court of justice that these things are brought before us but here they are and we must observe upon them                                       my lords we have done on our part we have made out our case and it only remains for me to make a few observations upon what mr hastings has thought proper to put forward in his defence does he meet our case with anything but these general attestations upon which i must first remark that there is not one single matter of fact touched upon in them your lordships will observe and you may hunt them out through the whole body of your minutes that you do not find a single fact mentioned in any of them but there is an abundance of panegyric and if we were doing nothing but making satires as the newspapers charge us with doing against mr hastings panegyric would be a good answer  but mr hastings sets up pleas of merit upon this occasion now undoubtedly no plea of merit can be admitted to extinguish as your lordships know very well a direct charge of crime merit cannot extinguish crime for instance if lord howe to whom this country owes so much as it owes this day for the great and glorious victory which makes our hearts glad and i hope will insure the security of this countryyet if lord howe i say was charged with embezzling the kings stores or applying them in any manner unbecoming his situation to any shameful or scandalous purposeif he was accused of taking advantage of his station to oppress any of the captains of his shipsif he was stated to have gone into a port of the allies of this country and to have plundered the inhabitants to have robbed their women and broken into the recesses of their apartmentsif he had committed atrocities like these his glorious victory could not change the nature and quality of such acts my lord malmesbury has been lately sent to the king of prussia we hope and trust that his embassy will be successful and that this country will derive great benefit from his negotiations but if lord malmesbury from any subsidy that was to be paid to the king of prussia was to put 50000l in his own pocket i believe that his making a good and advantageous treaty with the king of prussia would never be thought a good defence for him we admit that if a man has done great and eminent services though they cannot be a defence against a charge of crimes and cannot obliterate them yet when sentence comes to be passed upon such a man you will consider first whether his transgressions were common lapses of human frailty and whether the nature and weight of the grievances resulting from them were light in comparison with the services performed i say that you cannot acquit him but your lordships might think some pity due to him that might mitigate the severity of your sentence in the second place you would consider whether the evidence of the services alleged to be performed was as clear and undoubted as that of the crimes charged i confess that if a man has done great services it may be some alleviation of lighter faults but then they ought to be urged as suchwith modesty with humility with confession of the faults and not with a proud and insolent defiance they should not be stated as proofs that he stands justified in the eye of mankind for committing unexampled and enormous crimes indeed humility suppliant guilt always makes impression in our bosoms so that when we see it before us we always remember that we are all frail men and nothing but a proud defiance of law and justice can make us forget this for one moment i believe the commons of great britain and i hope the persons that speak to you know very well how to allow for the faults and frailties of mankind equitably  let us now see what are the merits which mr hastings has set up against the just vengeance of his country and against his proved delinquencies from the language of the prisoner and of his counsel you would imagine some great known acknowledged services had been done by him your lordships recollect that most of these presumed services have been considered and we are persuaded justly considered as in themselves crimes he wishes your lordships to suppose and believe that these services were put aside either because we could not prove the facts against him or could not make out that they were criminal and consequently that your lordships ought to presume them to have been meritorious and this is one of the grounds upon which he demands to be acquitted of the charges that have been brought forward and proved against him finding in our proceedings and recorded upon our journals an immense mass of criminality with which he is charged and finding that we had selected as we were bound to select such parts as might be most conveniently brought before your lordships for to have gone through the whole would have been nearly impossible he takes all the rest that we have left behind and have not brought here as charges and converts them by a strange metamorphosis into merits  my lords we must insist on the part of the house of commons we must conjure your lordships for the honor of a coördinate branch of the legislature that whenever you are called upon to admit what we have condemned as crimes to be merits you will at least give us an opportunity of being heard upon the matterthat you will not suffer mr hastings when attempting to defend himself against our charges in an indirect and oblique manner to condemn or censure the house of commons itself as having misrepresented to be crimes the acts of a meritorious servant of the public mr hastings has pleaded a variety of merits and every one of these merits without the exception of one of them have been either directly censured by the house of commons and censured as a ground for legislative provision or they remain upon the records of the house of commons with the vouchers for them and proofs and though we have not actually come to the question upon every one of them we had come before the year 1782 to fortyfive direct resolutions upon his conduct these resolutions were moved by a person to whom this country is under many obligations and whom we must always mention with honor whenever we are speaking of high situations in this country and of great talents to support them and of long public services in the house of commons i mean mr dundas then lord advocate of scotland and now one of the principal secretaries of state and at the head and worthily and deservedly at the head of the east indian department this distinguished statesman moved fortyfive resolutions the major part of them directly condemning these very acts which mr hastings has pleaded as his merits as being delinquencies and crimes all that the house of commons implore of your lordships is that you will not take these things which we call crimes to be merits without hearing the house of commons upon the subjectmatter of them i am sure you are too noble and too generous as well as too just and equitable to act in such a manner  the first thing that mr hastings brings forward in his defence is that whereas the company were obliged to pay a certain tribute to the mogul in consideration of a grant by which the moguls gave to us the legal title under which we hold the provinces of bengal bahar and orissa he did stop the payment of that tribute or acknowledgment small as it wasthat though bound by a treaty recognized by the company and recognized by the nation though bound by the very sunnud by which he held the very office he was exercising yet he had broken the treaty and refused to pay the stipulated acknowledgment where are we my lords is this merit good god almighty the greatest blockhead the most ignorant miserable wretch a person without either virtue or talents has nothing to do but to order a clerk to strike a pen through such an account and then to make a merit of it to you oh says he i have by a mere breach of your faith by a single dash of my pen saved you all this money which you were bound to pay i have exonerated you from the payment of it i have gained you 250000l a year forever will you not reward a person who did you such a great and important service by conniving a little at his delinquencies  but the house of commons will not allow that this was a great and important service on the contrary they have declared the act itself to be censurable there is our resolutionresolution the 7th  that the conduct of the company and their servants in india to the king meaning the mogul king and nudjif khân with respect to the tribute payable to the one and the stipend to the other and with respect to the transfer of the provinces of corah and allahabad to the vizier was contrary to policy and good faith and that such wise and practicable measures should be adopted in future as may tend to redeem the national honor and recover the confidence and attachment of the princes of india  this act of injustice against which we have fulminated the thunder of our resolutions as a heavy crime as a crime that dishonored the nation and which measures ought to be taken to redress this man has the insolence to bring before your lordships as a setoff against the crimes we charge him with this outrageous defiance of the house of commons this outrageous defiance of all the laws of his country i hope your lordships will not countenance you will not let it pass for nothing on the contrary you will consider it as aggravating heavily his crimes and above all you will not suffer him to set off this which we have declared to be injurious to our national honor and credit and which he himself does not deny to be a breach of the public faith against other breaches of the public faith with which we charge himor to justify one class of public crimes by proving that he has committed others  your lordships see that he justifies this crime upon the plea of its being profitable to the company but he shall not march off even on this ground with flying colors my lords pray observe in what manner he calculates these profits your lordships will find that he makes up the account of them much in the same manner as he made up the account of nobkissins money there is indeed no account which he has ever brought forth that does not carry upon it not only ill faith and national dishonor but direct proofs of corruption when mr hastings values himself upon this shocking and outrageous breach of faith which required nothing but a base and illiberal mind without either talents courage or skill except that courage which defies all consequences which defies shame which defies the judgment and opinion of his country and of mankind no other talents than may be displayed by the dash of a pen you will at least expect to see a clear and distinct account of what was gained by it  in the year 1775 at a period when mr hastings was under an eclipse when honor and virtue in the character of general clavering colonel monson and mr francis sat for a short period at the councilboardduring that time mr hastingss conduct upon this occasion was called into question they called for an account of the revenues of the countrywhat was received and what had been paid and in the account returned they found the amount of the tribute due to the mogul 250000l entered as paid up to october 1774 thus far all appeared fair upon the face of it they took it for granted as your lordships would take it for granted at the first view that the tribute in reality had been paid up to the time stated the books were balanced you find a debtor you find a creditor every item posted in as regular a manner as possible whilst they were examining this account a mr croftes of whom your lordships have heard very often as accountantgeneral comes forward and declares that there was a little error in the account and what was the error that he had entered the moguls tribute for one year more than it had actually been paid here we have the small error of a payment to the mogul of 250000l this appeared strange why says mr croftes i never discovered it nor was it ever intimated to me that it had been stopped from october 1773 till the other day when i was informed that i ought not to have made an entry of the last payments these were his expressions you will find the whole relation in the bengal appendix printed by the orders of the court of directors when mr croftes was asked a very natural question who first told you of your mistake who acquainted you with mr hastingss orders that the payment should be expunged from the account what is his answer it is an answer worthy of mr middleton an answer worthy of mr larkins or of any of the other white banians of mr hastingsoh i have forgotten here you have an accountantgeneral kept in ignorance or who pretends to be ignorant of so large a payment as 250000l who enters it falsely in his account and when asked who apprised him of his mistake says that he has really forgotten  oh my lords what resources there are in oblivion what resources there are in bad memory no genius ever has done so much for mankind as this mental defect has done for mr hastingss accountants it was said by one of the ancient philosophers to a man who proposed to teach people memoryi wish you could teach me oblivion i wish you could teach me to forget these people have certainly not been taught the art of memory but they appear perfect masters of the art of forgetting my lords this is not all and i must request your lordships attention to the whole of the account as it appears in the account of the arrears due to the king annexed to your minutes here is a kind of labyrinth where fraud runs into fraud on the credit side you find stated there eight lacs paid to the vizier and to be taken from the moguls tribute for the support of an army of which he himself had stipulated to bear the whole expenses these eight lacs are thus fraudulently accounted for upon the face of the thing and with respect to eighteen lacs the remainder of the tribute there is no account given of it at all this sum mr hastings must therefore have pocketed for his own use or that of his gang of peculators and whilst he was pretending to save you eight lacs by one fraud he committed another fraud of eighteen lacs for himself and this is the method by which one act of peculation begets another in the economy of fraud  thus much of these affairs i think myself bound to state to your lordships upon this occasion for although not one word has been produced by the counsel to support the allegations of the prisoner at your bar yet knowing that your lordships high as you are are still but men knowing also that bold assertions and confident declarations are apt to make some impression upon all mens minds we oppose his allegations but how do we oppose them not by things of the like nature we oppose them by showing you that the house of commons after diligent investigation has condemned them and by stating the grounds upon which the house founded its condemnation we send you to the records of the company if you want to pursue this matter further to enlighten your own minds upon the subject do not think my lords that we are not aware how ridiculous it is for either party the accuser or the accused to make here any assertions without producing vouchers for them we know it but we are prepared and ready to take upon us the proof and we should be ashamed to assert anything that we are not able directly to substantiate by an immediate reference to uncontradicted evidence  with regard to the merits pleaded by the prisoner we could efface that plea with a single stroke by saying there is no evidence before your lordships of any such merits but we have done more we have shown you that the things which he has set up as merits are atrocious crimes and that there is not one of them which does not in the very nature and circumstances of it carry evidence of base corruption as well as of flagrant injustice and notorious breach of public faith  the next thing that he takes credit for is precisely an act of this description the mogul had by solemn stipulation with the company a royal domain insured to him consisting of two provinces corah and allahabad of both these provinces mr hastings deprived the mogul upon weak pretences if proved in point of fact but which were never proved in any sense against him i allude particularly to his alleged alliance with the mahrattasa people by the way with whom we were not then at war and with whom he had as good a right as nudjif khân to enter into alliance at that time he takes these domains almost the last wrecks of empire left to the descendant of tamerlane from the man i say to whose voluntary grants we owe it that we have put a foot in bengal surely we ought at least to have kept our faith in leaving this last retreat to that unfortunate prince the house of commons was of that opinion and consequently they resolved that the transfer of corah and allahabad to the vizier was contrary to policy and good faith this is what the commons think of this business which mr hastings pleads as merits  but i have not yet done with it these provinces are estimated as worth twentytwo lacs or thereabouts that is about 220000l a year i believe they were improvable to a good deal more but what does mr hastings do instead of taking them into the companys possession for the purpose of preserving them for the mogul upon the event of our being better satisfied with his conduct or of appropriating them to the companys advantage he sells them to the nabob of oude who he knew had the art above all men of destroying a country which he was to keep or which he might fear he was not to keep permanent possession of and what do you think he sold them for he sold them at a little more than two years purchase will any man believe that mr hastings when he sold these provinces to the vizier for two years purchase and when there was no man that would not have given ten years purchase for them did not put the difference between the real and pretended value into his own pocket and that of his associates  we charge therefore first that this act for which he assumes merit was in itself a breach of faith next that the sale of these provinces was scandalously conducted and thirdly that this sale at one fifth of the real value was effected for corrupt purposes thus an act of threefold delinquency is one of the merits stated with great pomp by his counsel  another of his merits is the stoppage of the pension which the company was under an obligation to pay to nudjif khân a matter which even if admitted to be a merit is certainly not worth as a setoff much consideration  but there is another setoff of merit upon which he plumes himself and sets an exceedingly high value the sale of the rohilla nation to that worthless tyrant the vizier their cruel and bitter enemythe cruelest tyrant perhaps that ever existed and their most implacable enemy if we except mr hastings who appears to have had a concealed degree of animosity public private or political against them to this man he sold this whole nation whose country cultivated like a garden was soon reduced as mr hastings from the character of the vizier knew would be the consequence to a mere desert for 400000l he sent a brigade of our troops to assist the vizier in extirpating these people who were the bravest the most honorable and generous nation upon earth those who were not left slaughtered to rot upon the soil of their native country were cruelly expelled from it and sent to publish the merciless and scandalous behavior of great britain from one end of india to the other i believe there is not an honest ingenuous or feeling heart upon the face of the globe i believe there is no man possessing the least degree of regard to honor and justice humanity and good policy that did not reprobate this act the court of directors when they heard of it reprobated it in the strongest manner the court of proprietors reprobated it in the strongest manner by the house of commons after the most diligent investigation it was in a resolution moved by mr dundas reprobated in the strongest manner and this is the act which mr hastings brings forward before your lordships as a merit  but again i can prove that in this perhaps the most atrocious of all his demerits there is a most horrid and nefarious secret corruption lurking i can tell your lordships that sir robert barker was offered by this vizier for about one half of this very country namely the country of the rohillas a sum of fifty lacs of rupeesthat is 500000l mr hastings was informed of this offer by sir robert barker in his letter of the 24th march 1773 still in the face of this information mr hastings took for the company only forty lacs of rupees i leave your lordships to draw your own conclusion from these facts you will judge what became of the difference between the price offered and the price accounted for as taken nothing on earth can hide from mankind why mr hastings made this wicked corrupt bargain for the extermination of a brave and generous peoplewhy he took 400000l for the whole of that for half of which he was offered and knew he might have had 500000l  your lordships will observe that for all these facts there is no evidence on the one side or on the other directly before you their merits have been insisted upon in long and laborious details and discussions both by mr hastings himself and by his counsel we have answered them for that reason but we answer them with a direct reference to records and papers from which your lordships may judge of them as setoffs and merits i believe your lordships will now hardly receive them as merits to set off guilt since in every one of them there is both guilt in the act and strong ground for presuming that he had corruptly taken money for himself  the last act of merit that has been insisted upon by his counsel is the mahratta peace they have stated to you the distresses of the company to justify the unhandsome and improper means that he took of making this peace mr hastings himself has laid hold of the same opportunity of magnifying the difficulties which during his government he had to contend with here he displays all his tactics he spreads all his sails and here catches every gale he says i found all india confederated against you i found not the mahrattas alone i found war through a hundred hostile states fulminated against you i found the peshwa the nizam hyder ali the rajah of berar all combined together for your destruction i stemmed the torrent fortitude is my character i faced and overcame all these difficulties till i landed your affairs safe on shore till i stood the saviour of india  my lords we of the house of commons have before heard all this but we cannot forget that we examined into every part of it and that we did not find a single fact stated by him that was not a ground of censure and reprobation the house of commons in the resolutions to which i have alluded have declared that mr hastings the first author of these proceedings took advantage of an ambiguous letter of the court of directors to break and violate the most solemn the most advantageous and useful treaty that the company had ever made in india and that this conduct of his produced the strange and unnatural junction which he says he found formed against the company and with which he had to combat i should trouble your lordships with but a brief statement of the facts and if i do not enter more at large in observing upon them it is because i cannot but feel shocked at the indecency and impropriety of your being obliged to hear of that as merit which the house of commons has condemned in every part your lordships received obliquely evidence from the prisoner at your bar upon this subject yet when we came and desired your full inquiry into it your lordships for wise and just reasons i have no doubt refused our request i must however again protest on the part of the commons against your lordships receiving such evidence at all as relevant to your judgment unless the house of commons is fully heard upon it  but to proceedthe government of bombay had offended the mahratta states by a most violent and scandalous aggression they afterwards made a treaty of peace with them honorable and advantageous to the company this treaty was made by colonel upton and is called the treaty of poorunder mr hastings broke that treaty upon his declared principle that you are to look in war for the resources of your government all india was at that time in peace hyder ali did not dare to attack us because he was afraid that his natural enemies the mahrattas would fall upon him the nizam could not attack us because he was also afraid of the mahrattas the mahratta state itself was divided into such discordant branches as to make it impossible for them to unite in any one object that commonwealth which certainly at that time was the terror of india was so broken as to render it either totally ineffective or easy to be resisted there was not one government in india that did not look up to great britain as holding the balance of power and in a position to control and do justice to every individual party in it at that juncture mr hastings deliberately broke the treaty of poorunder and afterwards by breaking faith with and attacking all the powers one after another he produced that very union which one would hardly have expected that the incapacity or ill faith of any governor could have effected your lordships shall hear the best and most incontrovertible evidence both of his incapacity and ill faith and of the consequences which they produced it is the declaration of one of the latest of their allies concerning all these proceedings it is contained in a letter from the rajah of berar directly and strongly inculpating mr hastings upon facts which he has never denied and by arguments which he has never refuted as being himself the cause of that very junction of all the powers of india against us        letter from benaram pundit       as the friendship of the english is at all events the first and      most necessary consideration i will therefore exert myself in      establishing peace for the power of making peace with all is the      best object to this all other measures are subservient and will      certainly be done by them the english you write that after      having laid the foundation of peace with the pundit purdhaun it      is requisite that some troops should be sent with general goddard      against hyder naig and take possession of his country when all      those engagements and proposals may be assented to my reason is      confounded in discussing this suggestion at a time when hyder naig      is in every respect in alliance with the peshwa and has assisted      with his soul and life to repel the english for us to unite our      troops with those of the enemy and extirpate him would not this      fix the stamp of infamy upon us forever would any prince for      generations to come ever after assist us or unite with the      peshwa be yourself the judge and say whether such a conduct would      become a prince or not why then do you mention it why do you      write it       the case is as followsat first there was the utmost enmity      between hyder naig and the pundit purdhaun and there was the      fullest intention of sending troops into hyder naigs country and      after the conclusion of the war with bombay and the capture of      ragonaut row it was firmly resolved to send troops into that      quarter and a reliance was placed in the treaty which was entered      into by the gentlemen of bombay before the war but when ragonaut      again went to them and general goddard was ready to commence      hostilitieswhen no regard was paid to the friendly proposals      made by us and the pundit peshwawhen they desisted from coming      to poonah agreeable to their promise and a categorical answer was      given to the deputies from poonahthe ministers of poonah then      consulted among themselves and having advised with the nabob      nizam ul dowlah they considered that as enemies were appearing on      both sides and it would be difficult to cope with both what was      to be done peace must be made with one of them and war must be      carried on with the other they wished above all things in their      hearts to make peace with the english gentlemen and to unite with      them to punish hyder naig but these gentlemen had plainly refused      to enter into any terms of reconciliation it was therefore      advisable to accommodate matters with hyder naig although he had      been long an enemy what else could be done having nothing left      for it they were compelled to enter into an union with hyder  my lords this declaration made to mr hastings himself was never answered by him indeed answered it could not be because the thing was manifest that all the desolation of the carnatic by hyder ali all these difficulties upon which he has insisted the whole of that union by which he was pressed and against which as he says he bore up with such fortitude was his own work the consequences of his bad faith and his not listening to any reasonable terms of peace  but my lords see what sort of peace he afterwards made i could prove if i were called upon so to do from this paper that they have had the folly and madness to produce to you for other purposes that he might at any time have made a better treaty and have concluded a more secure and advantageous peace than that which at last he acceded to that the treaty he made was both disadvantageous and dishonorable inasmuch as we gave up every ally we had and sacrificed them to the resentment of the enemy that mahdajee sindia gained by it an empire of a magnitude dangerous to our very existence in india that this chief was permitted to exterminate all the many little gallant nations that stood between us and the mahrattas and whose policy led them to guard against the ambitious designs of that government almost all these lesser powers from central india quite up to the mountains that divide india from tartary almost all these i say were exterminated by him or were brought under a cruel subjection the peace he made with mr hastings was for the very purpose of doing all this and mr hastings enabled him and gave him the means of effecting it  advert next my lords to what he did with other allies by the treaty of poorunder made by colonel upton and which he flagitiously broke we had acquired what god knows we little merited from the mahrattas twelve lacs 112000l for the expenses of the warand a country of three lacs of annual revenue the province of baroach and the isle of salsette and other small islands convenient for us upon that coast this was a great useful and momentous accession of territory and of revenue and we got it with honor for not one of our allies were sacrificed by this treaty we had even obtained from the mahrattas for ragonaut row our support of whom against that government was a principal cause of the war an establishment of a thousand horse to be maintained at their expense and a jaghire for his other expenses of three lacs of rupees per annum payable monthly with leave to reside within their territories with no other condition than that he should not remove from the place fixed for his residence for the purpose of exciting disturbances against their government they also stipulated for the pardon of all his adherents except four and the only condition they required from us was that we should not assist him in case of any future disturbance but mr hastings by his treaty surrendered that country of three lacs of revenue he made no stipulation for the expenses of the war nor indemnity for any of the persons whom he had seduced into the rebellion in favor of ragonaut row he gave them all up to the vengeance of their governments without a stroke of a pen in their favor to be banished confiscated and undone and as to ragonaut row instead of getting him this honorable and secure retreat as he was bound to do this unfortunate man was ordered to retire to his enemys mahdajee sindias country or otherwise he was not to receive a shilling for his maintenance  i will now ask your lordships whether any man but mr hastings would claim a merit with his own country for having broken the treaty of poorunder your lordships know the opinion of the house of commons respecting it his colleagues in council had remonstrated with him upon it and had stated the mischiefs that would result from it and sir eyre coote the commander of the companys forces writing at the same time from madras states that he thought it would infallibly bring down upon them hyder ali who they had reason to think was bent upon the utter destruction of the power of this country in india and was only waiting for some crisis in our affairs favorable to his designs this my lords is to be one of the setoffs against all the crimes against the multiplied frauds cruelties and oppressions all the corrupt practices prevarications and swindlings that we have alleged against him  my lords it would be an endless undertaking and such as at this hour of the day we as well as your lordships are little fitted to engage in if i were to attempt to search into and unveil all the secret motives or to expose as it deserves the shameless audacity of this mans conduct none of your lordships can have observed without astonishment the selection of his merits as he audaciously calls them which has been brought before you the last of this selection in particular looks as if he meant to revile and spit upon the legislature of his country because we and you thought it fit and were resolved to publish to all india that we will not countenance offensive wars and that you felt this so strongly as to pass the first act of a kind that was ever made namely an act to limit the discretionary power of government in making war solelyand because you have done this solely and upon no other account and for no other reason under heaven than the abuse which that man at your bar has made of it and for which abuse he now presumes to take merit to himself i will read this part of the act to your lordships       mr burke here read 24th geo iii cap 25 sect 34       and whereas to pursue schemes of conquest and extension of      dominion in india are measures repugnant to the wish the honor      and policy of this nation be it therefore further enacted by the      authority aforesaid that it shall not be lawful for the      governorgeneral and council of port william aforesaid without the      express command and authority of the said court of directors or of      the secret committee of the said court of directors in any case      except where hostilities have actually been commenced or      preparations actually made for the commencement of hostilities      against the british nation in india or against some of the princes      or states dependent thereon or whose territories the said united      company shall be at such time engaged by any subsisting treaty to      defend or guaranty either to declare war or commence      hostilities or enter into any treaty for making war against any      of the country princes or states in india or any treaty for      guarantying the possessions of any country princes or states and      that in such case it shall not be lawful for the said      governorgeneral and council to declare war or commence      hostilities or enter into treaty for making war against any other      prince or state than such as shall be actually committing      hostilities or making preparations as aforesaid or to make such      treaty for guarantying the possessions of any prince or state but      upon the consideration of such prince or state actually engaging to      assist the company against such hostilities commenced or      preparations made as aforesaid and in all cases where hostilities      shall be commenced or treaty made the said governorgeneral and      council shall by the most expeditious means they can devise      communicate the same unto the said court of directors together      with a full state of the information and intelligence upon which      they shall have commenced such hostilities or made such treaties      and their motives and reasons for the same at large  it is the first act of the kind that ever was made in this kingdom the first statute i believe that ever was made by the legislature of any nation upon the subject and it was made solely upon the resolutions to which we had come against the violent intemperate unjust and perfidious acts of this man at your lordships bar and which acts are now produced before your lordships as merits  to show further to your lordships how necessary this act was here is a part of his own correspondence the last thing i shall beg to read to your lordships and upon which i shall make no other comment than that you will learn from it how well british faith was kept by this man and that it was the violation of british faith which prevented our having the most advantageous peace and brought on all the calamities of war it is part of a letter from the minister of the rajah of berar a man called benaram pundit with whom mr hastings was at the time treating for a peace and he tells him why he might have had peace at that time and why he had it notand that the cause of it was his own ridiculous and even buffoonish perfidiousness which exposed him to the ridicule of all the princes of india and with him the whole british nation       but afterwards reflecting that it was not advisable for me to be      in such haste before i had fully understood all the contents of the      papers i opened them in the presence of the maha rajah when all      the kharetas letters copies and treaties were perused with the      greatest attention and care first they convinced us of your great      truth and sincerity and that you never from the beginning to this      time were inclined to the present disputes and hostilities and      next that you have not included in the articles of the treaty any      of your wishes or inclinations and in short the garden of the      treaty appeared to us in all its parts green and flourishing      but though the fruit of it was excellent yet they appeared      different from those of colonel uptons treaty the particulars of      which i have frequently written to you and upon tasting them      proved to be bitter and very different when compared to the former      articles how can any of the old and established obligations be      omitted and new matters agreed to when it is plain that they will      produce losses and damages some points which you have mentioned      under the plea of the faith and observance of treaties are of such      a nature that the poonah ministers can never assent to them in all      engagements and important transactions in which the words but      and although and besides and whereas and why and other      such words of doubt are introduced it gives an opening to      disputes and misunderstandings a treaty is meant for the entire      removal of all differences not for increase of them my departure      to poonah has therefore been delayed  my lords consider to what ironies and insults this nation was exposed and how necessary it was for us to originate that bill which your lordships passed into an act of parliament with his majestys assent the words but although besides whereas and why and such like are introduced to give an opening and so on then he desires him to send another treaty fit for him to sign       i have therefore kept the treaty with the greatest care and      caution in my possession and having taken a copy of it i have      added to each article another which appeared to me proper and      advisable and without any loss or disadvantage to the english or      anything more in favor of the pundit purdhaun than what was      contained in the former treaties this i have sent to you and hope      that you will prepare and send a treaty conformable to that      without any besides or if or why or but and whereas      that as soon as it arrives i may depart for poonah and having      united with me row mahdajee sindia and having brought over the      nabob nizam ul dowlah to this business i may settle and adjust all      matters which are in this bad situation as soon as i have received      my dismission from thence i would set off for calcutta and      represent to you everything which for a long while i have had on my      mind and by this transaction erect to the view of all the world      the standard of the greatness and goodness of the english and of my      master and extinguish the flames of war with the waters of      friendship the compassing all these advantages and happy prospects      depends entirely upon your will and consent and the power of      bringing them to an issue is in your hands alone  my lords you may here see the necessity there was for passing the act of parliament which i have just read to you in order to prevent in future the recurrence of that want of faith of which mr hastings had been so notoriously guilty and by which he had not only united all india against us and had hindered us from making for a long time any peace at all but had exposed the british character to the irony scorn derision and insult of the whole people of that vast continent                                       my lords in the progress of this impeachment you have heard our charges you have heard the prisoners plea of merits you have heard our observations on them in the progress of this impeachment you have seen the condition in which mr hastings received benares you have seen the condition in which mr hastings received the country of the rohillas you have seen the condition in which he received the country of oude you have seen the condition in which he received the provinces of bengal you have seen the condition of the country when the native government was succeeded by that of mr hastings you have seen the happiness and prosperity of all its inhabitants from those of the highest to those of the lowest rank my lords you have seen the very reverse of all this under the government of mr hastingsthe country itself all its beauty and glory ending in a jungle for wild beasts you have seen flourishing families reduced to implore that pity which the poorest man and the meanest situation might very well call for you have seen whole nations in the mass reduced to a condition of the same distress these things in his government at home abroad scorn contempt and derision cast upon and covering the british name war stirred up and dishonorable treaties of peace made by the total prostitution of british faith now take my lords together all the multiplied delinquencies which we have proved from the highest degree of tyranny to the lowest degree of sharping and cheating and then judge my lords whether the house of commons could rest for one moment without bringing these matters which have baffled all legislation at various times before you to try at last what judgment will do judgment is what gives force effect and vigor to laws laws without judgment are contemptible and ridiculous we had better have no laws than laws not enforced by judgments and suitable penalties upon delinquents revert my lords to all the sentences which have heretofore been passed by this high court look at the sentence passed upon lord bacon look at the sentence passed upon lord macclesfield and then compare the sentences which your ancestors have given with the delinquencies which were then before them and you have the measure to be taken in your sentence upon the delinquent now before you your sentence i say will be measured according to that rule which ought to direct the judgment of all courts in like cases lessening it for a lesser offence and aggravating it for a greater until the measure of justice is completely full                                       my lords i have done the part of the commons is concluded with a trembling solicitude we consign this product of our long long labors to your charge take ittake it it is a sacred trust never before was a cause of such magnitude submitted to any human tribunal  my lords at this awful close in the name of the commons and surrounded by them i attest the retiring i attest the advancing generations between which as a link in the great chain of eternal order we stand we call this nation we call the world to witness that the commons have shrunk from no labor that we have been guilty of no prevarication that we have made no compromise with crime that we have not feared any odium whatsoever in the long warfare which we have carried on with the crimes with the vices with the exorbitant wealth with the enormous and overpowering influence of eastern corruption this war my lords we have waged for twentytwo years and the conflict has been fought at your lordships bar for the last seven years my lords twentytwo years is a great space in the scale of the life of man it is no inconsiderable space in the history of a great nation a business which has so long occupied the councils and the tribunals of great britain cannot possibly be huddled over in the course of vulgar trite and transitory events nothing but some of those great revolutions that break the traditionary chain of human memory and alter the very face of nature itself can possibly obscure it my lords we are all elevated to a degree of importance by it the meanest of us will by means of it more or less become the concern of posterityif we are yet to hope for such a thing in the present state of the world as a recording retrospective civilized posterity but this is in the hands of the great disposer of events it is not ours to settle how it shall be  my lords your house yet standsit stands as a great edifice but let me say that it stands in the midst of ruinsin the midst of the ruins that have been made by the greatest moral earthquake that ever convulsed and shattered this globe of ours my lords it has pleased providence to place us in such a state that we appear every moment to be upon the verge of some great mutations there is one thing and one thing only which defies all mutationthat which existed before the world and will survive the fabric of the world itself i mean justicethat justice which emanating from the divinity has a place in the breast of every one of us given us for our guide with regard to ourselves and with regard to others and which will stand after this globe is burned to ashes our advocate or our accuser before the great judge when he comes to call upon us for the tenor of a wellspent life  my lords the commons will share in every fate with your lordships there is nothing sinister which can happen to you in which we shall not be involved and if it should so happen that we shall be subjected to some of those frightful changes which we have seenif it should happen that your lordships stripped of all the decorous distinctions of human society should by hands at once base and cruel be led to those scaffolds and machines of murder upon which great kings and glorious queens have shed their blood amidst the prelates amidst the nobles amidst the magistrates who supported their thrones may you in those moments feel that consolation which i am persuaded they felt in the critical moments of their dreadful agony  my lords there is a consolation and a great consolation it is which often happens to oppressed virtue and fallen dignity it often happens that the very oppressors and persecutors themselves are forced to bear testimony in its favor i do not like to go for instances a great way back into antiquity i know very well that length of time operates so as to give an air of the fabulous to remote events which lessens the interest and weakens the application of examples i wish to come nearer to the present time your lordships know and have heard for which of us has not known and heard of the parliament of paris the parliament of paris had an origin very very similar to that of the great court before which i stand the parliament of paris continued to have a great resemblance to it in its constitution even to its fall the parliament of paris my lords was it is gone it has passed away it has vanished like a dream it fell pierced by the sword of the comte de mirabeau and yet i will say that that man at the time of his inflicting the deathwound of that parliament produced at once the shortest and the grandest funeral oration that ever was or could be made upon the departure of a great court of magistracy though he had himself smarted under its lash as every one knows who knows his history and he was elevated to dreadful notoriety in
