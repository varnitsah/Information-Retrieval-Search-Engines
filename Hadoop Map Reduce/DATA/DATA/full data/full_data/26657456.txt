umbrella man    xxxix  annaples ambition fallen     chapter i  st ambroses choir    for be it known   that their saints honour is their ownscott   the town of micklethwayte was rising and thriving  there were salubrious springs which an enterprising doctor had lately brought into notice  the firm of greenleaf and dutton manufactured umbrellas in large quantities from the stout weatherproof family roof down to the daintiest fringed toy of a parasol  there were a guild hall and a handsome corn market  there was a modern school for the boys and a high school for the girls and a school of art and a school of cookery and national schools and a british school and a board school also churches of every height chapels of every denomination and iron mission rooms budding out in hopes to be replaced by churches  like one of the animals which zoologists call radiated the town was constantly stretching out fresh arms along country roads all living and working and gradually absorbing the open spaces between  one of these arms was known as st ambroses road in right of the church an incomplete structure in yellow brick consisting of a handsome chancel the stump of a tower and one aisle just weathertight and usable but by its very aspect begging for the completion of the beautiful design that was suspended above the almsbox  it was the evening of a summer day which had been very hot  the choir practice was just over and the boys came out trooping and chattering very small ones they were for as soon as they began to sing tolerably they were sure to try to get into the choir of the old church which had a foundation that fed clothed taught and finally apprenticed them  so though the little fellows were clad in surplices and cassocks and sat in the chancel for correctness sake there was a space round the harmonium reserved for the more trustworthy band of girls and young women who came forth next followed by four or five mechanics  behind came the nucleus of the choira slim fairhaired youth of twenty a neat precise welltrimmed man closely shaven with stooping shoulders at least fifteen years older with a black poodle at his heels as well shorn as his master newly risen from lying outside the church door a gentle somewhat drooping lady in black not yet middleaged and very pretty a small eager unformed blackeyed girl who could hardly keep back her words for the outside of the church door a tall selfpossessed handsome woman with a fine classical cast of features and lastly a brownfaced wiry hardworking clergyman without an atom of superfluous flesh but with an air of great energy  oh vicar where are we to go was the question so eager to break forth  not to the crystal palace nuttie  the funds wont bear it  mr dutton says we must spend as little as possible on locomotion  im sure i dont care for the crystal palace  a trumpery tinsel place all shams  hush hush my dear not so loud said the quiet lady but nuttie only wriggled her shoulders though her voice was a trifle lowered if it were the british museum now or westminster abbey  or the alps chimed in a quieter voice or the ufizzi  now mr dutton thats not what i want  our people arent ready for that but what they have let it be real  miss mary dont you see what i mean  rather better than miss egremont herself said mr dutton  well said the vicar interposing in the wordy war mrs greenleafs children have scarlatina so we cant go to horton bishop  the choice seems to be between south beach and monks horton  thats no harm cried nuttie mrs greenleaf is so patronising  and both that and south beach are so stale said the youth  as if the dear sea could ever be stale cried the young girl  i thought monks horton was forbidden ground said miss mary  so it was with the last regime said the vicar but now the new people are come i expect great things from them  i hear they are very friendly  i expect nothing from them said nuttie so sententiously that all her hearers laughed and asked her exquisite reason as mr dutton put it  lady kirkaldy and a whole lot of them came into the school of art  and didnt appreciate head of antinous by miss ursula egremont was the cry that interrupted her but she went on with dignity unruffledanything so foolish and inane as their whole talk and all their observations i never heard  i dont like this style one of them said  such ugly useless things  i never see anything pretty and neatly finished such as we used to do  the girl gave it in a tone of mimicry of the nonchalant voice adding with fresh imitation and another did not approve of drawing from the lifemodels might be such strange people  my ears were not equally open to their profanities said miss mary i confess that i was struck by the good breeding and courtesy of the leader of the party who i think was lady kirkaldy herself  i saw  i thought she was patronising you and my blood boiled cried nuttie  will boiling blood endure a picnic in the park of so much ignorance folly and patronage asked mr dutton  oh indeed mr dutton nuttie never said that exclaimed gentle mrs egremont  whether it is fully worth the doing is the question said the vicar  grass and shade do not despise said miss mary  there surely must be some ecclesiastical remains said the young man  and there is a river added the vicar  i shall get a stickleback for my aquarium cried nuttie  we shall make some discoveries for the scientific society  i shall note down every individual creature i see  i say you are sure it is not a sham waterfall or temple of tivoli  it would please the choir boys and g f s girls quite as much if not more in that case said miss mary but you need not expect that nuttie  landscapegardening is gone by  even with the county people said nuttie  by at least half a century said mr dutton with all deference to this young ladys experience  it was out of their own mouths cried the girl defiantly  thats all i know about county people and so i hope it will be  come in my dear you are talking very fast interposed mrs egremont with some pain in the soft sweet voice which if it had been a little stronger would have been the best in the choir  these houses in st ambroses road were semidetached  the pair which the party had reached had their entrances at the angles with a narrow gravel path leading by a tiny grass plat to each  one which was covered with a rich pall of purple clematis was the home of mrs egremont her aunt and nuttie the other adorned with a gloire de dijon rose in second bloom was the abode of mary nugent with her mother the widow of a naval captain  farther on with adjoining gardens was another couple of houses in one of which lived mr dutton in the other lodged the youth gerard godfrey together with the partner of the principal medical man  the opposite neighbours were a master of the modern school and a scholar  indeed the saying of the vicar the rev francis spyers was and st ambroses road was proud of it that it was a professional place  every one had something to do either with schools or umbrellas scarcely excepting the doctor and the solicitor for the former attended the pupils and the latter supplied them  mr dutton was a partner in the umbrella factory and lived as the younger folk said as the old bachelor of the road  had he not a housekeeper a poodle and a cat and was not his house with lovely sill boxes full of flowers in the windows the neatest of the neat and did not the tiny conservatory over his diningroom window always produce the flowers most needed for the altar vases and likewise bouquets for the tables of favoured ladies why the very daisies never durst lift their heads on his little lawn which even bore a french lookingglass globe in the centre miss nugent or miss mary as every one still called her as her elder sisters marriage was recent was assistant teacher at the school of art and gave private drawing lessons so as to supplement the pension on which her mother lived they also received girls as boarders attending the high school  so did miss headworth who had all her life been one of those people who seem condemned to toil to make up for the errors or disasters of others  first she helped to educate a brother and soon he had died to leave an orphan daughter to be bred up at her cost  the girl had married from her first situation but had almost immediately lost her husband at sea and on this her aunt had settled at micklethwayte to make a home for her and her child at first taking pupils but when the high school was set up changing these into boarders while mrs egremont went as daily governess to the children of a family of somewhat higher pretensions  little ursula or nuttie as she was called according to the local contraction was like the child of all the party and after climbing up through the high school to the last form hoped after passing the cambridge examination to become a teacher there in another year     chapter ii  monks horton    and we will all the pleasures prove   by shallow rivers by whose falls   melodious birds sing madrigalsold ballad   it was holidaytime and liberties were taken such as were not permissible when they might have afforded a bad precedent to the boarders  therefore when two afternoons later mary nugent returning from district visiting came out into her garden behind the house she was not scandalised to see a pair of little black feet under a holland skirt resting on a laurel branch and going a few steps more she beheld a big shady hat and a pair of little hands busy with a pencil and a blank book as ursula sat on the low wall between the gardens shaded by the laburnum which facilitated the ascent on her own side  oh miss mary  delicious  come up here  you dont know how charming this is  she moved aside so as to leave the ascentby an inverted flowerpot and a laurel branchopen to her friend thus knocking down one of the pile of books which she had taken to the top of the wall  miss nugent picked it up marie stuart  is this your way of studying her  now you know tis holiday time and volunteer work besides she was waiting for you and i could not help doing this  she held out a hand which was scarcely needed and mary sprang lightly to share her perch upon the wall  look here  am i to guess the subject as in the game of historic outlines said miss nugent as the book was laid on her lap  it looks like a modernno a mediaevaledition of marcus curtius about to leap into the capital opening for a young man only with his dogs instead of his horse  that hound seems very rationally to object  now dont  guess in earnest  a compliment to your name  the boy of egremont poor fellow just about to bound across the strid  exactly  i always feel sure that my father must have done something like this  was it so heroic said miss mary you know it was for the hundredth time and he had no reason to expect any special danger  oh but his mother was waiting and he had to go  now ill tell you how it must have been with my father  you know he sailed away in a yacht before i was born and poor mother never saw him again but i know what happened  there was a ship on fire like the birkenhead and the little yacht went near to pick up the people and my father called out like sir humphrey gilbert            do not fear heaven is as near            by water as by land   and the little yacht was so close when the great ship blew up that it got sucked down in the whirlpool and rescuers and all died a noble death together  has your mother been telling you asked miss mary  oh no she never mentions him  she does not know  no one does but i am quite sure he died nobly with no one to tell the tale only the angels to look on and that makes it all the finer  or just suppose he was on a desert island all the time and came back again to find us  i sometimes think he is  what  when you are quite sure of the other theory  i mean i am quite sure while i am thinking about it or reading robinson crusoe or the swiss family  oh  miss mary has no one ever told you anything about my father  no one  they never tell me  mother cries and aunt ursula puts on her theresanendofit look  do you think there is anything they are waiting to tell me till i am older  if there were i am sure you had better not try to find it out beforehand  you dont think i would do anything of that sort  but i thought you might know  do you remember their first settling here  scarcely  i was a very small child then  miss nugent had a few vague recollections which she did not think it expedient to mention  a dim remembrance rose before her of mysterious whisperings about that beautiful young widow and that it had been said that the rector of the old church had declared himself to know the ladies well and had heartily recommended them  she thought it wiser only to speak of having been one of their first scholars telling of the awe miss headworth inspired but the pleasure it was to bring a lesson to pretty mrs egremont who always rewarded a good one with a kiss and she was so nice to kissyes and is  aunt ursel and mother both were governesses continued the girl and yet they dont want me to go out  they had rather i was a teacher at the high school  they dont want to trust their little bear out in the world  i think it is more than that said the girl  i cant help thinking that hemy fathermust have been some one rather grand with such a beautiful name as alwyn piercefield egremont  yes i know it was that for i saw my baptismal certificate when i stood for the scholarship it was dieppeursula alice daughter of alwyn piercefield and alice elizabeth egremont may 15 1860  james everetti think he was the chaplain at dieppe  mary nugent thought it the wisest way to laugh and say you of all people in the world to want to make out a connection with the aristocracy  true love is different said ursula  he must have been cast off by his family for her sake and have chosen poverty       to make the croon a pund my alwyn gaed to sea       and the croon and the pund they were baith for me   miss mary did not think a yacht a likely place for the conversion of a croon into a pound and the utter silence of mother and aunt did not seem to her satisfactory but she feared either to damp the youthful enthusiasm for the lost father or to foster curiosity that might lead to some painful discovery so she took refuge in an inarticulate sound  i think mr dutton knows proceeded nuttie  you dont mean to ask him  catch me  i know how he would look at me  slang  a forfeit  oh its holiday time and the boarders cant hear  theres mr duttons door  this might in one way be a relief to miss nugent but she did not like being caught upon the wall and therefore made a rapid descent though not without a moments entanglement of skirt which delayed her long enough to show where she had been as mr dutton was at the same moment advancing to his own wall on the opposite side of the nugent garden perhaps he would have pretended to see nothing but for nutties cry of glee  you wicked elf said miss mary to inveigle people into predicaments and then go shouting ho ho ho like robin goodfellow himself  you should have kept your elevation and dignity like me retorted ursula and then you would have had the pleasure of seeing mr dutton climbing his wall and coming to our feet  mischievous elves deserve no good news said mr dutton who was by no means so venerable that the crossing the wall was any effort or compromise of dignity and who had by this time joined mary on her grass plat  oh what is it  are we to go to monks horton cried nuttie  here is a gracious permission from lord kirkaldy the only stipulations being that no vestiges of the meal such as sandwich papers or gooseberry skins be left on the grass and that nobody does any mischief he added in an awful tone of personality  so if i see anybody rooting up holly trees i shall be bound to interfere  now mr dutton it was only a baby holly in a chink  only a holly tree  just like the giants daughter when she only carried off waggon peasant oxen and all in her pinafore  it is not longer than my finger now  well remember mischief either wanton or scientific is forbidden you are to set an example to the choirboys  scientific mischief is a fatal thing to rare plants said mary  if im not to touch anything i may as well stay at home pouted nuttie  you may gather as many buttercups and daisies as the sweet child pleases said mr dutton whereupon she threatened to throw her books at his head  miss nugent asked how they were to go and mr dutton explained that there was only a quarter of a miles walk from the station that return tickets would be furnished at a tariff of fourpence a head and that there would be trains at 115 and 730  how hungry the children will be  they will eat all the way  thats the worst of this sort of outing they eat to live and live to eat  at least they dont eat at church said nuttie  not since the peppermint day when mr spyers suspended dickie drake put in mary  and the spa terrace church people said it was incense  no  nuttie  indeed they did  louisa barnet attacked us about it at school and i said i wished it had been  only they mustnt eat peppermint in the train for it makes mother quite ill  do you mean that mrs egremont will come exclaimed mr dutton  oh yes she shall  it is not too far and it will be very good for her  i shall make her  theres young englands filial duty said mary  why i know what is good for her and she always does as i wish  beneficent despotism said mr dutton  may i ask if miss headworth is an equally obedient subject  oh aunt ursel is very seldom tiresome  nuttie nuttie my dear and a head with the snows of more than half a century appeared on the other side of the wall under a cap and parasol  i am sorry to interrupt you but it is cool enough for your mother to go into the town and i wish you to go with her     chapter iii  heir hunting    and she put on her gown of green   and left her mother at sixteen        to marry peter bellwordsworth   in the shrubberies of monks horton were walking a lady somewhat past middle age but full of activity and vigour with one of those bright faces that never grow old and with her a young man a few years over twenty with a grave and almost careworn countenance  more and more confidential waxed the conversation for the lady was making fresh acquaintance with a nephew seldom seen since he had been her pet and darling as almost a baby and he was experiencing the inexpressible charm of tone and manner that recalled the young mother he had lost in early boyhood  then your mind is made up she said you are quite right to decide on having a profession but how does your father take it  he is quite convinced that to repeat my uncles life dangling on as heir would be the most fatal mistake  assuredly and all the legal knowledge you acquire is so much in favour of your usefulness as the squire  if i ever am the squire of which i have my doubts  you expect mr egremont to marry  not a future marriage but one in the past  a private marriage  do you suspect it  i dont suspect iti know it  i have been hoping to talk the matter over with you  do you remember our first governess miss headworth  my dear mark did i not lose at pera the charms of your infancy  then neither my mother nor my grandmother ever wrote to you about her  i do remember that it struck me that immunity from governesses was a compensation for the lack of daughters  can you tell me no details said mark anxiously  have you no letters  it was about the time when blanche was born when we were living at raxley  i am sorry to say that our roving life prevented my keeping old letters  i have often regretted it  let me see there was one who boxed mays ears  that was long after  i think it was that womans barbarity that made my father marry again and a very good thing that was  it was wretched before  miss headworth was in my own mothers time  i begin to remember something happening that your mother seemed unable to write about and your grandmother said that she had been greatly upset by that miserable affair but i was never exactly told what it had been  miss headworth came when i was four or five years old  edda as we used to call her in mays language was the first person who gave me a sense of beauty  she had dark eyes and a lovely complexion  i remember in after times being silenced for saying not so pretty as my edda  i was extremely fond of her enough to have my small jealousy excited when my uncle joined us in our walks and monopolised her turning may and me over to play with his dog  but mark mr egremont is some years older than your father  he could not have been a young man at that time  so much the worse  most likely he seemed to her quite paternal the next thing i recollect was our being in the isle of wight we two children with miss headworth and the german nurse and our being told of our new sister  uncle alwyn and his yacht were there and we went on board once or twice  then matters became confused with me i recollect a confusion papa and grandmamma suddenly arriving everybody seeming to us to have become very cross our dear miss headworth nowhere to be found our attendants being changed and our being forbidden to speak of her again  i certainly never thought of the matter till a month ago  you know my uncles eyes have been much affected by his illness and he has made a good deal of use of me he has got a valet a fellow of no particular country more savoyard than anything else i fancy  he is a legacy like other evils from the old general and seems a sort of necessity to my uncles existence gregorio they call him  he was plainly used to absolute government and viewed the coming down amongst us as an assertion of liberty much against his will  we could see that he was awfully jealous of my father and me and would do anything to keep us out but providentially he cant write english decently though he can speak any language you please  well the man and i came into collision about a scamp of a groom who was doing intolerable mischief in the village and whom they put it on me to get discharged  on that occasion mr gregorio grew insolent and intimated to me that i need not make so sure of the succession  he knew that which might make the chanoine and me change our note  well my father is always for avoiding rows he said it was an unmeaning threat it was of no use to complain of gregorio and we must digest his insolence  but just after uncle alwyn sent me to hunt up a paper that was missing and in searching a writingcase i came upon an unmistakable marriage certificate between alwyn piercefield egremont and alice headworth and then the dim recollections i told you of began to return  what did you do  i thought i had better consult my father expecting to hear that she was dead and that no further notice need be taken of the matter but he was greatly disturbed to hear of the certificate and would hardly believe me  he said that some friend of my grandmother had written her word of goings on at freshwater between his brother and the young governess and that they went off at once to put a stop to it but found us left with the german maid who declared that miss headworth had gone off with mr egremont in the yacht  no more was heard of my uncle for six weeks and when he came back there was a great row with the old general but he absolutely denied being married  i am afraid that was all the old sinner wished and they went off together in the yacht to the west indies where it was burnt but they as you know never came to england again going straight off to the mediterranean having their headquarters at sorrento and cruising about till the generals death ten years ago  yes i once met them at florence and thought them two weary pitiable men  one looked at the general as a curious relic of the old buck of the regency days and compassionated his nephew for having had his life spoilt by dangling after the old man  it was a warning indeed and i am glad you have profited by it mark  he came back after the old man died to club life in london and seldom has been near the old place indeed it has been let till recently and he wants to let it again but it is altogether too dilapidated for that without repairs  so he came down to see about it and was taken ill there  but to return to what my father told me he was shocked to hear of the certificate for he had implicitly believed his brothers denial of the marriage and he said miss headworth was so childish and simple that she might easily have been taken in by a sham ceremony  he said that he now saw he had done very wrong in letting his motherinlaw take all the letters about that unhappy business off his hands without looking at them but he was much engrossed by my mothers illness and as he said it never occurred to him as a duty to trace out what became of the poor thing and see that she was provided for safely  you know mrs egremont says laissez faire is our family failing and that our first thought is how not to do it  yes utter repudiation of such cases was the line taken by the last generation and i am afraid my mother would be very severe  another thing that actuated my father was the fear of getting his brother into trouble with general egremont as he himself would have been the one to profit by it  so i do not wonder so much at his letting the whole drop without inquiry and never even looking at the letters which there certainly were  i could not get him to begin upon it with my uncle but mrs egremont was strongly on my side in thinking that such a thing ought to be looked into and as i had found the paper it would be best that i should speak  besides that there was no enduring that gregorio should be pretending to hold us in terror by such hints  well and has there been a wife and family in a cottage all this time  aunt margaret he has never seen or heard of her since he left her at dieppe  would you believe it he thinks himself a victim  he never meant more than to amuse himself with the pretty little governess and he took on board a mr and mrs houghton to do propriety shady sort of people i imagine but that she did not know  i have heard of them said lady kirkaldy significantly  she must have been a kind friend to the poor girl said mark  on some report that lady de lyonnais was coming down on her wrathful and terrible the poor foolish girl let herself be persuaded to be carried off in the yacht but there mrs houghton watched over her like a dragon  she made them put in at some little place in jersey put in the banns all unknown to my uncle and got them married each was trying to outwit the other while miss headworth herself was quite innocent and unconscious and i dont know whether to call it an excuse for uncle alwyn or not but to this hour he is not sure whether it was a legal marriage and my father believes it was not looking on it as a youthful indiscretion  he put her in lodgings at dieppe under mrs houghtons protection while he returned home on a peremptory summons from the general  he found the old man in such a state of body and mind as he tries to persuade me was an excuse for denying the whole thing and from that time he represents himself as bound hand and foot by the generals tyranny  he meant to have kept the secret given her an allowance and run over from time to time to see her but he only could get there once before the voyage to the west indies  the whole affair was as he said complicated by his debts those debts that the estate has never paid off  the general probably distrusted him for he curtailed his allowance and scarcely let him out of sight and hehe submitted for the sake of his prospects and thinking the old man much nearer his end than he proved to be  i declare as i listened it came near to hearing him say he had sold his soul to satan  from the day he sailed in the ninon he has never written never attempted any communication with the woman whose life he had wrecked except one inquiry at dieppe and that was through gregorio  what the valet  yes  i believe i seemed surprised at such a medium being employed for uncle alwyn explained that the man had got hold of the secret somehowservants always know everythingand being a foreigner he was likely to be able to trace her out  i daresay he profited by the knowledge to keep alwyn in bondage during the old mans lifetime  i have no doubt of it and he expected to play the same game with me the fellow reminds me whenever i look at him of a sort of incarnate familiar demon  when i asked my uncle whether he could guess what had become of her he held up his hands with a hideous french grimace  i could have taken him by the throat  nay one must pity him  the morals of george ivs set had been handed on to him by the general said lady kirkaldy rejoicing in the genuine indignation of the young face free from all taint of vice if somewhat rigid  and what now  he assured me that he could make all secure to my father and me as if that were the important point but finally he perceived that we had no right to stand still without endeavouring to discover whether there be a nearer heir and my father made him consent to my making the search grinning at its quixotism all the time  have you done anything  yes  i have been to jersey seen the registerjuly 20 1859and an old frenchspeaking clerk who perfectly recollected the party coming from the yacht and spoke of her as tres belle  i have also ascertained that there is no doubt of the validity of the marriage then deeply mistrusting master gregorio i went on to dieppe where i entirely failed to find any one who knew or remembered anything about themthere is such a shifting population of english visitors and residents and it was so long ago  i elicited from my uncle that she had an aunt he thought of the same name as herself but my father cannot remember who recommended her or anything that can be a clue has any one looked over my grandmothers letters  i think not  my brother spoke of keeping them till i came to london that might give a chance or the houghtons might know about her  i think my husband could get them hunted up  they are sure to be at some continental resort  whats that as a sound of singing was heard  auld langsyne  the natives are picnicking in the ravine below there  they used to be rigidly excluded but we cant stand that and this is the first experiment of admitting them on condition that they dont make themselves obnoxious  which they cant help  we have yet to see if this is worse than an austrian or italian festival  see we can look down from behind this yew tree  it really is a pretty sight from this distance  theres the cleric heading his little boys and their cricket and there are the tuneful party in the fern on the opposite side  they have rather good voices unless they gain by distance  and theres a girl botanising by the river  sentimentalising over forgetmenots more likely  my dear mark for a specimen of young england you are greatly behindhand in perception of progress  ah you are used to foreigners aunt margaret  you have never fathomed english vulgarity  it would serve you right to send you to carry the invitation to go round the gardens and houses  do you mean it aunt  mean it  dont you see your uncle advancing down the roadthereaccosting the clergymanwhats his nameeither towers or spiressomething ecclesiastical i know  we only waited to reconnoitre and see whether the numbers were unmanageable  and yet he does not want to sit for micklethwayte  so you think no one can be neighbourly except for electioneering o mark i must take you in hand  meantime the host is collecting  i abscond  which is the least showy part of the establishment  i recommend the coal cellarand as he went offpoor boy he is a dear good fellow but how little he knows how to be laughed at     chapter iv  a name    sigh no more lady lady sigh no more     men were deceivers ever   one foot on sea and one on land     to one thing constant neverold ballad   so you have ventured out again said lady kirkaldy as her nephew strolled up to her afternoon teatable under a great cedar tree  the coast being clear and only distant shouts being heard in the ravine            like an army defeated             the choir retreated             and now doth fare well             in the valleys soft swell  said the aunt  at least you have survived or is this the reaction said the nephew putting on a languid air  there were some very nice people among them on whom the pictures were by no means thrown away  what would you say mark if i told you that i strongly suspect that i have seen your lost aunt  nonsense cried mark as emphatically as disrespectfully  i am not joking in the least said lady kirkaldy looking up at him i heard the name of egremont and made out that it belonged to a very ladylike prettylooking woman in gray and white she seemed to be trying to check and tame a bright girl of eighteen or so who was in a perfect state of rapture over the vandykes  i managed to ask the clergyman who the lady was and he told me she was a mrs egremont who lives with her aunt a miss headworth who boards girls for the high school very worthy people he added  headworth  yes  but if it were she would have known your name  hardly  the title had not come in those days and if she heard of us at all it would be as kerrs  i ventured further to put out a feeler by asking whether he knew what her husband had been and he said he believed he had been lost at sea but he mr spyers i mean had only been at micklethwayte three or four years and had merely known her as a widow  i suppose it is worth following up said mark rather reluctantly i wish i had seen her  i think i should know miss headworth again and she would hardly know me  you see what comes of absconding  after all it was best said mark  supposing her to be the real woman which i dont expect it might have been awkward if she had heard my name  how can we ascertain the history of this person without committing ourselves  lord kirkaldy an able man who had been for many years a diplomatist here joined the party and the whole story was laid before him  he was new to micklethwayte having succeeded a somewhat distant kinsman and did not know enough of the place to be able to fix on any one to whom to apply for information but the result of the consultation was that lady kirkaldy should go alone to call on miss headworth and explain that she was come to inquire about a young lady of the same name who had once been governess to the children of her sister lady adelaide egremont  mark was rather a study to his uncle and aunt all the evening  he was as upright and honourable as the day and not only acted on high principle but had a tender feeling to the beautiful playfellow governess no doubt enhanced by painful experiences of successors chosen for their utter dissimilarity to her  still it was evidently rather flat to find himself probably so near the tangible goal of his romantic search and the existence of a first cousin had been startling to him though his distaste was more to the taking her from secondrate folk in a country town than to the overthrow of his own heirship  at least so he manifestly and honestly believed and knowing it to be one of those faiths that make themselves facts the kirkaldys did not disturb him in it nor commiserate him for a loss which they thought the best thing possible for him  miss headworth was accustomed to receive visitors anent boarders so when lady kirkaldys card was brought to her the first impression was that some such arrangement was to be made  she was sitting in her pretty little drawingroom alone for nuttie and her mother had gone out for a walk with miss nugent  the room opening on the garden and cool with blinds had a certain homely grace about the faded furniture  the drawings on the walls were good the work quaint and tasteful  there was a grand vase of foxgloves before the empty grate and some marshal nial roses in a glass on the table  the old lady herselfwith alert black eyes and a sweet expressionrose from her chair in the window to receive her guest  lady kirkaldy felt reassured as to the refinement of the surroundings and liked the gentle but selfpossessed tones of the old lady  she noticed the foxgloves  yes said miss headworth they are the fruits of yesterdays expedition  my two children as i call them brought them home in triumph  i cannot tell you what pleasure lord kirkaldys kindness gave themand many more  i am glad said the lady while she said to herself now for it and sat forward  it struck me she said on hearing your name that you might be related toto a young lady who lived a good while ago in the family of my sister lady adelaide egremont  a strange look came into miss headworths eyes her lips trembled she clutched tightly the arm of her chair but then cast a puzzled glance at her visitor  perhaps if you heard of me then said the latter it was as lady margaret kerr  yes said miss headworth then pausing she collected herself and said in an anxious voice  do i understand that your ladyship is come to inquire for my niece being aware of the circumstances  i only became aware of them yesterday said lady kirkaldy  i was in turkey at the time and no particulars were given to me but my nephew mark egremont your nieces old pupil came to consult us having just discovered among his uncles papers evidence of the marriage of which of course he had been ignorant  then exclaimed miss headworth holding her hands tightly clasped shall i really see justice done at last to my poor child  it is young marks most earnest wish and his fatherlady kirkaldy hesitated for a word and miss headworth put in  his father  why would he never even acknowledge either alices letters or mine  we wrote several times both to him and lady adelaide and never received any reply except one short one desiring he might not be troubled on such a subject  it was cruel alice said it was not in his writing  she had done very wrong and the family might well be offended but a poor child like her just eighteen might have been treated with some pity  my sister was in declining health  he was very much engrossed  he left the matter toto others said lady kirkaldy  he is very sorry now that he acquiesced in what was then thought right  he did not then know that there had been a marriage  i should have thought in that case a clergyman would have been bound to show the more compassion  lady kirkaldy knew that the cruel silence had been chiefly the work of the stem puritan pitilessness of her mother so she passed this over saying we are all very anxious to atone as far as possible for what is past but we know little or nothing only what my nephew mark has been able to gather  little mark  alice always talked of him with great affection  how pleased she will be to hear of his remembering her  would you object to telling me what you know of this history said lady kirkaldy  i am afraid it is very painful to you but i think we should understand it clearly  please speak to me as a friend as woman to woman  your ladyship is very kind said the poor old lady  i have only mentioned the subject once since we came to settle here seventeen years ago but such things one cannot forget  if you will excuse me i have some dates that will assist my accuracy  she hurried away and came back in a few moments having evidently dried some tears perhaps of thankfulness but she paused as if reluctant to begin  i think your niece had no nearer relation than yourself said lady kirkaldy anxious to set her off and at ease  oh no or she never would have been so treated  she was an orphan my poor brother was a curate  he marriedas young men willon insufficient means his strength gave way and he died of diphtheria when this poor child was only two years old  indeed two little ones died at the same time and the mother married again and went to shanghai  she did not long live there poor thing and little alice was sent home to me  i thought i did my best for her by keeping her at a good school  i have often wished that i had given up my situation and become an assistant there so as to have her more under my own eyes but i fancied it important to receive a salary out of which i could save  i am wearying your ladyship but i cant but dwell on the excuses for my poor child  indeed i wish to hear all the details was the sincere and gentle answer  i had her with me generally in the holidays and i confess i was absolutely alarmed to see how pretty the child was growing knowing how great a disadvantage it often is  she was always a good girl not naturally so studious as could be wished but docile merry gentle a favourite with every one and peculiarly innocent and childish  i wished her to remain a few years longer as teacher but it so happened that lady adelaide egremont coming to consult the head of the establishment about a nurserygoverness saw alice and was so much struck with her sweet face which was all sunshine then as to insist on engaging her  ah my dear sister i remember her enthusiastic letter about her pretty governess and her boys affection for her an affection that has lasted  it seemed so safe  a clergymans family in the country and so kind a lady at the head that though alice had been educated for a superior governess it appeared the best beginning she could have and she was very happy and met with great kindness  only unfortunately lady adelaide was delicate and for many weeks entirely confined to the sofa  mr egremonts elder brother was much there  he seemed to my poor inexperienced child quite elderly and his attentions like those ofof an old uncleshe told me afterwards  he must really have been over forty  no doubt my poor alice was unguarded  we know what a merry happy childish girl may be but i never heard that her conduct was even censured while she remained at baxley though i find that captain egremont used to join them in their walks under pretext of playing with the children  then she was sent to freshwater with the two eldest children during lady adelaides confinement and there most unjustifiably captain egremont continually visited them from his yacht and offered to take them out in it  alice knew she ought not to go without a married lady on board and he brought a mr and mrs houghton to call who were very kind and caressing to her and the children so that she thought all was right  oh lady kirkaldy i dont mean to defend her i daresay she was very giddy and silly she reproaches herself poor dear but i do say that a wicked advantage was taken of her innocence and ignorance  she says that she had begun to grow a little uneasy at the way people looked when captain egremont joined them on the beach and the nurse a german said something that she could not understand  on the 1st of julyyesbut i have the date herecame a telegram to the hotel to have rooms for lady de lyonnais and mr egremont ready by the evening  the whole place knew it and some meddling person burst on alice with the news roughly and coarsely given that they were coming to call her to account for her goings on captain egremont found her crying in the utmost terror andshe really hardly knew what he said to hershe thinks he offered to shelter her on board the ninon from lady de lyonnais first wrath while he and mrs houghton explained matters but she cannot tell for she lost her senses with fright only knew that he was kind and sweet to her in her distress and thought only of escaping  well i dont excuse her  of course it was the most terrible and fatal thing she could have done and the good old lady was quite overcome and lady kirkaldy had tears in her eyes as she said  it was frightful follybut she was guarded  yes her innocence was guarded thank god said miss headworth fervently  you see she did know that mr and mrs houghton were on board and mrs houghton was a truly kind protector who deserved her confidence though poor lady she admitted to me that her own conduct had not beenstrictly correct  how long was it before you heard of her  there was a dreadful letter from mr egremont enclosing what was due of her salary and then i heard no more for seven months  i went to the isle of wight and made all inquiries but the nurse and children had gone away immediately and i could obtain no trace of them  then sheyour niece never wrote  she was afraid poor dear  she had never been at her ease with me her mother had taught her to think me strict and harsh and she had never opened to me in those days  besides he had forbidden her  at last however in january came a letter from this mrs houghton telling me that my alice was very unwell at dieppe that nothing had been heard of her husband captain egremont to whom she had been married on the 20th of july at st philippe in jersey and that she herself was obliged to leave the place almost immediately but she would if possible wait till my arrival as mrs egremont was not in a condition to be left alone  my dear friends with whom i was then living were as kind as possible and set me free to go  i was there in three days and truly the dear beautiful merry girl i had parted with only a year before was a sad piteous sight  mrs houghton seemed brokenhearted at leaving her thinking there was little chance of her living but mr houghton who i am afraid was a professed gambler had got into some scrape and was gone to paris where she had to follow him  she told me all about it and how when captain egremont fancied that a marriage in the channel islands was one he could play fast and loose with she had taken care that the formalities should be such as to make all secure  foolish and wrong as poor alice had been she had awakened all the best side of that poor womans nature and no mother could have been more careful and tender  she gave me the certificatehere it isand assured me that it would hold good  i have shown it to a lawyer and he said the same but when i sent a copy to mr egremont my letter was returned unopened  captain egremont had denied the marriage and they believed him said lady kirkaldy  it is hard to believe that he could be so heartless but he was in bondage to the old general egremont and dreaded losing his inheritance  so he told them in his one visit to dieppe  he said he must keep his marriage secret but promised an allowance on condition that alice would live quietly at dieppe and not communicate with any one of her own family or his  he had left £100 with her but that was nearly gone and she had never heard from him  it had preyed on her and she was so ill that i never expected any more than mrs houghton to see her recover  i stayed there with her she could not be moved even if she would have consented when she was continually expecting him but at lastfour days after her little girl was borncame the news of the ninon having been burnt with all on board three months before  do you know strange to say though i had feared so much to tell her she began to revive from that time  the suspense and watching were over she saw that he had not deserted her and believed that he had loved her to the last  she cried a great deal but it was in a peaceful natural way  i wrote then as i had already written to lady adelaide and to mr egremont but was not answered  i can account for that said lady kirkaldy  my sister had been ordered to madeira in the autumn and there they remained till her death in may  all the letters were sent to my mother and she did not think fit to forward or open any bearing on the subject  in the meantime mr egremont was presented to the family living and on his return moved to bridgefield egremont  and you came here  of course i could not part with my poor alice again  mr and mrs fordyce whose daughter i had long ago educated had always kept up a correspondence with me and knowing all the story proposed to me to come here  he was then rector of the old church and by their help and recommendation with such capital as i had we were able to begin a little school and though that has had to give way to the high school what with boarders and with alices employment as daily governess we have i am thankful to say gone on very well and comfortably and my dear child has recovered her cheerfulness though she can never be quite whati think she was meant to be said the old lady with a sad smile though perhaps she is something better  do you think she was absolutely convinced of his death  do you mean that he is alive exclaimed miss headworth in dismay oh he is a wickeder man than even i supposed to have forsaken her all these years  is my poor child in his power  must her peace now she has attained it be disturbed  there is a great deal to take into consideration said lady kirkaldy i had better tell you how this visit of mine came about and explain some matters about the egremont family  she then told how captain egremont after a brief service in the life guards had been made to retire that the old general whose heir he was might keep him in attendance on him  already selfindulgent and extravagant the idleness of the life he led with the wornout old roue had deadened his better feelings and habituated him to dissipation while his debts his expensive habits and his dread of losing the inheritance had bound him over to the general  both had been saved from the fire in the ninon whence they were picked up by a chilian vessel and they had been long in communicating with home the general hated england and was in broken health  he had spent the remaining years of his life at various continental resorts where he could enjoy a warm climate combined with facilities for high play  when at length he died captain egremont had continued the life to which he had become accustomed and had of late manifested an expectation that his nephew mark should play the same part by him as he had done by the general but the youth bred in a very different tone would on no account thus surrender himself to an evil bondage indeed he felt all the severity of youthful virtue and had little toleration for his uncles ways of thinking though when the old man had come home ill dejected and half blind he had allowed himself to be made useful on business matters  and thus he had discovered the marriage and had taken up the cause with the ardour stimulated by a chivalrous feeling for the beautiful vision of his childhood whose sudden disappearance had ended his brightest days  i suppose it is right and generous of the young man said miss headworth  but since thethe man is alive i wish my poor alice could have been left at peace  you forget that her daughter has rights which must be taken into consideration  little nuttie  dear child  i should so far like her to be provided for so far as that she need not go out in the world to earn her own livelihood  but no better be as we are than accept anything from that man  i quite understand and respect your feeling miss headworth returned the lady but may i return to my question whether you think your niece has any doubt of her husband being dead  miss headworth considered  since you ask me i think she has kept the possibility of the life before her  we have never mentioned the subject and as i said the belief in his death ended a great suspense and sense of wounded affection  she began soon and vigorously to turn her attention to the support of her child and has found a fair measure of happiness but at the same time she has shrunk from all notice and society more than would be natural in so very young a widow and so attractive more than i should have expected from her original character  and once when she did apprehend symptoms of admiration she insisted that i should tell the history enough as she said to make it plain that it was impossible  there was one night too when she had scarlatina and was a little lightheaded only four years ago when she talked a good deal about his coming back but that might have been only the old impression on her brain of that long watching at dieppe  hecaptain egremont does not yet know where she is  no certainly not  but i fear he must  i suppose he ought sighed miss headworth but in the meantime till we know what line he takes surely she need not be unsettled by the knowledge of his existence  by no means  you had better act as you think best about that  but you will not object to my nephew her old pupil mark coming to see her  i will make him promise not to enter upon the subject  miss headworth had only time to make a sign of reluctant acquiescence when the door opened and mother and daughter came in  nuttie first eager as usual and openmouthed unaware that any one was there for lady kirkaldy wishing to avoid talk and observation had left her carriage at the livery stables and walked to st ambrose road  the girl whom in a moment she classed as small dark and oddly like may egremont stopped short at sight of a stranger the mother would have retreated but for miss headworths nervous call alice my dear here is lady kirkaldy  very lovely was lady kirkaldys impression as she saw a slender figure in a dark gray linen dress and a face of refined though not intellectual beauty and sweetness under a large straw hat with a good deal of white gauziness about it and the curtsey was full of natural grace  you do not know me said lady kirkaldy taking her hand but i am aunt to some former pupils of yours one of whom mark egremont is very anxious to come and see you  mark  my dear little mark and her face lighted up  how very kind of him  but he is not little mark now  he is not a very big mark either  most of the egremonts are small i see your daughter takes after them said lady kirkaldy shaking hands with ursula who looked at her in unmitigated amazement  alice faltered something about lady adelaide  my dear sister fell into a decline and died while the three children were still babies  poor things i believe they had a sad time till their father married a miss condamine who has been an excellent stepmother to them  i have been to see them but mark was not then at home so he has come to me at monks horton  when will he find you at home  or may i bring him in at once  he was to meet me at micklethwayte  i should like very much to see him was the answer  and miss headworth was obliged to say something about her ladyship taking a cup of tea  lady kirkaldy knowing that mark was on the watch set off in search of him and found him as she expected pacing the pavement in front of the church  there was no great distance in which to utter her explanations and cautions warning him of her promise that the intelligence of the husbands being alive was to be withheld for a fitter time but he promised dutifully and his aunt then took him in with her  the recognition of her claims was a less stunning shock to alice egremont than to her aunt  shielded by her illness as well as by her simplicity and ignorance she had never been aware of her aunts attempted correspondence with the egremonts nor of their deafness to appeals made on her behalf  far less had it ever occurred to her that the validity of her marriage could be denied and the heinous error of her elopement seemed to her quite sufficient to account for her having been so entirely cast off by the family  the idea that as wife or widow she had any claims on them or that ursula might have rights above those of mark had not come into her mind which indeed at the moment was chiefly occupied by the doubt whether the milk was come in and by ordering in the best teacups presented by the boarders  thus she was in the passage when mark entered and his exclamation instantly was oh edda dear old edda  you arent a bit altered and he put his head under her hat and kissed her adding as she seemed rather startled you are my aunt you know and wheres my cousin you are ursula  he advanced upon nuttie took her by the hand and kissed her forehead before she was aware but she flashed at him with her black eyes and looked stiff and defiant  she had no notion of kisses to herself still less to her pretty mother whom she protected with a half proud half jealous fondness  how could the man presume to call her by that foolish name  however that single effusion had exhausted marks powers of cordiality or else nutties stiffness froze him  they were all embarrassed and had reason to be grateful to lady kirkaldys practised powers as a diplomates wife  she made the most of mrs egremonts shy spasmodic inquiries and marks jerks of information such as that they were all living at bridgefield egremont now that his sister may was very like his new cousin that blanche was come out and was very like his mother etc etc  every one was more at ease when lady kirkaldy carried the conversation off to yesterdays entertainment hoping no one had been overtired and the like  mrs egremont lighted up a little and began telling some of the expressions of delight she had heard and in the midst nuttie waking from her trance of stiff displeasure came plump in with oh and theres a watersoldier a real stratiotes aculeatus in your lake  may we get it  mr dutton didnt think we ought but it would be such a prize  ursula means a rare waterplant said mrs egremont gently seeing that lady kirkaldy had no notion of the treasure she possessed  she and some of her friends are very eager botanists  i am sure you may said the lady amused  thank you  then o mother  miss mary and i will go  and well wait till after office hours and then gerard godfrey can come and fish it out for us  oh thank you  he wants the pattern of the abbots cross for an illumination and he can get some ferns for the church  soon after this ebullition lady kirkaldy carried off her nephew and his first utterance outside the door was a woman like that will be the salvation of my uncle  firstly if you can bring them together said his aunt and secondly if there is stuff enough in that pretty creature     chapter v  suspense    where shall the traitor rest   he the deceiverscott   poor miss headworths peace of mind was utterly destroyed  that the niece whom she had nursed back to life and happiness and brought to love her as a mother should be at the mercy of a man whom she looked on as a heartless profligate was dreadful to her beyond measure and it involved ursulas young life likewise  could it be a duty after these eighteen years to return to him  what legal rights had he to enforce the resumption of the wife he had deserted  i will consult mr dutton said the old lady to herself mr dutton is the only person who knows the particulars  he will give me the best advice  and while miss headworth over her evening toilette was coming to this resolution in one bedroom nuttie in another was standing aghast at her mothers agitation and receiving a confession which filled her with astonishment  i cant think why that gentleman should go and be so affectionate all on a sudden quoth nuttie if he is my cousin and so fond of you why couldnt he have come to see us before  oh nuttie dear you dont understand why it is so good of him  my dear now this has come i must tell youyou must hearthe sad thing your mother did  yes my dear i was their governessandand i did notin short my dear i eloped  you mother  oh what fun cried the girl in the utter extremity of wonder  nuttie exclaimed mrs egremont in a tone of horror and indignationnay of apprehension  o motheri didnt mean that  but i cant get to believe it  you little mother mine you that are so timid and bashful and quiet that youyou should have done such a thing  nuttie my dear cant you understand that such a thing would make me quiet  i am always feeling when i see people or they bring their daughters here  if they only knew  no no no  they would still see you were the sweetest dear  but tell me all about it  how very much in love you must have been said nuttie a magnificent vision of a young sailor with curly hair and open throat rising before her  i think i was more frightened than in love faintly said mrs egremont  at least i didnt know it was love i thought he was only kind to me  but you liked it said ursula magisterially  i liked it oh i liked it  it gave me a feeling such as nothing else ever did but i never thought of its being love he was so much older  older exclaimed nuttie much taken aback  oh as old as mr dutton  mr dutton is thirtysix i think  yes he was older than that  mother how could you  for to be older than mr dutton seemed to the youthful fancy to be near decrepitude but she added i suppose he was very noble and had done great things  he was the grandest gentleman i ever saw and had such a manner said the mother passing over the latter suggestion  anyway i never thought what it all meantall alone with the children as i wastill i found people looking at me and laughing at me and then i heard lady de lyonnais and mr egremont were coming down very angry to send me away  i ought i know it now to have waited for they would have written to my aunt  but i was horribly frightened and i couldnt bear to think of never seeing him again and he came and comforted me and said he would take me to mrs houghton the kind lady who was staying in the ninon and they would make it all square for meand thenoh it was very sweetbut i never knew that we were sailing away to jersey to be married  i knew it was very dreadful without any ones leave but it was so noble of him to take the poor little governess and defend her and it wasnt as if my mother had been alive  i didnt know aunt ursel then as i did afterwards  and mrs houghton said there was nothing else to be done  o dont leave off mother  do tell me  how long did you have him  six weeks thenand afterwards one fortnight at dieppe  he was not free  he had an old uncle general egremont who was sick and hottempered and he was obliged to keep everything secret from him and therefore from everybody else  and so i was to live at dieppe while he went out to take care of his uncle and you knowyou know  yes i know dear mother  but i am sure he was saving somebody else and it was a noble death  and i know how aunt ursel came to dieppe and how iyour own little frenchwomancame to take care of you  and havent we been jolly without any of these fine relations that never looked after you all this time  besides you know he is very likely to be on a lonely coral island and will come home yet i often think he is  my dear child i have been happier than i deserved said alice egremont drying her eyes  but oh nuttie i hope you will be a wiser woman than your mother  come dont go on in that way  why ive such advantages  ive miss mary and aunt ursel and mr spyers and mr dutton and you you poor little thing had nobody  one good thing is we shall get the watersoldier  mr dutton neednt come for hes like a cat and wont soil his boots but gerard is dying to get another look at the old ruin  he cant make up his mind about the cross on one of the stonecoffin lids so hell be delighted to come and hell get it out of the pond for us  i wonder when we can go  tonight is choir practice and tomorrow is cuttingout day  miss headworth was not sorry that the small sociabilities of the friends did not leave her alone with her niece all that evening or the next day when there was a grand cuttingout for the working partyan operation always performed in the holidays  miss headworth had of late years been excused from it and it gave her the opportunity she wanted of a consultation with mr dutton  he was her prime adviser in everything from her investments such as they were to the eccentricities of her timepieces and as the cuckooclock had that night cuckooed all the hours round in succession no one thought it wonderful that she should send a twisted note entreating him to call as early as he could in the afternoon  of course nutties chatter had proclaimed the extraordinary visitors and it needed not the old ladys dash under on an anxious affair to bring him to her little drawingroom as soon as he could quit his desk  perhaps he hastened his work with a hope in his heart which he durst not express but the agitation on the usually placid face forbade him to entertain it for an instant and he only said so our expedition has led to unforeseen consequences miss headworth  and then she answered under her breath as if afraid of being overheard mr dutton my poor child does not know it yet but the man is alive  mr dutton compressed his lips  it was the greater shock for he had actually made inquiries at the yacht club but the officials there either had not been made aware of the reappearance of the two egremonts or they did not think it worth while to look beyond the record which declared that all hands had perished and the connection of the uncle and nephew with the yacht club had not been renewed presently he said then hers was a right instinct  there is reason to be thankful  miss headworth was too full of her own anxieties to heed his causes for thankfulness  she told what she had heard from lady kirkaldy and from mark egremont and asked counsel whether it could be alices duty to return to the man who had deserted her or even to accept anything from him  there was an impetuous and indignant spirit at the bottom of the old ladys heart in spite of the subdued life she had led for so many years and she hardly brooked the measured considerate manner in which her adviser declared that all depended on circumstances and the manner in which captain egremont made the first move  at present no one was acting but young mark and as mr dutton observed it was not a matter in which a man was very likely to submit to a nephews dictation  there was certainly no need for mrs egremont to force her presence on him  but mr dutton did think that for her own sake and her childs there ought to be full recognition of their rights and that this should be proved by their maintenance  i imagine that ursula may probably be a considerable heiress and her lights must not be sacrificed  poor little girl  will it be for her happiness  i doubt it greatly  of that i suppose we have no right to judge said mr dutton somewhat tremulously justice is what we have to look to and to allow nuttie to be passed over would be permitting a slur to be cast on her and her mother  i see that said miss headworth with an effort  i suppose i am after all a selfish faithless old woman and it is not in my hands after all  but i must prepare my poor alice for what may be coming  if any terms are offered to her she had better put the matter into a lawyers hands  dobson would be a safe man to deal with  miss headworth was amazed that hewho had helped her in many a little question bordering on lawshould not proffer his aid now in this greatest stress  he was a resolute selfcontrolled man and she never guessed at the feeling that made him judge himself to be no fitting champion for alice egremont against her husband  ever since ten years ago he had learnt that his beautiful neighbour did not regard herself so certainly a widow as to venture to open her heart to any other love he had lived patiently on content to serve her as a trustworthy friend and never betraying the secret hope so long cherished and now entirely crushed  he was relieved to escape from the interview and the poor old lady remained a little more certain as to her duty perhaps but with a certainty that only made her more unhappy and she was so restless and nervous that in the middle of the evenings reading of archbishop trenchs lectures on history alice suddenly broke off in the very middle of a sentence and exclaimed aunt ursel you are keeping something from me  miss headworth made a faint attempt by saying something about presently and glancing with her eyes to indicate that it was to be reserved till after nutties bedtime but the young lady comprehended the signs and exclaimed never mind me aunt urseli know all about mother she told me last night  it is broke in mrs egremont who had been watching her aunts face you have heard of him  oh my father  you really have cried nuttie  then he really was on the desert island all this time i was quite sure of it  how delightful  she jumped up and looked at the door as if she expected to see him appear that instant clad in skins like robinson crusoe but her aunts nervous agitation found vent in a sharp reproof nuttie hold your tongue and dont be such a foolish child or i shall send you out of the room this instant  but aunt gasped alice unable to bear the suspense  yes my poor dear child  captain egremont with the general got off with some of the crew in a boat when the ninon was burnt  he spent a good many years abroad with the old man but he has now inherited the family place and is living there  miss headworth felt as if she had fired a cannon and looked to see the effect  ah if we could have stayed at dieppe said mrs egremont  but we did write back to say where we could be heard of  that was of no use  mark found no traces of us when he went thither  did he send mark  no  my dear alice i must not conceal from you that this is all mr mark egremonts doing  he seems to have been helping his uncle with his papers when he came on the evidence of your marriage and remembering you as he does he forced the confession of it from the captain and of his own accord set forth to discover what had become of you and to see justice done to you  dear little mark said she he always was such an affectionate little boy  and now my dear you must consider how you will receive any advances on his part  oh aunt ursel dont  i cant talk now  please let me go to bed nuttie dear you need not come yet  the desire for solitude in which to realise what she had heard was overpowering and she fled away in the summer twilight leaving nuttie with wide open eyes looking after her vanished hero and desert island  my poor alice sighed the old lady  aunt ursel exclaimed nuttie wasi meanis my father a good or a bad man  my dear should a daughter ask such a question  aunt ursel i cant help it  i think i ought to know all about it said nuttie gravely putting away her childishness and sitting down by her aunt  i did not think so much of it when mother told me they eloped because though i know it was very wrong people do do odd things sometimes when they are very much in love she said it in a superior patronising tone that would have amused miss headworth very much at any other time and it has not spoilt mother for being the dearest sweetest best thing in the world and besides they had neither of them any fathers or mothers to disobey  but then when i found he was so old and that he kept it a secret and must have told stories only for the sake of money uttered with extreme contempt i didnt like it  and if he left her as theseus left ariadne or sir lancelot left elaine ii dont think it is nice  do you think he only pretended to be lost in the ninon to get rid of her or that he could not find her  the ninon was really reported lost with all on board said miss headworth  that was ascertained  he was saved by a chilian ship and seems to have been a good while making his way back to europe  i had taken care that our address should be known at dieppe but it is quite possible that he may not have applied to the right people or that they may not have preserved my letter so that we cannot feel sore that he was to blame  if he had been worth anything at all he would have moved heaven and earth to find her cried nuttie and you said yourself it was all that marks doing  he seems to be a very upright and generous young man that mr mark egremont said miss headworth a whole romance as to nutties future destiny sweeping across her mind in an instant with a mental dispensation to first cousins in such a case  i think you will find him a staunch champion even against his own interests  perceptions came across nuttie  oh then i am a sort of lost heiress like people in a story  i see  but aunt ursel what do you think will happen  my dear child i cannot guess in the least  perhaps the egremont property will not concern you and only go to male heirs  that would be the best thing since in any case you must be sufficiently provided for  your father must do that  but about mother  a proper provision must be insisted on for her said miss headworth it is no use however to speculate on the future  we cannot guess how mr mark egremonts communication will be received or whether any wish will be expressed for your mothers rejoining your father  in such a case the terms must be distinctly understood and i have full trust both in mr mark and in lady kirkaldy as her champions to see that justice is done to you both  im sure he doesnt deserve that mother should go to him  nor do i expect that he will wish it or that it would be proper but he is bound to give her a handsome maintenance and i think most probably you will be asked to stay with your uncle and cousins said miss headworth figuring to herself a kind of newstead abbey or some such scene of constant orgies at bridgefield egremont  i shall accept nothing from the family that does not include mother said nuttie  dear child i foresee many trials but you must be her protector  that i will said nuttie and in the gallant purpose she went to bed to find her mother either asleep or feigning slumber with tears on her cheek     chapter vi  the watersoldier    presumptuous maid with looks intent   again she stretched again she bent   nor knew the gulf betweengray   it all seemed like a dream to ursula perhaps likewise to her mother when they rose to the routine of daily life with the ordinary interests of the day before them  there was a latent unwillingness in mrs egremonts mind to discuss the subject with either aunt or daughter and when the post brought no letter ursula after a moments sense of flatness was relieved and returned to her eager desire to hurry after the watersoldier  it was feasible that very afternoon  mary nugent came in with the intelligence  and can gerard come or we shall only look at it  yes gerard can come and so will mr dutton said mary who standing about halfway between mrs egremont and her daughter did not think herself quite a sufficient chaperon  he will look on like a hen at her ducklings said nuttie  it is cruel to take him poor man  meantime nuttie do you like an hour of marie stuart  oh thank you  but she whispered aunt ursel may i tell her  ask your mother my dear  leave was given half reluctantly and with a prohibition against mentioning the subject to any one else but both mother and aunt had confidence in mary nugents wisdom and discretion so the two friends sat on the wall together and ursula poured out her heart  poor little girl she was greatly discomfited at the vanishing of her noble vision of the heroic selfdevoted father and ready on the other hand to believe him a villain like bertram risingham or the pirate being possessed by this idea on account of his west indian voyages  at any rate she was determined not to be accepted or acknowledged without her mother and was already rehearsing magnanimous letters of refusal  miss mary listened and wondered feeling sometimes as if this were as much a romance as the little yacht going down with the burning ship and then came back the recollection that there was a real fact that nuttie had a father and that it was entirely uncertain what part he might take or what the girl might be called on to do  considering anxiously these bearings of the question she scarcely heard what she was required to assent to in one of nutties eager dont you think so  my dear nuttie she said rousing herself what i do think is that it will all probably turn out exactly contrariwise to our imaginations so i believe it would be wisest to build up as few fancies as possible but only to pray that you may have a right judgment in all things and have strength to do what is right whatever you may see that to be  and of course that will be to stick by mother  there can be little doubt of that but the how  no dear do not let us devise all sorts of hows when we have nothing to go upon that would be of no use and only perplex you when the time comes it would be much better to do the nexte thinge and read our marie stuart  nuttie pouted a little but submitted though she now and then broke into a translation with you know mother will never stand up for herself or they think i shall be asked to stay with the egremonts but i must work up for the exam  however the school habit of concentrating her attention prevailed and the study quieted nutties excitement  the expedition took place as arranged  there was a train which stopped so that the party could go down by it and the distance was not too great for walking back  mr dutton met them on the platform well armed with his neat silk umbrella and his black poodle monsieur trotting solemnly after him gerard godfrey bore materials for an exact transcript of the abbots monumental cross his head being full of church architecture while nuttie carried a long green tin case or vasculum as she chose to call it with her three vowels u a e and the stars of the little bear conspicuously painted on it in white  you did not venture on that the other day said mr dutton  how much of the park do you mean to carry away in it  let me take it said gerard politely  no thank you  youd leave it behind while you were pottering over the mouldings  you are much more likely to leave it behind yourself  whatwith my soldier my stratiotes in it  i think i see myself  give it to me said gerard  of course i cant see you carrying a great thing like that  cant you indeed  gently gently my dear said miss mary as the young people seemed very near a skirmish and the train was sweeping up  then there was another small scuffle for nuttie had set her heart on the third class but mr dutton had taken secondclass tickets and was about to hand them into a carriage whence there had just emerged a very supercilious blackmoustached valet who was pulling out a leathercovered dressingcase while gerard was consoling nuttie by telling her that monsieur never deigned to go third class  it is a smoking carriage said miss nugent on the step  pah how it smells as she jumped back  beautiful backya perfect nosegay said gerard  trust that fellow for having the best  his masters no doubt suggested mr dutton  youd better go in it to enjoy his reversion said nuttie  and wheres my escort then  oh im sure we dont want you  nuttie my dear expostulated miss nugent dragging her into the next carriage  you may enjoy the fragrance still said nuttie when seated  do you seetheres the mans master he has stood him up against that post with his cigar to wait while he gets out the luggage  i daresay you can get a whiff if you lean out far enough  i say that figure is a study said gerard  what is it that he is so like  oh i know said nuttie  it is lord frederick verisopht and the bad gentlefolks in the pictures to the old numbers of dickens that you have got miss mary  now isnt he  look only lord frederick wasnt fat  nuttie was in a state of excitement that made her peculiarly unmanageable and miss nugent was very grateful to mr dutton for his sharp though general admonition against staring while under pretext of disposing of the umbrella and the vasculum he stood up so as to block the window till they were starting  there was no one else to observe them but a demure old lady and in ten minutes time they were in open space where high spirits might work themselves off though the battle over the botanical case was ended by miss nugent who strongly held that ladies should carry their own extra encumbrances and slung it with a scarf over nutties shoulders in a knowing knapsack fashion  the two young people had known one another all their lives for gerard was the son of a medical man who had lived next door to miss headworth when the children were young  the father was dead and the family had left the place but this son had remained at school and afterwards had been put into the office at the umbrella factory under charge of mr dutton whose godson he was and who treated him as a nephew  he was a goodhearted steady young fellow with his whole interest in ecclesiastical details wearing a tie in accordance with the colours and absorbed in church music and decorations while his recreations were almost all in accordance therewith  there was plenty of merriment as he drew and measured at the very scanty ruins which were little more than a few fragments of wall overgrown luxuriantly with ivy and clematis but enclosing some fine old coffinlids with floriated crosses interesting to those who cared for architecture and church history as mr dutton tried to make the children do so that their ecclesiastical feelings might be less narrow and stand on a surer foundation than present interest a slightly aggressive feeling of contempt for all the other town churches and a pleasing sense of being persecuted  they fought over the floriations and mouldings with great zest and each maintained a date with youthful vigourboth being as mr dutton by and by showed them long before the foundation  the pond had been left to the last with a view to the wellbeing of the watersoldier on the return  here the difficulties of the capture were great for the nearest plant flourished too far from the bank to be reached with comfort and besides the sharppointed leaves to which it owes its name were not to be approached with casual grasps  oh monsieur i wish you were a beau sighed nuttie  why are you too stupid to go and get it  it is a proof of his superior intelligence said mr dutton  but really it is too ridiculoustoo provokingto have come all this way and not get it cried the tantalised nuttie  oh gerard are you taking off your boots and stockings  you duck  just what i wish i was said the youth rolling up his trousers  but even the paddling in did not answer  mr dutton called out anxiously take care gerard the bottom may be soft and came down to the very verge just in time to hold out his hand and prevent an utterly disastrous fall for gerard in spite of his bare feet sank at once into mud and on the first attempt to take a step forward found his foot slipping away from under him and would in another instant have tumbled backwards into the slush and weeds  he scrambled back his hat falling off into the reeds and splashing mr dutton all over while monsieur began to bark with astonishment at seeing his master in such a plight declared the ladies who stood convulsed with cruel laughter  isnt it dreadful exclaimed ursula  well  it might have been worse gravely said mr dutton wiping off the more obnoxious of his splashes with his pocket handkerchief  oh i didnt mean you but the watersoldier said nuttie  to have come five miles for it in vain  i dont know what to suggest added gerard  even if the ladies were to retire  no no interposed mr dutton tis no swimming ground and i forbid the expedient  you would only be entangled in the weeds  behold exclaimed mary who had been prowling about the banks and now held up in triumph one of the poles with a billhook at the end used for cutting weed  bravo miss nugent cried gerard  female wit has circumvented the watersoldier said mr dutton  dont cry out too soon returned mary the soldier may float off and escape you yet  however the capture was safely accomplished without even a dip under water to destroy the beauty of the white flowers  with these and a few waterlilies secured by gerard for the morrows altar vases the party set out on their homeward walk through plantations of whispering firs the low sun tingeing the trunks with ruddy light across heathery commons where crimson heath abounded and the delicate blushcoloured waxbelled species was a prize by cornfields in ear hanging out their dainty stamens along hedges full of exquisite plumes of feathering or nodding grass of which nuttie made bouquets and botanical studies and gerard stored for harvest decorations  they ran and danced on together with monsieur at their heels while the elders watched them with some sadness and anxiety freemasonry had soon made both mary and mr dutton aware of each others initiation and they had discussed the matter in all its bearings agreed that the man was a scoundrel and the woman an angel even if she had once been weak and that she ought to be very resolute with him if he came to terms  and then they looked after their young companions and mr dutton said poor children what is before them  it is well they are both so young answered mary     chapter vii  that man    it is the last timetis the lastscott   sundays were the everrecurring centres of work and interests to the little circle in st ambroses road  to them the church services and the various classes and schools were the great objects and excitements of the week  a certain measure of hopeful effort and varying success is what gives zest to life and the purer and higher the aim and the more unmixed the motives the greater the happiness achieved by the something attempted something done  setting apart actual spiritual devotion the altar vases purchased by a contribution of careful savings and adorned with the monks horton lilies backed by ferns from the same quarter the surplices made by the ladies themselves the chants they had practised the hymns they had taught could not but be much more interesting to them than if they had been mere lookers on  every cross on the markers every flower on the altar cloth was the work of one or other of them everything in the church was an achievement and choir boys school children bible classes every member of the regular congregation had some special interest nay every irregular member or visitor might be a convert in timeif not a present sympathiser and at the very least might swell the offertory that was destined to so many needs of the struggling district  thus it was with some curiosity mingled with selfreproach that nuttie while singing her benedictus among the tuneful shopgirls to whom she was bound to set an example became aware of yesterdays firstclass traveller lounging as far as the rows of chairs would permit in the aisle and as she thought staring hard at her mother  it was well that mrs egremonts invariable custom was never to lift her eyes from her book or her harmonium or she surely must have been disconcerted her daughter thought by the eyes that must have found her out under her little black net bonnet and veil as the most beautiful woman in churchas she certainly waseven that fine goodfornothing gentleman thinking so  nuttie would add his glances to the glories of her lovely mother  and she did so with triumph in her tone of reprobation as she trotted off after the early dinner to her share of sundayschool work as usual under miss nugents wing  it began with a childrens service and then ensued in rooms at the factory lent by mr dutton the teaching that was to supply the omissions of the board school the establishment of a voluntary one being the next ambition of st ambroses  coming home from their labours in the fervent discussion of their scholars and exchanging remarks and greetings with the other teachers of various calibres the friends reached their own road and there to their amazement beheld miss headworth  yes it really is cried nuttie  we cant be too late  notheres no bell  aunt ursel  what has brought you out  whats the matter wheres mother  in the house  my dear catching hold of her and speaking breathlessly i came out to prepare you  he is comeyour father  where cried nuttie rather wildly  he is in the drawingroom with your mother  i said i would send you poor miss headworth gasped with agitation  oh wheres mr duttonnot that anything can be done  is it that man asked nuttie and getting no answer i know it is oh aunt ursel how could you leave her with him  i must go and protect her  gerardcome  no go and fetch mr dutton  hush hush nuttie cried her aunt grasping her  you know nothing about it  wait here till i can tell you  come in here dear miss headworth said mary gently drawing her arm into hers for the poor old lady could hardly stand for trembling and bidding gerard open the door of her own house with the latchkey  she took them into the diningroom so as not to disturb her mother sent gerard off after mr dutton in the very uttermost astonishment and bewilderment and set miss headworth down in an easychair where she recovered herself under marys soothing care enough to tell her story in spite of nutties exclamations  wait wait nuttie  you mustnt burst in on them so  no you need not be afraid  dont be a silly child  he wont hurt her  oh no  they are quite delighted to meet  delighted to meet said nuttie as if transfixed  yes said her aunt  oh yes i always knew the poor child cared for him and tried to believe in him all along  he only had to say the word  i wouldnt cried the girl her eyes flashing  why didnt you ask him how he could desert her and leave her  my dear how can one come between husband and wife  oh my poor alice  how was it how did they meet dear miss headworth asked mary administering the wine she had been pouring out  you hadnt been gone half an hour alice was reading to me and i was just dozing when in came louisa  a gentleman to see mrs egremont she said and there he was just behind  we rose upshe did not know him at once but he just said edda my little edda sweeter than ever i knew you at once or something of that sort and she gave one little cry of i knew you would come and sprang right into his arms iwell i meant to make him understand how he had treated her but just as i began sirhe came at me with his hand outstretched  you didnt take it aunt i hope cried nuttie  my dear when you see him you will know how impossible it is  he has that highbred manner it is as if he were conferring a favour miss headworth i conclude said he a lady to whom i owe more than i can express  just as if i had done it for his sake  miss nugent felt this open expression dangerous on account of the daughter and she looked her consternation at mr dutton who had quietly entered ruthlessly shutting gerard godfrey out with only such a word of explanation as could be given on the way  then he comes withwith favourable intentions said mary putting as much admonition as she could into her voice  oh no doubt of that said miss headworth drawing herself together he spoke of the long separationsaid he had never been able to find her till the strange chance of his nephew stumbling on her at abbots norton  that ispossibprobably true said mr dutton  it cant be broke in nuttie  he never troubled himself about it till his nephew found the papers  you said so aunt ursel  he is a dreadful traitor of a man just like marmion or theseus or lancelot and now he is telling lies about it  dont look at me aunt ursel they are lies and i will say it and he took in poor dear mother once and now he is taking her in again and i cant bear that he should be my father  it was so entirely true yet so shocking to hear from her mouth that all three stood aghast as she stood with heaving chest crimson cheeks and big tears in her eyes  miss headworth only muttered oh my poor child you mustnt  mr dutton prevented another passionate outburst by his tone of grave gentle authority  listen a moment ursula he said  it is unhappily true that this man has acted in an unjustifiable way towards your mother and yourself  but there are no doubt many more excuses for him than you know of and as i found a few years ago that the people at dieppe had lost the address that had been left with them he must have found no traces of your mother there  you cannot understand the difficulties that may have been in his way  and there is no use quite the contrary in making the worst of him  he has found your mother out and it seems that he claims her affectionately and she forgives and welcomes himout of the sweet tenderness of her heart  she maybut i cant murmured nuttie  that is not a fit thing for a daughter nor a christian to say mr dutton sternly said  tis not for myselftis for herobjected nuttie  thats nonsense a mere excuse he returned  you have nothing at all to forgive since he did not know you were in existence  and as to your mother whom you say you put first what greater grief or pain can you give her than by showing enmity and resentment against her husband when she the really injured person loves and forgives  hes a bad man  if she goes back to him i know he will make her unhappy  you dont know any such thing but you do know that your opposition will make her unhappy  remember theres no choice in the matter he has legal rights over you both and since he shows himself ready as i understand from miss headworth that he is to give her and you your proper position you have nothing to do but to be thankful  i think myself that it is a great subject of thankfulness that your mother can return so freely without any bitterness  it is the blessing of such as she  nuttie stood pouting but more thoughtful and less violent as she said how can i be thankful  i dont want position or anything  i only want him to let mymy own mother and aunt and me alone  child you are talking of what you do not understand  you must not waste any more time in argument  your mother has sent for you and it is your duty to go and let her introduce you to your father  i have little doubt that you will find him very unlike all your imagination represents him but let that be as it may the fifth commandment does not say honour only thy good father but honour thy father  come now put on your glovesget her hat right if you please miss mary therenow come along be a reasonable creature and a good girl and do not give unnecessary pain and vexation to your mother  he gave her his arm and led her away  well done mr dutton exclaimed miss nugent  poor mr dutton  all aunt ursels discretion could not suppress that sigh but mary prudently let it pass unnoticed only honouring in her heart the unselfishness and selfrestraint of the man whose long patient unspoken hopes had just received a deathblow  oh mary  i never thought it would have been like this cried the poor old lady  i ought not to have spoken as i did before the child but i was so taken by surprise  alice turned to him just as if he had been the most faithful loving husband in the world  she is believing every word he says  it is very happy for her that she can pleaded mary  so it is yes butwhen one knows what he is and what she is  oh mr dutton is the poor child gone in  yes i saw her safe into the room  she was very near running off up the stairs said mr dutton  but i daresay she is fascinated by this time  that sort of man has great power over women  nuttie is hardly a woman yet said miss nugent  no but there must be a strong reaction when she sees something unlike her compound of marmion and theseus  i suppose there is no question but that they must go with him said miss headworth wistfully  assuredly  you say hethis egremontwas affectionate said mr dutton quietly but mary saw his fingers white with his tight clenching of the bar of the chair  oh yes warmly affectionate delighted to find her prettier than ever poor dear i suppose he meant it  heaven forgive me if i am judging him too hardly but i verily believe he went to church to reconnoitre and see whether she pleased his fancy  and do you understand added mr dutton that he is prepared to do her full justice and introduce her to his family and friends as his wife on equal terms  otherwise even if she were unwilling to stand up for herself it would be the duty of her friends to make some stipulations  i am pretty sure that he does said the aunt i did not stay long when i saw that i was not wanted but i heard him say something about his having a home for her now and her cutting out the redcastle ladies  besides there is the nephew mr mark egremont said mary  he will take care of her  yes said mr dutton  it appears to be all right  at any rate there can be no grounds for interference on our part  mr dutton took his leave with these words wringing miss headworths hand in mute sympathy and she poor old lady when he was gone fairly collapsed into bitter weeping over the uncertain future of those whom she had loved as her own children and who now must leave her desolate mary did her best with comfort and sympathy and presently took her to share her griefs and fears with gentle old mrs nugent     chapter viii  the father    i do think this lady   to be my childking lear   nuttie in her fresh holland sunday dress worked in crewels with wild strawberries by her mothers hands and with a whitetrimmed straw hat was almost shoved into the little drawingroom by mr dutton though he was himself invisible  her eyes were in such a daze of tears that she hardly saw more at first than that some one was there with her mother on the sofa  ah there she is she heard her mother cry and both rose  her mothers arm was round her waist her hand was put into another mrs egremonts voice tremulous with exceeding delight said our child our ursula our nuttie  oh this is what i have longed for all these years  oh thanks thanks and her hands left her daughter to be clasped and uplifted for a moment in fervent thanksgiving while nutties hand was held and a strange hairy kiss redolent of tobaccosmoking was on her foreheada masculine one such as she had never known except her cousin marks since the old rector died and she had grown too big for mr duttons embraces  it was more strange than delightful and yet she felt the polish of the tone that said we make acquaintance somewhat late ursula but better late than never  she looked up at this new father and understood instantly what she had heard of his being a grand gentleman  there was a highbred look about him an entire ease and perfect manner that made everything he did or said seem like gracious condescension and took away the power of questioning it at the moment  he was not above the middle size and was becoming unwieldy but there was something imposing and even graceful in his deportment and his bald narrow forehead looked aristocratic set off between side tufts of white hair white whiskers and moustaches waxed into sharp points victor emmanuel fashion and a round white curly beard  his eyes were dark and looked dull with yellow unwholesome corners and his skin was not of a pleasant colour but still with all nutties intentions of regarding him with horror she was subdued partly by the grand breeding and air of distinction and partly by the current of sympathy from her mothers look of perfect happiness and exultation she could not help feeling it a favour almost an undeserved favour that so great a personage should say a complete egremont i see she has altogether the family face  i am so glad you think so returned her mother  on the whole it is well but she might have done better to resemble you edda he said caressingly but perhaps that would have been too much for the earlsforth natives  williams girls will have enough to endure without a double eclipse and he laughed  ii dont want faltered the mother  you dont want no but you cant help it he said evidently with a proud delight in her beauty  now that i have seen the child he added i will make my way back to the hotel  will youwont you stay to tea or dinner said his wife beginning with an imploring tone which hesitated as she reviewed possible chops and her aunts dismay  thank you i have ordered dinner at the hotel he answered and gregorio is waiting for me with a cab  no doubt you will wish to make arrangements with madamethe old ladyand i will not trouble her further tonight  i will send down gregorio tomorrow morning to tell you what i arrange  an afternoon train probably as we shall go no farther than london  you say lady kirkaldy called on you  we might return her visit before starting but i will let you know when i have looked at the trains  my compliments to miss headworth  good evening sweetest  he held his wife in a fond embrace kissing her brow and cheeks and letting her cling to him then added good evening little one with a goodnatured careless gesture with which nuttie was quite content for she had a certain loathing of the caresses that so charmed her mother  and yet the command to make ready had been given with such easy authority that the idea of resisting it had never even entered her mind though she stood still while her mother went out to the door with him and watched him to the last  coming back she threw her arms round her daughter kissed her again and again and with showers of the glad tears long repressed cried oh my nuttie my child what joy  how shall i be thankful enough your father your dear father  now it is all right  little sentences of ecstasy such as these interspersed with caresses all in the incoherence of overpowering delight full of an absolute faith that the lost husband had loved her and been pining for her all these years but that he had been unable to trace her and was as happy as she was in the reunion  the girl was somewhat bewildered but she was carried along by this flood of exceeding joy and gladness  the marmion and theseus images had been dispelled by the reality and with mr duttons sharp reproof fresh upon her she felt herself to have been doing a great injustice to her father believed all that her mother did and found herself the object of a romantic recognitionif not the beggar girl become a princess at any rate the little schoolteacher a county lady  and she had never seen her mother so wildly overpoweringly happy with joy that made her too feel that something grand and glorious had happened  what are we going to do she asked as the vehemence of mrs egremonts emotion began to work itself off  home  he takes us to his home  his home repeated her mother in a trance of joy as the yearnings of her widowed heart now were fulfilled  oh but aunt ursel  poor aunt ursel  oh nuttie nuttie i had almost forgotten  how could i and there was a shower of tears of compunction  but he said he owed everything to her  she will come with us  or if she doesnt live with us we will make her live close by in a dear little cottage where is she  when did she go  i never saw her go  the sound of the front door was heard for the visitor had been watched away and miss headworth was returning to her own house to be there received with another fervent gush of happiness much more trying to her poor thing than to nuttie  there was evensong imminent and the most needful act at the moment was to compose the harmoniumplayer sufficiently for her to take her part miss headworth was really glad of the necessity since it put off the discussion and made a reason for silencing nuttie until all should be more recovered from the first agitation  alice egremont herself was glad to carry her gratitude and thankfulness to the throne of grace and in her voluntary and all her psalms there was an exulting strain that no one had thought the instrument capable of producing and that went to the heart of more than one of her hearers  no one who knew her could doubt that hers was simply innocent exultation in the recovery of him whom she so entirely loved and confided in  but there could not but be terrible doubts whether he were worthy of that trust and what the new page in her life would be  miss headworth had said they would not talk till after church but there was no deferring the matter then  she was prepared however when her niece came up to her in a tender deprecating manner saying aunt ursel dear aunt ursel it does seem very ungrateful but  he is going to take you away  yes i saw that  and it ought to be my dear  you know where  yes to london first to be fitted out and then to his own home to bridgefield egremont  i shall have to see mr egremont and her voice sank with shame  but mark will be good to me and why should i care when i have him  it is quite right i am glad it should be so firmly said the old lady  and yet to leave you so suddenly  that cant be helped  and it will only be for a little while she added till you can make arrangements to come to us  my dear husband says he owes you everything  so you must be with us or close to us  my dear its very dear and good of you to think of it but i must be independent  she put it in those words unwilling again to speak unguardedly before nuttie  oh dear auntie indeed you must  think what you are to us and what you have done for us  we cant go away to be happy and prosperous and leave you behind  can we nuttie  come and help me to get her to promise  dodo dearest auntie and she began the coaxing and caressing natural to her but nuttie did not join in it and miss headworth shook her head and said gravely  dont alice  it is of no use  i tell you once for all that my mind is made up  alice knowing by long experience that when her aunt spoke in that tone persuasion was useless desisted but looked at her in consternation with eyes swimming in tears  nuttie understood her a little better and felt the prickings of distrust again  but aunt dear aunt how can we leave you  what will you do with all the boarders went on mrs egremont  i shall see my way my dear  do not think about that  it is a great thing to see you and this child receive justice  and only think after all the hard things that have been said of him that we should meet first at church  he would not wait and send letters and messages by mark  you see he came down himself the first moment  i always knew he would  only i am so sorry for him that he should have lost all those sweet years when nuttie was a tiny child she must do all she can to make up to him  oh dear broke out nuttie  it is so strange  it will be all so strange  it will be a very new life said her aunt rather didactically but you must do your best to be a good daughter and to fill your new position and i have no doubt you will enjoy it  if i could but take all with me said nuttie  oh dear whatever will you do aunt ursel  oh mother the choir  who will play the harmonium and who will lead the girls and whatever will mr spyers do and who will take my class  mother couldnt we stay a little longer to set things going here  it is nice of you to have thought of it my dear said mrs egremont but your father would not like to stay on here  but mightnt i stay just a few days mother to wish everybody goodbye  mr dutton and miss mary and gerard and all the girls  there was some consolation in this plan and the three women rested on it that night mrs egremont recovering composure enough to write three or four needful notes explaining her sudden departure  the aunt could not talk of a future she so much dreaded for her nieces losing in it the thought of her own loneliness alice kept back her own loving tender undoubting joy with a curious sense that it was hard and ungrateful towards the aunt but it was impossible to think of that and nuttie was in many moods  eager anticipation of the new unseen world beyond exultation in finding herself somebody sympathy with her mothers happiness all had their share but they made her all the wilder because they were far from unmixed  the instinctive dislike of mr egremonts countenance and doubt of his plausible story which had vanished before his presence and her mothers faith returned upon her from time to time caught perhaps from her aunts tone and looks  then her aunt had been like a mother to herher own mother much more like a sister and the quitting her was a wrench not compensated for as in mrs egremonts case by a more absorbing affection  moreover nuttie felt sure that poor gerard godfrey would break his heart  as the mother and daughter for the last time lay down together in the room that had been theirs through the seventeen years of the girls life alice fell asleep with a look of exquisite peace and content on her face feeling her long term of trial crowned by unlookedfor joy while ursula though respecting her slumbers too much to move lay with wideopen eyes now speculating on the strange future now grieving over those she leftaunt ursel gerard mary and all such the schemes from which she was snatched and then again consoling herself with the hope that since she was going to be rich she could at once give all that was wantedthe white altar cloth the brass pitchernay perhaps finish the church and build the school  for had not some one said something about her position  oh yes she had not thought of it before but since she was the elder brothers daughter she must be the heiress there was no doubt a grand beautiful story before her she would withstand all sorts of fascinations wicked baronets and earls innumerable and come back and take gerard by the hand and say pride was quelled and love was free  not that gerard had ever uttered a word tending in that direction since he had been seven years old but that would make it all the prettier they would both be silently constant till the time came perhaps when she was of age  mother would like it though that father would certainly be horrid  and how nice it would be to give gerard everything and they would go all over the continent and see pictures and buy them and see all the cathedrals and all the mountains  but perhaps since mark egremont had really been so generous in hunting up the cousin who was displacing him she was bound in duty to marry him perhaps he reckoned on her doing so  she would be generous in her turn give up all the wealth to him and return to do and be everything to micklethwayte  how they would admire and bless her  and oh she was going to london tomorrowlondon which she so much wished to seewestminster abbey british museum all saints national gallery no end of new dresses  halfwaking halfdreaming she spent the night which seemed long enough and the light hours of the summer morning seemed still longer before she could call it a reasonable time for getting up her splashings  awoke her mother who lay smiling for a few moments realising and giving thanks for her great joy then bestirred herself with the recollection of all that had to be done on this busy morning before any summons from her husband could arrive  combining packing and dressing like the essentially unmethodical little woman she was mrs egremont still had all her beautiful silky brown hair about her shoulders when the bell of st ambroses was heard giving its thin tinkling summons to matins at halfpast seven she was disappointed she meant to have gone for this last time but there was no help for it and nuttie set off by herself  gerard godfrey was at his own door  he was not one of the regular attendants at the short service being of that modern species that holds itself superior to cranmers prayers but on this morning he hastened up to her with outstretched hand  and you are going away he said  i hope to get leave to stay a few days after mother she said  to prolong the torment he said  to wish everybody goodbye  it is a great piece of my life that is come to an end and i cant bear to break it off so short  and if you feel so who are going to wealth and pleasure what must it be to those who are left behind  oh said nuttie some one will be raised up  thats what they always say  i shall go into a brotherhood observed gerard desperately  oh dont began nuttie much gratified but at that moment miss nugent came out at her door and mr spyers who was some way in advance looked round and waited for them to come up  he held out his hands to her and said well nuttie my child you are going to begin a new life  oh dear  i wish i could have both cried nuttie not very relevantly as far as the words went  scheiden und weiden thut weh quoted mary  if his place was only monks horton  what will aunt ursel do  i think perhaps she may be induced to join us said mary  we mean to do our best to persuade her  and theres the choir  and my class and the harmonium went on nuttie while gerard walked on disconsolately  micklethwayte has existed without you nuttie said mr spyers taking her on with him alone  perhaps it will be able to do so again my dear you had better look on  there will be plenty for you to learn and to do where you are going and you will be sure to find much to enjoy and also something to bear  i should like to remind you that the best means of going on well in this new world will be to keep self down and to have the strong desire that only love can give to be submissive and to do what is right both to god and your father and mother  may i give you a text to take with you children obey your parents in the lord for this is right  they were at the door and there was no time for an answer but nuttie as she took her place was partly touched and partly fretted at the admonition  the question as to her remaining a day or two after her mother was soon disposed of  mrs egremont sent a pretty little note to make the request but the elegant valet who appeared at ten oclock brought a verbal message that his master wished mrs and miss egremont to be ready by two oclock to join him in calling on lady kirkaldy at monks horton and that if their luggage was ready by four oclock he gregorio would take charge of it as they were all to go up to town by the 440 train  did he have my note faltered alice stimulated by the imploring glances of aunt and daughter but anticipating the answer  yes madame but he wishes that miss egremont should accompany you immediately  of course was alices comment now that he has found his child he cannot bear to part with her  and all through the farewells that almost rent the gentle alices heart in two she was haunted by the terror that she or her daughter should have red eyes to vex her husband  as to mr dutton he had only come in with gerard in a great hurry just after breakfast said there was much to do today at the office as they were going to take stock and they should neither of them have time to come home to luncheon  he shook the hands of mother and daughter heartily promised to look after miss headworth and bore off in his train young gerard looking the picture of woe and muttering i believe he has got it up on purpose while mother and daughter thought it very odd and rather unkind     chapter ix  new plumes    and ye sall walk in silk attire   and siller hae to spareold ballad   the very best open fly and pair of horses being the equipage most like a private carriage possessed by the royal hotel came to the door with mr egremont seated in it at a few minutes after two oclock and found alice in her only black silk with a rose in her bonnet and a tie to match on her neck hastily procured as signs of her wifehood  she had swallowed her tears and nuttie was not a crying person but was perfectly scarlet on her usually brown cheeks  her father muttered some civility about back seats but it was plain that it was only in words and she never thought of anything but looking back with her last wave to her aunt and the two maids one crying at the gate the other at the door  there said mr egremont as they drove away that is over  my dear aunt said his wife  who can express her goodness to me  cela va sans dire was the reply  but these are connections that happily ursula is young enough to forget and leave behind  i shall never forget began nuttie but she saw her father composing himself in his corner without paying the slightest heed to what she was saying and she encountered a warning and alarmed glance from her mother so she was forced to content herself with uttering silent vows of perpetual recollection as she passed each wellknown objectthe unfinished church with mr spyers at the door talking to old bellman the town hall whose concerts lectures and s p g meetings had been her chief gaiety and excitement the school of art where lady kirkaldys appearance now seemed to her to have been like that of a bird of omen past the shops in the high street with a little exultation at the thought of past desires which they had excited  long could she have rattled away her hopes contradicting her regrets and her regrets qualifying her anticipations but she saw that her mother was nervous about every word and gesture and fairly looked dismayed when she exclaimed oh mother theres etta smith how surprised she will be bowing and smiling with all her might  there was a look of bare toleration on mr egremonts face as if he endured because it would soon be over as nuttie bowed several times and his wife though less quick to catch peoples eyes sometimes also made her recognition  when the streets were past and nuttie had aimed her last nods at the nursery parties out walking on the road she became aware that those cold lacklustre and yet sharply critical eyes of her father were scanning her all over  she has been educated he presently said to his wife  oh yes was the eager answer  she is in the highest form at the high school and has to go up for the senior local examination  miss belper makes sure that she will get a first class  mr egremont gave a little wave of the hand as dismissing something superfluous and said i hope she has some accomplishments  she has done very fairly in french and german  and latin put in ursula  and she has had several prizes at the school of art  and music  thats the only thing of any value in society he said impatiently and mrs egremont said more timidly she has learnt music regularly  but i dont care about it broke in nuttie  i havent mothers ear nor her voice  i learnt the science in case i should have to teach and they make me practise  i dont mind classical music but i cant stand rubbish and i think it is waste of time  mr egremont looked fairly amused as at the outspoken folly of an enfant terrible but he only said either to his wife or to himself a little polish and then she may be fairly presentable  we have taken great pains with her answered the gentle mother evidently taking this as a great compliment while the daughter was tingling with indignation  she bred up by mother and aunt and mary nugent to be barely presentable  was not their society at micklethwayte equal in good manners to any and superior far superior in goodness and intelligence to these stupid fashionable people who undervalued all her real useful acquirements and cared for nothing but trumpery music  the carriage entered the park and nuttie saw lake and woods from a fresh point of view  the owners were both at home and nuttie found herself walking behind her parents into a cheerful apartment half library half morningroom  mrs egremont was by far the most shy and shrinking of the party but it was an occasion that showed her husbands complete tact and savoir favre  he knew perfectly well that the kirkaldys knew all about it and he therefore took the initiative you are surprised to see us he said as he gave his hand but we could not leave the country without coming to thank lady kirkaldy for her kindness in assisting in following up the clue to mrs egremonts residence  i am very happy said lady kirkaldy while all were being seated  i think it was here that my nephew mark first met one whom child as he was he could not but remember  i dont think you met him here said lady kirkaldy to mrs egremont but he heard the name and was struck by it  dear mark was the response  he was so kind  he is a dear good boy chimed in my lady  yes said her lord an excellent good fellow with plenty of brains  as he well knows said mr egremont  oh yes i quite agree with all you say of him  one ought to be thankful for the possession of a rare specimen  it was in the tone in which falstaff discussed that sober boy lord john of lancaster  lord kirkaldy asked if the visitors were going to remain long in the neighbourhood  we are due in london tonight replied mr egremont  we shall spend a day or two there and then go home  alice he added though his wife had never heard him call her so before lady kirkaldy knows your inexperience  perhaps she would be good enough to give you some addresses that might be useful  i shall be delighted said the lady cordially looking at the blushing mrs egremont  dressmaker and all the rest of it said mr egremont  you know better than she does what she will require and a little advice will be invaluable  above all if you could tell her how to pick up a maid  lady kirkaldy proposed to take the mother and daughter up to her dressingroom where she kept her book of addresses to london tradesmen and mr egremont only begged that they would remember the 440 train  then lord kirkaldy was left to entertain him while the ladies went up the broad staircase to the pleasant room which had a mingled look of refinement and usefulness which struck nuttie at once lady kirkaldy as soon as the door was shut took her visitor by the hand kissed her forehead and said you must let me tell you how glad i am  the crystal veil at once spread over alices eyes  oh thank you lady kirkaldy  i am so happy and yet i am so afraid  please tell me what we shall do so that we may not vex him so high bred and fastidious as he is  be yourself  thats all my dear said lady kirkaldy tenderly dont be afraid  you are quite incapable of doing anything that could distress the most fastidious taste  it was perfectly true of the mother perhaps less so of the daughter but lady kirkaldy only thought of her as a mere girl who could easily be modelled by her surroundings  the kind hostess applied herself to giving the addresses of the people she thought likely to be most useful in the complete outfit which she saw would be necessary explaining to which establishments she applied with confidence if she needed to complete her wardrobe in haste feeling certain that nothing would be sent her that she disliked and giving leave to use her name  she soon saw that the mother was a little dazed while ursulas eyes grew rounder at the unlimited vista of fine clothes and she assented and asked questions as to the details  as to a maid lady kirkaldy would write to a person who would call on mrs egremont at the hotel in london and who might be what was wanted and in conclusion lady kirkaldy with some diffidence begged to be written toifif she said there happened to be any difficulty about which you might not like to consult mrs william egremont  nuttie hardly knew whether to be grateful or not for she did not believe in any standard above that of micklethwayte and she was almost angry at her mothers grateful answeroh thank you  i should be so grateful  i am so afraid of annoying him by what he may think small ignorant countrytown ways you will understand  lady kirkaldy did understand and she dreaded what might be before the sweet little yielding woman not from want of breeding so much as from the longindulged selfishness of her husband but she encouraged her as much as possible and promised all possible counsel bringing her downstairs again just in time  pretty little soul said lord kirkaldy as the fly clattered away i wonder whether mark has done her a kindness  it is just what she is a pretty nay a beautiful soul full of tenderness and forgiveness and affection and humility only i doubt whether there is any force or resolution to hold her own  you smile well perhaps the less of that she has the better she may get on with him  did he say anything about her  no i think he wants to ignore that they have not spent the last twenty years together  that may be the best way for all parties  do you think he will behave well to her  no man could well do otherwise to such a sweet little thing said lord kirkaldy especially as she will be his most obedient slave and will make herself necessary to him  it is much better luck than he deserves but i pity her when she comes to make her way with yon ladies  i wish i was there  i know she will let herself be trodden on however theres mark to stand up for her and william egremont will do whatever he thinks right and just  i wish i knew how his wife will take it     chapter x  bridgefield egremont    let us see these handsome houses   where the wealthy nobles dwelltennyson   mother mother cried two young people bursting open the door of the pretty diningroom of bridgefield rectory where the grownup part of the family were lingering over a late breakfast  gently gently children said the dignified lady at the head of the table  dont disturb papa  but we really have something to say mother said the elder girl and fraulein said you ought to know  uncle alwyn is come home and mrs egremont  and please are we to call her aunt egremont or aunt alwyn or what  the desired sensation was produced  canon egremont put down his newspaper  the two elder sisters looked from one to the other in unmitigated astonishment  mark briefly made answer to the final question aunt alice and mrs egremont said gravely how did you hear this rosalind  you know i always forbid you to gossip  we didnt gossip mother  we went up to the gardens to get some mulberries for our halfholiday feast and ronaldson came out and told us we must ask leave first for the ladies were come  the squire came home at nine oclock last night and mrs egremont and all and only sent a telegram two hours before to have the rooms got ready  has uncle alwyn gone and got himself married exclaimed one of the young ladies in utter amazement  not just now blanche said her father  it is an old story now your uncle married this lady who had been governess to may and mark many years ago and fromcircumstances in which she was not at all to blame he lost sight of her while he was abroad with old general egremont  mark met her about a fortnight ago and this has led to your uncles going in quest of her though he has certainly been more sudden in his proceedings than i expected  the mother here succeeded in sending rosalind and adela with their wondering eyes off the scene and she would much have liked to send her two stepdaughters after them but oneandtwenty and eighteen could not so readily be ordered off as twelve and ten and mark who had been prohibited from uttering a word to his sisters was eagerly examining margaret whether she remembered their edda but she had been only three years old at the time of the adventures in the isle of wight and remembered nothing distinctly but the aspect of one of the sailors in the yacht  well said mrs egremont this has come very suddenly upon us  it would have been more for her own dignity if she had held out a little before coming so easily to terms after the way in which she has been treated  when you see her mother you will understand said mark  shall we have to be intimate with her asked may  i desire that she should be treated as a relation said the canon decidedly  there is nothing against her character and as his wife was about to interruptnothing but an indiscretion to which she was almost driven many years ago  she was cruelly treated and i for one am heartily sorry for having let myself be guided by others  mrs william egremont felt somewhat complacent for she knew he meant lady de lyonnais and there certainly had been no love lost between her and her stepchildrens grandmother but she was a sensible woman and forbore to speak though there was a mental reservation that intimacy would a good deal depend upon circumstances  blanche cried out that it was a perfect romance and may gravely said but is she a lady  a perfect lady said mark  aunt margaret says so  one knows what a perfect lady means returned may  come may said mrs egremont do not let us begin with a prejudice by all accounts the poor thing has conducted herself with perfect respectability all this time  what did you tell me mark she has been living with an aunt keeping a school at micklethwayte  not quite said mark  she has been acting as a daily governess she seemed to be on friendly terms with the clerical folk  i came across the name at a school feast or something of the kind which came off in the kirkaldys park  oh then i know exactly the sort of person returned may pursing up her lips  mark laughed and said i wonder whether it is too soon to go up and see them  i wonder what my uncle thinks of his daughter  what  you dont mean to say there is a daughter cried may  even so  and exactly like you too miss may  then you are cut out mark  you are cut out i think may  youll have to give her all your miss egremont cards  no said the young lady mother made me have my christian name printed  she said all but the daughters of the head of the family ought to have it so  im glad of it  how old is she asked blanche  about a year younger than you  i think it is very interesting said blanche  how wonderful it must all be to her  i will go up with you mark as soon as i can get ready  you had better wait till later in the day blanche said the mother she knew the meeting was inevitable but she preferred having it under her own eye if she could not reconnoitre  she was a just and sensible woman who felt reparation due to the newlydiscovered sisterinlaw and that harmony or at least the appearance of it must be preserved but she was also exclusive and fastidious by nature and did not look forward to the needful intercourse with much satisfaction either on her own account or that of her family  she told mark to say that she should come to see mrs egremont after luncheon since he was determined to go at once and moreover to drag his father with him  canon egremont was a good and upright man according to his lights which were rather those of a wellbeneficed clergyman of the first than of the last half of the century intensified perhaps that the passive voice was the strongest in him all the country knew that canon egremont could be relied on to give a prudent scholarly judgment and to be kind and liberal when once induced to stir mind or bodybut how to do that was the problem  he had not been a young man at the time of his first marriage and was only a few years junior to his brother though he had the fresh wholesome look of a man who kept regular hours and lived much in the air  alice knew him at once and thought eighteen years had made little change as at nutties call to her she looked from the window and saw the handsome dignified grayhaired closeshaven rosy face and the clerical garb unchanged in favour of long coats and high waistcoats  the mother and daughter were exploring the house together  mr egremont had made it known that he preferred having his breakfast alone and not being disturbed in the forenoon  so the two ladies had breakfasted together at nine the earliest hour at which they could prevail on the household to give them a meal  indeed nuttie had slept till nearly that time for between excitement and noise her london slumbers had been broken and her endeavour to keep micklethwayte hours had resulted in a long weary hungry time in the sittingroom of the hotel with nothing to do when the gaze from the window palled on her but to write to her aunt and mary nugent  the rest of the day had been spent in driving about in a brougham with her mother shopping and this she could not but enjoy exceedingly more than did the timid mrs egremont who could not but feel herself weighted with responsibility and never having had to spend at the utmost more than ten pounds at a time felt bewildered at the cheques put into her hands and then was alarmed to find them melting away faster than she expected  there was a very late dinner after which mr egremont on the first day made his wife play bezique with him  she enjoyed it as a tender reminiscence of the yachting days but nuttie found herself de trop and was reduced to the book she had contrived to purchase on her travels  the second night mr egremont had picked up two friends not yet gone out of town whose talk was of horses and of yachts quite incomprehensible to the ladies  they were very attentive to mrs egremont whom they evidently admired one so visibly as to call up a blush but they disregarded the daughter as a schoolgirl  happily they appeared no more after the dinner but nutties first exclamation of astonished disgust was silenced at once by her mother with unusual determination you must not speak so of your fathers friends  not when  not at all interrupted mrs egremont  the only sense of promotion to greatness that ursula had yet enjoyed was in these fine clothes and the maid whom lady kirkaldy had recommended a grave and severelooking person of whom both stood somewhat in awe  the arrival at bridgefield had been too late for anything to be taken in but a general impression of space and dreariness and the inevitable dinner of many courses after which nuttie was so tired out that her mother sent her to bed  since the waking she had made some acquaintance with the house there was no show of domestics no curtseying housekeeper to parade the new mistress over the house mr egremont had told his wife that she must fill up the establishment as she pleased but that there was an admirable cook downstairs and he would not have her interfered withshe suited his tastes as no one else did and she must be left to deal with the provisions and her own underlings  there was a stable establishment and a footman had been hired in town but there was besides only one untidylooking housemaid who began by giving warning and alice and nuttie had roamed about without meeting any one from the big wainscotted diningroom with faded crimson curtains and family portraits the older grimy the younger chalky to the two drawingrooms whose gilding and pale blue damask had been preserved by pinafores of brown holland the library which looked and smelt as if mr egremont was in the habit of sitting there and a big billiardroom all opening into a shiveryfeeling hall with scagliola columns and a few dirty statues between them then upstairs to a possible morningroom looking out over a garden lawn where mowing was going on in haste and suites of dreary shutup fusty bedrooms nuttie who had notions of choosing her own bower could not make up her mind which looked the least inviting  it did not seem as if girls could ever have laughed together or children clattered up and down the stairs  mrs egremont begged her to keep possession for the present at least of the chamber where the grim housemaid had chosen to put her and which had the advantage of being aired  the two windows looked out over the park and thence it was that while morris the maid was unpacking and putting away the new purchases and nuttie was standing scarcely realising that such pretty hats and bonnets could be her very own when her mother beheld the canon and mark advancing up the drive  it was with a great start that she called ursula to come down directly with her as no one would know where to find them hastily washing the hands that had picked up a sense of dustiness during the exploration and taking a comprehensive glance in the cheval glass which showed her some one she felt entirely unfamiliar to her in a dainty summer costume of pale gray silk picked out with a mysterious shade of pink  ursula too thought miss egremonts outer woman more like a chelsea shepherdess than nutties true self as she tripped along in her buckled shoes and the sea green stockings that had been sent home with her skirt  with crimson cheeks and a throbbing heart alice was only just at the foot of the stairs when the newcomers had made their way in and the kind canon ignoring all that was past held out his hands saying well my dear i am glad to see you here kissing mrs egremont on each cheek  and so this is your daughter  how do you do my dearursula  isnt that your name and ursula had again to submit to a kiss much more savoury and kindly than her fathers though very stubbly  and oh her uncles dress was like that of no one she had ever seen except the rector of the old church the object of unlimited contempt to the adherents of st ambroses  as to mark he only kissed his aunt and shook hands with her while his father ran on with an unusual loquacity that was a proof of nervousness in him  mrs egremontjane i meanwill be here after luncheon  she thought you would like to get settled in first  how is alwyn  is he down yet  i will see in a trembling voice  oh no never mind alwyn hates to be disturbed till he has made himself up in the morning  my call is on you you know  where are you sitting  i dont quite know  in the drawingroom i suppose  the canon knowing the house much better than she did opened a door into a third drawingroom she had not yet seen a pretty little room fitted up with fluted silk like a tent somewhat faded but not much the worse for that and opening into a conservatory which seemed to have little in it but some veteran orange trees  nuttie however exclaimed with pleasure at the nicest room she had seen and mark began unfastening the glass door that led into it  meantime alice with burning cheeks and liquid eyes nerved her voice to say oh sirmr egremontplease forgive me  i know now how wrong i was  nonsense my dear  bygones are bygones  you were far more sinned against than sinning and have much to forgive me  there my dear we will say no more about it nor think of it either  i am only too thankful that poor alwyn should have some one to look after him  alice who had dreaded nothing more than the meeting with her former master was infinitely relieved and grateful for this kindness  she had ejaculated oh you are so good in the midst and now at the mention of her husband she exclaimed oh do you think he is ill i cant help being afraid he is but he will not tell me and does not like to be asked  poor fellow he has damaged his health a good deal was the answer he had a sharp attack in the spring but he has pretty well got over it and raikes told me there was no reason for uneasiness provided he would be careful and that will be a much easier matter now  i should not wonder if we saw him with quite a renewed youth  so the canon and mrs egremont were getting on pretty well together but there was much more stiffness and less cordiality between the two cousins although mark got the window open into the conservatory and showed nuttie the way into the garden advising her to ask ronaldson the gardener to fill the conservatory with flowers  the pavilion as this little room was called always seemed to have more capacities for being lived in than any other room in the house  it had been fitted up when such things were the fashion for the shortlived bride of our great uncle  the colour must have been awful then said mark looking up at it enough to set ones teeth on edge but it has faded into something quite orthodoxmuch better than could be manufactured for you  mark had evidently some ideas of art and was besides inclined to do the honours to the stranger but nuttie was not going to encourage him or anybody else to make up to her while she had that look of gerard godfreys in her minds eye  so she made small answer and he felt rebuffed but supposed her shy and wondered when he could go back to her mother who was so much more attractive  presently his father went off to storm the den of the master of the house and there was a pleasant quarter of an hour during which the three went out through the conservatory and mark showed the insandouts of the garden found out ronaldson and congratulated him on having some one at last to appreciate his flowers begging him to make the conservatory beautiful  and mrs egremonts smile was so effective that the scot forthwith took out his knife and presented her with the most precious of the roses within his reach  moreover mark told the names and ages of all his sisters whole and half  he was the only son except a little fellow in the nursery and he exhorted his aunt not to be afraid of his stepmother who was a most excellent person he declared but who never liked to see any one afraid of her  there was something a little alarming in this but on the whole the visit was very pleasant and encouraging to mrs egremont and she began rejoicing over the kindness as soon as the canon had summoned his son and they had gone away together  i am sure you must be delighted with your uncle and cousin my dear she said  hes not a bit my notion of a priest returned nuttie  and i dont believe he has any daily prayers  he is oldfashioned my dear  one of the stodgey old clergymen in books observed nuttie  i didnt think there were any of that sort left  oh my dear pray dont take fancies into your head  he is a very very good man and has been most kind to me far more than i deserve and he is your uncle nuttie  i do so hope you will get on well with your cousins  here a gong a perfectly unknown sound to nuttie made itself heard and rather astonished her by the concluding roar  the two ladies came out into the hall as mr egremont was crossing it  he made an inclination of the head and uttered a sort of good morning to his daughter but she was perfectly content to have no closer salutation having a healthy noonday appetite her chief wish was at the moment that those beautiful little cutlets arranged in a crown form were not so very tiny or that with two menservants looking on it were possible to attain to a second help but she had already learnt that gregorio would not hear her and that any attempt to obtain more food frightened her mother  so his reverence has been to see you observed mr egremont william if you like it better  oh yes and he was kindness itself  and how did master mark look at finding i could dispense with his assistance  i think he is very glad  mr egremont laughed  you are a simple woman edda  the pose of virtuous hero was to have been full compensation for all that it might cost him  and no doubt he looks for the reward of virtue likewise  wherewith he looked full at ursula who to her extreme vexation felt herself blushing up to the ears  she fidgeted on her chair and began a most untrue im sure for indeed the poor girl was sure of nothing but that her fathers manner was most uncomfortable to her his laugh choked whatever she might have said which perhaps was well and her mothers cheeks glowed as much as hers did  did the canonessjane i meancome up mr egremont went on  mrs egremont  no she sent word that she is coming after luncheon  hm  then i shall ride out and leave you to her majesty  now look you alice you are to be very careful with williams wife  she is a condamine you know and thinks no end of herself and your position among the womenfolk of the county depends more on how she takes you up than anything else  but that doesnt mean that you are to let her give herself airs and domineer over you  remember you are the elder brothers wifemrs egremont of bridgefield egremontand she is nothing but a parsons wife and i wont have her meddling in my house only dont you be absurd and offend her for she can do more for or against you in society than any one elsemores the pity  oh wont you stay and help me receive her exclaimed the poor lady utterly confused by these contrary directions  not i  i cant abide the woman nor she me  he added after a moment you will do better without me  so he went out for his ride and ursula asked oh mother what will you do  the best i can my dear  they are good people and are sure to be kinder than i deserve  nuttie was learning that her mother would never so much as hear far less answer a remark on her husband  it was beginning to make a sore in the young heart that a barrier was thus rising where there once had been as perfect oneness and confidence as could exist between two natures so dissimilar though hitherto the unlikeness had never made itself felt  mrs egremont turned the conversation to the establishing themselves in the pavilion whither she proceeded to import some fancywork that she had bought in london and sent nuttie to ronaldson who was arranging calceolarias begonias and geraniums in the conservatory to beg for some cutflowers for a great dustylooking vase in the centre of the table  these were being arranged when mrs william egremont and miss blanche egremont were ushered in and there were the regular kindred embraces after which alice and nuttie were aware of a very handsome dignifiedlooking lady well though simply dressed in what was evidently her home costume with a large shady hat and feather her whole air curiously fitting the imposing nickname of the canoness blanche was a slight delicatelooking rather pretty girl in a lawntennis dress  the visitor took the part of treating the newcomers as wellestablished relations  we would not inundate you all at once she said but the children are all very eager to see their cousin  i wish you would come down to the rectory with me  my ponies are at the door  i would drive you and ursula might walk with blanche  and as alice hesitated for a moment considering how this might agree with the complicated instructions that she had received she added never mind alwyn  i saw him going off just before i came up and he told william he was going to look at some horses at hales so he is disposed of for a good many hours  alice decided that her husband would probably wish her to comply and she rejoiced to turn her daughter in among the cousins so hats gloves and parasols were fetched and the two mothers drove away with the two sleek little toy ponies  by which it may be perceived that mrs william egremonts first impressions were favourable  it is the shortest way through the gardens said blanche  have you been through them yet  mark walked about with us a little  youll improve them ever so much  there are great capabilities look you could have four tennis courts on this one lawn  we wanted to have a gardenparty up here last year and father said we might but mother thought uncle alwyn might think it a liberty but now youll have some delicious ones  of course you play lawntennis  i have seen it a very few times said nuttie  oh we must teach you  fancy living without lawntennis said blanche  i always wonder what people did without it  onlywith an effort at antiquarianismi believe they had croquet  aunt ursula says there werent gardenparties before croquet came in  how dreadful ursula  your names ursula isnt it  havent you some jolly little name to go by  nuttie  nuttie  thats scrumptious  ill call you nuttie and you may call me pussycat  thats not so nice as blanche  mother wont have me called so when strangers are there but you arent a stranger you know  you must tell me all about yourself and how you came never to learn tennis  i had something else to do said nuttie with dignity  oh you were in the schoolroom  i forgot  poor little nuts  at school said ursula  ah i remember  but youre out now arent you  ive been out since this spring  mother wont let us come out till we are eighteen isnt it horrid  and we were so worked there  i can tell you a finishing governess is an awful institution  poor little rosie and adey will be in for one by and by  at present theyve only got a jolly little fraulein that they can do anything they please with  oh i wonder if she would tell me of some german books  you dont mean that you want to read german and blanche stood still and looked at her cousin in astonishment  why what else is the use of learning it  oh i dont know  every one does  if one went abroad or to court you know said blanche vaguely but ursula had now a fresh subject of interest for on emerging from the shrubbery they came in sight of a picturesque but not very architectural church which had the smallest proportion of wall and the largest of roof and a pretty orielwindowed schoolhouse covered with clematis  nuttie rushed into inquiries about services and schools and was aghast at hearing of mere sundays and saints days  oh no father isnt a bit ritualistic  i wish he was it would be so much prettier and then he always advertises for curates of moderate views and they are so stupid  you never saw such a stick as we have got now mr edwards and his wife isnt a lady im sure  then as to schools it was an absolute amazement to nuttie to find that the same plans were in force as had prevailed when her uncle had come to the living and built that pretty housenay were kept up at his sole expense because he liked oldfashioned simplicity and did not choose to be worried with government inspection  and said blanche every one says our girls work ever so much better and make nicer servants than those that are crammed with all sorts of nonsense not fit for them  as to the sunday school  mother and the curate take care of that im sure if you like it you can have my class for i always have a headache there and very often i cant go  only may pegs away at it and she wont let me have the boys who are the only jolly ones because she says i spoil them  but you must be my friendmind nuttie not mays for we are nearer the same age  when is your birthday  you must put it down in my book  nuttie who had tolerable experience of making acquaintance with new girls was divided between a sense of blanches emptiness and the warmth excited by her friendliness as well as of astonishment at all she heard and saw  crossing the straggling meandering village street the cousins entered the grounds of the rectory an irregular but wellkept building of the soft stone of the country all the garden front of it a deep verandah that was kept open in summer but closed with glass frames in the winterflowerbeds lying before it and beyond a lawn where the young folk were playing at the inevitable lawntennis  margaret was not so pretty as blanche but had a more sensible face and her welcome to ursula was civil but reserved  rosalind and adela were bright little things in quite a different style from their halfsisters much lighter in complexion and promising to be handsomer women  they looked full of eagerness and curiosity at the new cousin whom blanche set down on a bank and proceeded to instruct in the mysteries of the allimportant game by comments and criticisms on the players  as soon as mark and adela had come out conquerors ursula was called on to take her first lesson  may resigned her racket saying she had something to do and walked off the field and carrying off with her adela who as blanche said had a spine and was ordered to lie down for an hour every afternoon  the cheerfulness with which she went spoke well for the training of the family  nuttie was lightfooted and dexterous handed and accustomed to active amusements so that under the tuition of her cousins she became a promising pupil and thawed rapidly even towards mark  she was in the midst of her game when the two mothers came out for the drive had been extended all round the park under pretext of showing it to its new mistress but really to give the canoness an opportunity of judging of her in a teteatete  yet that sensible woman had asked no alarming questions on the past still less had offered any advice that could seem like interference  she had only named localities mentioned neighbours and made little communications about the ways of the place such as might elicit remarks and as alices voice betrayed less and less constraint she ventured on speaking of their daughters so as to draw forth some account of how ursula might have been educated  and of this alice was ready and eager to talk telling how clever and how industrious nuttie had always been and how great an advantage miss nugents kindness was and how she was hoping to go up for the cambridge examination then detecting some doubt in her companions manner she said it would be a great disappointment to her not to do so now  do you think she had better not  i dont think she will find time to go on with the preparation and to tell the truth i dont think we are quite ripe for such things in this county  we are rather backward and ursula coming in fresh upon us might find it a disadvantage to be thought much cleverer than other people  ah  i was not quite sure whether her father would like it  i do not think he would  i am sure that if my little rose were to take it into her head i should have hard work to get her fathers consent though no doubt the world will have progressed by the time she is old enough  that settles it said alice  thank you mrs egremont  i own she added presently that i do somewhat regret that it cannot be for i thought that a motive for keeping up her studies would be helpful to my childi do not mean for the sake of the studies but of thethe balance in all this change and novelty  you are quite right i have felt it myself said her sisterinlaw perhaps something could be done by essay societies  may belongs to one and if ursula is an intellectual girl perhaps you could keep her up to some regular employment in the morning  i succeeded in doing so when may came out but i can accomplish nothing regular but music with blanche and an hours steady practice a day is better than nothing  the drive was on the whole a success and so was the teadrinking in the verandah where aunt alice and little fiveyears old basil became fast friends and mutual admirers the canon strolled out and was installed in the big cushioned basketchair that crackled under his weight blanche recounted nutties successes and her own tennis engagements for the week mark lay on a rug and teased her and her dachshund nuttie listened to the family chatter as if it were a play and may dispensed the cups and looked grave and severe  well said the canon anxiously when mark blanche and little basil had insisted on escorting the guests home and he and his wife were for a few minutes teteatete  it might have been much worse said the lady  she is a good little innocent thing and has more good sense than i expected governessy thats all but she will shake out of that  of course she will  its the best thing imaginable for alwyn  his wife kept back the words a hundred times too good for alwyn     chapter xi  lawntennis    madam the guests are come supper served up   my young lady asked forromeo and juliet   a gardenparty mrs william egremont decided would be the best mode of testifying her approbation of her sisterinlaw and introducing the newcomers to the neighbourhood  so the invitations were sent forth for an early day of the coming week  from how many points of view was mrs william egremonts gardenparty regarded and how different  there was basil to whom it meant wearing his velvet suit and eating as many ices as mother would allow  to blanche it was an occasion for triumph on the tennis ground for herself and for hopes for her pupil and ursula herself looked forward to it and practised for it like a knight for his first encounter in the lists her sole care being to distinguish herself with her racket  to her mother it was an ordeal where she trusted not to be a mortification to her husband and his family while to the hostess it was a not unwelcome occasion of exercising honest diplomacy and tact not without a sense of magnanimity  to may it was a bore to be endured with dutiful philosophy to her goodnatured father an occasion for hospitality where he trusted that his brother would appear and appear to advantage and was ready even to bribe him thereto with that wonderful claret that alwyn had always envied and declared to be wasted on a parson  and mark perhaps he viewed the occasion with different eyes from any one else  at any rate even the denizens of bridgefield mustered there with as many minds as scott ascribes to the combatants of bannockburn and there were probably as many other circles of feeling more or less intersecting one another among the more distant guests most of them however with the same feeling of curiosity as to what this newlydiscovered wife and daughter of alwyn egremont might be like  externally in her rich black silk trimmed with point lace and her little strawcoloured bonnet with its tuft of feathery grass and blue cornflower she was so charming that her daughter danced round her crying o mammy mammy if they could but see you at homethen at a look well thenaunt ursel and miss mary and mr dutton  nuttie was very much pleased with her own pretty tennis dress but she had no personal vanity for herself only for her mother  the knowledge that she was no beauty was no grievance to her youthful spirits but when her father surveyed them in the hall she looked for his verdict for her mother as if their relations were reversed  ha  well you certainly are a pretty creature edda he said graciously  youll pass muster  you want nothing but style  and hang it youll do just as well without it if the canoness will only do you justice  faces like that werent given for nothing  she blushed incarnadine and accepted one of his kisses with a pleasure at which nuttie wondered her motherly affection prompting her to murmur in his ear  and ursula  shell not cut you out but she is egremont enough to do very fairly going already  if you would come with us she said wistfully to the horror of nuttie who was burning to be at the beginning of all the matches  i oh no  i promised old will to look in but that wont be till late in the day or i shall have to go handing all the dowagers into the diningroom to tea  then i think we had better go on  they asked us to come early so as to see people arrive and know who they are  they was a useful pronoun to alice who felt it a liberty to call her grandlooking sisterinlaw janewas too wellbred to term her mrs william  the mother and daughter crossed the gardens nuttie chattering all the way about the tennis tactics she had picked up from blanche while her mother answered her somewhat mechanically wondering as her eye fell on the square squat gray church tower what had become of the earnest devotion to church work and intellectual pursuits that used to characterise the girl  true always both mother and daughter had hitherto kept up their churchgoing and even their sundayschool habits nor had any hindrance come in their way mr egremont apparently acquiescing in what he never shared  but these things seemed in ursulas mind to have sunk out of the proportion they held at bridgefield no longer to be the spirit of a life but mere sunday duties and occupations  was this wicked world getting a hold of the poor child  which was duty which was the world  this was the thought that perplexed alice too simple as yet to perceive that ursulas former absorption had been in the interests that surrounded her and her companions exactly as they were at present and that the real being had yet to work itself out  for herself alice did not think at all  she was rejoicing in her restored husband and his evident affection  her duty towards him was in her eyes plain  she saw of course that he had no religion but she accepted the fact like that of bad weather she loved him and she loved her daughter she said her prayers with all her heart for them she hoped and she did her best without trying to go below the surface  there was the rectory gate wide open  there was basil rushing up to greet his dear aunt alice there were all the windows and doors of the rectory open and the nearer slopes covered with chairs and seats of all dimensions some under trees some umbelliferous and glowing afghan rugs or spotted skins spread for those who preferred the ground  there was blanche flitting about wild with excitement and pouncing on nuttie to admire her outfit and reiterate instructions there were the two younger girls altering the position of chairs according to their mothers directions there were actually two guestsnot very alarming ones only the curate and his wife both rather gaunt bony people  he was buttonholing the canon and she was trying to do the same by the canoness about some parish casualty the canon hoped to escape in the welcome to his sisterinlaw and niece but he was immediately secured again while his wife found it requisite to hurry off else where leaving mrs edwards to tell her story to mrs egremont  in point of fact alice really liked the good lady was quite at ease with her and felt parish concerns a natural element so that she gave full heed and attention to the cruelty of mrs parkins depriving betsy butter with an old father and mother to support of her family washing on the ground of a missing pocket handkerchief the which mrs edwards believed to have been abstracted by the favourite pickle of miss blanches class if only a confession could be elicited from him when undefended by his furious mother  mrs egremont was listening with actual interest and sympathy to the history of betsy butters struggles and was inquiring the way to her cottage when she was called off to be introduced to the arrivals who were beginning to flood the lawn  she presently saw may who had just come down walking up and down with mrs edwards evidently hearing the story of the handkerchief  she thought it had been nuttie for a moment  there was a general resemblance between the cousins that made them be mistaken for one another several times in the course of the day since their dresses though not alike were of the same make and style  thus it was that as nuttie was sitting on the grass in earnest contemplation of blanches play a hand was familiarly laid on her shoulder and a voice said  i havent seen that horrid girl yet  after so many introductions nuttie had little idea whom she knew or whom she did not know  she looked up and saw a small person in light blue with the delicate features transparent skin and blue eyes that accompany yellow hair with an indescribable glitter of mirth and joyousness about the whole creature as if she were part and parcel of the sunbeam in which she stood  what horrid girl said nuttie  the interloper the newlydiscovered savage come to upsetahwith a little shriekit isnt may  i beg your pardon  im mays cousin said nuttie ursula egremont  oh oh and therewith the fact burst on both girls at once  they stood still a moment in dismay then the stranger went into a fit of laughter  oh i beg your pardon  i cant help it  it is so funny  nuttie was almost infected though somewhat hurt  who said i was horrid she asked  nobody  nobody but meannaple ruthvenand theyll all tell you may and all that im always putting my foot in it  and i never meant that you were horridyou yourselfyou knowonly  only nobody wanted us here said nuttie but we could not help it  of course not  it was shocking just my way  please forgive me and she looked most pleading  nuttie held out her hand with something about no one could mind and therewith annaple cried oh if you dont mind we can have our laugh out and the rippling laughter did set nuttie off at once  the peal was not over when may herself was upon them demanding what was the joke  oh there she is  the real may  why said annaple kissing her only think here ive been and gone and thought this was you and inquired aboutwhat was itthe awful monsterthe chimera direthat mark had routed up  no you didnt say that said nuttie half provoked  never mind what i said  dont repeat it  i only wish myself and every one else to forget it  now it is swept to the winds by a good wholesome giggling  but what business have you two to be so inconveniently alike  you are as bad as the twin leslies  theres an old foremother on the staircase in white satin who left her looks to us both said may  youll have to wear badges said annaple  you know the leslies were so troublesome that one had to be shipped off to the east indies and the other to the west  they married thats all said may seeing nuttie looking mystified and at that moment blanches side coming out victorious nuttie descended into the arena to congratulate and be asked to form part of the next set  well that was a scrape said annaple but she wasnt bad about it i must do something to make up for it somehowget janet to invite her but really janet is in such a state of mind that i am mildness itself compared with her  she would not have come only john was curious and declared he should go whether we did or not  ah said may i saw him like the rest of mankind at madames feet  oh is she of that sort  no said may not at all  mother and father too both think she is good to the backbone but she is very pretty with just the inane soft sweetness that men rave aboutinnocent really  all accounts of her are excellent and she has nice parish ways and will be as helpful as uncle alwyn will let her  but she couldnt always have been nice  well i verily believe it was all uncle alwyns and grandmammas fault  i know mark thinks so  when the women of a family acquit a woman it goes for something said annaple  thats not original my dear i heard old lady grosmede say so to janet when she was deliberating over the invitation for a good deal more than mr marks at any rate  mark is very fond of herthe mother i mean  he says when he was a little fellow her loss was worse to him than even our mothers  do you remember the catastrophe  not a bit  only when she is petting basil it strikes me that i have heard the tones before  i only remember the time of misery under the crosspatches grandmamma got for us  well it was a splendid cutting of his own throat in mark said annaple so it ought to turn out well  i dont know how it is to turn out for mark answered may  oh here he comes  will you come into this set annaple he asked  they want another couple and as she accepted  how do you get on with mays double  i pity may for having such a double  dont encourage her by misplaced pity  its abominable altogether  i want to fly at somebody  exhaust your feelings on your racket and reflect that you see a man released from bondage  is that philosophy or highfaluting she said in a teasing tone as the game began  the ruthvens had very blue blood in their veins but as there were nine of the present generation they possessed little beyond their long pedigree even the head of the family lord ronnisglen being forced to live as a soldier leaving his castle to grouse shooters his seven brothers had fared mostly in distant lands as they could and his mother had found a home together with her youngest child at lescombe where her eldest was the wife of sir john delmar  lady ronnisglen was an invalid confined to the house and lady delmar had daughters fast treading on the heels of annabella so christened but always called annaple after the old scottish queens her ancestors she had been may egremonts chief friend ever since her importation at twelve years old and the intimacy had been promoted by her mother and sister  indeed the neighbourhood had looked on with some amusement at the competition ascribed to lady delmar and to the wealthy parvenu mrs west for the heirpresumptive of bridgefield egremont  annaples lightness and dexterity rendered her the best of the lady tennisplayers and the less practised ursula found herself defeated in the match in spite of a partner whose play was superior to marks and with whom she shyly walked off to eat ices  i see said annaple it is a countrytown edition of may  i shant blunder between them again  she will polish said mark but she is not equal to her mother  whom i have not seen yet  ah theres mr egremont  why he looks quite renovated  well he may be  but mark not to hurt your feelings he must have behaved atrociously  im not going to deny it said mark  i always did think he looked like it said annaple  when have you seen him before  only once but it was my admirable sagacity you understand  i always see all the villains in books just on his model  oh but whos that how very pretty  you dont mean it is she  well she might be the heroine of anything  isnt she lovely  and has she been keeping school like patience on a monument all these years  it doesnt seem to have much damaged her damask cheek  it was only daily governessing  she looks much better than when i first saw her and as to the damaskwhy thats deepened by the introduction to old lady grosmede that is impending  she is being walked up to the old spanish duck with the red rag round her leg to receive her fiat  what a thing it is to be a bearded dowager and rule ones neighbourhood  i think she approves  she has made room for her by her side  is she going to catechise her  annaple made an absurd sound of mingled pity and disgust  not that shemy aunt i meanneed be afraid  the shame is all on the other side  and i think lady grosmede has too much sense to think the worse of her for having worked for herself added annaple  if it was not for mother i should long to begin  you  its a longing well known to mebut you  exactly  as the irishman felt blue moulded for want of a bating so do i feel fagged out for want of an honest days work  if one only knew what to turn to said mark so wearily that annaple exclaimed  we seem to be in the frozenout state of mind and might walk up and down singing ive got no work to doto which she gave the well known intonation  too true said he joining in the hum  but i thought you were by way of reading law  one must see more than only by way of in these days to do any good  at that moment basil ran up with a message that lady delmar was ready to go home  they walked slowly up the terrace and mark paused as they came near mrs egremont to say aunt alice here is miss ruthven mays great friend  annaple met a pleasant smile and they shook hands exchanging an observation or two while a little way off lady grosmede was nodding her strong old face at lady delmar and saying tell your mother ill soon come and see her my dear  thats a nice little innocent body ladylike and thoroughly presentable  alwyn egremont might have done worse  the only wonder is he did not returned lady delmar  they make the best of it here  very good taste of them  but now ive seen her i dont believe theres anything behind  very hard upon the poor young man though it was all his doing his mother says  i congratulate you that it had not gone any farther in that quarter  oh dear no  never dreamt of it  she is mays friend thats all  nevertheless lady delmar made a second descent in person to hurry annaple away  isnt it disgusting said may catching her stepmothers smile  you will see a good deal more of the same kind said the canoness i am afraid more mortification is in store for mark than he guesses i wish that girl were more like her mother  mamma a girl brought up among umbrellamakers  just fancy  why she has just nothing in her  dont set mark against her may he might do worse  her head is a mere tennis ball said may drawing her own higher than ever and no one would know her from a shop girl  she is young enough said the canoness  dont class me with lady delmar mayi only sayifand that i dont think you realise the change mark will feel  better so than sell himself muttered may     chapter xii  out of work    im seeking the fruit thats nae growingballad   society recognised the newcomers  lady grosmedes card appeared the next day and was followed by showers of others and everybody asked everybody have you seen mrs egremont  it was well for alices happiness even at home that she was a success when alwyn egremont had been lashed by his nephews indignant integrity into tardy recognition of the wife of his youth it had been as if he had been forced to pick up a flower which he had thrown away  he had considerable doubts whether it would answer first he reconnoitred intending if he found a homely or faded being to pension her off but this had been prevented by her undeniable beauty and grace bringing up a rush of such tender associations as he was capable of  yet even then her position depended on the impression she might make on those about him on her own power of selfassertion and on her contributing to his comfort or pleasure  of selfassertion alice had none only a gentle dignity in her simplicity and she was so absolutely devoted to him that he found his house far more pleasant and agreeable for her presence and unfailing attention though still his estimation of her was influenced more than he owned to himself by that of the world in general and the rectory in particular  and the rectory did its part well  the canon was not only charmed with the gentle lady but felt an atonement due to her and his wife without ever breathing into any ears save his the mysterious adjective governessy praised her right and left confiding to all inquirers the romance of the burnt yacht the lost bride and the happy meeting under lady kirkaldys auspices with the perfect respectability of the intermediate career while such was the universal esteem for and trust in herself and the canon that she was fully believed and people only whispered that probably alwyn egremont had been excused for the desertion more than he deserved  the subject of all this gossip troubled herself about it infinitely less than did the good canoness  in effect she did not know enough of the world to think about it at all  her cares were of a different order chiefly caused by tenderness of conscience and solicitude to keep the peace between the two beings whom she best loved  two things were in her favour in this latter respect one that they saw very little of each other since mr egremont seldom emerged from his own rooms till after luncheon and the other that ursulas brains ran to little but lawntennis for the ensuing weeks  to hold a champions place at the tournaments neck and neck with her cousin blanche and defeat miss ruthven and that veteran player miss basset was her foremost ambition and the two cousins would have practised morning noon and night if their mothers would have let them  there need have been no fear of ursulas rebellion about the cambridge honours she never seemed even to think of them and would have had no time in the more important competition of rackets indeed it was almost treated as a hardship that the pair were forbidden to rush together before twelve oclock and that ursulas mother insisted on rational home occupation until that time setting the example herself by letterwriting needlework and sharing in the music which was a penance to the girl only enforced by that strong sense of protecting affection which forbade rebellion  but alice could hope that their performances were pleasant to her husband in the evening if only to sleep by and so she persisted in preparing for them  nutties rage for tennis and apparent forgetfulness of her old life and aspirations might be disappointing but it conduced to make her mothers task easier than if she had been her original critical and protesting self  in the new and brilliant surroundings she troubled herself much less than could have been expected at the failure of her father his house nay and of the parish itself in coming up to the st ambrose standard  how much was owing to mere novelty and intoxication how much to a yet unanalysed disappointment how much to mays having thrown her upon the more frivolous blanche could not be guessed  the effect was unsatisfactory to her mother but a certain relief for nutties aid would have been only mischievous in the household difficulties that weighed on the anxious conscience good servants would not stay at bridgefield hall for unexplained causes which their mistress believed to be connected with gregorio or with the treasure of a cookhousekeeper over whom she was forbidden to exercise any authority and who therefore entirely neglected all meals which the master did not share with the ladies fortunately mr egremont came in one day at their luncheon and found nothing there but semiraw beef upon which there was an explosion and being by this time convinced that his wife both would and could minister to his comfort her dominion was established in the female department though as long as gregorio continued paramount with his master and the stables remained in their former state it was impossible to bring matters up to the decorous standard of the rectory and if ever his mistress gave an order he did not approve gregorio overruled it as her ignorance  in fact he treated both the ladies with a contemptuous sort of civility  meantime mr egremont was generally caressing and admiring in his ways towards his wife with only occasional bursts of temper when anything annoyed him  he was proud of her gave her a liberal allowance and only refused to be troubled and she was really happy in his affection for which she felt a gratitude only too humble in the eyes of her daughter  they had parties  blanches ambition of tennis courts all over the lawn was fulfilled and sundry dinners which were crosses to alice who had neither faculty nor training for a leader and hostess suffered much from the menu more from the pairing of her guests more again in catching her chief ladys eye after and most of all from her husbands scowls and subsequent growls and their consequence for ursula broke out it is not fair to blame my mother  how should she have all the savoirfaire or what you may call it of aunt jane when she has had no practice  perhaps mrs egremont he retorted with extreme suavity you will also attend to your daughters manners  otherwise he took little notice of ursula viewing her perhaps as did the neighbourhood as a poor imitation of may without her style or it may be with a sense that her tongue might become inconvenient if not repressed  when he began to collect sporting guests of his own calibre in the shooting season the canoness quietly advised her sisterinlaw to regard them as gentlemens parties and send ursula down to spend the evening with her cousins and to this no objection was made  mr egremont wanted his beautiful wife at the head of his table and his guests never comported themselves unsuitably before her but nobody wanted the unformed girl and she and blanche were always happy together  the chief restraint was when mark was at home and that was not always he made sundry visits and expeditions and was altogether in an uncomfortable condition of reaction and perplexity as to his future he was a good and conscientious fellow and had never been actually idle but had taken education and life with the easiness of the prospective heir to a large property and though he had acquitted himself creditably it was with no view of making his powers marketable  though he had been entered at the temple it was chiefly in order to occupy himself respectably and to have a nominal profession so as not to be wholly dependent on his uncle and all that he had acquired was the conviction that it would be half a lifetime if not a whole one before the law would afford him a maintenance  his father wished him to take holy orders with a view to the reversion of the rectory but marks estimate of clerical duty and vocation was just such as to make him shrink from them  he was threeandtwenty an awkward age for all those examinations that stand as lions in the face of youth intended for almost any sort of service and seldom or never to be gagged by interest  for one indeed he went up and failed and in such a manner as to convince him that cramming had more to do than general culture with success  he had a certain consciousness that most people thought another way open to him most decidedly his gentle aunt and perhaps even his parents  the matter came prominently before him one day at luncheon when some parochial affairs being on hand and mr egremont out for the day alice whose free forenoons enabled her to take a share in church and parish affairs was there as well as the curate and his wife  these good people were in great commotion about a wedding about to take place between a young farmer and his delicate first cousin the only survivor of a consumptive family  proputty proputty quoted the canon  james johnson is what they call a warm man  it is a sin and a shame said mrs edwards  what can they expect george johnson looks strong enough now but they tell me his brother undoubtedly died of decline though they called it inflammation but there was tubercular disease  i am afraid it is strong in the family said the canoness they all have those clear complexions but i do believe george is heartily in love with poor little emily  first cousins ought to be in the table of degrees said mr edwards  it is always a question whether the multiplying of prohibitions without absolute necessity is expedient said the canon  he spoke quite dispassionately but the excellent couple were not remarkable for tact  mrs edwards gave her husband such a glance of warning and consternation as violently inclined may to laugh and he obediently and hesitatingly began oh yes sir i beg your pardon of course there may be instances thereby bringing an intense glow of carnation into alices cheeks while the canon ready for the occasion replied and george johnson considers himself one of them he will repair the old moat house i suppose  and his wife though she would rather have beaten mrs edwards demanded how many blankets would be wanted that winter  the effect of this little episode was that mark announced to his father that evening his strong desire to emigrate an intention which the canon combated with all his might  he was apparently a hale and hearty man but he had had one or two attacks of illness that made him doubt whether he would be longlived and not only could he not bear to have his eldest son out of reach but he dreaded leaving his family to such a head as his brother  mark scarcely thought the reasons valid considering the rapidity of communication with canada but it was not possible to withstand the entreaties of a father with tears in his eyes and though he could not bring himself to consent to preparing to be his fathers curate he promised to do nothing that would remove him to another quarter of the world and in two or three days more started for monks horton to see what advice his uncle and aunt there could give him indeed lord kirkaldys influence was reckoned on by his family almost as a sure card in the diplomatic line  the kirkaldys were very fond of mark and had an odd feeling of being accountable for the discovery which had changed his prospects  they would have done anything for him that they could but all lord kirkaldys interest was at the foreign office or with his fellowdiplomates and here he soon found an insuperable bar  marks education had stood still from the time of miss headworths flight till his fathers second marriage his energies having been solely devoted to struggles with the grim varieties of governess purveyed by his grandmother and he had thus missed all chance of foundation of foreign languages and when once at school he had shared in the average english boys contempt and aversion for the french masters who outscreamed a whole class  in consequence lord kirkaldy an accurate and elegant scholar in european tongues besides speaking them with the cosmopolitan ease of an ambassadors son was horrified not only at marks pronunciation but at his attempts at letterwriting and translation made with all the good will in the world but fit for nothing but to furnish the good stories which the kind uncle refrained from telling any one but his wife  unluckily too a piedmontese family some of them not strong in their english were on a visit at monks horton and the dialect in which the old marquis and mark tried at times to interchange ideas about pheasants was something fearful  and as in the course of a week mark showed no signs of improvement in vernacular french or italian lord kirkaldys conscience would let him give no other advice than that his nephew should stick to english law living still on the allowance his father gave him and hoping for one of the chance appointments open to an english barrister of good family and fair ability  of course mark had gone at once to carry tidings of aunt alice as he scrupulously called her to old miss headworth whom his aunt had continued to visit at intervals  that good lady had given up her boarders having realised enough to provide for her own old age and she had joined forces with the nugents mary being very thankful to have her companionship for mrs nugent who was growing too blind and feeble to be satisfactorily left alone all day  mark delighted the old ladies by his visits and accounts of their darlings success and popularity which he could paint so brightly that they could not help exulting even though there might be secret misgivings as to the endurance of these palmy days  he was a great hero in their eyes and they had too good taste to oppress him with their admiration so that he really was more at ease in their little drawingroom than anywhere at monks horton whither the italians could penetrate  the marchesino spoke english very well but that was all the worse for mark since it gave such a sense of inferiority  he was an intelligent man too bent on being acquainted with english industries of all kinds and thus it was that a party was organised to see the umbrella factory  it was conducted by mr dutton with whom lord kirkaldy between charities and public business had become acquainted  to marks secret shame this manufacturer spoke french perfectly and even got into such a lively conversation with the old marquis about cavour that lord kirkaldy begged him to come to dinner and continue it  they were all surprised not only by the details of the manufacture and the multitude of artizans male and female whom it employed but by the number of warehouseclerks whom they found at work and who it appeared were in correspondence with agencies and depots in london and all the principal towns in the kingdom  gerard godfrey was therecasting looks askance at the young egremont whom he regarded as a kind of robber  the marchesino asked from what class these young men were taken and mr dutton made reply that most of them were sons of professional men if they could obtain a small capital and take shares in the business they were encouraged to do so and rose to the headship of the agencies obtaining a fair income  and you dont exact an examination said mark  except in handwriting and bookkeeping said mr dutton  poor mark you look for your bugbear everywhere sighed his aunt  they went over the institute coffeerooms eatingrooms and lodginghouses by which the umbrella firm strove to keep their hands respectable and contented and were highly pleased with all most especially with mr dutton who though his name did not come prominently forward had been the prime mover and contriver of all these things and might have been a wealthier man if he had not undertaken expenses which he could not charge upon the company  gerard godfrey came in to mrs nugents that evening in the lowest spirits  he had a sister married to a curate in the same county with bridgefield and she had sent him a local paper which understood that a marriage was arranged between mark de lyonnais egremont esquire and ursula daughter of alwyn piercefield egremont esquire of bridgefield egremont and he could not help coming to display it to miss headworth in all its impertinence and prematurity  indeed he said nothing to me about it said miss headworth and i think he would if it had been true  no doubt he intends it and is trying to recommend himself through you said gerard  i should not think he needed that returned aunt ursel though i should be very glad i am sure  he is an excellent young man and it is quite the obvious thing  people dont always do the obvious thing put in mary nugent  certainly it didnt look like it said miss headworth when he told us about the great annual hunt ball at redcastle that nuttie and his sister blanche are to come out at he said he did not intend to go home for it if he could help it  struggling against fate said miss nugent  the puppy burst out gerard  having ascertained the particulars of this same hunt ball gerard became possessed with a vehement desire to visit his sister and so earnestly solicited a few days leave of absence that it was granted to him  poor boy he may settle down when he has ascertained what an ass he is said mr dutton  ah said mary  i thought he was very bad when i saw he had not changed the green markers for st lukes day     chapter xiii  detrimentals    that tongue of yours at times wags more than charity allows    and if youre strong be merciful great woman of three cows                                                      j o mangan   nine miles was a severe distance through country lanes in november to go to a ball but the redcastle hunt ball was the ball of the year uniting all the county magnates and young ladies were hardly reckoned as come out till they had appeared there  mrs egremonts position would hardly be established till she had been presented to the notabilities who lived beyond calling intercourse and her husband prepared himself to be victimised with an amount of grumbling that was intended to impress her with the magnitude of the sacrifice but which only made her offer to forego the gaiety and be told that she would never have any common sense  so their carriage led the way and was followed by the rectory waggonette containing the ladies and mark who had been decisively summoned home since his stepmother disliked public balls without a gentleman in attendance and his father was not to be detached from his fireside  and in a group near the door got up as elaborately as his powers could accomplish stood gerard godfrey  he knew nobody there except a family in his sisters parish who had goodnaturedly given him a seat in their fly and having fulfilled his duty by asking the daughter to dance he had nothing to disturb him in watching for the cynosure whose attraction had led him into these unknown regions and as he remembered with a qualm on the eve of st britius however with such a purpose one might surely grant oneself a dispensation from the vigil of a black letter saint  there at length he beheld the entrance  there was the ogre himself high bred almost handsome as long as he was not too closely scrutinised and on his arm the wellknown figure metamorphosed by delicatelytinted satin sheen and pearls and still more by the gentle blushing gladness on the fair cheeks and the soft eyes that used to droop  then followed a stately form in mulberry moire and point lace leaning on gerards more especial abhorrencethat puppy who had been the author of all the mischief and behind them three girls one in black the other two in white and what was provoking he really could not decide which was ursula  the carefullydressed hair and stylish evening dress and equipments had altogether transformed the little homely schoolgirl so that though he was sure that she was not the fairhaired damsel with pale blue flowers he did not know how to decide between the white and daisies and the black and grasses indeed he thought the two whites most likely to be sisters and all the more when the black lace halted to exchange greetings with some one and her face put on an expression so familiar to him that he started forward and tried to catch her eye but in vain and he suffered agonies of doubt whether she had been perverted by greatness  it was some comfort that when presently a rush of waiters floated by she was not with her cousin but to provoke him still more as the daisies neared him he beheld for a moment in the whirl the queer smile halffrightened halfexultant which he had seen on nutties face when swinging skyhigh  when the pause came and people walked about the black lady stood talking so near him that he ventured at last on a step forward and an eager miss egremont but as she turned he found himself obliged to say i beg your pardon  did you mean my cousin  we often get mistaken for each other said may civilly  he brightened  i beg your pardon he said i knew her at micklethwayte  i am herequite by accident  mrs elmore was so good as to bring me  may was rather entertained  theres my cousin she said lord philip molyneux is asking her to dance and she left him most unnecessarily infuriated with lord philip molyneux  a steward introduced him to a dulllooking girl but fortune favoured him for this time he did catch the real nutties eye and all herself as soon as the dance was over she came up with outstretched hands oh gerard to think of your being here  come to mother  and beautiful and radiant mrs egremont was greeting him and there were ten minutes of delicious exchange of news  but pleasures are as poppies fled nuttie had no dance to spare her card was full and she had not learnt fashionable effrontery enough to play tricks with engagements and just then mr egremont descended on themi wish to introduce you to the duchess he said to his wife and on the way he demandedwho is that young cub  gerard godfreyan old neighbour  i thought i had seen him racketing about there with ursula  ill not have those umbrella fellows coming about  does he really make umbrellas nuttie asked blanche catching her hand  no such thing said nuttie hotly he is in the office  his father was a surgeon his sisters married clergymen  and he came here to meet you said annaple ruthven  poor fellow what a shame it is  cant you give him one turn  oh dear  im engaged all through  to mark this time  give him one of the extras  throw mark over to me  no as she looked at the faces of the two girls i suppose that wouldnt do but im free this timeim not the fashion  introduce me ill do my best as consolation  nuttie had just performed the feat with great shyness when mark appeared having been sent in quest of his cousin when her father perceived that she had hung back  poor gerard led off miss ruthven the more gloomily and could not help sighing out i suppose that is an engagement  oh you believe that impertinent gossip in the paper returned annaple  i wonder they dont contradict it but perhaps they treat it with magnificent scorn  no doubt they know that it is only premature  if they means the elders i daresay they wish it but we arent in france or italy  then you dont think miss ruthven that it will come off  i dont see the slightest present prospect said annaple unable to resist the kindly impulse of giving immediate pleasure though she knew the prospect might be even slighter for her partner  however he footed it all the more lightly and joyously for the assurance and the goodnatured maiden afterwards made him conduct her to the tearoom whither mark and nuttie were also tending and there all four contrived to get mixed up together and nuttie had time to hear of monsieurs new accomplishment of going home for mr duttons luncheon and bringing it in a basket to the office before fate again descended mr egremont who had been at the far end of the room among some congeners who preferred stronger refreshment suddenly heard her laugh stepped up and with a look of thunder towards her observed in a low voice mark you will oblige me by taking your cousin back to her mother  the gray tyrant father murmured annaple in sympathy  that being the case i may as well go back in that direction also  this resulted in finding lady delmar and the two mrs egremonts together comparing notes about the two different roads to redcastle from their several homes  lady delmar was declaring that her coachman was the most obstinate man in existence and that her husband believed in him to any extent  which way did you come she asked  by bankside lane said the canoness  over bluepost bridge  there janet said annaple  so much the worse  i know we shall come to grief over bluepost bridge and now there will be treble weight to break it down  i dreamt it i tell you and theres second sight in the family  yes but you should tell what you did dream janet said her sister she thought robinson the coachman was waltzing with her over it and they went into a hole and stuck fast while the redflag traction engineman prodded her with an umbrella till she was all over blood now if it had been anything rational i should have thought something of her second sight  i tell her twas suggested by           london bridge is broken down           dance oer my lady lee   well i am quite certain those tractionengines will break it some time or other said lady delmar  i am always trying to get john to bring it before the magistrates but he only laughs at me and nothing will induce robinson to go the other way because they have just been mending the road on lescombe hill  annaple my dear i cant allow you another waltz mark must excuse youi am going  it is halfpast two and the carriage was ordered at two  robinson will be in a worse temper than ever if we keep him waiting  she bore her sister off to the cloakroom and there nearly an hour later the egremonts found them still waiting the pleasure of the implacable robinson but what was that in consideration of having kept her sister from such a detrimental as poor mark had become  so muttered mr egremont in the satisfaction of having himself with gentlemanly severity intimated the insuperable gulf between miss egremont of bridgefield and the man of umbrellas  moreover his sisterinlaw took care that he should hear that the duchess of redcastle had pronounced his wife sweetly pretty and ladylike and talked of inviting them for a visit of a few nights  a bore observed he ungratefully tis as dull as ditchwater but in truth though the canons family when in residence were intimate with the ducal family alwyn egremont had never been at the castle since the days of his earliest youth and he was not quite prepared to owe his toleration there to his wifes charms or the canonesss patronage of her  and innocent alice only knew that everybody had been very kind to her and it was only a pity that her husband did not like her to notice poor gerard godfrey     chapter xiv  going agee    gin ye were a brig as auld as meburns   whats the matter exclaimed mrs egremont waking from a dozethat bridge  bridge  dont be such a fool  we arent near it yet  the servant his face looking blurred through the window came to explain that the delay was caused by an agricultural engine which had chosen this unlucky night or morning to travel from one farm to another  there was a long delay while the monster could be heard coughing frightfully before it could be backed with its spiky companion into a field so as to let the carriages pass by and meantime mr egremont was betrayed into uttering ejaculations which made poor nuttie round her eyes in the dark as she sat by his feet on the back seat and alice try to bury her ears in her hood in the corner  on they went at last for about a mile and then came another sudden stopanother fierce growl from mr egremont another apparition of the servant at the window saying in his alert deferential manner sir the bridge have broke under a carriage in front  lady delmars sir the horse is plunging terrible  the door was torn open and all three regardless of ball costumes precipitated themselves out  the moon was up and they saw the rectory carriage safe on the road before them but on the bridge beyond was a struggling mass dimly illuminated by a single carriage lamp mr egremont and the groom hurried forward where mark and the rectory coachman were already rendering what help they could  may standing at the horses heads and her mother trying to wrap everybody up since stay in their carriages they could not  transferring the horses to nuttie the two sisters hurried on towards the scene of action but blanches white satin boots did not carry her far and she turned on meeting her uncle  he spoke with a briskness and alacrity that made him like another man in this emergency as he assured the anxious ladies that their friends were safe but that they could not be extricated till the carriage was lifted from the hole into which it had sunk amid bricks stones and broken timbers  he sent his own coachman to assist as being the stronger man and mounting the box turned and drove off in quest of further help at a wayside cottage or from the attendants on the engine whose weight had probably done the mischief and prepared the trap for the next comer  as may came near her brother made her available by putting the lamp into her hand bidding her hold it so as to light those who were endeavouring to release the horse which had cleared the portion of the bridge before the breakdown under the brougham and now lay on the road its struggles quelled by a servant at its head  nearly the whole of the hind wheels and most of the door had disappeared on one side and though more was visible on the other it was impossible to open the door as a mass of rubbish lay on it  annaple was on this side and her voice was heard calling to may in fits of the laughter which is perhaps near akin to screams           london bridge is broken down            dance oer my lady lee   janet will go in for secondsight ever after  yes shes all right except a scratch from the glass and that im sitting on her more or less  how are they getting on  the horse is all but out  not hurt they think  heres another man come to helpa gentlemanmy dear it is your partner nutties umbrella man  oh making it completehopes janetim sorry but i cant help squashing you i cant help subsiding on you  what is it now as the lamplight vanished  they are looking for something to make levers of returned may these wooden rails are too rotten  cant they get us through the window sighed a muffled voice  not unless we could be elongated like the hope of the katzekopfs  we shall manage now cried mark we have found some iron bars to the hatch down there  but you must prepare for a shock or two before you can be set free  the two gentlemen and three servants strove and struggled hoisted and pushed to the tune of suppressed sounds half of sobs half of laughter till at last the carriage was heaved up sufficiently to be dragged backwards beyond the hole but even then it would not stand for the wheels on the undermost side were crushed neither could either door be readily opened one being smashed in and the other jammed fast  annaple however still tried to keep up her own spirits and her sisters observing that she now knew how to sympathise with johnnies tin soldiers in their box turned upside down  two sturdy labourers here made their appearance having been roused in the cottage and brought back by mr egremont and at last one door was forced open by main force and the ladies emerged annaple helping her sister beginning some droll thanks but pausing as she perceived that lady delmars dress was covered with blood  my dear janet  this is worse than i guessed  why did you not speak  it is not much said the poor lady rather faintly  my neck  the elder ladies came about her and seated her on cushions where by the light of mays lamp alice who had been to an ambulance class at micklethwayte detected the extent of the cut extracted a fragment of glass and staunched the bleeding with handkerchiefs and strips of the girls tulle skirts but she advised her patient to be driven at once to a surgeon to secure that no morsel of glass remained  mr egremont gratified to see his wife come to the front undertook to drive her back to redcastle  indeed they must return thither to cross by the higher bridge  you will go with me entreated lady delmar holding alices hand and the one hastily consigning nuttie to her aunts care the other giving injunctions not to alarm her mother to annaple who had declared her intention of walking home the two ladies went off under mr egremonts escort  just then it was discovered that the delmar coachman robinson had all this time been lying insensible not dead for he moaned but apparently with a broken leg if nothing worse  indeed the men had known it all along but until the ladies had been rescued nothing had been possible but to put his cushion under his head and his rug over him  the ladies were much shocked and mrs william egremont decided that he must be laid at the bottom of the waggonette and that she would take him straight to the hospital  they were only a mile and a half from lescombe and it was pronounced safe to cross on foot by the remains of the bridge so that annaple who had a pair of fur boots had already decided on going home on foot the other girls wanted to accompany her and as may and nuttie both had overshoes they were permitted to do so and desired to go to bed and wait to be picked up by the waggonette which must return to bridgefield by the lescombe road  blanche having a delicate throat was sentenced to go with her stepmother  mark undertook to ride the horse through the river and escort the three girls and gerard godfrey also joined them  the place where he was staying lay a couple of miles beyond lescombe and when mrs elmores fly had been met and turned back by mr egremont he had jumped off to render assistance and had done so effectively enough to win marks gratitude  it was by this time about halfpast five as was ascertained by the light of the waning moon the carriagelamp having burnt out  it was a fine frosty morning and the moon was still powerful enough to reveal the droll figures of the girls  may had a fur cloak with the hood tied over her head by mrs egremonts lace shawl nuttie had a huge white cloud over her head and a light blue opera cloak annaple had rowed herself in a plaidie like the scotch girl she was and her eyes flashed out merrily from its dark folds  they all disdained the gentlemens selfdenying offers of their ulsters and only nuttie consented to have the carriagerug added to her trappings and ingeniously tied on cloakfashion with her sash by gerard  he and mark piloted the three ladies over the narrow border of the hole which looked a very black open gulf  annaple had thanked the men and bidden them come to lescombe the next day to be paid for their assistance then they all stood to watch mark ride through the river at the shallowest place indicated both by her and the labourers  it was perfectly fordable so annaples were mock heroics when she quoted           never heavier man and horse           stemmed a midnight torrents force   and nuttie responded in a few seconds           yet through good heart and our ladyes grace           full soon he gained the landing place   they were both in high spirits admiring each others droll appearance and speculating on the ghosts they might appear to any one who chanced to look out of window  annaple walked at the horses head calling him poor old robin hood and caressing him while gerard and nuttie kept together  may began to repent of her determination to walk lescombe seemed very far off and she had an instinct that she was an awkward fifth wheel either because robin hood walked too fast for her weary limbs or because she felt it a greater duty to chaperon nuttie than annaple she fell back on the couple in the rear and was rather surprised at the tenor of their conversation  this umbrella man was telling of his vicars delight in the beautiful chalice veil that had been sent by mrs egremont and nuttie was communicating as a secret she ought not to tell that mother was working a set of stoles and hoped to have the white ones ready by the dedication anniversary also that there was a box being filled for the st ambrose christmas tree  they were trying to get something nice for each of the choir boys and of the old women and therewith to mays surprise this youth whom she regarded as a sort of shopman fell into full narration of all the events of a highlyworked parishall about the choral festival and the guilds and the choir and the temperance work  a great deal of it was a strange language to may but she halfdisapproved of it as entirely unlike the soberness of bridgefield ways and like the redcastle vicar whom her father commonly called that madman  still she had a practical soul for parish work and could appreciate the earnestness that manifested itself and the exertions made for people of the classes whom she had always supposed too bad or else too well off to come under clerical supervision  and her aunt and cousin and this young man all evidently had their hearts in it  for nuttiethough her new world had put the old one apparently asidehad plunged into all the old interests and asked questions eagerly and listened to their answers as if micklethwayte news was water to the thirsty the two were too happy to meet and it must be confessed had not quite manners enough to feel it needful to include in their conversation the weary figure that plodded along at a little distance from them hardly attending to the details of their chatter yet deriving new notions from it of the former life of ursula and her mother matters which she had hitherto thought beneath her attention except so far as to be thankful that they had emerged from it so presentable  that it was a more actively religious and perhaps a more intellectual one than her own she had thought impossible where everything must be secondrate  and yet when her attention had wandered from an account of mr duttons dealings with a refractory choir boy bent on going to the races she found a discussion going on about some past lectures upon astronomy and nuttie vehemently regretting the not attending two courses promised for the coming winter upon electricity and on italian art and mournfully observing we never go to anything sensible here  may at first thought impertinent little thing and felt affronted but then owned to herself that it was all too true  otherwise there was hardly anything said about the contrast with nutties present life gerard knew already that the church atmosphere was very different and with the rectors daughter within earshot he could not utter his commiseration nor nuttie her regrets  once there was a general start and the whole five came together at the sight of a spectrally black apparition with a huge tufted head on high bearing down over a low hedge upon them  nobody screamed except nuttie but everybody started though the next moment it was plain that they were only chimneysweepers on their way  retribution for our desire to act ghosts said annaple when the sable forms had been warned of the broken bridge  poor may you are awfully tired  shouldnt you like a lift in their cart  or i could put you up on robin hood said mark  thank you i dont think i could stick on  is it much farther  only up the hill and across the park said annaple still cheerily  take my arm old woman said mark and then there was a pause before annaple said in an odd voice you may tell her mark  oh annaple  mark is it so cried may joyously but under her breath and with a glance to see how near the other couple were  yes said annaple between crying and laughing  poor janet shell think we have taken a frightfully mean advantage of her but i am sure i never dreamt of such a thing and the queer thing is that mark says she put it into his head  no no said mark you know better than that  why you told me you only found it out when she began to trample on the fallen  i told you i had only understood my own heart  and i said very much the sameshe made me so angry you see  i cant but admire your motives said may exceedingly rejoiced all the time and ready to have embraced them both if it had not been for the spectators behind  in fact it was opposition you both wanted  i wonder how long you would have gone on not finding it out if all had been smooth  the worst of it is said annaple that im afraid it is a very bad thing for mark  not a bit of it retorted he  it is the only thing that could have put life into my work or made me care to find any  and find it i will now  must we let the whole world in to know before i have found it annaple  i could not but tell my mother said annaple  it would come out in spite of me even if i wished to keep it back  oh yes  lady ronnisglen is a different thing said mark  just as may here is  and she will say nothing i know till we are readymy dear old minnie said annaple  only mark do pray have something definite to hinder janet with if there are any symptoms of hawking her commodity about  i will said mark  if we could only emigrate  ah if we could said annaple  ronald is doing so well in new zealand but i dont think my mother could spare me  she could not come out and she must be with me wherever i am  you knowdont youthat i am seven years younger than alick  i was a regular surprise and the old nurse at ronnisglen said depend upon it my leddy she is given to be the comfort of your old age  and i have always made up my mind never to leave her  i dont think she would get on with janet or any of them without me so youll have to take her too mark  with all my heart he answered  and indeed i have promised my father not to emigrate  i must and will find work at hand and wake a home for you both  but you will tell papa at once said may  it will hurt him if you do not  you are right may i knew it when annaple spoke of her mother but there is no need that it should go further  the intelligence had lightened the way a good deal and they were at the lodge gates by this time  gerard began rather ruefully to take leave but annaple in largehearted happiness and gratitude begged him to come and rest at the house and wait for daylight and this he was only too glad to do especially as mays secession had made the conversation a little more personal  nuttie was in a certain way realising for the first time what her mothers loyalty had checked her in expressing even if the tumult of novelties had given her full time to dwell on it  everybody outside is kind she said to gerard they are nice in a way and good but oh they are centuries behind in church matters and feeling just like the old rector  i gathered that i am very sorry for you  is there no one fit to be a guide  i dont know said nuttie  i didnt thinki must somehow before lent  there is advent close at hand he said gravely  if you could only be at our mission services we hope to get father smith  oh if only i could  but mother never likes to talk about those kind of things  she says our duty is to my father  not the foremost  no she would not say that  but oh gerard if he should be making her worldly  it must be your work to hinder it he said looking at her affectionately  oh gerard but im afraid im getting so myself  i have thought a great deal about lawntennis and dress and this ball said nuttie somehow it has never quite felt real but as if i were out on a visit  you are in it but not of it said gerard admiringly  no im not so good as that  i like it allalmost all  i thought i liked it better till you came and brought a real true breath of micklethwayte  oh if i could only see monsieurs dear curly head and bright eyes  this had been the tenor of the talk and these were the actual last words before the whole fivejust in the first streaks of dawncoalesced before the front door to be admitted by a sleepy servant mark tied up the horse for a moment while annaple sent the man to waken sir john delmar and say there had been a slight accident but no one was much hurt and as they all entered the warm dimlylighted hall they were keenly sensible that they had been dancing or walking all night  rest in the chairs which stood round the big hearth and smouldering woodfire was so extremely comfortable as they all dropped down that nobody moved or spoke or knew how long it was before there was a voice on the stairseh whats this annaple  an accident wheres janet and a tall burly figure candle in hand in a dressinggown and slippers was added to the group  janet will be at home presently i hope said annaple but she got a cut with some broken glass and we sent her round by dr raymonds to get it set to rights  oh john we came to grief on bluepost bridge after all and im afraid robinson has got his leg broken  sir john was a goodnatured heavy man whose clever wife thought for him in all that did not regard horses dogs and game  he looked perfectly astounded and required to have all told him over again before he could fully take it in  then he uttered a suppressed malediction on engines insisted that all his impromptu guests should immediately eat drink and sleep and declared his intention of going off at once to redcastle to see about his wife  the two gentlemen were committed to the charge of the butler and annaple took nuttie and may to her sisters dressingroom where she knew she should find fire and tea and though they protested that it was not worth while she made them undress and lie down in a room prepared for them in the meantime  it was a state chamber with a big bed far away from the entrance shuttered and curtained up and with double doors excluding all noise  the two cousins lay down nuttie dead asleep almost before her head touched the pillow while may was aching all over declaring herself far too much tired and excited to sleep and besides that it was not worth while for she should be called for in a very short time  and she remained conscious of a great dread of being roused so that when she heard her cousin moving about the room she insisted that they had scarcely lain down whereupon nuttie laughed declared that she had heard a great clock strike twelve before she moved and showed daylight coming in through the shutters  we cant lie here any longer i suppose said may sitting up wearily and yet what can we put on  it makes one shiver to think of going down to luncheon in a ball dress  besides mine is all torn to pieces to make bandages said nuttie i must put on the underskirt and my cloak again  or annaple might lend us something  i must get out somehow to know how poor lady delmar is and what has become of everybody  ring ursula please and lie down till somebody comes  the bell was answered by a maid who told them that my lady had been brought home by mr and mrs egremont about an hour after their arrival  she was as well as could be expected and there was no cause for anxiety  mr and mrs egremont had then gone on to bridgefield leaving word that mrs william egremont and miss blanche were sleeping at redcastle having sent home for their own dresses and the young ladies and would call for the rest of their party on the way indeed a box for the miss egremonts had been deposited by the canon from the ponycarriage an hour ago and was already in the dressingroom but miss ruthven would not have them disturbed  miss ruthvenoh yes she was up she had not been in bed at all     chapter xv  a castle of umbrellas   no annaple ruthven could not have slept even if she had had time her first care had been to receive her sister who had been met at the entrance of redcastle by her husband  there had been profuse offers of hospitality to mr and mrs egremont the latter of whom looked tired out and offers of sending messengers to bridgefield but mr egremont would not hear of them and every one suspected that he would not incur the chance of rising without gregorio and all his appliances  by the time they were disposed of and lady delmar safe in bed it was time to repair to her mothers room so as to prevent her from being alarmed  lady ronnisglen was english born  she was not by any means the typical dowager  her invalid condition was chiefly owing to an accident which had rendered her almost incapable of walking and she was also extremely susceptible of cold and therefore hardly ever went out but there was so much youth and life about her at sixtythree that she and annaple often seemed like companion sisters and her shrewd keen managing eldestborn like their mother  annaple lay down beside her on her bed in the morning twilight and gave her the history of the accident in playful terms indeed annaple could never help that but there was something in her voice that made lady ronnisglen say when satisfied about janets hurt youve more to say nannie dear  yes minnie mine i walked home with mark egremont  and  yes minnie  he is going to work and make a homea real true homely home for you and me  my child my child you have not hung the old woman about the poor boys neck  as if i would have had him if he did not love her and make a mother of her  but what is he going to do nan  this is a very different thing from  very different from janets notions and they both laughed the mother adding to the mirth by saying  poor janet congratulating herself that no harm had been done and that you had never taken to one another  did she really now  oh yes only yesterday and i bade her not crow too soon for i thought i saw symptoms  you dear darling minnie  think of that  before we either of us knew it and when he is worth ever so much than he was before  not but that i am enraged when people say he has acted nobly just as if there had been anything else for him to do  i own that i am glad he has proved himself  i was afraid he would be dragged in the way of his uncle  dont be furious nannie  not at all into evil but into loitering and i should like to know what are his prospects now  well mother i dont think he has any  but he means to have  and not a word is to be said to anybody except you and his father and may till he has looked over the top of the wall and seen his way  we need not bring janet down on us till then  i must see him my dear  let me see him before he goes away  he always has been a very dear lad a thoroughly excellent rightminded fellow  only i must know what he means to do and whether there is any reasonable chance of employment or fixed purpose  lady ronnisglens maid here arrived with her matutinal cup of tea and annaple beginning to perceive that she was very stiff went off in hopes that her morning toilette would deceive her hardworked little frame into believing it had had a proper nights rest  she was quite ready to appear at the breakfast table though her eldest niece a longhaired longlimbed girl considerably the bigger of the two was only too happy to preside over the cups  all the four young people were in the greatest state of excitement welcoming as the heroes of the night mark and mr godfrey and clamouring to be allowed to walk down after breakfast with their father and the gentlemen to see the scene of the catastrophe and the remains of the carriage and the bridge  sir john made a courteous reference to the governess but there was a general sense that the cat was away and presently there was a rush upstairs to prepare for the walk  annaple had time in the course of all the bustle while the colour came back to her cheeks for a moment to tell mark that her mother had been all that was good and wanted to see him  he must manage to stay till after eleven oclock she could not be ready before  then he might come to her sittingroom which as well as her bedroom was on the ground floor  mark had to work off his anxiety by an inspection of the scene of the disaster and a circumstantial explanation of the details to the young delmars who crowded round him and mr godfrey half awed half delighted and indeed the youngesta considerable tomboyhad nearly given the latter the opportunity of becoming a double hero by tumbling through the broken rail but he caught her in time and she only incurred from sir john such a scolding as a great fright will produce from the easiest of fathers  afterwards mark put gerard on the way to his brotherinlaws living asking him on the road so many questions about the umbrella business that the youth was not quite sure how to take it and doubted whether the young swell supposed that he could talk of nothing else but his petulance was mitigated when he was asked supposing a person wished to enter the business to whom should he apply  do you know any one who wishes for anything of the kind he asked are you making inquiries for any one and on a hesitating affirmation because i know there is an opening for a man with capital just at present  dutton wont advertisetis so risky and he wants some knowledge of a persons antecedents and whether he is likely to go into it in a liberal gentlemanly spirit with good principles you see such as would not upset all we are doing for the hands  what amount of capital do you mean  oh from five hundred to a thousand  or more would not come amiss if i only had it  what it would be to conduct an affair like that on true principles  but luck is against me every way  mark was at the sittingroom door as the four quarters began to strike in preparation for eleven but lady ronnisglen had been in her chair for nearly halfanhour having been rapid and nervous enough to hurry even the imperturbable maid whom annaple thought incapable of being hastened  she was a little slight woman with delicate features and pale complexion such as time deals with gently and her once yellow hair now softened with silver was turned back in bands beneath the simple net cap that suited her so well  there was a soft yet sparkling look about her as she held out her hands and exclaimed ah master mark what mischief have you been doing  mark came and knelt on one knee beside her and said will you let me work for you both lady ronnisglen  i will do my best to find some  ah that is the point my dear boy  i should have asked and wished for definite work if you had come to me before that discovery of yours and now it is a mere matter of necessity  yes said mark then with some hesitation he added lady ronnisglen do you care whether i take to what people call a gentlemans profession  i could of course go on till i am called to the bar and then wait for something to turn up but that would be waiting indeed  then in other directions ive taken things easy you see till im too old for examinations  i failed in the only one that was still open to me  lord kirkaldy tried me for foreign office work and was appalled at my blunders  im not fit for a parson  i should have thought you were  not i said mark  im not up to the mark there  i couldnt say honestly that i was called to it  i wish i could for it would be the easiest way out of it but i looked at the service and i cant therethats a nice confession to come to you with  i cant think how i can have been so impudent  mark you are a dear good lad  i respect and honour you ever so much more than before all this showed what stuff was in you  but the question is whats to be done  my child is verily the penniless lass with a high pedigree for she has not a poor thousand to call her own  and i have no right to anything in my fathers lifetime though i have no doubt he would give me up my share of my mothers portionabout £3000  now this is what has occurred to me in the place where i found my uncles wifemicklethwayte close to monks hortontheres a great umbrella factory with agencies everywhere  there are superior people belonging to it  ive seen some of them and ive been talking to the young fellow who helped us last night who is in the office  i find that to go into the thing with such capital as i might hope for would bring in a much larger and speedier return than i could hope for any other way if only my belongings would set aside their feelings  and you see there are the kirkaldys close by to secure her good society  lady ronnisglen put out her transparentlooking blackmittened hand and gave a little dainty pat to his arm  i like to see a man in earnest said she  her little skye terrier was seized with jealousy at her gesture and came nuzzling in between with his black nose mull objects she said smiling but then with a graver look and so will your father  at first said mark but i think he will give way when he has had time to look at the matter and sees how good you are  that will make all the difference  so annaple who had been banished for a little while was allowed to return and mother daughter and lover built themselves a little castle of umbrellas and bestowed a little arch commiseration on poor lady delmar who it was agreed need know nothing until something definite was arranged since annaple was clearly accountable to no one except her mother  she would certainly think the latter part of her dream only too well realised and consider that an unfair advantage had been taken of her seclusion in her own room  in spite of all loyal efforts to the contrary mark if he had been in a frame of mind to draw conclusions would have perceived that the prospect of escaping from the beneficent rule of lescombe was by no means unpleasant to lady ronnisglen  the books that lay within her reach would hardly have found a welcome anywhere else in the house  sir john was not brilliant and his wife had turned her native wits to the practical rather than the intellectual line and had quite enough to think of in keeping up the dignities of lescombe with a large family amid agricultural difficulties  annaple remembered at last that she ought to go and look after her guests assisted therein by the pleasure of giving may a hearty kiss and light squeeze with a murmur that all was right  she brought them downstairs just as the gong was sounding and the rush of girls descending from the schoolroom and lady ronnisglen being wheeled across the hall in her chair  nuttie who had expected to see a gray passive silent old lady like mrs nugent was quite amazed at the bright lively face and voice that greeted the soninlaw and grandchildren may and herself congratulating these two on having been so well employed all the morning and observing that she was afraid her nannie could not give so good an account of herself  well said sir john i am sure she looks as if she found plodding along the lanes as wholesome as sleeping in her bed  nan applecheeks eh  whereupon annaples cheeks glowed all the more into resemblance of the babyname which she had long ceased to deserve but may could see the darkness under her eyes betraying that it was only excitement that drove away fatigue  sir john had not gone far in his circumstantial description of the injuries to his unfortunate carriage when the canon arrived with his wife and blanche  mark would have given worlds in his impatience to have matters settled between the two parents then and there but lady ronnisglen had already warned him that this would not be possible and assured him that it would be much wiser to prepare his father beforehand  then he fixed his hopes on a solitary drive with his father back in the pony carriage but he found himself told off to take that home and had to content himself with may as a companion  nor was his sisters mode of receiving the umbrella plan reassuring  she had smiled too often with her stepmother over nutties having been brought up among umbrellas to be ready to accept the same lot for her brother and her friend and she was quite sure that her father would never consent an egremont an umbrellamaker how horrible  just fancy seeing dutton egremont and co on the handle of ones umbrella  well you need not patronise us said mark  but is it possible that lady ronnisglen did not object said may  she seemed to think it preferable to driving pigs in the texas like her son malcolm  yes but then that was the texas  oh may may i did not think you were such a goose  i should have thought the folly was in not being patient  stick to your profession and something must come in time  ay and how many men do you think are sticking to it in that hope no may tis not real patience to wear out the best years of my life and hers in idleness waiting for something not beneath an egremont to do  but is there nothing to do better than that  find it for me may     chapter xvi  infra dig    till every penny which she told   creative fancy turned to goldb lloyd   the blueposts bridge had produced a good deal of effect  ursula egremont in special seemed to herself to have been awakened from a strange dream and to have resumed her real nature and affections she felt as if she would give all her partners at the ball for one shake of monsieurs fringed paws her heart yearned after aunt ursel and miss mary she longed after the chants of the choir and when she thought of the effort poor gerard godfrey had made to see her she felt him a hero and herself a recreant heroine who had wellnigh been betrayed into frivolity and desertion of him and she registered secret resolutions of constancy  she burned to pour out to her mother all the micklethwayte tidings and all her longings to be there but when the rectory party set her down at the door the footman with a look of grave importance announced that mr egremont was very unwell  mr gregory thinks he has taken a chill from the effect of exposure sir and dr hamilton has been sent for  the canon and his wife both got out on this intelligence and mrs egremont was summoned to see them  she came looking more frightened than they thought the occasion demanded for she was appalled by the severe pain in the head and eyes but they comforted her by assuring her that her husband had suffered in the same manner in the spring and she saw how well he had recovered and then telling nuttie to bring word what the doctors report was and then spend the evening at the rectory they departed while poor nuttie only had one kiss one inquiry whether she were rested before her mother fled back to the patient  nor did she see her again till after the doctors visit and then it was only to desire her to tell her uncle that the attack was pronounced to be a return of the illness of last spring and that it would be expedient to go abroad for the winter  go abroad  it had always been a vision of delight to nuttie and she could not be greatly concerned at the occasion of it but she did not find the rectory in a condition to converse and sympathise  blanche was lying down with a bad headache  the edwardses and a whole party of semigenteel parish visitors had come in to inquire about the accident and had to be entertained with afternoon tea and may though helping her stepmother to do her devoir towards them seemed more preoccupied than ever  as indeed she was for she knew that mark was putting his fate to the touch with his father in the study  the canon heard the proposal with utter consternation and dismay at the perverseness of the two young people who might have been engaged any time these two years with the full approbation of their families and now chose the very moment when every one was rejoicing at their freedom  when a young man has got into a pickle he said the first thing is to want to be married  exactly so sir to give him a motive for getting out of the pickle  umbrellas  i should like to hear what your grandfather would have said  these are not my grandfathers days sir  no indeed  there was nothing to do but to give a hint to old lord de lyonnais and he could get you put into any berth you chose interest was interest in those days  i dont see why kirkaldy cant do the same  not unless i had foreign languages at my tongues end  whereat the canon groaned and mark had to work again through all the difficulties in the way of the more liberal professions and the upshot was that his father agreed to drive over to lescombe the next day and see lady ronnisglen  he certainly had always implicitly trusted his sons veracity but he evidently thought that there must have been much warping of the imagination to make the young man believe the old scottish peeress to have consented to her daughters marrying into an umbrella factory  nuttie was surprised and gratified that both mark and may put her through an examination on the habits of micklethwayte and the position of mr godfrey which she thought was entirely due to the favourable impression gerard had produced and she felt proportionably proud of him when mark pronounced him a very nice gentlemanly young fellow  she could not think why her uncle with more testiness than she had ever seen in that goodnatured dignitary ordered may not to stand chattering there but to give them some music  the canon drove to lescombe the next day under pretext of inquiring after lady delmar and then almost forgot to do so after he had ascertained that she was a prisoner to her dressingroom and that sir john was out shooting  the result of his interview filled him with astonishment  lady ronnisglen having had a large proportion of sons to put out in life on very small means had learnt not to be fastidious and held that the gentleman might ennoble the vocation instead of the vocation debasing the gentleman  moreover in her secret soul she felt that her daughter janets manoeuvres were far more truly degrading than any form of honest labour and it was very sore to her to have no power of preventing them ridicule protest or discouragement being all alike treated as the dear mothers oldworld unpractical romance  it galled her likewise that she could perceive the determination that annaple ruthven should be disposed of before muriel delmar came on the scene and the retiring to ever so small a home of their own had been discussed between mother and daughter and only put aside because of the pain it would give their honesthearted host and their hostess who really loved them  thus she did her best to persuade her old friend that there were few openings for a man of his sons age and that if the micklethwayte business were all that mark imagined it was not beneath the attention even of a wellborn gentleman in these modern days and would involve less delay than any other plan except emigration which was equally dreaded by each parent  delay there must be not only in order to ascertain the facts respecting the firm but to prove whether mark had any aptitude for the business before involving any capital in it however every other alternative would involve much longer and more doubtful waiting  and altogether the canon felt that if a person of lady ronnisglens rank did not object he had scarcely a right to do so  however both alike reserved consent until full inquiry should have been made  the canon wrote to lord kirkaldy and in the meantime wanted to gather what information he could from his sisterinlaw but he found her absolutely engrossed as her husbands nurse and scarcely permitted to snatch a meal outside the darkened room  he groaned and grumbled at his brothers selfishness and declared that her health would be damaged while his shrewder lady declared that nothing would be so good for her as to let alwyn find her indispensable to his comfort even beyond gregorio  this absorption of her mother fell hard on ursula especially when the first two days alarm was over and her mother was still kept an entire prisoner as companion rather than nurse  as before the rheumatic attack fastened upon the head and eyes causing lengthened suffering and teaching mr egremont that he had never had so gentle so skilful so loving or altogether so pleasant a slave as his wife the only person except gregorio whom in his irritable state he would tolerate about him  his brother could not be entirely kept out but was never made welcome more especially when he took upon himself to remonstrate on alices being deprived of air exercise and rest  he got no thanks mr egremont snarled and alice protested that she was never tired and needed nothing  the rectory party were excepting the schoolroom girls engaged to make visits from home before going into residence at redcastle and were to begin with monks horton  they offered to escort ursula to see her great aunt at micklethwayteoh joy of joysbut when the canon made the proposition in his brothers room mr egremont cut it short with im not going to have her running after those umbrellamongers  the canons heart sank within him at the tone and he was really very sorry for his niece who was likely to have a fortnight or three weeks of comparative solitude before her father was ready to set out on the journey  cant she help you in reading to her fatheror anything he asked alice who had come out with him into the anteroom to express her warm thanks for the kind proposal  she shook her head  he would not like it nor i for her  i should think not exclaimed the canon as his eye fell on the title of a yellow french book on the table  i have heard of this does he make you read such as this to him alice  nothing else seems to amuse him she said  do you think i ought not  i dont understand much of that kind of modern french but nuttie knows it better  not that kind i hope said the canon hastily  no no my dear as he saw her colour mantling small blame to you  you have only to do the best you can with him poor fellow  then well take anything for you  weve said nothing to nuttie jane said i had better ask you first  oh that was kind  i am glad she is spared the disappointment  not that she was  for when she learnt her cousins destination she entreated to go with them and had to be told that the proposal had been made and refused  there is no denying that she behaved very ill  it was the first real sharp collision of wills  she had differed from and disapproved of her father all along but what had been required of her had generally been pleasant to one side at least of her nature but here she was condemned to the dulness of the lonely outsider to a sick room when her whole soul was leaping back to the delights of her dear old home at micklethwayte  she made her mothers brief meal with her such a misery of protests and insistences on pleadings with her father that poor alice was fain to rejoice when the servants presence silenced her and fairly fled from her when the last dish was carried out  when they met again nuttie demanded have you spoken to my father  i told you my dear it would be of no use  you promised  no nuttie i did not  im sure i understood you to say you would if you could  it was your hopes my dear child  he is quite determined  and you leave him so  mother i cant understand your submitting to show such cruel ingratitude  nuttie was very angry though she was shocked at the burning colour and hot tears that she beheld as half choked her mother said oh my dear my dear do not speak so  you knowyou know it is not in my heart but my first duty and yours too is to your father  whatever he tells us demanded nuttie still hot and angry  i did not say that returned her mother gently but you know nuttie aunt ursel herself would say that it is our duty to abide by his decision here  but you could speak to him still argued nuttie whats the use of his being so fond of you if he wont do anything you want  hush hush nuttie you know that is not a right way of speaking  i cannot worry him now he is ill  you dont know what that dreadful pain is  happily nuttie did refrain from saying no doubt it makes him very cross but she muttered and so we are to be cut off for ever from aunt ursel and miss mary andandevery thing goodand niceand catholic  i hope not indeed i hope not  only he wants us to get the good society manners and tonelike your cousins you know  you are young enough for it and a real egremont you know nuttie and when you have learnt it he will trust you there said the mother making a very mild version of his speech about the umbrellamongers  yes he wants to make me worldly so that i should not care but that he never shall do whatever you may let him do to you  his bell rang sharply and away hurried alice leaving her daughter with a miserably sore and impatient heart and the consciousness of having harshly wounded the mother whom she had meant to protect  and there was no hugging and kissing to make up for it possible  they would not meet till dinnertime and nutties mood of stormy repentance had cooled before that time into longing to be more tender than usual towards her mother but how was that possible during the awful household ceremony of many courses with three solemn menservants ministering to them  and poor alice jumped up at the end and ran away as if afraid of fresh objurgations so that all nuttie could do was to rush headlong after her catch her on the landing kiss her face all over and exclaim oh mother mother i was dreadfully cross  there there  i knew you would be sorry dear dear child i know it is very hard but let me go  he wants me  and a very forlorn and deplorable person was left behind feeling as if her father after carrying her away from everything else that she loved had ended by robbing her of her mother  she stood on the handsome staircase and contrasted it with the little cosy entrance at her aunts  she felt how she hated all these fine surroundings and how very good and unworldly she was for so doing only was it good to have been so violent towards her mother  the rectory folks were dining out so she could only have recourse to mudies box to try to drive dull care away  a few days more and they were gone  though mr egremont was gradually mending he still required his wife to be in constant attendance  in point of fact alice could not and in her loyalty would not tell her dignified brotherinlaw far less her daughter of the hint that the doctor had given her namely that her husband was lapsing into the constant use of opiates founded at first on the needs of his malady but growing into a perilous habit which accounted for his shutting himself up all the forenoon  while under medical treatment it was possible to allowance him and keep him under orders but dr hamilton warned her not to allow the quantity to be exceeded or the drugs to be resorted to after his recovery speaking seriously of the consequences of indulgence  he spoke as a duty but as he looked at the gentle timid woman he saw little hope of her doing any good  poor alice was appalled  all she could do was to betake herself to the little weapon called allprayer and therewith to use all vigilance and all her arts of coaxing and cheering away weariness and languor beguiling sleeplessness soothing pain by any other means she had just enough success to prevent her from utterly despairing and to keep her always on the strain and at her own cost for mr egremont was far more irritable when he was without the narcotic and the serenity it produced was an absolute relief  she soon found too that gregorio was a contrary power  once when he had suggested the dose and she had replied by citing the physicians commands mr egremont had muttered an imprecation on doctors and she had caught a horrible grin of hatred on the mans face which seemed to her almost diabolical  she had prevailed then but the next time her absence was at all prolonged she found that the opiate had been taken and her dread of quitting her post increased though she did not by any means always succeed  sometimes she was goodhumouredly set aside sometimes roughly told to mind her own business but she could not relinquish the struggle and whenever she did succeed in preventing the indulgence she felt a hopefulness thatin spite of himself and gregorio she might yet save him  another hint she had from both the canon and his wife  when they asked what place was chosen mr egremont said he had made alice write to inquire of the houses to be had at various resortsmentone nice cannes and the like  she was struck by the ardour with which they both began to praise nice genoa sorrento any place in preference to mentone which her husband seemed to know and like the best  and when she went downstairs with them the canon held her hand a moment and said anywhere but mentone my dear  she looked bewildered for a moment and the canoness added look in the guidebooks  then she remembered monte carlo and for a moment it was to her as shocking a warning as if she had been bidden to keep her husband out of the temptation of thieving  she resolved however to do her best feeling immediately that again it was a pull of her influence against gregorios  fortune favoured her so far that the villa favoured by mr egremont was not to be had only the side of the bay he disliked and that a pleasant villa offered at nice  should she close with it  wellwas there great haste  gregorio knew a good many people at mentone and could ascertain in his own way if they could get the right side of the bay by going to the hotel and waiting  alice however pressed the matterrepresented the danger of falling between two stools pleaded personal preference and whereas mr egremont was too lazy for resistance to any persuasion she obtained permission to engage the nice villa  the next day gregorio announced that he had heard that the proprietor of villa francaleone at mentone was giving up hopes of his usual tenants and an offer might secure it  villa eugenie at nice is taken said alice and she received one of those deadly black looks which were always like a stab  of all this nuttie knew nothing  she was a good deal thrown with the schoolroom party and with the curates wife for companionship  now mrs edwards did not approve of even the canonical egremonts having an ideal far beyond the ritual of bridgefield and she was delighted to find how entirely miss egremont sympathised with her  nuttie described st ambroses as a paradise of church observances and parish management everything becoming embellished and all shortcomings forgotten in the loving mists of distance  the harmonium was never out of tune the choirboys were only just naughty enough to show how wisely mr spyers dealt with them the surplices one would think never needed washing mr dutton and gerard godfrey were paragons of lay helpers and district visitors never were troublesome  mrs edwards listened with open ears and together they bewailed the impracticability of moving the canon to raising bridgefield to anything approaching to such a standard while nuttie absolutely cultivated her home sickness  according to promise blanche wrote to her from monks horton and told her thus muchwe have been all over your umbrella place  it was very curious  then we called upon miss headworth who was quite well and was pleased to hear of you  blanche was famous for never putting into a letter what her correspondent wanted to hear but her stepmother wrote a much longer and more interesting letter to mrs egremont  you will be glad to hear that we found your aunt quite well  i suppose it is not in the nature of things that you should not be missed but i should think your place as well supplied as could be hoped by that very handsome and superior miss nugent with whom she lives  i had a good deal of conversation with both for you will be surprised to hear that the canon has consented to marks making the experiment of working for a year in greenleaf and duttons office with a view to entering the firm in future  i was very anxious to understand from such true ladies what the position would be socially i longed to talk it over with you beforehand but alwyn could never spare you and it was not a subject to be broached without ample time for discussion  we felt that though the kirkaldys could tell us much it was only from the outside whereas miss headworth could speak from within  the decision is of course a blow to his father and will be still more so to the de lyonnais family but they have never done anything to entitle them to have a voice in the matter and the kirkaldys agree with us that though not a path of distinction it is one of honourable prosperity and with this if mark is content we have no right to object since his mind is set on present happiness rather than ambition  it was a letter gratifying to alice in its confidential tone as well as in the evident approval of those surroundings which she loved so well  she read it to her husband as she was desired to give him a message that the canon had not written out of consideration for his eyes  he laughed the laugh that always jarred on her  so master mark has got his nose to the grindstone has he was his first exclamation and after some cogitation the fellow wants to be married depend on it  do you think so returned alice wistfully  think  why you may see it in janes letter  i wonder who it is the little yellow ruthven girl most likely  the boy is fool enough for anything  i thought he would have mended his fortunes with ursula but hes too proud to stomach that i suppose  i did wish that said alice  it would have set everything straight and it would have been so nice for her  you should have cut out your daughter after your own pattern he answered not let her be such a raw insignificant little spitfire tis a pity  i dont want the estate to go out of the name though i wont leave it to an interfering prig like mark unless he chooses to take my daughter with it  the latter part of this amiable speech was muttered and scarcely heard or attended to by alice in her struggle to conceal the grief she felt at the uncompromising opinion of her child  nuttie might outgrow being raw but there seemed less rather than more prospect of a better understanding with her father  about a week later mark made his appearance timing it happily when his uncle was making his toilette so that his aunt was taking a turn on the sunny terrace with nuttie when the young man came hurrying up the garden  mark  what  are you come home  not the others  they are at mr condamines i came last nightby way of lescombe  edda dear it is all right  oh i forgot you did not know  there was no seeing you before we went away  ah by the by how is my uncle  much better except that using his eyes brings on the pain  what is it mark  ah i can guess she said aided no doubt by that conjecture of her husbands  yes yes yes he answered with a rapidity quite unlike himself why nuttie how mystified you look  im sure i dont wonder at any one being glad to live at dear old micklethwayte said nuttie slowly  but somehow i didnt think it of you mark  my dear thats not all said her mother  oh cried nuttie with a prolonged intonation  is itoh mark did you do it that night when you led the horse home  even so nuttie  and aunt alice lady ronnisglen is the best and bravest of old ladies and the wisest  nobody objects but lady delmar and she declares she shall not consider it an engagement till ronnisglen has been written to in nepaul as if he had anything to do with it but that matters the less since they all insist on our waiting till ive had a years trial at the office  i suppose they could not be expected to do otherwise but it is a pity for im afraid lady delmar will lead annaple and her mother a life of it  dear mark i am delighted that it is all going so well  i knew you would be  i told them i must tell you though it is not to go any farther  so that hope of marks restoration to the inheritance faded from alice and yet she could not be concerned for him  she had never seen him in such good spirits for the sense of failure and disappointment had always been upon him and the definite prospect of occupation gilded by his hopes of annaple seemed to make a new man of him     chapter xvii  an old friend    my heart untravelled still returns to theegoldsmith   to go abroad  such had been the fairy castle of nutties life  she had dreamed of swiss mountains italian pictures rheinland castles a perpetual panorama of delight and here she was in one of the great hotels of paris as little likely to see the lions of that city as she had been to see those of london  the party were halting for two days there because the dentist on whom mr egremonts fine show of teeth depended practised there but nuttie spent great part of the day alone in the sittingroom and her handbag and her mothers with all their books and little comforts had been lost in the agony of landing  her mothers attendance was required all the morning or what was worse she expected that it would be and though nutties persistence dragged out the staid silent english maid who had never been abroad before to walk in the tuilleries gardens which they could see from their windows both felt halfscared the whole time  nuttie was quite unused to finding her own way unprotected and martin was frightened cross and miserable about the bags which she averred had been left by gregorios fault  she so hated gregorio that only a sort of adoration which she entertained for mrs egremont  would have induced her to come teteatete with him and perhaps he was visiting his disappointment about mentone on her  in the afternoon nothing was achieved but a drive in the bois de boulogne when it was at once made evident that mr egremont would tolerate no questions nor exclamations  his mouth was in no condition for eating in public and he therefore decreed that his wife and daughter should dine at the table dhote while he was served alone by gregorio  this was a great boon to nuttie and to her mother it recalled bridal days long past at dieppe but what was their astonishment when on entering the room they beheld the familiar face of mr dutton  it was possible for him to place himself between them and there is no describing the sense of rest and protection his presence imparted to them more especially to nuttie  he had come over as he did from time to time on business connected with the materials he used and he was beguiled into telling them of his views of mark whom he had put in the way of learning the preliminaries needful to an accountant  he had a deep distrust of the business capacities and perseverance of young gentlemen of family especially with a countessaunt in the neighbourhood and quoted lord eldons saying that to make a good lawyer of one it was needful for him to have spent both his own and his wifes fortune to begin with but he allowed that young mr egremont was a very favourable specimen and was resolutely applying himself to his work and that he himself felt it due to him to give all the assistance possible  miss headworth he could not deny had aged but far less than mrs nugent in the past year and it really was a great comfort to miss mary to have the old ladies together  he told too how the mission now lately over had stirred the micklethwayte folk into strong excitement and how good works had been undertaken evil habits renounced reconciliations effected religious services frequented would it last nobody he said had taken it up so zealously as gerard godfrey who seemed as if he would fain throw everything up and spend his whole life in some direct service as a home missionary or something of the kind  he is a good fellow said mr dutton and it is quite genuine but i made him wait at least a year that he may be sure that this is not only a passing impulse  nuttie thought that she knew what was the impulse that had actuated him and felt a pleasant elation and selfconsciousness even while she repressed a sigh of pity for herself and for him  altogether the dip into the micklethwayte world was delightful but when mr dutton began to ask nuttie what she had seen she burst out with nothingnothing but just a walk and a drive in the bois de boulogne and her mother explained that in mr egremonts state of health etc  i wonder asked mr dutton if i might be allowed  nutties eyes sparkled with ecstasy  it ended in her mother who had been wondering how mr egremont could be amused all the long evening arranging that mr dutton should come in an hours time to call on him on the chance of being admitted and that then the offer might be made when she had prepared him for it advising nuttie to wait in her own room  she was beginning to learn how to steer between her husband and her daughter and she did not guess that her old friend was sacrificing one of the best french plays for the chance  it turned out well mr egremont was conscious of a want of variety he demanded whether it was the young fellow and being satisfied on that part observed in almost a goodhumoured tone so we are in for umbrellas we may as well go in for the whole firm caused the lights to be lowered under pretext of his eyesto conceal the lack of teethdid not absolutely refuse to let nuttie take advantage of the escort and when mr dutton did come to the anteroom of the apartment he was received with full courtesy though gregorio looked unutterable contempt  mr dutton was a man who could talk and had seen a good deal of the world at different times  mr egremont could appreciate intelligent conversation so that they got on wonderfully well together over subjects that would have been a mere weariness to nuttie but for the exceeding satisfaction of hearing a micklethwayte voice at last mr dutton said something about offering his escort to the ladies or to miss egremont who used he said in a paternal way to be a little playfellow of his mr egremont really smiled and said ay ay the child is young enough to run after sights well thank you if you are so good as to take the trouble they will be very grateful to you or if her mother cannot go with her theres the maid  nuttie thought she had never known him so amiable and hardly durst believe her good fortune would not turn the wheel before morning and it so far did that her mother found or thought she found that it would not do to be out of call and sent the silent martin in her stead  but mr dutton had set telegraphs to work and recovered the bags which gregorio had professed to give up in despair  a wonderful amount of lionising was contrived by mr dutton who had lived a few years at paris in early youth and had made himself acquainted alike with what was most worth seeing and the best ways and means of seeing it so that as little time as possible was wasted on the unimportant  it was one of the white days of nutties life wanting nothing but her mothers participation in the sight of the st michael of the louvre of the sainte chapelle of the vistas in notre dame and of poor marie antoinettes cellall that they had longed to see together  she had meant to tell mr dutton that it was all her fathers selfishness but somehow she could not say so there was something about him that hindered all unbefitting outbreaks of vexation  and thus when she mentioned her disappointment at not being allowed to go to micklethwayte with her uncle he answered you could not of course be spared with your father so unwell  oh he never let me come near him  i wasnt of the slightest use to him  mrs egremont would have missed you  really he never gave her time  he perfectly devours her body and soul  oh dear no  twas for no good i was kept there but just pride and ingratitude though mother tried to call it being afraid for my manners and my style  in which if you lapse into such talk you fully justify the precaution  i was just thinking what a young lady you had grown into he answered in a tone of banter under which however she felt a rebuke and while directing her attention to the pantheon he took care to get within hearing again of martin  and in looking at these things he carried her so far below the surface  st michael was not so much raffaelles triumph of art as the eternal victory over sin the sainte chapelle spite of all its modern unsanctified gaudiness was redolent of st louis and the cell of the slaughtered queen was as a martyrs shrine trod with reverence  there were associations with every turn and nuttie might have spent years at paris with another companion without imbibing so many impressions as on this december day when she came home so full of happy chatter that the guests at the table dhote glanced with amusement at the eager girl as much as with admiration at the beautiful mother  mr dutton had been invited to come and take coffee and spend the evening with them again but mr egremonts affairs with the dentist had been  completed and he had picked up or more strictly speaking gregorio had hunted up for him a couple of french acquaintances who appeared before long and engrossed him entirely  mr dutton sat between the two ladies on a stiff darkgreen sofa on the opposite side of the room and under cover of the eager halfshrieking gesticulating talk of the frenchmen they had a quiet lowtoned conversation like old times alice said  more than old times nuttie added and perhaps the others both agreed with her  when the two englishwomen started at some of the loud french tones almost imagining they were full of rage and fury their friend smiled and said that such had been his first notion on coming abroad  you have been a great deal abroad mrs egremont asked you seem quite at home in paris  oh mamma he showed me where the school was that he went to and the house where he lived  up such an immense way  mr dutton was drawn on to tell more of his former life than ever had been known to them  his father a wine merchant had died a bankrupt when he was ten years old and a relation engaged in the same business at paris had offered to give him a few years of foreign schooling and then make him useful in the business  his excellent mother had come with him and they had lived together on very small means high up in a manystoried lodginghouse while he daily attended the lycie  his reminiscences were very happy of those days of cheerful contrivance of her eager desire to make the tiny appartement a home to her boy of their pleasant sundays and holidays and the life that in this manner was peculiarly guarded by her influence and the sense of being all she had upon earth  he had scarcely ever spoken of her before and he dwelt on her now with a tenderness that showed how she had been the guiding spirit of his life  at fifteen he was taken into the office at marseilles and she went thither with him but the climate did not agree with her she drooped and moreover he discovered that the business was not conducted in the honourable manner he had supposed  after a few months of weighing his obligations to his kinsman against these instincts the question was solved by his cousins retiring  he resolved to take his mother back to england at any loss and falling in with one of the partners of the umbrella firm in quest of french silk he was engaged as foreign correspondent and brought his mother to micklethwayte but not in time to restore her health and he had been left alone in the world just as he came of age when a small legacy came to him from his cousin too late for her to profit by it it had been invested in the business and he had thus gradually risen to his present position  mrs egremont was amazed to hear that his mother had only been dead so short a time before she had herself come to micklethwayte and fairly apologised for the surprise she could not help betraying at finding how youthful he had then been and nuttie exclaimed in her original unguarded fashion  why mr dutton i always thought you were an old bachelor  nuttie my dear said her mother in a note of warning but mr dutton laughed and said  not so far wrong  they tell me i never was a young man  you had always to be everything to your mother said mrs egremont softly  yes he said and a very blessed thing it was for me  ah you dont regret now all that you must have always been giving up for her returned alice  no indeed  only that i did not give up more  that is always the way  it is indeed  one little knows the whips that a little selfwill prepares  nuttie thought he said it for her admonition and observed but she was good only however in a mumble that the other two thought it inexpedient to notice though it made both hearts ache for her even aliceswith an additional pang of selfreproach that she herself was not good enough to help her daughter better  neither of them guessed at the effect that a glimpse of the lovely young seeming widow had had on the already grave selfrestrained young man in the home lately made lonely how she had been his secret object for years and how when her history was revealed to him he had still hoped on for a certainty which had come at last as so fatal a shock and overthrow to all his dreams  a life of selfrestraint and selfconquest had rendered it safe for him to thoroughly enjoy the brief intercourse which had come about by the accident of his having come to dine at the hotel de louvre to meet a friend who had failed him  these were two completely happy hours to all the three and when they said goodnight there was a sense of soothing and invigoration on alices mind and on nutties that patience and dutifulness were the best modes of doing justice to her micklethwayte training although he had scarcely said a word of direct rebuke or counsel  while mr dutton sped home to tell miss headworth that mrs egremont looked lovelier than ever and wasyes she wasmore of an angel that her husband had been very pleasant much better than he expected and indeed might come to anything good under such influence and as to little nuttieshe was developing fast and had a brave constant heart altogether at micklethwayte  but that servant who was acting as courier was an insolent scoundrel who was evidently cheating them to the last degree     chapter xviii  a friend in need    true courage often is in frightened eyes                                  thoughts and verses   all the preliminaries of the sojourn at nice had been settled in correspondence and the egremont family had nothing to do after arriving at the station but to drive up to villa eugenie whose flowerwreathed balconies were like a vision of beauty  servants had been hired through agencies known to mr egremont and gregorio looked very black at his mistress keeping the reins in her hand and tried to make her feel herself inefficient  it was not an eventful or very interesting part of ursulas life she was almost wild with the novelty and beauty of the south at first but except for what she could thus see there was little variety  the mould of the day was as much as possible after the bridgefield fashion except that there were no cousins at the rectory no parish interests very little society as far as the ladies were concerned  mr egremont had old acquaintance and associates with whom he spent afternoons and evenings after his own fashion but they were not people to whom he wished to introduce his wife and daughter  and the superior english habitues of nice the families who formed the regular society knew mr egremonts reputation sufficiently to feel by no means disposed to be cordial to the fair wife and grownup daughter whom he so unexpectedly produced on the scene  it had been different at home where he had county standing and the canon and canoness answered for the newcomers but here where all sorts of strange people came to the surface the respectable felt it needful to be very cautious and though of course one or two ladies had been asked to call through the intervention of lady kirkaldy or of mrs william egremont and had been assured on their authority that it was all right their attentions were clogged by doubt and by reluctance to involve their mankind in intimacy with the head of the family  thus very little of the proverbial gaiety of nice offered itself to nuttie and her mother and except by a clerical family who knew mr spyers they were kept at a distance which mr egremont perceived and resented by permitting no advances  the climate suited him so well that to his wifes great relief he seemed to have dropped his inclination for sedatives but his eyes would not bear much and she felt bound to be always on the alert able to amuse him and hinder his feeling it dull  gregorio highly disapproved of the house and servants and was always giving hints that mentone would agree far better with his master but every day that mr egremont seemed sufficiently amused at nice was so much gain and she had this in her favour that he was always indolent and hard to move moreover between his masters levee and late dinner gregorio was hardly ever to be found  no doubt he knew the way to monte carlo well enough and perhaps preferred that the family should be farther off for he soon ceased to show himself discontented with their present abode  once when his absence was inconvenient mr egremont abused him roundly as a goodfornothing gambler but when alice hoped that he might be called to a reckoning the wrath had subsided with the immediate vexation and as usual she was told all those fellows were alike  the foreign servants were not to be induced to give the earlyrising ladies more than a roll and cup of coffee and nuttie felt ravenous till she learned to lay in a stock of biscuits and with martins connivance made tea on her own account and sustained her mother for the mornings walk before the summons to mr egremont  he always wanted his wife much earlier in the day during his hours of deshabille and letting her write his letters and read the papers to him  she was pleased with this advance but it gave nuttie a great deal more solitude which was sometimes judiciously spent but it was very hard not to be desultory in spite of learning lessons in french italian and drawing  later in the day came the drive or the visit to the public gardens when the band was playing but this became less frequent as mr egremont observed the cold civility shown to his wife and as he likewise grew stronger and made more engagements of his own  then nuttie had happy afternoons of driving donkeyriding or walking with her mother sketching botanising admiring and laying up stores for the long descriptive letters that delighted the party in st ambroses road drinking in all the charm of the scenery and entering into it intelligently  they spent a good many evenings alone together likewise and it could not but give alice a pang to see the gladness her daughter did not repress when this was the case even though to herself it meant relaxation of the perpetual vigilance she had to exert when the father and daughter were together to avert collisions  they were certainly not coming nearer to one another though nuttie was behaving very well and submissively on the whole and seldom showing symptoms of rebellion  this went on through the early part of their stay but latterly there was a growing sense upon the girl that she and her mother were avoided by some young ladies to whom they had been introduced and whom they saw regularly at the daily services at st michaels church  they were pleasantlooking girls with whom nuttie longed to fraternise and she was mortified at never being allowed to get beyond a few frigidly civil words in the street more especially when she came upon sketching parties and picnics in which she was never included  it was all very well for her mother to answer her murmurs and wonderings with you know people are very exclusive my dear nuttie began to guess that her father and her name were the real reason and her eyes were further opened later in the spring when mr egremont who had recovered unusual health and vigour took his ladies to mentone to spend a day or two in the newer beauties there alice had her misgivings but the visit was avowedly to show the place to her and she could not reasonably object  he was in unusual good humour and even tolerated their ecstasies at the scenery and the flowers dined at the table dhote and found acquaintance enjoyed himself and in the forenoon while nuttie was out wondering and admiring and going as far as she could drag martin he expressed to his wife that she would be astonished at the gardens and the music of monte carlo  there however alice made a stand  thank you it is very kind but if you please i should not like to take ursula to monte carlo or to go there myself she said in an apologetic tone  he laughed  what you are afraid of making the little one a confirmed gambler  you know i am not but  you think the little prig will be contaminated eh  well i think it will be happier for her if she never sees anythingof the kind  you little foolish edda as if her eyes or ears need see anything but flowers and music and good company  i know that but i had so much rather not  it was a sweet face and caressing voice that implored and he still was good humoured  well well i dont want to drag you old lady against your will though i fancy you would be rather surprised at the real aspect of the abode of iniquity your fancy depicts  oh thank you thank you so much  what an absurd little woman it is  i wonder if you would thank me as heartily supposing i cleared a round thousand and gave yousay a diamond necklace  i am sure i should not  no i dont believe you would  that restless little conscience of yours would be up on end  after all i dont know that you are the worse for it when it looks so prettily out of your brown eyes  i wonder what you expect to see  the ruined gamester shooting himself on every path eh  no no i dont suppose i should see anything horrid or even disagreeable  i know it is all very beautiful but then every person who goes for the innocent pleasures sake only helps to keep up the whole thingevil and all  and what would the old women of all sorts here and at nice do without such a choice temple of scandal to whet their teeth upon well i suppose you and your precious daughter can take care of yourselves there are the gardens or you can tell gregorio to order you a carriage  then you are going  yes i promised grafton  dont be afraid mistress edda im not going to stake bridgefield and reduce you to beggary  im an old hand and was a cool one in my worst days and whatever i get ill hand over to appease you  that was all she could obtain and she secretly hoped there would be no winnings to perplex her  thankful that she had not made him angry by the resistance for which she had prepared herself with secret prayer ever since the mentone scheme had been proposed she placed herself at nutties disposition for the rest of the day  they had a charming donkeyride and still unsatiated with beauty ursula made her mother come out again to wonder at the trees in the public gardens  rather tired they were sitting on a shaded bench when a voice close to them exclaimed it is yes it must be tis the voiceyes and the face prettier than ever  little aliceah you dont know me  time has been kinder to you than to me  oh  i know you now  i beg your pardon cried alice recognising in the thin nutcracker parchment visage and shabbilydressed figure the remnant of the brilliant aquiline countenance and gay attire of eighteen years ago  mrs houghton  i am so glad to have met you you were so kind to me  and here she is  what is this the child  bless me what a proof how time goes young lady youll excuse my not knowing you  you were a very inconvenient personage not quite born when i last met your mother what a likeness i could have known her for alwyn egremonts daughter anywhere  yes they all say she is a thorough egremont  then it is all right  i saw alwyn egremont esquire and family among the arrivals at nice but i hardly durst expect that it was you  it seemed too good to be true though i took care the knot should be tied faster than my gentleman suspected  oh please cried alice deprecatingly at first not apprehending the force of the words having never known the gulf from which mrs houghton had saved her and that lady seeing that the girl was listening with all her ears thought of little pitchers and restrained her reminiscences asking with real warm interest and how was it how did you meet him again  he came and found me out said alice with satisfaction in her voice  indeed  not at dieppe for he was en garcon when i nearly came across him ten years ago at florence  oh no  he inquired at dieppe but they had lost the address my aunt left  indeed  i should not have thought it of old madame leroux she seemed so thoroughly interested in la pauvre petite  what did you do  your aunt wrote to me when your troubles were safely over and she thought him lost in the poor ninon that she meant to settle in a place with an awfully long yorkshire name  micklethwayte yes we lived there and got on very well  we had boarders and i had some dear little pupils but last year mark egremontyou remember dear little markwas in the neighbourhood and hearing my name he told his uncle who had been seeking us ever since and he came mr egremont and took us home and oh the family have been so kind  what  the parson and that awful old shelion of a grandmother whose very name scared you out of your wits  she is dead and so is dear good lady adelaide  canon egremont is kindness itself  it was all the old ladys doing and he knew nothing about it  he was gone to madeira with lady adelaide and got none of our letters and he never knew that his brother was married to me  trust alwyn for that mrs houghton muttered  well alls well that ends well and i hope he feels due gratitude to me for doing him a good turn against his will  i tried to get at him at florence to find out what he had done with you but unluckily i was ill and had to send through poor houghton and he mismanaged it of course though i actually wrote down that barbarous address mickle something on a card  i believe he only got as far as the man instead of the master  ah  i wanted to ask for captain houghton said alice glad to lead the conversation away from revelations of which she had an instinctive dread  gone my dear two years ago  poor fellow it was low fever but quite as much want of luck i shall always believe she said  oh i am sorry  he was so kind to me said alice squeezing her hand and looking up with sweet tender commiseration  there there dont you pretty creature said mrs houghton putting her hand across her eyes  i declare youve almost made me crywhich ive not donewell hardly since i parted with you at dieppe thinking you a sweet little flower plucked and thrown away to die though i had done my best to bind it to him  what care i took not to let houghton disabuse him about jersey marriages  there is a difference between hearing and hearkening and alice egremonts loving and unsuspecting heart was so entirely closed against evil thoughts of her husband and so fully occupied with her old friends condition that she never took in the signification of all this while nuttie being essentially of a far more shrewd and less confiding nature and already imbued with extreme distrust of her father was taking in all these revelations with an openeyed silent horror of conviction that her old impressions of the likeness to marmion or theseus had been perfectly correct  it was all under her hat however and the elder ladies never thought of her alice bringing back the conversation to mrs houghton herself  oh my dear i drag on as i can  ive got a fragment of our old income and when thats run too low i go up to monte carloi always had the lucky hand you know and tis only restitution after all  im sick of it all though and sometimes think ill take my good sister annes offers and go home  oh do do cried alice  but went on the poor woman humble pie goes against me and think what an amount would be before meheigh hoafter nearly fiveandtwenty years yes fiveandtwenty years it issince houghton poor fellow told me i was too bright and winsome for a little country lawyers house in a poky street  what would they think of me now and she laughed with a sound that was painful to hear well sycorax had done one good deed and when i look at you queening it there i feel that so have i  you were very good to me i know but oh if you would go home to your sister  my dear you little know what you ask  anne  why she is the prime district lady or whatever you call it of dockforth  think what it would be to her to have this battered old vaurien thrown on her hands to be the stock subject for all the righteous tongues besides as she coughed the english climate would make an end of me outright  im in a bad way enough here where i can sit among the lemon trees half the days in the winter but the english fireside in a stuffy parlour and she shuddered  that shiver reminded all that it was getting late too late for mrs houghton to be out of doors and near the time when mr egremont was to meet his ladies at the hotel  alice begged for mrs houghtons address and it was given with a short ironical laugh at her promise to call again if possible  ay if possible the poor woman repeated i understand  no no as alice was about to kiss her i wont have it done  theres no one in sight  as if that made a difference  alice child you are as innocent as the little dove that flew aboard the ninon  how have you done it get along with you  no kisses to such as me  i dont know whether it breaks my heart or binds it up to look at the face of you anyway i cant bear it  she hurried away and made some steps from them  a terrible paroxysm of coughing came on and mrs egremont hurried towards her but she waved back all help shook her head and insisted on going home alice kept her in sight till she dived into a small side street  mother said nuttie  then there was a pause  mother did you know all this  dont talk of it nuttie  it is not a thing to be talked about to any one or by any one  i wish you had not been there  but mother this once  did you know  i knew that i knew not what i did when i went on board that yacht but that gods kind providence was over me in a way that i little deserved that is all i care to know and ursula i will have not another word about it  no i will not hear it  i was only going to ask whether you would tell my father  certainly but not before you  the tone of decision was unwonted and nuttie knew she must abide by it but the last shreds of filial respect towards mr egremont were torn away by what mrs houghton had implied and the girl dashed up and down her bedroom muttering to herself oh why have i such a father and she she will not see it she is wilfully blind  why not break with him and go home to dear aunt ursel and gerard and mr dutton at once instead of this horrid horrid grandeur  oh if i could fling all these fine things in his face and have done with him for ever some day i will when i am of age and gerard has won his way  meantime alice in some trepidation but with resolution at the bottom had told her husband of the meeting with mrs houghton of her widowhood sickness and poverty  he did not like the intelligence of their meeting and hoped no one had seen it then when reassured on this score he hummed a little and exclaimed poor old flossy houghton  i dont wonder  they went the pace  well what do you want  twenty pounds for her  why twill all be at monte carlo in three days time  it is very good of you but i want more than that  she is so ill and wretched you know  i cant have you visiting her if thats what you mean  why after all the pains ive been at to get you on your proper level at home heres my lady louisa and all her crew in their confounded insolence fighting shy of you and you cant give them a better colour for it than by running after a woman like thatdivorced to begin with and known at every gambling table in europe  i know that alwyn dear alwyn it was very seldom that she called him so and she put her clasped hands on his shoulder but i am sure she is dying and she was so good to me i cant bear doing nothing for her  well theres twentyfifty if you like  thank you thank you but you know i never meant to visit herlikelike society only to go sometimes privately and  and how about your daughter  i would not take her on any account  what i want to do is this mrs houghton spoke of her sister a kind good woman in england who would take her home and love her if only she could bring herself to go now i think i could persuade her to write or let me write to the sisterand if only the two were together again  it is very dreadful to think of her dying alone in the way she is going on  what little saint you want to try your hand on her  i should say she was too tough an old sinner for you  oh alwyn her heart was very near though she tried to keep it back i do not want toto do what you meanonly to get her to let her sister come  im sure that would do the rest  if any sister does more than you you little witch he said  alice pressed him no more then but a day or two later when she knew he had an engagement she arranged to dispose of nuttie with the clergymans wife and then begged permission to go by train to mentone and come back in the evening  he did not like itno more did shefor she was perfectly unaccustomed to travelling alone but there was a deep sense of sacred duty upon her only strengthened by her unwillingness to realise how much she owed to mrs houghton  she telegraphed that she was coming and found her friend more touched than she chose to allow at the fact of her visit declaring that she must have wonderful power over alwyn egremont if she knew how to use it indeed the whole tone was of what alice felt flattery intended to turn away anything more serious  poor woman she was as careful of doing no injury to her young friends reputation as mr egremont could have desired  alice had come resolved that she should have one good meal but she would not hear of eating anywhere in public where either could be recognised and the food was brought to a private room in the hotel  to her lodgings she still would not take alice nor would she give her sisters address  except for a genuine shower of tears when alice insisted on kissing her there seemed no ground gained  but alice went again on her husbands next visit to mentone  he was to a certain degree interested in her endeavours and really wished the poor woman to be under the charge of her relations instead of dying a miserable lonely death among strangers  this time alice had to seek her friend in the dreary quatrieme of the tall house with the dirty stone stairs it was a doleful empty room where with a mannishlooking dressinggown and a torn lace scarf tied hoodfashion over her scanty hair mrs houghton sat over a pan of charcoal oppressive to alices english lungs  come again she cried  well i really shall begin to think that angels and ministers of grace exist off the stage  you pretty thing let me look at you  where did you get that delicious little bonnet  why it is perfectly plain  so it is  tis only the face that is in it  now if some folks put this onsister anne for example what dowdies they would be  poor old anne you must know she had a turn for finery only she never knew how to gratify it  to see the contortions of her crinolines was the delight of all the grammar school  it was a regular comedy for them to see her get into our pew edgeways and once unconsciously she carried off a gentlemans hat on her train  so she went on talking coughing at intervals and generally using a halfmocking tone as if defying the tenderness that awoke in spite of her but always of her original home and especially of her sister alice ventured to ask whether they often heard from one another  good soul she always writes at christmas and on my birthday  i know as well as possible that i shall find a letter poste restante wherever she heard of me last and that she hasnt doneim ashamed to say for how longreally i think not since i let her know that i couldnt stand ivy lodge dockforth at any price when she wrote to monaco on seeing poor houghtons death in the paper  there was a good deal of rambling talk of this kind to which alice listened tenderly and compassionately making no attempt at persuasion only doing what was possible for the poor ladys comfort she had procured on her way some fruit and jelly and some good english tea at which mrs houghton laughed saying time was i called it catlap somehow it will seem the elixir of life now redolent even milkless of the days when we were young  then she revealed something of her long suffering almost ghastly nights and alice gently told how her old friend mrs nugent suffered from sleeplessness and kept a store of soothing psalms and hymns in her memory  there was a little laugh  thats for you good folk  i havent such a thing about me  come par exemple and alice repeated the first thing she could remember the verse beginning god who madest earth and heaven  thats one of your charms is it  well it would not be too much for me if my poor old memory would hold it  say it again  alice generally had about her a tiny prayerbook with hymns ancient and modern attached  it had been a gift from mary nugent and she was fond of it but the opportunity was not to be lost and she took it out saying she would bring a larger one and reclaim it  and as she was finally taking leave she said with a throbbing heart do you know that you have betrayed your sisters address  i shall write to her now  if you do cried mrs houghton in a tone like threatening deprecation but with a little of her strange banter in it besides alices mind had been made up to do the thing and she had not felt it honest not to give due warning of her intentions  even now she was not certain of the ladys surname but she trusted to her husbands knowledge of mrs houghtons previous history and not in vain  mr egremont amused himself with a little ridicule at his wifes quixotry and demanded whether flossy houghton was a promising convert but confessed himself very glad that the poor thing should be off their hands declaring that it was quite time her own people looked after her and happily he recollected her maiden name  so the letter was written after numerous attempts at expressing it suitably explaining mrs houghtons illness and the yearnings she was too proud and ashamed to express to her sister and was answered at once by a few short words of earnest gratitude and an assurance that miss reade was preparing to start at once  could mrs egremont meet her and prepare her sister  to alices disappointment this could not be  mr egremont had invited some friends to the villa and would not spare her  she could only send a note assuring miss reade that she believed that preparation would do more harm than good and she waited and watched anxiously  a card came by the post in mrs houghtons scrawled writing  naughty little wretch was all it said but thence she gathered hope  the spring was advancing and mr egremont was in haste to be gone but alice obtained one more run to mentone and once more climbed up the dark and dirty stairs to the room where the wellknown voice answered her tap come in  ah there she is the wicked little angel  a substantial little rolypoly businesslike little woman hurried forward with tearful eyes and outstretched hands  oh mrs egremont can i ever thank you enough  you cant anne so dont try  it will be a relief to all parties interposed mrs houghton  sentiment is not permitted here  nevertheless she hugged alice almost convulsively  she was sitting in a comfortable armchair one about which mrs egremont knew something and the whole aspect of the room had changed indescribably for the better as much indeed as mrs houghtons own personal array which had no longer the desolate neglected look of old  a little stool was close to her chair as if the two sisters could not bear to be far apart and the look of love and content in their eyes as they turned to one another was perfect joy to alice  she had no longer any doubt that anne reade who had found the wanderer yet a great way off would yet bring her back to the home spiritually if not outwardly  mrs houghton spoke of better rooms when the winter visitors had fled anne spoke of her being able to return to dockforth  whether that would ever be seemed entirely doubtful to alices eyes especially as the patients inclination was evidently otherwise there was nothing to be done but to leave the sisters together obtaining miss reades ready promise to write and putting into her hands a sum of money which could be sincerely called only a debt of gratitude from my husband and me and which would smooth the way either to remaining or returning to england  nor was there any return  ere many weeks had passed mrs egremont heard from miss reade how a fresh cold had made it impossible to move and summer heat had brought on low fever which had destroyed the feeble strength but not till childhoods star had again arisen and a deeply and truly repentant woman had passed away saved as it seemed through that one effort on behalf of the young girl whose innocence she had protected     chapter xix  the vortex    with one black shadow at her feettennyson   the rebuffs that society had bestowed on his wife and daughter at nice had rendered mr egremont the more determined on producing them in london and establishing their position  he secured a furnished house in westburnia before leaving nice and travelling leisurely home without visiting bridgefield he took possession the second week in may  there had not been much correspondence with the rectory and on the first forenoon as mrs egremont and nuttie were trying to enliven the drawingroom with the flowers sent up to meet them they were surprised by the entrance of blanche full of kisses and welcomes  oh didnt you know  im with the kirkaldys just round the corner aunt margaret has undertaken to do the part of a noble aunt by me  then you are here for the season  and may  may wouldnt come except just for a week to see the pictures and lay in a stock of talk  shes grown more parochial than ever and we believe it is all hugh condamine  oh i forgot you were gone before we came home last autumn  he is mammas nephew you know and was ordained last year to the curacy of the next parish to his fathers place  if the edwardses only would take themselves off we would have him at home and then we should have flowers on the altar and all sorts of jolly things  papa would stand ever so much more from him than from the old edwardses  but is he engaged to may then  well no not exactly  i believe he does not think it right till he has done preparing for priests orders  hes ever so strict you know and he hasnt got much either but he means it  lucy his sister you know told me all about it and that altogether the elders had settled it was better for both that he should attend to his preparation and may should not bind herself though they really understand one another and so she wont come to london  oh thats very good of her cried nuttie but why wont they let them settle their minds and be engaged  people are always tiresome said blanche and i do believe the living is at the bottom of it at least lucy thought so  i mean everybody wants to waitall the old ones i meannot hugh or may of courseto know whether mark will stick to the umbrellas or turn back and be a clergyman because then of course he would have the living and if he doesnt they want to be certain whether uncle alwyn or you nuttie would promise it to hugh if he married may  me exclaimed nuttie  my dear i dont like to hear you talk of such things said mrs egremont gently  oh yes i knowits all very dreadful  i was only telling you what is in the old peoples heads and what would settle it and make it all right with them  and how is mark  is miss ruthven in london asked mrs egremont glad to turn away the conversation from the contingencies of which blanche spoke with the hardness of youth as yet not realising sorrow  i daresay you know nearly as much of mark as we do now the kirkaldys are up here  all his letters go to lescombe  oh no annaple is not in london  the delmars cant afford it you know though i believe my lady would have made a stretch if annaple hadnt been bespokebut now she reserves herself for muriel  alice looked with some discomfort at the soft fairhaired creature who was uttering all this worldly jargon in a tone that would have been flippant if it had not been so childish  she asked if lord ronnisglen had written  oh yes long ago  lady delmar had tried to make him nasty about it but he wouldnt be so thats all right and mark seems to get on very well though it must be horridly dull for him now the kirkaldys are away and he cant spend all his sundays at monks horton  he will get more into the spirit of the place said nuttie whereat blanche shrugged her shoulders a little and exclaimed  youve got out of it at any rate nuttie  i hope not  well then the look of it  i never saw any one so improved  isnt she aunt alice  shes grown i declare  yesmeasuring herself against her cousini was a leetle bit taller when you came and now youve got above me and what a duck of a way of doing your hair you must show me  i must tell may theres no fear of your being taken for one another now aunt margaret will be quite surprised  it was true that ursula had developed a good deal during the last year and under the experienced hands of martin had lost her schoolgirl air and turned into a young lady capable of becoming the paris outfit which her father had enjoined  without positive beauty she was a pleasing intelligent animated girl with the reputation of being an heiress with a romance in the background and there was nothing to prevent her from being a success  the family connections with lady kirkaldy to set the example had determined on giving full support to mrs egremont and as of course every one liked to look at so lovely a face the way of both was smoothed in a manner that delighted her husband when they encountered any of those who had looked coldly on her at nice  he would have had her presented but her own reluctance and the united counsels of lady kirkaldy and the canoness prevailed on him to drop the idea and then there was a fight with ursula who declared that she would not go to court if her mother did not but she was overruled at last by that mothers tears at her defiance and let herself be presented together with blanche by lady kirkaldy  to ursula it was altogether a strange time full of the same kind of reckless swing and sense of intoxication that had possessed her at bridgefield  not that there was an excessive amount of actual gaiety hot rooms and late hours were soon found not to agree with mrs egremont  she looked faded and languid after evening parties and as her husband really cared more to have her ready to wait upon him and amuse him than for anything else he did not insist on her going out more than might be needful to establish her position or when it suited him to show her off  the other purposes were quite as well served by letting ursula go out with lady kirkaldy who was warmly interested in mother and daughter glad of a companion for blanche and still more glad of a companion for herself  for she was not slow to discover that exhibitions which were merely fashionable gapeseed to her niece were to nuttie real delights viewed intelligently and eliciting comments and questions that lady kirkaldy and even her husband enjoyed in their fresh interest but which were unendurable weariness to blanche unless she had some one to chatter with  lectures and lessons which the aunt hoped to render palatable by their being shared by the two cousins only served to show the difference between a trained and eager and an untrained and idle nature  with the foreign society to be met at lord kirkaldys blanche was less at a loss than her brother and could get on by the help of nods and becks and wreathed smiles but nuttie fresh from her winter abroad could really talk and was often in request as a useful person to help in entertaining  she thus saw some of the choicest society in london and in addition had as much of the youthful gaiety as lady kirkaldy thought wholesome for the two girls also there were those ecclesiastical delights and privileges which had been heard of at micklethwayte and were within reach greatly enjoyed by mrs egremont whenever she could share them though her daughter chafed at her treating all except the chief service on sunday as more indulgence than duty  nuttie was strong with that spring of energy which unbroken health and a quiet life lays up and in her own phrase she went in for everything from early services to late balls thinking all right because it was seldom that her day did not begin with matins or celebration and because she was not taken to more than two balls a week and conversed at times with superior people or looked at those with worldfamed names  possibly the whirl was greater than if it had been mere gaiety for then the brain would not have participated in it church functions with the scurry to go at all or to obtain a seat fine music grand sermons religious meetings entertainments for the poor lectures lessons exhibitions rides drives kettledrums gardenparties concerts theatres operas balls chattering laughing discussing reading up current subjects enjoying attention excitement as to what should be done and howone thing drove out another in perpetual succession and the one thing she never did or could do was to sit still and think  rest was simply dreamless sleep generally under the spell of a strong will to wake at the appointed hour for church  the short intervals of being alone with her mother were spent in pouring out histories of her doings which were received with a sympathy that doubled their pleasure excepting when nuttie thought proper to grumble and scold at her mothers not coming to some church festival at an hour when she thought mr egremont might want her  of him nuttie saw very little  he did not want her and cared little what she did as long as she was under the wing of lady kirkaldy whose patronage was a triumphant refutation of all doubts  he went his own way and had his own club his own associates and with his wife always at his beck and call troubled himself very little about anything else  alice spent a good deal of time alone chiefly in waiting his pleasure but she had her own quiet occupations her books her needlework her housekeeping and letterwriting and was peacefully happy as long as she did not displease nuttie  there were no collisions between father and daughter and the household arrangements satisfied that fastidious taste  she was proud of ursulas successes but very thankful not to be dragged out to share them though she was much less shy and more able on occasion to take her place  one pain she had  good old mrs nugent was rapidly decaying and she shared with all her loving heart in the grief this was to mary and to miss headworth and longed to help them in their nursing  she would not grieve nuttie by dwelling constantly on the bad accounts and the girl hardly attended to them in the tumult of occupations and so at last when the final tidings came in the second week in july they were an absolute shock to nuttie and affected her as the first grief sometimes does  mrs nugent was really the first person of her own intimate knowledge who had died and in the excited state in which she was the idea of the contrast between her own occupations and marys was so dreadful to her that she wept most bitterly with the sobs of childhood such as she really did not know how to restrain  it was an unfortunate day for it was one of the few on which mr egremont wanted to take out his ladies  there was to be a great gardenparty at richmond given by one of his former set who had lately whitewashed himself by marrying a very fast and fashionable lady  nuttie had heard strong opinions on the subject at lord kirkaldys but her father was quite elated at being in a position to countenance his old friends  alice in the midst of her sorrow recollected this with consternation  my dear my dear hush  you must stop yourself  remember we have to go out  goout cried nuttie her sobs arrested by very horror  you wouldnt go  i am afraid your father would be very much vexed  let him  it is a horrid wicked place to go to at all and nowwhen dear dear old mrs nugent is lying thereand  the crying grew violent again and in the midst in walked mr egremont with an astonished what is all this  we have lost one of our dear kind old friends at micklethwayte said alice going towards him dear old mrs nugent and she lifted up her tearstained face which he caressed a little and said poor old body but then at a sob cant you stop ursula from making such a row and disfiguring herself  you must pick up your looks edda for i mean you to make a sensation at jerninghams  oh alwyn if you could let us stay at home  mrs nugent was so good to us and it does seem unkind the tears were in her eyes again  nonsense he said impatiently  i promised jerningham and it is absurd to have you shutting yourself up for every old woman at micklethwayte  thereupon ursula wiped away her tears and stood up wrathful before him  i am not going she said  oh indeed he returned in a tone that made her still more angry hein a french ejaculation which he had the habit of uttering in a most exasperating manner  no she said  it is scarcely a place to which we even ought to be asked to go and certainly not when  do you hear that mrs egremont he asked  oh nuttie nuttie dear she implored dont  no mother said nuttie with flashing eyes if you care so little for your best friends as to let yourself be dragged out among all sorts of gay wicked people when your dear friend is lying dead im sure i shant go with you  her father laughed a little  a pretty figure you are to make a favour of accompanying us  oh go away go away nuttie entreated her mother  you dont know what you are saying  i do know said nuttie exasperated perhaps by the contrast in the mirror opposite between her own swelled disfigured face and the soft tender one of her mother with the liquid eyes  i know how much you care for the dear friends who took care of us when we were forsaken  and with this shaft she marched out of the room while her father again laughed and said have they been training her for the tragic stage never mind edda the little vixen will come to her senses upstairs and be begging to go  i dont think she will said alice sadly she is not that sort of stuff and she was very fond of mrs nugent  oh alwyn if you could let us off  not after that explosion certainly he said  besides i promised jerningham and such an excuse would never hold water  she is not even a relation  no but she was very good to me  the more reason why you should not stay at home and be hipped never mind that silly girl  she will be all right by and by  on the contrary she did not come down to luncheon and when about an hour later alice after writing a few tender loving words to the mourners went up to her daughters room it was to find a limp and deplorable figure lying across the bed and to be greeted with a fresh outburst of sobs and inarticulate exclamations  oh nuttie dear this will not do  it is not right  dear good mrs nugent herself would tell you that this is not the way any one so good and so suffering should be grieved for  think  oh i know all that cried nuttie impatiently but sheshe was the dearestand nobody cares for her but me  not even you  again alice tried to debate the point and urge on her the duties of moderation selfcontrol and obedience but the poor gentle mother was at a great disadvantage  in the first place she respected and almost envied her daughters resistance and really did not know whether it was timidity or principle that made it her instinct to act otherwise in the next ursula could always talk her down and in the third she was and greatly she reproached herself for that same in great dread of setting herself off into tears that might become hysterical if she once gave way to them  and what would be her husbands feelings if she too collapsed and became unpresentable  so having once convinced herself that even if nuttie had been a consenting party no amount of cold water and eaudecologne would bring those bloodshot eyes swollen lids and mottled cheeks to be fit to be seen she fled as fast as possible from the gasps of barbed reproaches which put her own composure in peril and dressed with the heaviest of hearts coupled with the utmost solicitude to look her best  if she had not thought it absolutely wrong she would even have followed martins suggestion and put on a soupcon of rouge but by the time she was summoned to the carriage the feverishness of her effort at selfcontrol had done the work and her husband had paid her the compliment of observing that she looked pretty enough for two  nuttie heard them drive off with a burst of fresh misery of indignation against her mothernow as a slave and a victimnow as forgetting her old home  it was chiefly in mutterings she had pretty well used up her tears for unconsciously perhaps she had worked them up as a defensive weapon against being carried to the party and now that the danger was over her head throbbed her eyes burnt and her throat ached too much for her to wish to cry any more she had not felt physically like this since the day seven years ago when she and mildred sharpe had been found suspiciously toying with the key of the arithmetic and had been debarred from trying for the prize  then she felt debased and guilty now she felt or ought to feel like a heroine maintaining the right  she got up and set herself to rights as well as she could  martin who had been allowed to know that she had lost an old friend petted and pitied her and brought her a substantial meal with her tea after which she set out to evensong at the church at the end of the square well veiled under a shady hat and with a conviction that something ought to happen  nothing did however happen she met no one whom she knew the psalms were not particularly appropriate and her attention wandered away to the scene at home  she did not come back as she was sure she ought to have done soothed exhilarated and refreshed but rather in a rasped state of mind and a conscience making a vehement struggle to believe itself in the righta matter in which she thoroughly succeeded  she wrote a long letter to mary nugent and shed some softer tears over it then she built a few castles on her future escape from the power of her father and then she picked up reata and became absorbed in it regretting only the weakness of her eyes and the darkening of the summer evening  she was still reading when the others came home  her mother kissed her but looked so languid and tiredout that nuttie was shocked and martin declared that she ought not to go down to dinner  a teteatete dinner between father and daughter was too dreadful to alices imagination to be permitted so she dressed and went down looking like a ghost  mr egremont scowled at nuttie nuttie scowled at him each considering it the fault of the other and when at last it was over alice gave up the struggle and went off to bed leaving a contrite message that her headache would be better tomorrow  all your accursed folly and obstinacy observed mr egremont when nuttie with a tone of monition gave him the message  i should call it the consequence of being dragged out with a sore heart returned nuttiea little speech she had prepared ever since she had seen how knocked up her mother was  then i should recommend keeping your ideas to yourself he answered looking at her in his annihilating manner  she was put down she thought afterwards of a hundred things that she could have said to him but she was crushed for the present and when he went out she could only betake herself to reata and forget all about it as much as she could  when she went upstairs at the end of the third volume martin was on the watch and would not let her go into the room  i have been at hand maam without her guessing it and i am happy to say her tears has had a free course when she was in bed  yes maam suppressed grief is always dangerous  mrs egremont was still prostrate with fatigue and headache the next day and nuttie had all the quiet luxuriating in reminiscences she desired  her father was vexed and angry and kept out of the way but it must be confessed that nutties spirits had so much risen by the afternoon that it was a sore concession to consistency when she found herself not expected at blanches last little afternoon dance at lady kirkaldys     chapter xx  wolf    if i cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against   an honest man i have but very little credit with your worship                                                ii king henry iv   another cause besides ursulas recalcitrance and her mothers ailment contributed to disturb mr egremont and bring him home  his agent by name bulfinch a solicitor at redcastle came to him with irrefragable proofs of gross peculation on the part of the bailiff who managed the home farm which supplied the house and stables and showed him that it was necessary to make a thorough investigation and change of system  in point of fact mr egremont greatly preferred being moderately cheated to exerting himself to investigate but this was going beyond moderation and the explosion had been too public to be passed over so he came home and sat by while his wife and mr bulfinch did the work for him and made it evident to him that the frauds had been of long standing and carried on with the connivance of the coachman of gregoriowho had before mrs egremonts arrival acted as house stewardand of the former cook  indeed it was the housekeeper whom mrs egremont had left in charge whose refusal to connive had brought about the discovery  gregorios share in all was sufficiently evident and alices heart leapt with hope  her husband would be wholly her own if his evil genius were once departed but mr egremont would not see it  he had no objection to sacrifice the coachman and all his underlings with the bailiff and his entire family and felt none of the pity that alice had for the pretty silly halfeducated daughters but as to the valetpooh pooh the poor fellow had been out of the way all this timewhatever he had done had been in the dark ages long ago before bridgefield knew its mistress he was a foreigner and that was enough to prevent him from forgathering with the english  it was all their english prejudice  i can show you facts and figures sir said mr bulfinch  i daresay a year or more old  why i was an unprotected carcase thena mere preythe fellow only did after his kind  alice held her tongue then but made an effort in private  indeed i dont think you know i am afraid gregorio is not altered  i found him out in his charges about the wine and the servants wages at nice only you wouldnt listen  his little perquisites my dear child  come nonsense these foreign fellows dont pretend to have the morals you ascribe to the native flunkeygenerally without foundation eitherthey are much of a muchness as to that but your frenchman or italian does it more neatly and is a dozen times better servant than the other is  but  oh ay  i know you dont like him  but he knows his manners to you i hope said mr egremont with a suddenness that made her wish she could truthfully say he did not  yes he always isis respectful but somehow i see it is under protest  mr egremont laughed  rivalsyes i see why you dont consider the sore trial of having a fullgrown mistress turned in upon him look here you keep the keys already but the new fellow at the farm and all the rest of them shall account to you for everythinggregorio and all wont that satisfy you  tis not only the money but i think gregorio is a badnot a goodman  ho ho she wants to advertise for a pious footman and coachman eh no i thank you my dear edda i agree withwho was it who said volez moi mais sans mennuyer  the rectory likewise had hoped for gregorios dismissal and there were grave looks when alice had to confess that nothing would move her husband against him  the canon even lashed himself up to say i tell you how it is alwyn youll never do any good with your household while you keep that fellow  i am not aware what description of good you expect me to do with it will coolly answered the elder brother in a disconcerting tone  poor alice on her side thought of the little master and then wondered if it was uncharitable to do so  for she knew it had become war to the knife with gregorio  whether his master told him or whether it were his own evil conscience or the wonderful intuition of servants he certainly knew of the pressure for his dismissal and he visited it on her as much as he durst  outwardly deferential he could thwart and annoy her in a hundred ways from making love to the housemaids to making evil suggestions to his master yet never giving her any overt cause of complaint  he could worry and sting her under the politest exterior and he knew very well that the most effectual form of annoyance was the persuading his master that any discomfort or lassitude was to be removed by some form of narcotic  this would have the further advantage of stupefying mr egremont and making him more ready to lapse under the old influence while the duration and strength of the new one was already a surprise to gregorio  but there was no doubt that mrs egremont had profited by her year of training  she looked tired and less youthful and pretty but she had gained in grace and importance as well as in style and was much more really the mistress of bridgefield  her shyness had passed away and she knew now to take her place in society though still she was somewhat silent  and her husband depended upon her entirely for all his correspondence for much of his occupation and amusement and even for the regulation of his affairs  in the household gregorio was little more than his personal attendant and she had the general management even of the other menservants  the canoness might well say it had turned out better than she expected  and nuttie had become more womanly and had acquired the indefinable polish given by a london season  she had learnt the art of conversation and could make herself agreeable to her uncle or to any one else who came in her way  even may allowed that she had something in her and cultivated her more than before but on the other hand even the rectory could perceive that there was now an absolute alienation between her and her father and what might before have been fear had become dislike  if she had to refer to him especially if her plans for herself or her mother were crossed there was always a tone of bitterness or of sarcasm about her and her greater boldness and freedom of speech would occasionally manifest itself towards him  this was not indeed often since not only did his cool contempt make her come off the worst in the encounters but the extreme distress they gave to her mother made her refrain whenever her temper or what she thought her conscience would let her but still there was always a danger which kept poor alice on thorns whenever there was a possible difference of schemes or opinions  mrs william egremont was seriously considering of representing to ursula that her conduct was bad taste bad policy and moreover was doing her mothers spirits and health serious harm but it was a delicate matter in which to meddle and the good lady could not make up her mind how far to surrender her brotherinlaws character and allow a partial justification to ursula  she was a cautious woman and waited and watched her opportunities  in the beginning of october mr and mrs egremont were invited to a great shooting party at sir james jerninghams  the invitation did not include ursula  perhaps she had never dawned on their hostesss imagination perhaps it was that lady jerningham was well known to dislike girls or any one who might absorb young mens attention at any rate the omission was a cause of thankfulness to the party concerned and she did not neglect to worry her mother by a protest against keeping such company as would be met at waldicotes  alice smiled a little faintly and said i dont think it hurts me my dear i dont understand half of what they talk about and they are always kind to me  i dont think you ought to go among them or countenance them  my dear childand the colour rosei dont feel as if i had a right to set myself above any one  mother  people might have said just the same of me  and whose fault was that muttered nuttie under her breath but mrs egremont would not hear  she only pleaded as perhaps mother ought not to have done with child  you know nuttie it is not for my own pleasure but your fathers eyesight makes him dislike to go anywhere without me now and i really should be uneasy about him  yes he is all you care for said nuttie  you sacrifice everything you used to think essential just to his will and pleasure  oh nuttie i hope not i dont think i do  if i thought it was doing him any good i should not so much mind went on the girl but he is just the same and i am always thinking of as the husband is the wife is  hush hush  you have no right to think in that way of your father i will not hear it  i have let you say too much already nuttie then after a pause she added gently and wistfully you have been better taught and are clearer headed than ever i was my nuttie and it is quite right that you should hate what seems evil to you  i can only go on trying to do what seems my duty from day to day  i know she added with rising tears that the sin and folly of my younger days worked a difficult position for us both but we can only act according to our lights and pray god to direct us and pleaseplease bear with me my dear one if the same course does not always seem right to us both  nuttie had never heard her say anything so fully showing that she realised these difficulties and greatly touched she asked pardon kissed and caressed her mother  there was a calm over them for the next few days and nuttie actually refrained from bitter comments when her mother was not allowed to go to evensong on sunday on the plea of her being tired but as the girl believed in order that she might read the newspapers aloud  she knew that her silence was appreciated by the way her mother kissed her and called her a dear good considerate girl  on monday mr and mrs egremont went away at what was a strangely early hour for the former nuttie spending her days at the rectory  on the tuesday blanche went with her little sister and the governess on a shopping expedition to redcastle and in relating her adventures on her return she said oh by the bye i met annaple in parks shop  full of micklethwayte news i suppose said may  yes of course  did you know nuttie that your aunt was ill  no indeed i did not  what was the matter  bronchitis i believebrown titus as betty butter calls it  bronchitis  oh dear oh dear  are you quite sure blanche  oh yes  i am quite certain annaple said mark told her that miss headworth was laid up with bronchitis  and nobody has written to us all this week sighed nuttie  i should think that a sign there could not be much in it observed may it may be only a bad cold  but aunt ursel had bronchitis four years ago and was very ill indeed persisted nuttie  im sure it is bronchitis and that she wont let miss mary write to us  she was in much distress about it though may privately told her that she ought to know blanches way better than to trust implicitly to any of her reports and her aunt said much the same thing in more general terms even proposing that if she did not hear the next morning she should go over to lescombe to ascertain what mark had really said  this pacified her a little but on her way home the alarm grew upon her and moreover she recollected the opposition that she believed that her father was certain to make to either her mother or herself going to nurse her aunt  it flashed upon her that if she were to hasten to micklethwayte on this alarm before there could be a prohibition it would be no disobedience and perfectly justifiable not to say noble  her parents were to return on thursday evening and she made up her mind that unless she were fully reassured as to miss headworths state she would go off at once to micklethwayte before any one could gainsay her  she had plenty of money and she consulted the timetable in the hall before going upstairs  it only concerned the nearest line but she calculated that if she caught the express she should reach her destination in time to write to her mother at waldicotes and prevent needless shocks  her eagerness for the plan grew upon her so that it seemed like liberation she could hardly sleep for thinking of it and certainly was not as much disappointed as she believed herself when the post came ina blank  martin was away with her mistress so nuttie explained matters to the upper housemaid who was very sympathetic carried down her orders for the carriage procured for her both breakfast and provision for the journey and packed her clothes  ursula would fain have been off before the rectory was aware but the two little girls came up with a message about the plans for the day just as she was beginning an explanatory note and she entrusted to them the information that she was so uneasy about miss headworth that she had decided on going to see for herself  so in dashed adela and rosalind to their mothers room full of excitement with the news that cousin nuttie was gone off by the train because her aunt was very ill indeed  gone adela are you sure  really gone  oh yes mamma  the dogcart was coming round and she said she wanted to catch the 1005 train and was very sorry she had not time to write a note to you  was there a letter  what had she heard  oh only that her aunt was so very ill  she did not tell usdid she rosie  there was something about being in time to write to aunt alice suggested adela  i am very sorry about this  i am afraid it will be a great shock to alice observed the mother as she imparted the news at her husbands dressingroom door  young girls are so precipitate said the canon  your brother wont like it at all the lady continued  not he  but after all it is just as well that he was not asked they do owe that poor old lady a good deal and alwyns not the man to see it  im not sorry the girl took the matter into her own hands though i couldnt have advised it  except that it will all fall on alice  he is very fond of alice  she has done more with him than i ever thought possible  kept him respectable this whole year and really it grows on him  he makes ever so much more of her now than when he first brought her homeand no wonder  no no he wont fall foul of her  perhaps not but it is just as bad or worse for her if he falls foul of her daughter  besides she is very much attached to her aunt  i wish i knew what the account was or whether she knows anything about it     chapter xxi  ursulas reception    thy wish was father harry to that thoughtshakespeare   it was at halfpast seven oclock that ursula egremonts cab stopped at st ambroses road  she had missed the express train and had to come on by a stopping one  but here at last she was with eyes even by gaslight full of loving recognition a hand full of her cabfare a heart full of throbbing hope and fear a voice full of anxiety as she inquired of the astonished servant louisa louisa how is aunt ursel and without awaiting the reply she opened the adjoining door there sat with their evening meal on the table not only mary nugent but miss headworth herself  nuttie rushed at her and there was an incoherency of exclamations the first thing that made itself clear to the senses of the traveller being ill my dear  no such thing  only i had a bad cold and mary here is only too careful of me  but mark said you had bronchitis  what could have put that into his head  he did not write it surely  he wrote it to annaple ruthven and she told blanche  oh and mary nugents tone was rather nettling  and then it was such a terrible time since we had heard anything added nuttie on the defensive  did not your mother get my letter said miss headworth  i wrote to her atwhats the name of that place  i hope i addressed it right  oh but i was not there  i didnt go with them  ah yes i remember  then did not she send you  no i came off this morning  i heard this yesterday evening and i determined that nothing should stop me if there was no news by the post  dear child  but will your father not be displeased said miss headworth  he hasnt any right to object cried nuttie with flashing eyes and a look that made miss nugent anxious but at the moment there could be little thought save of welcome to the warmhearted girl  louisa was already brewing fresh tea and extemporising additions to the meal and nuttie was explaining how she hoped to have arrived a couple of hours sooner  by the bye i meant to have written to mother for her to have it tomorrow before leaving waldicotes  is there time  no the pillar at hand was cleared at seven and the regular postoffice could not be reached in time so they satisfied themselves with the knowledge that mrs egremont must have had aunt ursels cheerful letter and mary recommended telegraphing to the canon the first thing in the morning  then they gave themselves up to enjoyment  at any rate im here said nuttie and ill make the most of it  and her handsome furs were laid aside and her boots taken off and she resigned herself to absolute ease and luxury while mary poured out the tea and her aunt heaped her plate with eggs and rashers such as one doesnt get anywhere else said nuttie declaring herself quite voracious while her aunt fondly admired her growth and improvement and she inquired into the cold not quite gone yet and there were speculations over what mark could have got into his head mary remembered having met him coming to call and having told him that she had persuaded miss headworth to keep her bed because her colds were apt to be severe and it was agreed to lay the exaggeration at the door of the lovers and blanche  miss headworth laughed and said she ought to be flattered that an old womans sore throat should be thought worthy of mention by a fine young gentleman like mr mark  a very good young man he is she added  you would never have thought how kind he is in coming in here to tell me everything he hears about your dear mother nuttie  he makes himself very useful while mr dutton is away added mary taking his young mens class and all  oh is mr dutton away  yes he has had to be in london a great deal of late  i am afraid he may have to live there altogether  what a grievous pity  he wont be anywhere without doing good said miss headworth but i sometimes wish we had his cool good sense here  and how is mr spyers asked nuttie  she felt shy of asking for gerard godfrey or perhaps she thought she ought to be shy of his name and kept hoping that it would come in naturally  mr spyers is very well  very busy of course and very much delighted with your mothers gifts to the church  all her own work isnt it nuttie  yes every bit  she does lots of embroidery and work of all kinds when she is waiting for him or sitting with him and luckily it has never occurred to him to ask what it is for  the two ladies knew well what was meant by him but they would not pursue the subject and proceeded to put nuttie au courant with st ambrose affairshow last years mission had produced apparently an immense effect in the town and how the improvement had been ebbing ever since but had left various individual gains and stirred up more than one good person who had hitherto thought it enough to save ones own soul and let other people alone how mr spyers was endeavouring to bind people together in a guild how a violent gust of temperance orators had come down upon the place and altogether fascinated and carried away gerard godfrey  there was his name at last and nuttie was rather gratified to feel herself blushing as she asked ah poor gerardhow is he  as good and sincere as ever said miss nugent but not much wiser he is so excitable and vehement  yes said miss headworth  i dont understand the kind of thing in my time a steady young clerk used to be contented after hours with playing at cricket in the summer or learning the flute in the winterand a great nuisance it was sometimes but now gerard must get himself made a sort of half clergyman  a reader suggested mary  minor orders  oh how delightful cried nuttie  people dont half understand it added miss headworth  mrs jeffreys will have it that he is no better than a jesuit and really i did not know what to say for he talked to me by the hour about his being an external brother to something  not to the jesuits certainly said nuttie  yes i told her that but she thinks all monks are jesuits you know and that all brothers are monks and he does wear his cassockhis choir cassock i meanwhen he has his service in the iron room at the sandpits  and now he has taken up temperance and flies about giving the pledge and wanting one to wear bits of blue ribbon  i told him i never did take and never had taken more than a little hot wine and water when i had a cold and i couldnt see what good it would do to george jenkins and the poor fellows at the spread eagle if i took ever so many vows  theres a regular blueribbon fever set in said miss nugent gerard told me i was supporting the cause of intemperance yesterday because i was so wicked as to carry the rest of your bottle of port miss headworth to poor anne crake  well he is a dear boy and youth wouldnt be youth if it were not sometimes rather foolish said miss headworth and it is better it should be for good than evil  eager in a cause and not for selfishness said mary  poor gerard i wonder where he will be safely landed  so did nuttie who had a secret flattering faith in being the cause of all the poor young fellows aberrations and was conscious of having begun the second volume of her lifes novel  she went to bed in the elated frame of mind proper to a heroine  there was a shade over all in the absence of dear old mrs nugent and in marys deep mourning but there is more tenderness than poignancy in sorrow for shocks of corn gathered in full season and all was cheerful about her  she had quite a triumph the next day as old friends dropped in for the chance of seeing her  the least agreeable encounter was that with mark who came in on his way to the office having just received by the second post a letter from his father inquiring into miss headworths state  he met nuttie in the vestibule with her hat on and in a great hurry as she wanted to walk with mary to the school of art gerard godfrey accompanying them as far as the office and she did not at all like the being called to account and asked what could have possessed her to take alarm  why you wrote yourself  i  to annaple ruthven  what am i supposed to have written  that aunt ursel was very ill with bronchitis  ill be bound that miss ruthven said no such thing  you dont pretend that you heard it from herself  no but blanche did  blanche  oh that accounts for it  though i should have thought you knew blanche by this time  but what did you say  i believe i said i couldnt get a knitting pattern miss headworth was to send lady ronnisglen because she was in bed with a cold  what you and blanche could contrive to make of a simple thing like that  and annaple  well but checking himself with a smile we will not fight about that  i only hope it has not brought you into an awkward scrape nuttie  i cant help that she answered with her head rather high  you have written and explained he said anxiously  to my mother of course  if i were you he said lowering his voice i should write or send a special message to your father  i cant see why  it was a mistake  yours was a strong measure and he wont like it  be advised nuttie recollect your mother  the best way would be to go home at once  i could get a day to take youif you would start this afternoon  thank you im not going back till i hear she said proudly  time being up mark took his leave hastily and as he shut the door nuttie uttered half aloud the words she had scarcely repressed no i thank you mr mark i am not going back like a dog in a string  what was that what he expected of you said gerard godfrey whom she had not intended to hear her but who had come out of the sittingroom on the sounds of departure  he said he would take me home if i could go at once  wouldnt he have liked it exclaimed gerard  it might be the best way said miss nugent who had followed young godfrey  now miss mary cried nuttie as if i could shorten my holiday now that i have it  and i dont see what business he had to call you to account said gerard  a stuckup fellow  of course all the egremonts are set against my being here said nuttie  i thought the canon offered to bring you last year said mary gently  oh that was only to monks horton  it would have been simply tantalising  lady kirkaldy is an excellent person said miss nugent  is she at home now asked ursula  coming next week they tell me said gerard  heyour cousinwill always be loafing up there now giving up all that he had undertaken i suppose  not very likely said mary quietly  it is a mere scottish antichurch influence said gerard turning round at the swingdoor of his office  why else will egremont not take the pledge  wherewith he disappeared blue ribbon and all while mary smiled though she was vexed and nuttie observed poor gerard but i cant see why he should be jealous of mark now  mary did not choose to understand what nuttie implied in her simplicity and made answer he is rather blue ribbon mad  besides i am afraid the fact of being a swell does not conduce to your cousins popularity among the clerks  surely he does not give himself airs said ursula her family feelings awaking  no but i fancy he is rather reserved  whats this about giving up what he has undertaken  what is it  when mr dutton went to london he asked mark to take his sunday afternoons with the big lads  he thought they wanted some one with more resources and variety than there is in poor gerard who didnt at all like being passed over  i never should have thought it of mark  he never dreamt of teaching anybody at home  very likely not but there is an atmosphere at st ambroses  and oh how glad i am to be in it  i wonder how long they will let me stay  the dear little mother will try to get me a sunday here if she dares  indeed i cant hear before saturday and then there would hardly be time to get home  oh thats jolly  ill go to the nursery gardens and get such flowers for the vases  saturday brought nuttie a letter but not from her mother   my dear ursulai write because we are anxious to keep your mother as quiet as possible  it was a serious shock to her to find that you had left home and she naturally supposed that miss headworth was in great danger  your father was greatly displeased and she has been much overcome and very unwell but we hope by keeping her perfectly quiet that worse consequences may be prevented  your father desires you to remain where you are for the present as he will not have her disturbed again  your mother sends her love both to you and to your aunt and desires me to say that she will write in a day or two and that she thinks you had better not come back till she is better and your fathers vexation has diminished  i wish you had informed us of your intentions as then we could have ascertained the grounds of the report that terrified you so strangelyi remain your affectionate aunt                                           jane m egremont   poor mother he has been sneering at us all in his dreadful cynical way and knocked her up into one of her awful headaches said nuttie who felt extremely angered by the grave tone of rebuke in the letter and tossed it over to her aunt without absolutely reading it all  miss headworth was a good deal distressed and anxious to know what mrs william egremont meant but nuttie positively declared oh it is her headaches  you know she always had them more or less and they have grown a great deal worse since she has taken to sitting in that horrid stuffy perfumy cigarry room and doesnt take half exercise enough  and when miss headworth showed herself much concerned about the state of things nuttie coaxed her and declared that she should fancy herself unwelcome and have to go and beg a lodging somewhere instead of enjoying her reprieve  and aunt ursel was far less impervious to coaxing than she used to be when she was the responsible head of a boarding house  she did most thoroughly enjoy the affection of her great niece and could not persuade herself to be angry with her especially when the girl looked up smiling and said if the worst came to the worst and he did disinherit me the thing would only right itself  i always meant to give it back to mark  no great aunt in the world could fail to admire the generous spirit of the girl who came back from the great world of luxury so loving and happy in her humble surroundings  the only sighs were for poor alice in the hands of a man of whom miss headworth knew so much evil  if she were not wretched and a victimand nuttie did not think her suchshe must surely be getting spoilt and worldly  her daughter implied fears of this kind yet who could read her letters and think so  nuttie was fortunately too much in awe of the canoness to write all the pertnesses that tingled at her fingers ends and she sent a proper and fairly meek letter intimating however that she was only too happy to remain at micklethwayte  it was two or three days more before she heard again   my own dear childthey have let me write at last and i can say how much i like to think of your nestling up to dear aunt ursel and how glad i am to find that she was well enough to enjoy you it is almost like being there to hear of you and the only thing that grieves me is that your father was very much vexed at your setting off in that sudden way and at my being so foolish about it  his eyes have been very bad and he missed me sadly while i was laid up  we are neither of us very strong and we thinkif aunt ursel and mary can keep you for a little longerit will be better for you to stay on with them as it might be as dreary for you as it was last winter especially as the rectory folk will soon be going into residence  i will write to them about it and persuade them to take something for your board so as to make it easy for them  and then you can have a fire in your room you must not leave it off now you are used to it  my dear i wish you would write a little apology to your father  i ought not to conceal that he is really very angry and i think it would be well if you expressed some regret or if you cannot truthfully do that asked his pardon for your impetuosity for you know he cannot be expected to realise all that dear aunt ursel is to us  you cannot think how kind your aunt jane has been to me i did not think she could have been so tender  this is the first letter i ever had to write to you my own dear child  i miss you every moment but after all it is better you should be away till your father has overlooked this hurried expedition of yours  i am sure he would if you wrote him a real nice letter telling how you were really frightened and that it was not a mere excuse  pray do and then you can come back to your loving little mother                                  a e   as if i would or could quoth nuttie to herself  apologise to him indeed for loving the aunt who toiled for us when he deserted us poor little mother she cant really expect it of me  indeed i dont think she quite knows what she wants or whether she likes me to be here or at bridgefield  my belief is that he bullies her less when i am out of the way because she just gives way to him and does not assert any principle  ive tried to back her up and it is of no use and i am sure i dont want such a winter as the last  so i am much better here and as to begging pardon when i have done nothing wrong i am sure i wont to please anybody  i shall tell her that she ought to know me better than to expect it  but nuttie did not show the letter either to aunt ursel or mary nugent nor did she see that in which alice had satisfied them that it might be better that her daughter should pay them a long visit while mr egremonts health required constant attendance and the canons family were at redcastle  and as her husband was always openhanded she could make ursulas stay with them advantageous to their slender means without hurting their feelings  she told them as much as she could but there was more that no living creature might know namely the advantage that gregorio had gained over that battlefield his master during her days of illness  the first cold weather had brought on pain and anger and anxiety nervous excitement and sleeplessness which the valet had taken upon him to calm with a narcotic under a new name that at first deceived her till she traced its effects and inquired of dr hammond about it unwillingly on her account he enlightened her and showed her that though the last years care had done much to loosen the bonds of the subtle and alluring habit yet that any resumption of it tended to plunge its victim into the fatal condition of the confirmed opiumeater giving her every hope at the same time that this propensity might be entirely shaken off and that the improvement in mr egremonts health and habits which had set in might be confirmed and raise him above the inclination  could she have been rid of gregorio she would have felt almost sure of victory but as it was she believed the man absolutely meant to baffle her partly out of a spiteful rivalry partly because his masters torpid indolence could be used to his own advantage  she was absolutely certain that his sneering tone of remark made her husband doubly disinclined to let any religious book be near or to permit her to draw him to any sunday observance  the battle must be fought out alone  the gentle woman could have no earthly helper in the struggle  the canon and mark the only persons who could have given her the slightest aid were both at a distance even if her loyal heart could have brooked confession to them and she only hoped that nuttie would never know of it  only aid from above could be with her in the daily hourly effort of cheerfulness patience and all the resources of feminine affection to avert the temptation and she well knew that the presence of the ardent unsubdued opinionative girl would alas only double the difficulties so she acquiesced at least for the present in nutties grand achievement of having broken away from all the wealth and luxury of bridgefield to return to her simple home and good old aunt  mark was a good deal vexed but nuttie did not care about that attributing this displeasure to egremont clanship mary nugent was doubtful and anxious and thought it her duty to reconcile herself to her father but miss headworth who be it remembered had reason to have the worst impressions of mr egremont rejoiced in her young niece having escaped from him for the time and only sighed over the impossibility of alices doing the same  and when nuttie described as she constantly did the various pleasures she had enjoyed during the past year the good old lady secretly viewed her as a noble christian heroine for resigning all this in favour of the quiet little home at micklethwayte though reticent before her and discussed her excellence whenever she was alone with mary  nor would miss nugent vex her with contradictions or hints that what nuttie was giving up at present might be a dull house with her mother engrossed by an irritable semiinvalid and the few gaieties to be enjoyed by the help of the canons family at redcastle  she did ask the girl whether mrs egremont being avowedly not quite well might not need her assistance but nuttie vehemently disavowed being of any possible use to her father he never let her read to him oh no he called her music schoolgirly a mere infliction he never spoke to her if he could help it and then it was always with a sort of sneer she believed he could not bear the sight of her and was ashamed of it as well he might be  for mrs houghtons disclosures had rankled ever since within her and had been confirmed by her aunt  but that is very sad said mary  i am so sorry for you  ought you not to try hard to conquer his distaste  iwhy he cares for nothing good  nay smiling  not for your mother  oh  shes pretty you know besides she makes herself a regular slave to him and truckles to him in everything as i could never do  perhaps she is overcoming evil with good  i am afraid it is more like being overcome of evil  no no dear miss mary dont be shocked  the dear little mother never would be anything but good in her own sweet self but it is her nature not to stand up for anything you know  she seems to me just like a christian woman that has been obliged to marry some paynim knight and it perfectly provokes me to see her quite gratified at his notice and ready to sacrifice anything to him now i know how he treated her  if i had been in her place i wouldnt have gone back to him no not if he had been ready to crown me after i was dead like ines de castro  i dont know that you would have had much choice in that case  my very ghost would have rebelled said nuttie laughing a little  and mary could believe that mrs egremont with all her love for her daughter might find it a relief not to have to keep the peace between the father and child  yet she said to herself if mr dutton were here he would have taken her back the first day     chapter xxii  disenchantment    he promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons   st ambroses road was perfectly delightful as long as there was any expectation of a speedy recall  every day was precious every meeting with an old face was joyful each interchange of words with mr spyers or gerard godfrey was hailed as a boon nothing was regretted but the absence of monsieur and his master and that the favourite choir boys voice was cracked  but when there was reason to think that success had been complete when miss headworth had been persuaded by mary that it was wiser on all accounts not to mortify alice by refusing the two guineas a week offered for miss egremonts expenses when a couple of boxes of clothes and books had arrived and ursula found herself settled at micklethwayte till after christmas she began first to admit to herself that somehow the place was not all that it had once been to her  her mother was absent that was one thing  mrs nugent was gone that was another  there was no monsieur or mr dutton to keep her in awe of his precision even while she laughed at it  there were no boarders to patronise and play with and her education at the high school was over if she saw a halfclothed child it was not half so interesting to buy an ulster in the next shop as it was to turn over the family ragbag knit sew and contrive  somehow things had a weariness in them and the little excitements did not seem to be the exquisite delights they used to be  after having seen patience at the princesss it was not easy to avoid criticising a provincial lady jane and it was the like with other things of more importance  even the ritual of st ambroses church no longer struck her as the ne plus ultra of beauty and only incited her to describe london churches  she resumed her sundayschool classes and though she talked at first of their raciness and freedom she soon longed after the cleanliness respectfulness and docility of the despised little bridgefordites and uttered bitter things of micklethwayte turbulence declaringperhaps not without truththat the children had grown much worse in her absence  and as mr godfrey had been superintendent during the latter half of the time this was a cruel stroke  he wanted to make her reverse her opinions  and they never met without now ursula dont you remember jem burton putting on miss popes spectacles and grinning at all the class  yes and how mr dutton brought him up to beg her pardon  now was any notice taken when that horrid boyi dont know his nameturned the hymn they were saying to her into tommy make room for your uncle  oh albert cox  it is no use doing anything to him he would go off at once to the primitives  let him  i cannot make him a schismatic  i wonder what he is now  besides miss pope perfectly provokes impertinence  then i wouldnt give her work she cant do  such an argument as this might be very well at the moment of provocation but it became tedious when recurred to at every meeting nuttie began to wonder when monks horton would be inhabited again and how much notice lady kirkaldy would take of her and she was a good deal disappointed when mark told her that lord kirkaldy had been begged to undertake a diplomatic mission which would keep them abroad all the winter  there was a certain weariness and want of interest  it was not exactly that there was nothing intellectual going on  there were the lectures but they were on chemistry for which nuttie cared little there were good solid books and lively ones too but they seemed passe to one who had heard them discussed in town  mary and miss headworth read and talked them over and perhaps their opinions were quite as wise and miss nugents conversation was equal to that of any of nutties london friends but it was only womans talk after allthe brilliancy and piquancy the touch and go she had enjoyed in lady kirkaldys drawingroom was lacking  mr spyers was too much immersed in parish matters to read anything secular and neither he nor gerard godfrey seemed ever to talk of anything but parish matters  there was not the slightest interest in anything beyond  foreign politics european celebritiesthings in which nuttie had learnt to take warm interest when with the kirkaldys were nothing to them  even mary wondered at her endeavours to see the days paper and she never obtained either information or sympathy unless she came across mark  it seemed to her that gerard cared less for the peace or war of an empire than for a tipsy cobbler taking the pledge  the monotony and narrowness of the world where she had once been so happy fretted and wearied her though she was ashamed of herself all the time and far too proud to allow that she was tired of it all  aunt ursel at her best had always been a little dry and grave an authority over the two nieces and though softened she was not expansive did not invite confidences and home was not home without the playfellowmother  and most especially was she daily tired of gerard godfrey  had he always talked of nothing but the colours chants e c u classes and teetotalism  whatever she began it always came back to one or other of these subjects and when she impatiently declared that she was perfectly sick of hearing of the use of sarum he looked at her as guilty of a profanity  perhaps it was true that he was narrower than he had been  he was a good honest religiouslyminded lad but with no great depth or grasp of intellect ursula egremont had been his companion first and then his romance and the atmosphere of the community in which he lived had been studious and intelligent  his expedition to redcastle had convinced him that the young lady lived in a different world entirely beyond his reach and in the reaction of his hopelessness he had thrown himself into the excitement of the mission and it had worked on him a zealous purpose to dedicate himself totally to a religious life giving up all worldly aims and employing the small capital he could call his own in preparing for the ministry  mr dutton had insisted that he should test his own steadfastness and resolution by another years work in his present situation before he took any steps  he had submitted but still viewed himself as dedicated and so far as business hours permitted gave his services like a clerical pupil to st ambroses with the greatest energy and perhaps somewhat less judgment than if mr dutton had been at hand  being without natural taste for intellectual pursuits unless drawn into them by his surroundings he had dropped them entirely and read nothing but the ephemeral controversial literature of his party and not much of that for he was teaching preaching exhorting throughout his spare time while the vicar was in too great need of help to insist on deepening the source from which his zealous assistant drew  as miss nugent observed teetotalism was to him what dissipation was to other young men  on this vehemence of purpose descended suddenly ursula egremont once more and the human heart could not but be quickened with the idea not entirely unfounded that it was to him that she had flown back and that her exile proved that she cared for him more than for all the delights she had enjoyed as heiress of bridgefield  the good youth was conscientious to the backbone and extremely perplexed between his selfdedication and the rights that their implied understanding might give to her  was she to be the crowning blessing of his life to be saved partly through his affection from worldly trials and temptations and bestowing on him a brilliant lot in which boundless good could be effected  or was she a syren luring him to abandon his higher and better purposes  the first few days of her stay the former belief made him feel like treading on air or like the hero of many a magazine story but as time went on this flattering supposition began to fail him when nuttie showed her weariness of the subjects which in his exclusiveness he deemed the only ones worthy of a christian or rather of a catholic both of them had outgrown the lively aimless chatter and little jests that had succeeded the games of childhood and the growth had been in different directions so that ursula felt herself untrue to her old romance when she became weary of his favourite topics disappointed by his want of sympathy and comprehension fretted by his petty disapprovals and annoyed by his evident distaste for mark to whom she turned as to one of her proper world  at last after many tossings gerard fixed upon a test  if she endured it she would be the veritable maiden of his imagination and they would stand by one another come what would if not he would believe that the past had been fancy not love or love that had not withstood the attractions of fashionable life  a great temperance meeting was coming on and gerard eager at once to fill the room and to present a goodly roll of recruits watched anxiously for his moment and came on nuttie with his hands full of bills in huge letters and his pockets of badges  excellent speakers he cried  we shall have the hall crowded youll come ursula  i dont know what miss mary will do  i dont think she means it  oh if you insist if we both insist she will  look at the paperwe are to have some splendid experiences  nuttie made a face  ive heard all about those she said  that man pointing to one of the names regularly rants about it he is like a madman  he does go rather far but it is quite necessary as you will hear oh nuttie if you would only be one of us  ive brought a card  if you would  why whats the use gerard  i dont like wine i never do drink it except a little claretcup sometimes when i cant get water  then it would cost you nothing  yes it would  it would make me ridiculous  you used not to heed the sneers of the world  not for anything worth doingbut this is not  it is the greatest cause of the day he cried in an eager exalted manner which somewhat inclined her to laugh  do away with alcohol and you would do away with crime  thank you for the compliment gerard i never found that the infinitesimal drop of alcohol that i suppose there is in a tumbler of claretcup disposed me to commit crimes  why wont you understand me ursula  cant you give up that for the sake of saving others  i wonder whom it would save  example saves  if you put on thistaking out the badgehow many should you not lead at your home  just nobody  mother and i should have a bad time of it thats all  and if you endured what would not your testimony effect in the household and village  nothing  i have nothing to do with the menservants and as to the village it is very sober  theres only one public house and that is kept by uncle williams old butler and is as orderly as can be  ah thats the way you all deceive yourselves  moderate drinkers are ten times more mischievous than regular drunkards  thank you gerard  and outrageous abstainers are more mischievous than either of them because they make the whole thing so utterly foolish and absurd  she was really angry now and so was gerard  is that your ultimatum he asked in a voice that he strove to render calm  certainly im not going to take the pledge  having quarrelled in childhood made quarrelling now easier and gerard answered bitterly  very well i hope you will have no cause to repent it  tis not the way to make me repent it to see how it seems to affect some peoples common sense  it is just as if all your brains had run to water said nuttie laughing a little but gerard was desperately serious and coloured vehemently  very well miss egremont i understand  i have had my answer he said gathering up his papers and marching out of the room  she stood still offended and not in the least inclined to run after him and take back her words  he poor fellow stumbled down the steps and held by the garden rail to collect his senses and compose himself  whats the matter gerard are you ill or giddy asked miss nugent coming up in the winter twilight  no oh no  only the dream of my life is over he answered scarce knowing what he said  you havent cried mary aghast  oh no he said understanding the blank only she wont take the pledge  i dont see how she could or ought responded mary  is that all  i had made it the test muttered poor gerard  it is right  it is all over now  i shall know how to go on my way  it is best soi know it isonly i did not know whether anything was due to her  it was almost a sob  dear old gerard said mary i see you meant to do right  it is well your mind should be settled  i think youll find comfort in your good work  he wrung her hand and she went in half amused for she was fully aware of the onesidedness of the mania for temperance under which he acted yet honouring his high pure motives and rejoicing that he had found this indirect mode of gauging nutties feelings towards himthat is if he was right about them and there was no revulsion  far from it  nuttie was still angry  gerard had been so ridiculous she said teasing her to take the pledge and quite incapable of understanding her reasons  i cant think why gerard has grown so stupid  enthusiasms carry people away returned mary  if mr dutton had only stayed he would have kept gerard like himself said nuttie  but there was no relenting  the two young people avoided each other and perhaps nuttie was secretly relieved that the romance she had outgrown no longer entangled her     chapter xxiii  a failure    would i had loved her moremrs hemans   on the 14th of january at bridgefield egremont the wife of alwyn piercefield egremont esquire a son and heir  ursula had been prepared for this event for about a fortnight by a long tender letter from her mother mourning over the not meeting at christmas and the long separation but saying that she had wished to spare the long anxiety and that it had been a trying time which she felt herself able to cope with better alone than even with her dear nuttie knowing her to be happy and safe with aunt ursel  now if all went well they would have a happy meeting and begin on a new score if the will of god should be otherwise added alice i am sure i need not entreat my nuttie to do and be all that she can to her father my child you do not know how sorely he needs such love and tendance and prayer as you can give him  i know you have thought i have set you asideif not better things for his sake  indeed i could not help it  then there was something tearstained and blotted out and it ended with he is beginning to miss your step and voice about the house  i believe he will really be glad to see you when the bright spring days come and i can kiss my own nuttie again  nuttie was very much delighted but a little hurt that her aunt and mary should have been in the secret and pledged to say nothing to her till her mother should write  she found moreover that miss headworth was extremely anxious and not altogether reassured by mrs william egremonts letter of announcement which filled nuttie with delight how happy the little mother must be to have a baby in her arms again and though she herself did not profess to have a strong turn for infant humanity it was the greatest possible relief to be no longer an heiress excepting that the renunciation in favour of mark was no longer practicable  the residence at redcastle was not over but the canoness had come to nurse her sisterinlaw and kept up the correspondence  the son and heir was reported to be a perfect specimen and his father was greatly elated and delighted but the letters showed anxiety about the mother who did not get on as she ought and seemed to have no power of rally about her  at length came a letter that seemed to burn itself into nutties brain   my dear ursulayour mother is longing to see you  you had better come home directly  your aunt saved her before  tell her if she will come she shall have my deepest gratitude  i shall send to meet the 511 trainyour affectionate father                                         a p egremont   mrs william egremont wrote at more length  symptoms had set in which filled the doctors and nurses with double anxiety  advice had been sent for from london and mr egremont was in an uncontrollable state of distress  she had undertaken to summon ursula home and to beg miss headworth to undertake the journey  she evidently did not know that her brotherinlaw had written himself and before they could start a telegram terrified them but proved to contain no fresh tidings only a renewed summons  miss headworth forgot all her resolutions about mr egremonts hospitalityher alice was her only thought and all the remedies that had been found efficacious at dieppe  the good lady had a certain confidence in her own nursing and experience of alice which buoyed her up with hope while ursula seemed absolutely stunned  she had never thought of such a frightful loss or grief and her mental senses were almost paralysed so that she went through the journey in a kind of surface trance observing all around her much as usual looking out for the luggage and for the servant who had come to meet them with the report no change  she did the honours of the carriage and covered miss headworth with the fur rug  they wanted it for they were shivering with anxiety  canon egremont came out to the front hall to meet them and put his arms round nuttie tenderly saying my poor dear child then as he saw he had frightened them no no  she is aliveconscious they say only so very weak  then with something of his usual urbane grace he held out his hand miss headworth it is very good in you to come you have a great deal to forgive  he took them into the tentroom where tea was standing interrupting himself in the account he was giving to bid nuttie let her aunt have some  it was plain from his manner that he had given up hope and in another minute in hurried his brother looking terribly haggard and with bloodshot eyes giving his hand to each with thats right miss headworth thank you  come let me know what you think of her  does she know they are come said the canon  no  then alwyn let them have some tea and take off their things  i can tell you the nurses will never let them in just off a journey  miss headworth seconded this and mr egremont submitted allowing that she had not asked for nuttie since the morning and then had smiled and squeezed his hand when he said she was coming with her aunt but he walked up and down in direful restlessness his whole mind apparently bent on extracting from miss headworth that she had been as ill or worse at dieppe  alas when mrs william egremont came down to fetch nuttie there was no question that matters were much worse  the sweet face was perfectly white and wasted and the heavy lids of the dark eyes scarcely lifted themselves but the lips moved into a smile and the hand closed on that of the girl who stood by her as one frozen into numbness  there was the same recognition when her aunt was brought to her side the poor old lady commanding herself with difficulty as the loving glance quivered over the face  time passed on and she still held nutties hand  once when a little revived by some stimulant at her lips she made an effort and said stay with him  take care of him  love him  and your little brother my nuttie  promise  i promise the girl answered scarce knowing what she said  and the eyes closed with an air of peace and rest  again when miss headworth was doing something to ease her position she said thank you and then more vigorously thank you dear aunt for all you have been to us  there was little more  she asked nuttie for her hymn the evening hymn with which mother and daughter used nightly to go to sleep and which in her strange dreamy way the girl managed to say  then a little murmur and sign passed between the elder ladies and mrs william egremont fetched her husband  as he opened his book to find the commendatory prayer thinking her past all outward consciousness and grieved by the look of suffering her eyes again unclosed and her lips said failed  dont think of that  god can make failures success  there was a half smile a look of peace  he makes up she said and those were the last audible words before it was over and the tender spirit was released from its strife some time later they only knew when by the failure of the clasp on her husbands hand  old miss headworth did not understand the meaning of that sad word till the next forenoon  thenas she sat in the darkened tentroom crying over her letterswhile the stunned and bewildered nuttie was under her aunt janes direction attending to the needful arrangements canon egremont wandered in upon her in the overflow of confidence of a man with a full heart wanting to talk it all out communicating the more because she was a discreet woman and asked no questions  he had tried to see his brother but gregorio had not admitted him  he was aware now of the whole state of things  dr hammond had told him when first beginning to be alarmed for his patient that the principal cause for anxiety was the exhaustion caused by the long strain on her spirits and strength consequent on her efforts to wean her husband from his fatal propensity  there had been other complications as the doctor called them and more immediate causes of danger but both he and his colleague summoned from london believed that she would have surmounted them if she had had more strength to rally  but her nurses dated the decided turn for the worse from the day when she had gazed up into mr egremonts face and detected the look in his eyes that she had learnt too well to understand  she would fain have lived and according to her obedient nature had submitted to all the silence and stillness enforced on her but she had told dr hammond that she must see her brotherinlaw before she was too far gone  and the doctor knowing all took care it should be brought about  and then she had spoken of her failure in the effort of these years if i had begun better she said it might not have been so with him  my dear indeed you have nothing to blame yourself for  you were grievously sinned against by us all  alwyn was no saint when he drew you into itand you you have been his good angel doing all and more too said the canon almost breaking down  i triedbut if i had been a better womanand to leave him to that man  child child victories sometimes come this way he cried scarce knowing how it was put into his mouth but glad to see the light in her eye  thanks she replied  no i ought not to have said that  i leave him to god and my poor nuttie  i want you to tell her if i cant what she must try to do  if i had but brought them together more but i tried for the best  then she begged for her last communion saying i do pray for that poor gregorio  isnt that forgiving him  and the attempt to exchange forgiveness with the canon for their mutual behaviour at the time of her marriage overcame them both so much that they had to leave it not half uttered  indeed in speaking of the scene william egremont was utterly overwhelmed  and thats the woman that i treated as a mere outcast he cried walking about the little room  oh god forgive me  i shall never forgive myself  poor miss headworth  in past days she had longed for any amount of retribution on alices hardhearted employers but it was a very different thing to witness such grief and self reproach  he had in truth much more developed ideas of duty both as man and priest than when he had passively left a disagreeable subject to his motherinlaw as lying within a womans province and his good heart was suffering acutely for the injustice and injury in which he had shared towards one now invested with an almost saintly halo  in the gush of feeling he had certainly revealed more to miss headworth than his wife or even he himself in his cooler moments would have thought prudent and he ended by binding her to secrecy and saying that he should only tell his niece what was necessary for her to know  nuttie was going about dryeyed and numbed glad of any passing occupation that would prevent the aching sense of desolation at her heart from gaining force to overwhelm her courting employment and shunning pity and condolence but she could not escape when her uncle took her hand made her sit down by him with i want to speak to you my dear and told her briefly and tenderly what her mothers effort had been and of the message and task she had bequeathed the poor girls heart fainted within her  oh but uncle william how can i  how can i ever  mother could do things i never could  he did care for her  he does not care for me  you must teach him to do so nuttie  oh she said with a hopeless sound  the canon did think it very hopeless in his heart but he persevered as in duty bound  i told your dear mother that perhaps you would succeed where she thought she had failed though indeed she had done much  it made her happy  so my dear child you are bound to do your best  yes then after a pausebut mother could coax him and manage him mother was with him day and night she could always get at him what can i do  i think you will find that he depends upon you more said the canon and it may be made easier to you if you only set your will to it  if i ought ill try said poor nuttie more humbly perhaps than she had ever spoken before but in utter dejection and her uncle answered her like a child  there thats a good girl  nobody can do more  for the canon had one hope  he had not thought it becoming to speak to her of the counter influence but he could not help thinking it possible that if he and his son backed by doctor and lawyer made a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether they might induce his brother to part with gregorio and this would render ursulas task far less impossible  he was confirmed in this hope by finding that marks arrival was not unwelcome to mr egremont who seemed to have forgotten the unpleasantness with which he had regarded the engagement and only remembered that his nephew had been alices champion resuming old customs of dependence making him act as amanuensis and arraigning the destiny that had restored so lovely and charming a creature only to snatch her away leaving nothing but a headstrong girl and a helpless baby  that poor little fellow was all that could be desired at his age but nuttie felt her beautiful mother almost insulted when the elder ladies talked of the wonderful resemblance that the canoness declared to have been quite startling in the earlier hours of his life  for the convenience of one of the sponsors he was to be christened in the afternoon following the funeral the others beingby his mothers special entreatyhis sister and mark  egremont customs were against the ladies going to the funeral so that nuttie was kept at home much against her will but after the luncheon she escaped leaving word with her aunts that she was going to walk down to church alone and they were sorry enough for her to let her have her own way especially as her father having been to the funeral had shut himself up and left all the rest to them  the egremont family had a sort of enclosure or pen with iron rails round it close to the church wall where they rested under flat slabs the gate in this was open now and the newmade grave was one mass of white flowerswreaths and crosses snowdrops hyacinths camellias and the likeand at the feet was a flowerpot with growing plants of the white hyacinth called in france lys de la vierge  these before they became frequent in england had been grown in mr duttons greenhouse and having been favourites with mrs egremont it had come to be his custom every spring to bring her the earliest plants that bloomed  nuttie knew them well the careful tying up the neat arrangement of moss over the earth the peculiar trimness of the whole and as she looked the remembrance of the happy times of old the sick longing for all that was gone did what nothing had hitherto effectedbrought an overwhelming gush of tears  there was no checking them now that they had come  she fled into church on the first sounds of arrival and hid herself in the friendly shelter of the great family pew but she had to come out and take her place though she could hardly utter a word and it was all that she could do to keep from sobbing aloud she could not hand the babe and the canon had to take on trust the name alwyn headworth for he could not hear the words that were on her trembling lips  it was soon over and while the baby and his attendants with miss headworth were being packed into the carriage and her uncle and aunt bowing off the grand godfather she clutched her cousins arm and said mark wheres mr dutton  ii didnt know he was coming but now you ask i believe i saw him this morning  i know he is here  do you want to see him said mark kindly  oh if i might  then with a sudden impulse she looked back into the church and recognised a black figure and slightly bald head bowed down in one of the seats  she pointed him out  no doubt he is waiting for us all to be gone said mark in a low voice  you go into the rectory nuttie theres a fire in the study and ill bring him to you there ill get him to stay the night if i can  oh thank you and it was a really fervent answer  mark waited and when mr dutton rose was quite shocked at his paleness and the worn look on his face as of one who had struggled hard for resignation and calm  he started almost as if a blow had been struck him as mark uttered his name in the porch no doubt having never meant to be perceived nor to have to speak to any one but in one moment his features had recovered their usual expression of courteous readiness  he bowed his head when mark told him that ursula wanted to shake hands with him and came towards the rectory but he entirely declined the invitation to sleep there declaring that he must return to london that night  mark opened the study door and then went away to secure that the man whom he had learnt to esteem very highly should at least have some refreshment before he left the house  those few steps had given mr dutton time to turn from a mourner to a consoler and when nuttie came towards him with her hand outstretched and oh mr dutton mr dutton he took it in both his and with a calm broken voice said god has been very good to us in letting us know one like her  but oh what can we do without her  ah nuttie that always comes before us  but i saw your work and your comfort just now  poor little boy  i shall get to care about him i know but as yet i can only feel how much rather i would have her  no doubt but it is her work that is left you  her work  yes  but oh mr dutton you dont know how dreadful it is  he did not know what she meant  whether it was simply the burthen on any suddenly motherless girl or any special evil on her fathers part but he was soon enlightened for there was something in this old friend that drew out her confidence beyond all others even when he repressed her and she could not help telling him in a few murmured furtive words such as she knew she ought not to utter and he felt it almost treason to hear  opiates she was always trying to keep my father from them it was too much for her  my uncle says i must try to do it and i cant  poor child said mr dutton kindly though cut to the heart at the revelation of sweet alices trial at least you can strive and there is always a blessing on resolution  oh if you knew and he doesnt like me  i dont think ive ever been nice to him and that vexed her  i havent got her ways  no said mr dutton but you will learn others  look here nuttie you used to be always craving for grand and noble tasks the more difficult the better  i think you have got one now more severe than ever could have been thought ofand very noble  what are those lines about the task bequeathed from bleeding sire to son  isnt it like that  you are bound to go on with her work and the more helpless you feel and the more you throw yourself on god the more god will help you  he takes the will for the deed if only you have will enough and nuttie you can pray that you may be able to love and honour him  teacups were brought in followed by mark and interrupted them and after a short interval they parted at the park gate and ursula walked home with mark waked from her dull numb trance with a crushed feeling as if she had been bruised all over and yet with a purpose within her     chapter xxiv  farms or umbrellas    he tokin into his handis    his londis and his lodechaucer   mark  mark  a little figure stood on the gravel road leading through lescombe park and lifted up an eager face as mark jumped down from his horse  i made sure you would come over  yes but i could not get away earlier  and i have so much to say to you and your mother annaple theres a great proposition to be considered  oh dear and here is john bearing down upon us  never mind  well get into the mithers room and be cosy  well mark said sir johns hearty voice i thought you would be here  come to luncheon  thats right  and how is poor egremont i thought he looked awful at the funeral  he is fairly well thank you but it was a terrible shock  i should think so  to find such a pretty sweet creature just to lose her again  child likely to live eh  oh yes he is a fine fellow and has never had anything amiss with him  poor little chap  doesnt know what he has lost  well nannie as they neared the house do you want a teteatete or to take him in to your mother  here ill take the horse  come to her at once said annaple she wants to hear all and besides she is expecting me  mark was welcomed by lady ronnisglen with inquiries for all concerned and especially for that poor girl  i do pity a young thing who has to take a womans place too soon she said  it takes too much out of her  i should think ursula had plenty of spirit said annaple  i dont know whether spirit is what is wanted said mark  her mother prevailed more without it than i am afraid she is likely to do with it  complements answer better than parallels sometimes but not always said lady ronnisglen  which are we asked annaple demurely  not parallels certainly for then we should never meet responded mark  but here is the proposal  my father and all the rest of us have been doing our best to get my uncle to smooth ursulas way by getting rid of that valet of his  the man with the mephistopheles face  exactly  he is a consummate scoundrel as we all know and so does my uncle himself but he has been about him these twelve or fourteen years and has got a sort of hold on himthatthat it is no use to talk of it but it did not make that dear aunt of mine have an easier life  in fact i should not be a bit surprised if he had been a hindrance in the hunting her up  well the fellow thought proper to upset some arrangements my mother had made and then was more insolent than i should have thought even he could have been towards her  i suppose he had got into the habit with poor aunt alice  that made a fulcrum and my father went at my uncle with a will  i never saw my father so roused in my life  i dont mean by the behaviour to his wife but at what he knew of the fellow and all the harm he had done and is doing  and actually my uncle gave in at last and consented to tell gregorio to look out for another situation if he has not feathered his nest too well to need one as i believe he has  oh that will make it much easier for ursula cried annaple  if he goes put in her mother  i think he will  i really had no notion how much these two years have improved my uncle  to be sure it would be hard to live with such a woman as that without being the better for it  but he really seems to have acquired a certain notion of duty  they did not smile at the simple way in which mark spoke of this vast advance and lady ronnisglen said i hope so for the sake of his daughter and that poor little boy  i think that has something to do with it said mark  he feels a responsibility and still more i think he was struck by having a creature with him to whom evil was like physical pain  it will work said lady ronnisglen  then went on mark he took us all by surprise by making me this proposalto take the management of the estate and become a kind of private secretary to him  you know he gets rheumatism on the optic nerve and is almost blind at times  he would give me £300 a year and do up the house at the home farm rent free  what do you say to that annaple  there was a silence then annaple said give up the umbrellas  oh what do you think mark  my father wishes it said mark  he would as he had promised to do make over to me my share of my own mothers fortune and that would i have been reckoning bring us to just what we had thought of starting upon this spring at micklethwayte  the same now said lady ronnisglen after some reckoning but what does it lead to  wellnothing i am afraid said mark as you know this is all i have to reckon upon  the younger children will have hardly anything from their mother so that my fathers means must chiefly go to them  and this agency is entirely dependent on your satisfying mr egremont  true but thats a thing only too easily done  however as you say this agency has no future and if that came to an end i should only have to look out for another or take to farming  and ask poor john if that is a good speculation nowadays said annaple  fortunes are and have been made on the umbrellas said mark greenleaf has a place almost equal to monks horton and dutton though he makes no show has realised a considerable amount  oh yes let us stick to the umbrellas cried annaple youve made the plunge so it does not signify now and we should be so much more independent out of the way of everybody  you would lose in society said mark excepting of course as to the monks horton people but they are often away  begging your pardon mark is there much to lose in this same neighbourhood laughed annaple now may will go  it is not so much a question of liking added her mother as of what is for the best and where you may wish to besay ten years hence  looked at in this way there could be no question but that the umbrella company promised to make mark a richer man in ten years time than did the agency at bridgefield egremont  he had a salary from the office already and if he purchased shares in the partnership with the portion his father would resign to him his income would already equal what he would have at bridgefield and there was every prospect of its increase both as he became more valuable and as the business continued to prosper  if the descent in life had been a grievance to the ladies the agency would have been an infinite boon but having swallowed so much as annaple said they might as well do it in earnest and to some purpose  perhaps too it might be detected that under the circumstances annaple would prefer the living in a small way out of reach of her sisters visible compassion  so the matter was settled but there was an undercurrent in marks mind on which he had not entered namely that his presence at home might make all the difference in that reformation in his uncles habits which alice had inaugurated and left in the hands of others with him at hand there was much more chance of gregorios being dispensed with ursulas authority maintained little alwyn well brought up and the estate tenants and household properly cared for and then he smiled at his notion of supposing himself of so much importance  had he only had himself to consider mark would have thought his duty plain but when he found miss ruthven and her mother so entirely averse he did not deem it right to sacrifice them to the doubtful good of his uncle nor indeed to put the question before them as so much a matter of conscience that they should feel bound to consider it in that light he did indeed say well that settles it in a tone that led annaple to exclaim i do believe you want to drop the umbrellas  no he answered it is not that but my father wished it and thought it would be good for my uncle  no doubt said annaple but he has got a daughter also a son and a brother and agents are plentiful so i cant see why all the family should dance attendance on him  lady ronnisglen much misdoubting mr egremonts style of society and dreading that mark might be dragged into it added her word feeling on her side that it was desirable and just to hinder the family from sacrificing marks occupation and worldly interest to a capricious old roue who might very possibly throw him over when it would be almost impossible to find anything else to do  moreover both she and annaple believed that the real wish was to rescue the name of egremont from association with umbrellas and they held themselves bound to combat what they despised and thought a piece of worldly folly  so mark rode home more glad that the decision was actually made than at the course it had taken  his father was disappointed but could not but allow that it was the more prudent arrangement and mr egremont showed all the annoyance of a man whose good offer has been rejected  tis that little giggling scotch girl he said  well we are quit of her anyway  tis a pity that mark entangled himself with her and a motherinlaw into the bargain  i was a fool to expect to get any good out of him  this was said to his daughter with whom he was left alone for miss headworth could not bear to accept his hospitality a moment longer than needful and besides had been so much shaken in nerves as to suspect that an illness was coming on and hurried home to be nursed by mary nugent  canon egremont was obliged to go back to redcastle to finish his residence and his wife who had been absent nearly a month from her family thought it really wisest to let the father and daughter be thrown upon one another at once so that ursula might have the benefit of her fathers softened mood  there could be no doubt that he was softened and that he had derived some improvement from the year and a half that his wife had been with him  it might not have lifted him up a step but it had arrested him in his downward course  selfish and indolent he was as ever but there had been a restraint on his amusements and a withdrawal from his worst associates such as the state of his health might continue above all if gregorio could be dispensed with  the man himself had become aware of the combination against him and though reckoning on his masters inertness and dependence upon him knew that a fresh offence might complete his overthrow and therefore took care to be on his good behaviour  thus nutties task might be somewhat smoothed but the poor girl felt unspeakably desolate as she ate her breakfast all alone with a dull postbag and still more so when having seen the housekeeper who happily for her was a good and capable woman and very sorry for her she had to bethink herself what to do in that dreary sittingroom during the hour when she had always been most sure of her sistermothers dear company  how often she had grumbled at being called on to practise duets for her fathers evening lullaby  she supposed she ought to get something up and she proceeded to turn over and arrange the music with a sort of sick loathing for whatever was connected with those days of impatient murmurs which she would so gladly have recalled  everything had fallen into disorder as blanche and may had left it the last time they had played there and the overlooking it and putting aside the pieces which she could never use alone occupied her till gregorio very meek and polite came with a message that mr egremont would be glad if she would come to his room in some dread some distaste and yet some pity and some honest resolution she made her way thither  there he sat in dressinggown smokingcap and blue spectacles with the glittering february sunshine carefully excluded  he looked worse and more haggard than when she had seen him at dinner in the evening made up for company and her compassion increased especially as he not only held out his hand but seemed to expect her to kiss him a thing she had never done since their first recognition  it was not pleasant in itself but it betokened full forgiveness and indeed he had never spoken to her in his sneering exasperating voice since her mournful return home  have you seen the boy he asked  yes they are walking him up and down under the south wall said nuttie thankful that she had peeped under the many wraps as he was carried across the hall  here  i want you to read this letter to me  a man ought to be indicted for writing such a hand  it was really distinct penmanship though minute but as nuttie found her father did not like to avow how little available were his eyes  he could write better than he could read but he kept her over his correspondence for the rest of the morning answering some of the letters of condolence for him in her own name writing those of business and folding and addressing what he himself contrived to write  her native quickness stood her in good stead and being rather nervous she took great pains and seldom stumbled indeed she only once incurred an exclamation of impatience at her stupidity or slowness  she guessed rightly that this forbearance was owing to tender persuasions of her mother and did not guess that a certain fear of herself was mingled with other motives  her father had grown used to womans ministrations he needed them for his precious little heir and he knew his daughter moreover for a severe judge and did not want to alienate her and lose her services so they got on fairly well together and she shared his luncheon during which a message came up about the carriage and as there had been an application for some nursery needment and moreover blackedged envelopes had run short there was just purpose enough for a drive to the little town  then nuttie read her father to sleep with the newspaper rushed round the garden in the twilight to stretch her young limbs tried to read a little dressed dined with her father finished what he had missed in the paper then offered him music and was told if she pleased and as she played she mused whether this was to be her life  it looked very dull and desolate and what was the good of it all  but there were her mothers words love him  how fulfil them  she could pity him now but oh how could she love one from whom her whole nature recoiled when she thought of her mothers ruined life mr dutton too had held her new duties up to her as capable of being ennobled  noble to read aloud a sporting paper she did not want to understand to be ready to play at cards or billiards to take that dawdling drive day by day to devote herself to the selfish exactions of burntout dissipation  was this noble  her mother had done all this and never even felt it a cross because of her great love  it must be nutties cross if it was her duty but could the love and honour possibly come though she tried to pray in faith     chapter xxv  the giggling scotch girl    for every lamp that trembled here   and faded in the night   behold a star serene and clear   smiles on me from the heightb m   nuttie was not mistaken in supposing that this first day would be a fair sample of her life though of course after the first weeks of mourning there were variations and the return of the rectory party made a good deal of brightening and relieved her from the necessity of finding companionship and conversation for her father on more than half her afternoons and evenings  he required her however almost every forenoon and depended on her increasingly so that all her arrangements had to be made with reference to him  it was bondage but not as galling in the fact as she would have expected if it had been predicted to her a few months previously  in the first place mr egremont never demanded of her what was actually against her conscience except occasionally giving up a sunday evensong to read the paper to him and that only when he was more unwell than usual  he was after all an english gentleman and did not ask his young daughter to read to him the books which her mother had loathed  moreover gregorio was on his good behaviour perfectly aware that there was a family combination against him and having even received a sort of warning from his master but by no means intending to take it and therefore abstaining from any kind of offence that could furnish a fresh handle against him and thus for the present dr hammonds regimen was well observed and mr egremont was his better self in consequence for under his wifes guardianship the perilous habit had sufficiently lost strength to prevent temper and spirits from manifestly suffering from abstinence  the first time nuttie found herself obliged to make any very real sacrifice to her fathers will was on the occasion of marks marriage at easter  things had arranged themselves very conveniently for him at micklethwayte though it seemed to nuttie that she only heard of affairs there in a sort of distant dream while such events were taking place as once would have been to her the greatest possible revolutions  aunt ursel reached home safely but her expectations of illness were realised  she took to her bed on arriving and though she rose from it there was reason to think she had had a slight stroke for her activity of mind and body were greatly decayed and she was wholly dependent on mary nugent for care and comfort  mary remembering the consequences of the former alarm made the best of the old ladys condition and nuttie ashamed of having once cried wolf did not realise the true state of the case nor indeed could she or would she have been spared to go to micklethwayte  the next news told that gerard godfrey at the end of the year required by mr dutton had resigned his situation and at the close of his quarters notice was going to prepare for holy orders under the training of a clergyman who would employ him in his parish and assist him in reading up to the requirements for admission to a theological college  poor dear old gerard  it gave nuttie a sort of pang of selfreproach to own how good and devoted he was and yet so narrow and stupid that she could never have been happy with him  was he too good or was he too dull for her  had she forsaken him for the worlds sake or was it a sound instinct that had extinguished her fancy for him  no one could tell least of all the parties concerned  he might be far above her in spiritual matters but he was below her in intellectual ones and though they would always feel for one another that peculiar tenderness left by the possibilities of a first love no doubt the quarrel over the blue ribbon had been no real misfortune to either  the next tidings were still more surprising  mr dutton was leaving the firm  though his father had died insolvent and he had had to struggle for himself in early life he was connected with wealthy people and change and death among these had brought him a fair share of riches  an uncle who had emigrated to australia at the time of the great break up had died without other heirs leaving him what was the more welcome to him that micklethwayte could never be to him what it had been in its golden age  he had realised enough to enable him to be bountiful and his parting gift to st ambroses would complete the church but he himself was winding up the partnership and withdrawing his means from greenleaf and co in order to go out to australia to decide what to do with his new possessions  mark egremont purchased a number of the shares though to gratify the family the shelter of the greenleaf veiled his name under the co and another already in the firm possessed of a businesslike appellation gave designation to the firm as greenleaf goodenough and co  mr duttons wellkept house with the little conservatory and the magnolia was judged sufficient for present needs and the lease was taken off his hands so that all was in order for the marriage of mark and annaple immediately after easter  lady delmar had resigned herself to the inevitable and the wedding was to take place at lescombe  nuttie whose chief relaxation was in hearing all the pros and cons from may and blanche was asked to be one of the bridesmaids by annaple who had come over to the rectory in a droll inscrutable state of mischief declaring that she had exasperated janet to the verge of insanity by declaring that she should have little umbrellas like those in the persian inscriptions on her cards and that mark was to present all the bridesmaids with neat parasols  if crinolines had not been gone out they could have all been dressed appropriately  now they must wear them closely furled  all this banter was hardly liked by may and blanche whose little sisters were laughed at again for needing the assurance that they were really to wear white and rowan leaves and berriesthe ronnisglen badge  nuttie who had drawn much nearer to may refrained from relating this part of the story at home but was much disappointed when on telling her father of the request she was answered at once  hein  the 24th  youll be in london and a very good thing too  are we to go so soon  yes  didnt i tell you to take that house in berkshire road from the 20th  i did not think we were to start so soon  is there any particular reason  yes  that scotch girl ought to have known better than to ask you in your deep mourning  i thought women made a great point of such things  aunt jane did not seem to think it wrong said nuttie for she really wished much for consent  not only had she grown fond both of mark and annaple but she had never been a bridesmaid and she knew that not only the kirkaldys but mr dutton had been invited she had even ventured on offering to lodge some of the overflowing guests of the rectory  their heads are all turned by that povertystricken scotch peerage returned mr egremont or the canoness should have more sense of respect  nutties wishes were so strong that she made one more attempt i need not be a bridesmaid  they would not mind if i wore my black  i should then said her father curtly  if they dont understand the proprieties of life i do  i wont have you have anything to do with it  if you are so set upon gaiety youll have enough of weddings at fitter times  it was the old sneering tone  nuttie felt partly confounded partly indignant and terribly disappointed  she did care for the sight of the weddingher youthful spirits had rallied enough for that but far more now she grieved at missing the sight of mr dutton when he was going away she knew not where and might perhaps come on purpose to see her and it also made her sore and grieved at being accused of disregard to her mother  she was silenced however and presently her father observed in the same unpleasant tone well if youve digested your disappointment perhaps youll condescend to write to the agent that i expect the house to be ready on the 21st  nuttie got through her mornings work she hardly knew how though her father was dry and faultfinding all the time  her eyes were so full of tears when she was released that she hardly saw where she was going and nearly ran against her aunt who had just walked into the hall mrs egremont was too prudent a woman to let her burst out there with her grievance but made her come into the tentroom before she exclaimed he is going to take me away to london he wont let me go to the wedding  i am sorry for your disappointment said her aunt quietly but i am oldfashioned enough to be glad that such strong respect and feeling should be shown for your dear mother  i wish annaple had spoken to me before asking you and i would have felt the way  im sure it is not want of feeling said nuttie as her tears broke forth  i did not say it was returned her aunt but different generations have different notions of the mode of showing it and the present certainly errs on the side of neglect of such tokens of mourning  if i did not think that annaple and her mother are really uncomfortable at lescombe i should have told mark that it was better taste to wait till the summer  if i might only have stayed at homeeven if i did not go to the wedding sighed nuttie who had only half listened to the canonesss wisdom  since you do not go it is much better that you should be out of the way said mrs egremont  is your father ready to see me  so nuttie had to submit though she pouted to herself feeling grievously misjudged first as if she had been wanting in regard to the memory of her mother who had been so fond of mark and so rejoiced in his happiness and then that her vexation was treated as mere love of gaiety whereas it really was disappointment at not seeing mr dutton that good grave precise old friend who could not be named in the same breath with vanity  moreover she could not help suspecting that respect to her mother was after all only a cloak to resentment against mark and his marriage  however she bethought herself that her mother had often been disappointed and had borne it cheerfully and after having done what aunt ursel would have called grizzling in her room for an hour she wrote her note to miss ruthven and endeavoured to be as usual feeling keenly that there was no mother now to perceive and gratefully commend one of her only too rare efforts for good humour on other grounds she was very sorry to leave bridgefield  may had in her trouble thawed to her and they were becoming really affectionate and intimate companions by force of propinquity and relationship as well as of the views that may had imbibed from hugh condamine  moreover nuttie felt her aunts watch over the baby a great assistance to her own ignorance  however the canoness had resigned to the poor little heir the perfect and trustworthy nurse whom basil had outgrown and who consented to the transfer on condition of having her nursery establishment entirely apart from the rest of the household  her reasons were known though unspoken namely that the rejection of one or two valets highly recommended had made it plain that there had been no dislodgment of gregorio  the strong silent objection to him of all good female servants was one of the points that told much against him  martin and the housekeeper just endured him and stayed on for the present chiefly because their dear lady had actually begged them not to desert her daughter if they could help it at least not at first  nuttie bound over her cousins to give her a full account of the wedding and both of them wrote to her  blanches letter recorded sundry scattered particularsas to how well the rowantrimmed tulle dresses lookedhow every one was packed into the carriages for the long drivehow there had been a triumphal arch erected over the bluepost bridge itself and annaple nearly choked with laughing at the appropriatenesshow to her delight a shower began and the procession out of the church actually cried out for umbrellashow papa when performing the ceremony could not recollect that the brides proper name was annabella and would dictate it as annamaria sir john correcting him each time sotto vocehow basil and little hilda delmar walked together and looked like a couple of ducks which it was to be hoped was to be taken metaphoricallyhow dreadfully hard the ice on the weddingcake was so that when annaple tried to cut it the knife slipped and a little white dove flew away and hit may which everyone said was a grand omen that she would be the next bride while of course annaple was perfectly helpless with mirth every one said it was the merriest wedding ever seen for the brides only tears were those of laughter  what nuttie really cared for most came just at the end and not much of that your mr dutton is just gone  he got on famously with hugh condamine and i forgot to tell you that he has given mark such a jolly present a lovely silver coffeepot just the one thing they wanted and lady delmar said he didnt look near so like a tradesman as she expected  i see may is writing too but i dont know what you will get out of her as hugh condamine came for the day  nuttie however had more hopes from may  her letter certainly was fuller of interest if shorter   my dear nuttieblanche has no doubt told you all the externals  i suppose there never was a brighter wedding for as annaple keeps her mother with her there was no real rending asunder of ties  indeed i almost wish her excitement did not always show itself in laughing for it prevents people from understanding how much there is in her   plainly hugh condamine had been rather scandalised by the giggling scotch girl   dear old lady ronnisglen was delightful  if there were any tears they were hers and lady delmar was very cordial and affectionate of course hugh and mr dutton missed much that one would have liked in a wedding  i drove back with them afterwards and it was very interesting to listen to their conversation about church matters hugh is very much struck with your friend he had heard a good deal about micklethwayte before and says that such a lay worker is perfectly invaluable  it is a great pity that he is not going on in the firm it would make it so much nicer for mark but he says he has duties towards his new property  i think he was sorry not to find you at home but he plainly never thought it possible you should be at the wedding  i dont know whether i ought to tell you this but i think you ought to know it  there is a lovely new wreath of eucharis lilies and maidenhair at dear aunt alices grave close against the rails at the feet and hugh told me that he looked out of his window very early yesterday morning and saw mr dutton standing there leaning on the rail with his bare head bowed between his hands  you cant think how it impressed hugh  he said he felt reverent towards him all through that day and he was quite angry with rosalind and adela for jesting because when the shower began as we were coming out of church mr dutton rushed up with an umbrella being the only person there who had one i believe  hugh says you may be proud of such a friend  i wish you could have seen hughyour affectionate cousin                                               margaret egremont     chapter xxvi  three years later    theres something rotten in the statehamlet   on an eastwindy afternoon in march mary nugent emerged from the school of art her wellworn portfolio under her arm thinking how many successive generations of boys and girls she had drilled through freehand perspective and even life with an unvarying average of failure and very moderate success and how little talent or originality had come to the front though all might be the better for knowing how to use eyes and fingers  on the whole her interest as well as her diligence did not flag but a sense of weariness and monotony would sometimes come after a recurrence of wellknown blunders of her pupils and she missed the sense of going home to refreshment and enjoyment which had once invigorated her  st ambroses road had had its golden age but the brightness had been dimmed ever since that festival at monks horton one after another of the happy old society had dropped away  the vicar had received promotion and she only remained of the former intimates excepting old miss headworth who was no longer a companion but whom affection forbade her to desert in feeble old age  had her thoughts of the old times conjured up a figure belonging to them  there was the wellbrushed hat the natty silk umbrella the perfect fit of garments the precise turnout nay the curly lionshaven poodle with all his fringes leaping on her in recognition and there was that slightly french flourish of the hat beforewith a bounding heartshe met the hand in an english grasp  miss nugent  mr dutton  i thought i should meet you here  when did you come  half an hour ago  i came down with george greenleaf left my things at the royal hotel and came on to look for you  you will come and spend the evening with us  if you are so good as to ask me  how is miss headworth  very feeble very deaf but she will be delighted to see you  there is no fear of her not remembering you though she was quite lost when mrs egremont came in yesterday  mrs egremont he repeated with a little start  mrs mark  ah we have got used to the namethe honourable mrs egremont as the community insist on calling her  what a sunny creature she is  and miss egremont what do you hear of her  she writes long letters poor child  i hope she is fairly happy are you come home for good or is this only a visit  i have no intention of returning  i have been winding up my good cousins affairs at melbourne  marys heart bounded again with a sense of joy comfort and protection but she did not long keep mr dutton to herself for every third person they met gladly greeted him and they were long in getting to st ambroses road now dominated by a tall and beautiful spire according to the original design  they turned and looked in at the pillared aisles stained glass and handsome reredos  very different from our struggling days said mr dutton  yes said mary with half a sigh  theres the new vicar as he passed with a civil nod  he has three curates and a house of sisters and works the parish excellently  you dont speak as if you were intimate  no  his womankind are rather grandquite out of our beat and in parish work i am only an estimable excrescence  it is very well that i am not wanted for miss headworth requires a good deal of attention and it is only the old adam that regrets the days of importance  ah do you see  they were passing mr duttons old home  on the tiny strip of lawn in front was a slender black figure with yellow hair under a tiny black hat dragging about a wooden horse whereon was mounted a sturdy boy of two also yellowlocked and in deep mourning under his holland blouse  billyboy is riding to meet his daddy was merrily called out both by mother and son before they perceived the stranger  mr dutton said mary  annaple bowed but did not put out her hand and such a flush was on her face that miss nugent said i am sure that is too much for you  oh no she began but allow me said mr dutton and before she could refuse he was galloping round and round the little lawn the boy screaming with delight as monsieur raced with them  so he is come she said in a low doubtful voice to mary  yes  he has met mr greenleaf in london  i always think he has the contrary to the evil eye  whatever he takes in hand rights itself  ill hope so  oh thank you  billyboy say thank you  what a ride you have had  why are they in such deep mourning asked mr dutton after they had parted  oh did you not know for good old lady ronnisglen  she had a bad fall about two years ago and never left her bed again and this last autumn she sank away  they have had a great deal of trouble then  i saw the death of canon egremont in the times soon after i went out to australia  yes he had heart disease and died quite suddenly  the living is given to mr condamine who married the eldest daughter and the widow is gone to live under the shadow of redcastle cathedral  therewith miss nugent opened her own door and miss headworth was soon made aware of the visitor  she was greatly changed and had the indescribable stony look that tells of paralysis and though she knew mr dutton and was delighted to see him his presence made her expect to see alice and nuttie come in though she soon recollected herself and shed a few helpless tears  thenin another moodshe began to display with pride and pleasure the photographs of alices dear little boy  she had a whole series of them from the longclothed babe on his sisters knee to the bright little fellow holding a druma very beautiful child with a striking resemblance to his mother quite startling to mr dutton especially in the last which was coloured and showed the likeness of eyes and expression  nuttie always sends me one whenever he is taken said the old lady dear nuttie  it is very good for her  she is quite a little mother to him  i was sure it would be so said mr dutton  yes said mary he is the great interest and delight of her life her letters are full of his little sayings and doings  is she at home now  no at brighton  her father seems to have taken a dislike to bridgefield since his brothers death and only goes there for a short time in the shooting season  he has taken a lease of a house in london and spends most of the year there  ah as she showed him the address that is near the old house where i used to stay with my grandaunt  we thought it altogether in the country then but it is quite absorbed now and i have dazzling offers from building companies for the few acres of ground around it have you seen her  oh no i believe she is quite necessary to her father  i only hear of her through lady kirkaldy who has been very kind to her but i am sorry to say is now gone with her lord to the east  she says she thinks that responsibility has been very good for nuttie she is gentler and less impetuous and a good deal softened by her affection for the child  she was certain to develop  i only dreaded what society her father might surround her with  lady kirkaldy says that all has turned out better than could have been expected  you see as she says mr egremont has been used to good women in his own family and would not like to see her in a slangy fast set  all her own gaieties have been under lady kirkaldys wing or that of mrs william egremonts relations and only in a quiet moderate way  her father gets his own old set about him and they have not been very choice but they are mostly elderly men and gentlemen and know how to behave themselves to her indeed her cousin blanche who was here in the winter gave us to understand that ursula knows how to take care of herself and gets laughed at as rather an old maidish model of propriety if you can believe it of your little nuttie  i could quite believe in her on the defensive unprotected as she is  what did that young ladymiss blanchetell us about that gentleman mary asked miss headworth hearing and uttering what miss nugent hoped had passed unnoticed  oh i think that was all gossip returned mary and so i am sure did the mark egremonts  she said there was one of mr egremonts friends mr clarence fane i think she called him rather younger than the others who she was pleased to say seemed smitten with nuttie but i have heard nothing more about it and mrs mark scouted the idea she added in haste as she saw his expression vary in spite of himself  do you see much of your neighbours  we are both too busy to see much of one another but we have our little talks over the wall  what a buoyant creature she is  it seems as if playfulness was really a sustaining power in her helping her to get diversion out of much that others might stumble at  you know perhaps that when she arrived the workpeople had got up a beautiful parasol for her white with a deep fringe and spray of rowan  little susie gunner presented her with it and she was very gracious and nice about it  but then what must mr goodenough do but dub it the annabella sunshade and blazon it considerably vulgarised in all the railway stations and magazines  i know  i had the misfortune to see it in the station at melbourne and my mind misgave me from that hour  her husband was prepared to be very angry but she fairly laughed him out of it made all sorts of fun out of the affair declared it her only opening to fame and turned it into a regular joke so that indeed the greenleafs who were vexed at the matter and tried to apologise were quite perplexed in their turn and not at all sure that the whole concern was not being turned into ridicule  i wonder it did not make him cut the connection said mr dutton muttering i only wish it had  mrs greenleaf is very funny about her added mary proud of the honourable mrs egremont as they insist on calling her yet not quite pleased that she should be the junior partners wife and decidedly resenting her hardly going into society at all though i really dont see how she could for first there was the canons death and then just after the boy was born came lady ronnisglens accident and for the next year and a half there was constant attendance on her  they fitted up a room on the ground floor for her the one opening into your drawingroom and there they used to sit with her  i used to hear them reading to her and singing to her and they were always as merry as possible till last autumn when something brought on erysipelas and she was gone almost before they took alarm  the good little daughter was beaten down then really ill for a week but if you can understand me the shock seemed to tell on her chiefly bodily and though she was half brokenhearted when her husband in a great fright brought me up to see her and say whether her sister should be sent for she still made fun of him and described the impossible advice they would bring on themselves  i had to take care of her while he went away to the funeral in scotland and then i learnt indeed to like her and see how much there is in her besides laughter  did the old lady leave them anything  i believe she had nothing to leave  her jointure was not much but i am sure they miss that for mrs egremont has parted with her nurse and has only a little girl in her stead driving out the perambulator often herself to the great scandal of the greenleafs though she would have one believe it is all for want of occupation  do you think they have taken any alarm  theres no judging from her joyous surface but i have thought him looking more careworn and anxious than i liked  mr dutton dont answer if i ought not to ask but is it true that things are going wrong  i know you have been seeing mr greenleaf so perhaps you are in his confidence and cannot speak  tell me what is known or suspected  just this that mr goodenough has been the ruin of the concern  he has been quite different ever since his voyage to america  you were gone old mr greenleaf has been past attending to business ever since he had that attack and george greenleaf has been playing the country squire at horton bishop and not looking after the office work and mr egremont was inexperienced  one could see of course that the whole character of the business was changedmuch more advertising much more cheap and flashy workto be even with the times it was said but the old superior hands were in despair at the materials supplied to them and the scamped work expected  you should have heard old thorpe mourning for you and moralising over the wickedness of this world his wife told me she really thought he would go melancholy mad if he did not leave the factory and he has done so  they have saved enough to set up a nice little shop at monks horton  i must go and see them  good old thorpe  i ought never to have put those poor young things into the firm when i ceased to have any control over it  i shall never forgive myself  nothing could seem safer then  no one could have guessed that young mr greenleaf would be so careless without his father to keep him up to the mark nor that mr goodenough should alter so much  is it very bad  is there worse behind  speculation i suppose  of course  i do not see to the bottom of it yet poor george seemed to reckon on me for an advance but i am afraid this is more than a mere temporary depression such as may be tided over and that all that can be looked to is trying to save honourable names by an utter break up which may rid them of thatthatno i wont call him a scoundrel i thought highly of him once and no doubt he never realised what he was doing  before the evening was far advanced mark egremont knocked at the door and courteously asked whether mr dutton could be spared to him for a little while  mary nugent replied that she was just going to help miss headworth to bed and that the parlour was at their service for a private interview but mark answered my wife is anxious to hear  she knows all that i do and is quite prepared to hear whatever mr dutton may not object to saying before her  so they bade goodnight to mary and went on together to the next house mr dutton saying you have much to forgive me mr egremont i feel as if i had deserted the ship just as i had induced you to embark in it  you did not guess how ill it would be steered without you returned mark with a sigh  do not fear to speak out before my wife even if we are sinking  she will hear it bravely and smile to the last  the room which mr dutton entered was not like the cabin of a sinking ship nor as in his own time like the wellordered apartment of a bachelor of taste  indeed the house was a great puzzle to monsieur who entered by invitation knowing his way perfectly thinking himself at home after all his travels and then missing his own particular mat and sniffing round at the furniture  it was of the modified aesthetic date but arranged more with a view to comfort than anything else and by the light of the shaded lamp and bright fire was preeminently homelike with the three chairs placed round the hearth and brighthaired annaple rising up from the lowest with her knitting to greet mr dutton and find a comfortable lair for monsieur  miss nugent says that you set everything right that you do but look at mr dutton she said so we are prepared to receive you as a good genius to help us out of our tangle  mr dutton was afraid that the tangle was far past unwinding and of course the details so far as yet known were discussed  there was in truth nothing for which mark could be blamed  he had diligently attended to his officework which was mere routine and conscious of his own inexperience and trusting to the senior partners he had only become anxious at the end of the year when he perceived goodenoughs avoidance of a settlement of accounts and detected shuffling  he had not understood enough of the previous business to be aware of the deterioration of the manner of dealing with it though he did think it scarcely what he expected  if he had erred it was in acting too much as a wheel in the machinery keeping his thoughts and heart in his own happy little home and not throwing himself into the spirit of the business or the ways of those concerned in it so that he had been in no degree a controlling power  he had allowed his quality of gentleman to keep him an outsider instead of using it to raise the general level of the transactions so that the whole had gone down in the hands of the unscrupulous goodenough  annaple listened and knitted quietly while the affairs were explained on either hand  mark had had one serious talk with george greenleaf and both had had a stormy scene with goodenough  then mr dutton had telegraphed his arrival and greenleaf had met him in london with hopes bred of long and implicit trust that his sagacity and perhaps his wealth would carry the old house through the crisis  but mr dutton though reserving his judgment till the books should have been thoroughly examined and the liabilities completely understood was evidently inclined to believe that things had gone too far and that the names of greenleaf and egremont could only be preserved from actual dishonour by going into liquidation dissolving partnership and thus getting quit of goodenough  mark listened resignedly annaple with an intelligence that made mr dutton think her the more clearheaded of the two though still she could not refrain from her little jokes  im sure i should not mind how liquid we became if we could only run off clear of goodenough she said  you know what it means said her husband  oh yes i know what it means  it is the fine word for being sold up well mark never mind we are young and strong and it will not be a bit the worse for the billyboy in the end to begin at the bottom of everything  i hopemay i askis everything embarked in the poor old firm said mr dutton with some hesitation  all that is mine said mark with his elbow on the table and his chin on his hand  but ive got a hundred a year charged on poor old ronnisglens estate said annaple  all the others gave theirs up when they married and i wanted to do so but my dear mother would not let me she said i had better try how i got on first  think of that mark a hundred a year  why old gunner or thorpe would think themselves rolling in riches if they only heard that they had a hundred a year  you wont find it go far  yes i shall for i shall make you live on porridge with now and then a sheeps head for a treat  besides there will be something to do it will be working up again you know  but seriously mr dutton i have some things here of my dear mothers that really belong to ronnisglen and i was only keeping till he comes home should not they be got out of the way  my dear we are not come to that yet  i hope it may be averted cried mark  but mr dutton agreed with the young wife that it would be much better to send these things away before their going could excite suspicion there was only a tiny silver saucepan valued as a gift of queen clementina to an ancestress also a silver teapot and some old point and some not very valuable jewellery all well able to go into a small box which mr dutton undertook to deposit with lord ronnisglens bankers  he was struck with the scrupulous veracity with which annaple decided between what had become her own property and the heirlooms though what she claimed might probably be sacrificed to the creditors  mark could hardly endure to see what made the crisis so terribly real that i should have brought you to this he said to his wife when their visitor had at length bidden them goodnight  if we begin at that work said annaple it was i who brought you i have often thought since it was rather selfish not to have consented to your helping poor ursula with her heavy handful of a father  it was all money grubbing and grabbing you see and if we had thought more of our neighbour than ourselves we might have been luxuriating at the home farm or even if your uncle had quarrelled with you he would not have devoured your substance  i have thought so often ever since i began to see this coming  my dear child you dont mean that you have seen this coming  my prophetic soul  why mark you have as good as inferred it over and over again  ive felt like scratching that badenough whenever i met him in the street  i must indulge myself by calling him so for once in strict privacy  you have guessed it all the time while i only thought how unconscious you were  not to say stupid considering all you told me  besides what would have been the use of howling and moaning and being dismal before the time  for my part i could clap my hands even now at getting rid of goodenough and his jaunty gracious air  come mark it wont be so bad after all youll see  nothing can be so bad while you are what you are my nan  thats right  while we have each other and the billyboy nothing matters much  theres plenty of work in us both and that good man will find it for us or if he doesnt well get a yellow van and knit stockings and sell them round the country  how jolly that would be imagine janets face  there thats right as her mimicry evoked a smile i should be ashamed to be unhappy about this when our good name is saved and when there is a blessing on the poor she added in a lower voice tenderly kissing her husbands weary brow     chapter xxvii  the boy of egremont    and the boy that walked beside me   he could not understand   why closer in mine ah closer   i pressd his warm soft handlongfellow   the agony of a firm like greenleaf goodenough and co could not be a rapid thing and mr dutton lived between london and micklethwayte for several weeks having much to endure on all sides  the senior partners thought it an almost malicious and decidedly ungrateful thing in him not to throw in his means or at any rate offer his guarantee to tide them over their difficulties  goodenoughs tergiversations and concealments needed a practised hand and acute head to unravel them and often deceived mr greenleaf himself and when for a time he was convinced that the whole state was so rotten that a crash was inevitable his wifes lamentations and complaints of mr dutton would undo the whole and it was as if he were doing them an injury that the pair accepted the comfortable prospect he was able to offer them in australia  he would have made the like proposal to the egremonts but found that mark held himself bound by his promise to his father not to emigrate and thought of some kind of officework  before trying to procure this for him however mr dutton intended to see his uncle and try whether the agency once rejected could still be obtained for him learning from miss nugent that the egremonts were in town he went up thither with the purpose of asking for an interview  there was a new church in the immediate neighbourhood of his house in a state of growth and development congenial to the st ambrose trained mind and here mr dutton after old micklethwayte custom was attending the early matins when in the alternate verses of the psalm he heard a fresh young voice that seemed to renew those days gone by and looking across the central aisle his eyes met a pair of dark ones which gave a sudden glitter of gladness at the encounter that was all he saw or cared to see  he did not take in the finished completeness of the very plain dark dress and hat nor the womanly air of the little figure until they clasped hands in the porch and in the old tones nuttie exclaimed  ive been hoping you would come to london  how is monsieur  in high health thank you the darling of the steamer both going and coming  i hope your charges are well  my father is tolerable just as usual and my little alwyn is getting more delicious every day  he will be so delighted to see monsieur  i have told him so many stories about him  do you think i may call on mr egremont  oh do  he is ready to be called on between two and three and we always have wynnie downstairs then so that you will see him too and you have been at micklethwayte  i am afraid you found a great change in aunt ursel  yes but she is very peaceful and happy  and i have to leave her altogether to dear excellent miss nugent it seems very very wrong but i cannot help it  and how about mark and annaple  i think she is the bravest woman i ever met  then things are really going badly with the dear old firm  i am hoping to talk to mr egremont about it  ah  nuttie paused  towards mr dutton she always had a stronger impulse of confidence than towards any one else she had ever met but she felt that he might think it unbecoming to say that she had perceived a certain dislike on her fathers part towards mark ever since the rejection of the agency and the marriage which perhaps was regarded as a rejection of herself  he had a habit of dependence on mark which resulted in personal liking when in actual contact but in absence the distaste and offence always revived fostered no doubt by gregorio and canon egremonts death had broken the link which had brought them together  however for his brothers sake and for the sake of the name the head of the family might be willing to do something  it was one of nutties difficulties that she never could calculate on the way her father would take any matter  whether for better or for worse he always seemed to decide in diametrical opposition to her expectation and as she was certainly less impetuous and more dutiful she parted with mr dutton at her own door without any such hint  these three years had been discipline such as the tenderest wisest hand could not have given her though it had been insensible  she had been obliged to attend to her father and watch over her little brother and though neither task had seemed congenial to her disposition the honest endeavour to do them rightly had produced the affection born of solicitude towards her father and the strong warm tenderness of the true mothersister towards little alwyn  ursula egremont was one of those natures to which responsibility is the best training  if she had had any one to guard or restrain her she might have gone to the utmost limits before she yielded to the curb as it was she had to take care of herself to bear and forbear with her father to walk warily with her household and to be very guarded with the society into which she was thrown from time to time  it was no sudden change but one brought about by experience an outbreak of impatience or temper towards her father was sure to be followed by his galling sneer or by some mortification to her desires any act of mismanagement towards the servants brought its own punishment and if she was tempted by girlish spirits to relax the quiet stiff courtesy which she observed towards her fathers guests there followed jests or semipatronage or a tone of conversation that offended her and made her repent it  happily mr egremont did not wish her to be otherwise  one day when she had been betrayed into rattling and giggling he spoke to her afterwards with a cutting irony which bitterly angered her at the moment and which she never forgot  each irksome duty each privation each disappointment each recurrence of the sweeping sense of desolation and loneliness had had one effectit had sent her to her knees  she had no one else to go to  she turned to her father in heaven sometimes indeed it was in murmuring and complaint at her lot but still it was to him and him alone and repentance sooner or later came to aid her while refreshments sprang up around herlittle successes small achievements pleasant hours tokens that her father was pleased or satisfied and above all the growing charms of little alwyn  the special grievance gregorios influence had scarcely dwelt on her at first as it had done on her mother  the man had been very cautious for some time knowing that his continuance in his situation was in the utmost jeopardy and mr egremont had in the freshness of his grief for his wife abstained from relapsing into the habits from which she had weaned him  when however the canon was dead and his son at a distance gregorio began to feel more secure and in the restless sorrow of his master over the blow that had taken away an only brother he administered soothing drugs under another name so that ursula in her inexperience did not detect what was going on and still fancied that the habit had been renounced  all she did know was that it was entirely useless for her to attempt to exert any authority over the valet and that the only way to escape insolently polite disobedience was to let him alone  moreover plans to which her father had agreed when broached by her had often been overthrown after his valet had been with him  it was a life full of care and disappointment yet there was a certain spring of trust that kept ursulas youth from being dimmed and enabled her to get a fair share of happiness out of it though she was very sorry not to be more at bridgefield where she could have worked with all her heart with may condamine  moreover lady kirkaldys absence from london was a great loss to her for there was no one who was so kind or so available in taking her into society and nuttie though mistress of her fathers house was not yet twentytwo and strongly felt that she must keep within careful bounds and not attempt to be her own chaperon  but the very sight of her old friend and the knowledge that he was in the neighbourhood filled her heart with gladness and seemed like a compensation for everything  mr egremont was in a gracious mood and readily consented to see mr duttonthe friend who had been so pleasant and helpful at parisand nuttie gave her private instructions to the footman to insure his admittance  his card was brought in just as the father and daughter were finishing luncheon and he was received in mr egremonts sittingroom where the first civilities had hardly passed before the door was opened and in trotted the goldenhaired boy so beautiful a child that it would have been impossible not to look at him with delight even for those to whom his dark eyes and sweet smile did not recall those that had once been so dear  mr egremonts voice took a fresh tone ah here he comes the old fellowand he held out his hands but the boy was intent on his own purpose  wheres black doggie he asked in a silverbell of a little voice but lisping a good deal wyn got penny for him  wynnie must be a good boy  kiss papa first and mr dutton remonstrated the sister and alwyn obeyed so far as to submit to his fathers embrace and then raising those velvety eyes to the visitors face he repeated where black doggie  wyn want to see him buy bun  there your fame has preceded you said mr egremont or rather your dogs  you shall see him said mr dutton taking the pretty boy almost reverently on his knee but he is at home now  i could not leave him out on the street and i did not know if i might bring him in  oh mr dutton as if monsieur would not be welcome cried the nuttie of old times  i only wish i had stipulated for him dear old fellow  wyn want to see him reiterated the child  may i take him to see the performance said mr dutton  i live only at the corner of berkshire road and theres a dairy just opposite where monsieur has been allowed to keep up his accomplishment  alwyns legs arms and voice were all excitement and entreaty and mr egremont himself proposed that they should all come and witness the feat so nuttie in great glee climbed the stairs with her little brother to get ready and when she came down again found the gentlemen deep not in mark egremonts umbrellas but in the gas and smoke grievances which had arisen since the lease of the house had been taken and in which sympathy might be expected from a fellowinhabitant of the district  little alwyn was however plainly the lord of the ascendant and unused to see anything else attended to in his presence he took possession of mr duttons hand and his tongue went fast nor did his father or sister seem to desire any better music  they reached an oldwalled garden with lilac and laburnum and horsechestnut blossoming above and showing a mass of greenery through the iron railing that surmounted the low wall on the street side where mr dutton halted and took out his key  is this yours exclaimed nuttie i have so often wondered whose it could be  yes it was a countryhouse when i was of the age of this little man though you might not think it  the increase of london had not been on that side said mr egremont this must be a very valuable property  and nuttie perceived that such an inheritance made mr dutton much more in his eyes than an exumbrellamonger but no sooner was the tall iron gate opened than monsieur beautifully shaved with all his curly tufts in perfection came bounding to meet his master and alwyn had his arms round the neck in a moment  monsieur had in his time been introduced to too many children not to understand the situation and respond politely and he also recognised ursula and gave unmistakable proofs of being glad to see her  then the halfpenny was presented to him  he wagged his queer tail smiled with his intelligent brown eyes took it between his teeth and trotted across the street in the most businesslike way the others following but detaining the boy from keeping too close they found the creature sitting upright tapping the floor with his tail the centre of rapturous admiration to all the customers already in the dairy shop he received his bun and demurely dropping on his front legs walked back with it to his master and crossed the road with it uneaten rather to alwyns disappointment but mr dutton said he would probably dispose of it in some hidingplace in the garden until his evening appetite came on  it was well he was a dog of moderation for there was great temptation to repeat the entertainment more than was wholesome for him  there wynnie said nuttie in a voice of monition monsieur doesnt eat all his goodies at once he keeps them for bedtime  it might be perceived that the oversupply of sweets was a matter of anxiety to the elder sister  to the nurse who waited in readiness alwyn was consigned for his walk while his father and sister accepted mr duttons invitation to look round his domain  it would have been small in the country but it was extensive for the locality and there was a perfect order and trimness about the shaven lawn the little fountain in the midst the flowerbeds gay with pansies forgetmenots and other early beauties and the freshlyrolled gravel paths that made nuttie exclaim ah i should have known this for yours anywhere  i have not had much to do to it he said  my old aunts had it well kept up even when they could only see it from their windows their old gardener still lives in the cottage behind the toolhouse though he is too infirm for anything but being wheeled about in the sun in their bathchair  you keep a large amount lying idle by retaining it as it is said mr egremont  true but it is well to preserve an oasis here and there  nuttie knew well that it was not for himself alone and as they entered the little conservatory and her eye fell on the row of white hyacinths the very scent carried her back to the old times and her eyes grew moist while mr dutton was cutting a bouquet for her in accordance with wellknown tastes  i shall put them in my room  it will feel like home she said and then she saw that she had said what her father did not like for he was always sensitive as to any reference to her early life  mr dutton however took this opportunity of saying that he had been backwards and forwards to micklethwayte several times this spring  i hope you are well out of the concern there said mr egremont  thank you sir i have no share in it at present  so much the better  but i am very anxious about my friends  ah  but mr egremonts attention was drawn off at the entrance of the house by a newfashioned stove of which mr dutton did the honours conducting father and daughter into the drawingroom where obvious traces of the old ladies remained and thence into his own sittingroom smelling pleasantly of russia leather and recalling that into which nuttie had been wont before her schooldays to climb by the window and become entranced by the illustrations of a wonderful old edition of telemaque picked up at paris  mr dutton made them sit and rest for this had been a good deal of exercise for mr egremont coffee was brought in having been ordered on their arrival and therewith mr dutton entered on an exposition of the affairs of greenleaf and goodenough which was listened to with a good deal of interest though nuttie could not quite detect whether it were altogether friendly interests in marks misfortunes or if there were not a certain triumph in the young man having run into trouble by rejecting his offer  mr dutton explained that his present object was to induce the friends of the family to prevent annoyance by preserving the furniture and personals at a valuation and mr egremont readily agreed to contribute to doing this though he said the sisters and stepmother were well able also to do their share  and then to give the young people a fresh start added mr dutton  there are some men who are always wanting fresh starts said mr egremont just as there are some vessels that are always unlucky and if you observe it is just those men who are in the greatest haste to hang an expensive wife and family round their necks  i dont think poor annaple can be accused of being expensive papa said nuttie  only think when wynnie has two nurses always after him her willie has only the fraction of a little maid who does all sorts of work besides  yes i never saw more resolute and cheerful exertion than mrs mark egremonts said mr dutton  she owes him something said mr egremont for she has been the ruin of him  of his worldly prospects in one sense said mr dutton quietly while nuttie felt how much better and wiser an answer it was than the indignant denial that trembled on her tongue  there can be no doubt that they made a grievous mistake in their choice and i unfortunately was concerned in leading them into it but no one can see how they meet their troubles without great respect and admiration and i am especially bound to seek for some new opening for them  i have little doubt that some office work might be found for him in london but they are essentially country people and it would be much better for them if he could have some agency  i suppose the situation you offered him before sir is filled up  not really cried nuttie  we have only a very common sort of uneducated bailiff who would be much better with some one over him you said so papa  did he request you to apply to me said mr egremont sharply looking at mr dutton  neither he nor she has the least idea of my intention i only thought sir you might be willing to consider how best to assist a nephew who has certainly not been wanting either in industry or economy and who bears your name  well i will think it over said mr egremont rising to take leave  the carriage had been bidden to await them at the door for their daily drive and as mr egremont leant back with the furs disposed over him he observed thats a man who knows how to take care of himself  i wonder where he gets his coffee ive not drunk any like it since i was at nice  and nuttie though well knowing that mr duttons love of perfection was not selfindulgence was content to accept this as high approbation and a good augury for mark and annaple  indeed with mr dutton settled near and with the prospect of a daily walk from church with him she felt such a complete content and trust as she had not known since she had been uprooted from micklethwayte     chapter xxviii  a brave heart    one furnace many times the good and bad may hold   yet what consumes the chaff will only cleanse the gold                                      archbishop trench   never was there a truer verse than that which tells us that in seeking duty we find pleasure by the way and in seeking pleasure we meet pain it might be varied to apply to our anticipations of enjoyment or the reverse  ursula had embraced her lot as a necessity and found it enlivened by a good many sunshiny hours and when she looked upon mr duttons neighbourhood as a continual source of delight and satisfaction she found that it gave rise to a continual course of small disappointments  in the first place he did not walk home from church with her every morning  she looked for him in vain even when she knew he was in town  he only appeared there on sundays and at intervals when he had some especial reason for speaking to her  at first she thought he must have grown lazy or out of health to have thus dropped his old micklethwayte habits but after a time she discovered by accident that he frequented another church open at a still earlier hour and a little farther off and she was forced to come to the conclusion that he acted out of his characteristic precise scrupulosity which would not consider it as correct for her to walk home every day with him she chafed and derided the dear old man a little in her own mind then ended with a sigh  was there any one who cared so much about what was proper for her  and after all was he really older than mr clarence fane whom everybody in her fathers set called clarence or even clare and treated as the boy of the party so that she had taken it as quite natural that he should be paired off with her  it was quite a discovery  there was another and more serious disappointment  mr egremont had not seemed disinclined to consider the giving the agency to mark and nuttie had begun to think with great satisfaction of may condamines delight in welcoming him and of the good influence that would be brought to bear on the dependents when suddenly there came a coolness she could trace the moment and was sure that it was when gregorio became aware of what was intended  he had reason to dread mark as an enemy and was likely to wish to keep him at a distance and it had been ursulas great hope that an absolute promise might have been given before he heard of the plan but mr egremont was always slow to make up his mind except when driven by a sudden impulse and had never actually said that the post should be offered to his nephew  nuttie only detected the turn of the tide by the want of cordiality the hums and haws and by and by the resumption of the unkind ironical tone when mark and annaple were mentioned and at last when she had been reading to him a letter from mrs william egremont full of anxiety for the young people and yet of trust in his kindness to them he exclaimed youve not been writing to her about this absurd proposal  i have not mentioned any proposal at all  what do you mean  why this ridiculous idea about the agency  as if i was going to put my affairs into the hands of a man who has made such a mull of his own  but that was not marks fault papa  he was junior you know and had no power over that goodenough  he ought then  never sail with an unlucky captain  no no marks honourable lady would not let him take the agency when he might have had it and i am not going to let them live upon me now that they have nothing of their own  oh papa but you almost promised  almost he repeated with his ironical tone thats a word capable of a good deal of stretching  this is what you and that umbrella fellow have made out of my not giving him a direct refusal on the spot  he may meddle with marks affairs if he chooses but not with mine  nuttie had learnt a certain amount of wisdom and knew that to argue a point only made her father more determined so she merely answered very well adding in a meek voice their furniture poor things  oh ay  their umbrella friend is making a collection for them  yes i believe i said i would contribute  hot blood surged up within nuttie at the contemptuous tone and she bit her lip to keep down the answer for she knew mr dutton intended to call the next afternoon for her fathers ultimatum before going down to micklethwayte where the crisis was fast approaching and she had so much faith in his powers that she dreaded to forestall him by an imprudent word  alas gregorio must have been on his guard for though nuttie was sure she heard her friends ring at the usual time no entrance followed  she went up to put on her habit to ride with her father and when she came down mr egremont held out a card with the name philip dutton and the pencilled request below to be allowed to see mr egremont later in the day  he has been denied exclaimed she in consternation  hein  before we go out sit down and write a note for me  and he dictated       dear siri will not trouble you to call again this       afternoon as i have decided on reflection that there       is no employment on my estate suited to my nephew       mark egremont       as i understand that you are raising a family       subscription for rescuing his furniture from the       creditors i enclose a cheque for £50 for the purpose                                             i remain   yourswhatpapa asked ursula with a trembling voice full of tears  yours etc of course  quite intimate enough for an exumbrellamonger here give it to me and ill sign it while you fill up the cheque for me  that such should be the first letter that nuttie ever addressed to mr dutton since the roundhand one in which miss ursula wished mr duton to have the onner of a tee with me on my birthday and i am your affected little nuttie  she hoped to explain and lament the next morning after church  he would surely come to talk it over with her but he only returned a civil note with his receipt and she did not see him again before his departure  she was greatly vexed she had wanted so much to tell him how it was and then came an inward consciousness that she would probably have told him a great deal too much  was it that tiresome prudence of his again that would think for her and prevent impulsive and indignant disclosures  it made her bring down her foot sharply on the pavement with vexation as she suspected that he thought her so foolish and then again her heart warmed with the perception of selfdenying care for her  she trusted to that same prudence for no delusive hopes having been given to mark and his wife  she did so justly  mr dutton had thought the matter far too uncertain to be set before them  the canonesss vague hopes had been the fruit of a hint imprudently dropped by nuttie herself in a letter to blanche she had said more to miss nugent but mary was a nonconductor  mr duttons heart sank as he looked at the houses and he had some thoughts of going to her first for intelligence but annaple had spied him and ran out to the gate to welcome him  oh mr dutton im so glad  mark will be delighted  is he at home  oh no at the office wading through seas of papers with mr greenleaf but he will come home to eat in a quarter of an hour  so come in then as her boys merry voice and a gruffer one were heard thats the bailiff  he is willies devoted slave  i hoped to have been in time to have saved you that  well im convinced that among the much maligned races are bailiffs i wonder what i could get by an article on prejudice against classes i was thinking how much beer i should have to lay in for this one and behold he is a teetotaller and besides that amateur nursemaid parlourmaid kitchenmaid etc etc  what bailiff could withstand mrs egremont  perhaps you have tamed him  not i  the cook did that  indeed i believe theres a nice little idyll going on in the kitchen and besides he wore the blue ribbon and was already a devoted follower of young mr godfrey  however if the valuation is ready i hope you may be relieved from him if you wont be too much concerned at the parting  mrs egremont told us that our people are very good to us said annaple and dont mean to send us out with nothing but a pack at our backs  it is very kind in them and in you mr dutton to take the trouble of it  no ill not worry you with thanks  the great point is hope for something for mark to do  that will keep up his spirits best  poor mr greenleaf is so melancholy that it is all i can do to keep him up to the mark  i have been making inquiries and i have three possible openings but i hardly like to lay them before you  oh we are not particular about gentility  it is work we want and if it was anything where i could help that would be all the better im sure i only wonder there are so many as three  i think it is somebodys doing  ah theres mark and she flew out to meet him mark she said on the little path heres the good genius with three chances in his pocket  keep him to luncheon  ive got plenty poor old man how hot you look  go and cool in the drawingroom while i wash my sons face  and she disappeared into the back regions while mark the smile she had called up vanishing from his face came into the drawingroom and held out a cordial thankful hand to his friend whose chief intelligence was soon communicated  yes said mark when he heard the amount entrusted by the family to mr dutton that will save all my wifes poor little household gods  not that i should call them so for i am sure she does not worship them  i dont know what would become of me if she were like poor mrs greenleaf who went into hysterics when the bailiff arrived and has kept her room ever since i sometimes feel as if nothing could hurt us while annaple remains what she is  mr dutton did not wonder that he said so when she came in leading her little son with his sunny hair newly brushed and shining and carrying a little bouquet for the guest of one la marque rosebud and three lilies of the valley  take it to mr dutton billyboy i think he knows how the flowers came into the garden  you shall have daddys buttonhole to take to him next  there mark it is a pansy of most smiling countenance such as should beam on you through your accounts  i declare theres that paragon of a mr jones helping bessy to bring in dinner  isnt it very kind to provide a manservant for us  it might be rattle and it might be inconsequent but it was much pleasanter than hysterics  billyboy was small enough to require a good deal of attention at dinner especially as he was more disposed to open big blue eyes at the stranger than to make use of his spoon and annaple seemed chiefly engrossed with him though a quick keen word at the right moment showed that she was aware of all that was going on as mark and mr dutton discussed the present situation and future measures  it was quite true that a man concerned in a failure was in great danger of being left out of the race for employment and mr dutton did not think it needful to mention the force of the arguments he was using to back his recommendation of mark egremont  the possibilities he had heard of were a clerkship at a shipping agents another at a warehouse in their own line and a desk at an insurance office  this sounded best but had the smallest salary to begin with and locality had to be taken into account  mr duttons plan was that as soon as mark was no longer necessary for what annaple was pleased to call the fall of the sere and withered leaf the pair should come to stay with him so that mark could see his possible employers and annaple consider of the situations  they accepted this gratefully mark only proposing that she should go either to his stepmother or her own relations to avoid the final crisis  as if i would she exclaimed  what sort of a little recreant goose do you take me for  i take you for a gallant little woman ready to stand in the breach said mark  ah dont flatter yourself  there is a thing i have not got courage to facewithout necessity and thats janets triumphant pity  mr dutton lives rather too near your uncle but he is a man and he cant be so bad  this of course did not pass till mr dutton had gone in to greet the ladies next door to promise to tell them of their child at length when the business hours of the day should be over  shall it be told  there was something in his toneperfectly indefinable with which he spoke of miss egremont that was like the old wistfully reverential voice in which he used to mention mrs egremont  it smote mary nugents quiet heart with a pang  was it that the alteration from the old kindly fatherliness of regard to little nuttie revealed that any dim undefined hope of marys own must be extinguished for ever or was it that she grieved that he should again be wasting his heart upon the impracticable  a little of both perhaps but mary was as ready as ever to sympathise and to rejoice in hearing that the impetuous child had grown into the forbearing dutiful woman     chapter xxix  a fresh start   did you say that mark and his wife were come to springfield house  they come the day after tomorrow answered ursula  mark could not finish up the business sooner  well i suppose we must have them to dinner for once  he has made a fool of himself but i wont have the canoness complaining that i take no notice of him and it is easier done while he is there than when he has got into some hole in the citythat is if he ever gets anything to do  mr dutton has several situations in view for him  in view  thats a large order  or does it mean living on dutton and doing something nominal  i should think dutton too old and sharp a hand for that though he is quartering them on himself  i believe there is nothing mr dutton would like better if he thought it right for them but i am quite sure mark and annaple would not consent  ha ha and mr egremont laughed  their nose is not brought to the grindstone yet  say saturday then ursula  am i to ask mr dutton  of course im not going to have a teteatete with master mark  so ursula had the satisfaction of writing a more agreeable note to mr dutton than her last and her invitation was accepted but to her vexation mr egremont further guarded himself from anything confidential by verbally asking mr clarence fane on that very day and as that gentleman was a baronets son she knew she should fall to his lot at dinner and though she was glad when this was the case at their ordinary parties it was a misfortune on the present occasion  she had not seen annaple since her marriage except at the family gathering on the canons death when she was very much absorbed by the requirements of the stricken household and nuttie expected to see her in the same subdued condition  all mr dutton had said or mary nugent had written about her courage and cheerfulness had given the impression of patience smiling at grief and in a very compassionate mood she started for a forenoon call at springfield house but early as it was nobody was at home unless it might be the little boy whose voice she thought she heard while waiting at the gate  she was out driving with her father afterwards in the long summer evening and only found marks card on returning just in time to dress it was a bright glaring day and she was sitting by the window rather inattentively listening to mr fanes criticism of a new performance at one of the theatres when she heard the bell and there entered the slight bright creature who might still have been taken for a mere girl  the refined though pronounced features the transparent complexion crispy yellow hair and merry eyes were as sunbeamlike as at the rectory gardenparty almost five years ago and the black dress only marked the contrast and made the slenderness of the figure more evident  mark looked older and wrung his cousins hand with a pressure of gratitude and feeling but annaples was a light little gay kiss and there was an entire unconsciousness about her of the role of poor relation  she made an easy little acknowledgment of the introduction of mr fane and as mr egremont appeared the next moment exchanged greetings with him in a lively ordinary fashion  this was just what he liked  he only wanted to forget what was unpleasant and giggling scotch girl as she was he was relieved to find that she could not only show wellbred interest in the surface matters of the time but put in bright flashes of eagerness and originality well seconded by mr dutton  mr fane was always a professor of small talk and nuttie had learnt to use the current change of society so that though mark was somewhat silent the dinner was exceedingly pleasant and lively and as mr fane remarked afterwards he had been asked to enliven a doleful feast to ruined kindred he could only say he wished prosperity always made people so agreeable  this is all high spirit and selfrespect thought nuttie  annaple is talking as i am from the teeth outwards  i shall have it out with her when we go upstairs  at any rate my father is pleased with her  nuttie made the signal to move as soon as she could and as they went upstairs put her arm round the slim waist and gave a sympathetic pressure but the voice that addressed her had still the cheery ring that she fancied had been only assumed  im sorry i missed you but we set out early and made a day of it and oh weve been into such funny places as i never dreamt of  you didnt see my boy  no  i thought i heard him  i must see him tomorrow  and i must see yours  may it not be a pleasure tonight  ive no doubt you go and gloat over him at night  well i do generally run up after dinner but after your day i cant think of dragging you up all these stairs  oh thats nothing  only you see it is jollier to have my billyboy in the next room  they were mounting all the time and were received in the day nursery by the old rectory nurse much increased in dignity but inclined to be pathetic as she inquired after mr mark while annaple like a little insensible being answered with provoking complacency as to his perfect health and begged mrs poole to bring master alwyn to play in the garden at springfield with her willie  in fact there was a general invitation already to alwyn to play there but his attendants so much preferred the society of their congeners in the parks that they did not avail themselves of it nearly as often as ursula wished  little alwyn asleep was of course a beautiful sight with a precious old headless rabbit pressed tight to his cheek annaples face grew tender as she looked at the motherless creature and she admired him to any extent except saying that he excelled her own being more than a year the elder there could be no rivalry as to accomplishments but as soon as they were out of the nursery hush annaple laughed her way down again with tales of billyboys wonder at his first experiences of travelling  they sat down among the plants in the balcony as far from the lamps as possible and talked themselves into intimacy over micklethwayte  there are two eden homes in peoples lives one that of later childhood the other the first of wedded happiness and st ambrose road had the same halo to both of these for both had been uprooted from it against their will the chief difference being that ursula could cast longing lingering looks behind while annaple held herself resolutely steeled against sentiment and would only turn it off by something absurd  nothing was absolutely settled yet mark had been presenting himself at offices and she had been seeing rooms and lodgings  the insurance office sounds the best and would be the least shock to our belongings said annaple but it seems to lead to nothing he would not get on unless we had capital to invest and even if we had any you wouldnt catch us doing that again  does mr dutton advise that  no he only thought we should like it better but we are quite past caring for peoples feelings in the matter  they couldnt pity us worse than they do  i incline to stubbs and co  one of them was once in the greenleaf office and has a regard for anything from thence besides mark would have something to do besides desk work he would have to judge of samples and see to the taking in and storing of goods  he does know something about that and im sure it would agree with him better than an unmitigated high stool with his nose to a desk  i should like it better  thats right  now i have got some one to say so  besides rising is possible if one gets very useful  i mean to be mrs alderman if not my lady mayoress before we have done  then they have a great big almost deserted set of rooms over the warehouse where we might live and look after the place  oh but should you like that  mr dutton wants us to live out in some of the suburban places where it seems there is a perfect population of clerks families in semidetached houses  he says we should save marks railway fare rent and all in doctors bills  but people children and all do live and thrive in the city and i think marks health will be better looked after if i am there to give him his midday bite and sup and brush him up than if he is left to cater for himself and as to exercise for the billyboy tis not so far to the thames embankment the only things that stagger me are the blacks  i dont know whether life is long enough to be after the blacks all day long but perhaps i shall get used to them  well i think that would be worse  perhaps it would and at any rate if the blacks do beat me we could move  think no rent nor rates nor taxesthat is an inducement to swallownoto contend with any number of blackamoors isnt it even if they settle on the tip of billyboys nose  i could come to see you better there than out in a suburb said nuttie  but what do these rooms look out upon  on one side into their own court on the other into wulstan streeta quiet place on the wholeall walls and warehouses and theres an excellent parish church mr underwoods so i think we might do worse  nuttie was very sorry that the gentlemen came up and mr fane wandered out and began asking whether they were going to the rose show  somehow on that evening she became conscious that annaple looked at her and mr fane rather curiously and when they met again the next day and having grown intimate over the introduction of the two little boys were driving out together there were questions about whether she saw much of him  oh i dont know  he is the nicest on the whole of papas friends he can talk of something besidesnuttie paused over her besideshorseyness and all that sort of thinghe is not so like an old satyr as some of them are and so he is a resource  i see  and you meet him elsewhere dont you in general society  i dont go out much now that lady kirkaldy is not in town but he always seems to turn up everywhere that one goes  ursula im very glad of that tone of yours  i was afraid  afraid of what cried nuttie in a defiant tone  that you liked him and he is not really nice nuttie  mark knows all about him and so did i when i lived with the delmars  nuttie laughed rather bitterly  thank you annaple  as if i could care for that manor he for me for that matter  i know but too well she added gravely that nobody nice is ever intimate at home  i beg your pardon  i would not have worried you about it only i think you must take care nuttie for blanche mentioned it to us last winter  blanche is an arrant gossip  if she saw a grandfather and great grandmother gossiping she would say they were going to be married  yes as mark says one always swallows blanche with a qualification  you may be quite sure annaple that nothing like that will ever be true about me  why what would ever become of my poor little wyn if i was so horrid as to want to go and marry  she said it with an ineffable tone of contempt just like the original nuttie who seemed to be recalled by association with annaple  that sojourn of mark and his wife at springfield house was a bright spot in that summer  if it had been only that annaples presence gave the free entree to such an island of old micklethwayte it would have been a great pleasure to her but there was besides the happiness of confidence and unrestraint in their society a restful enjoyment only to be appreciated by living the guarded life of constraint that was hers  she was so seldom thrown among people whom she could admire and look up to  annaple told her husband of nutties vehement repudiation of any intention of marriage  i am sure she meant it she observed it was only a little too strong i wonder if that poor youth who came to her first ball and helped to pick us out of the hole in bluepost bridge had anything to do with it  annaple had an opportunity of judging  mr dutton would not have brought about a meeting which might be painful and unsettling to both but one afternoon when nuttie was off duty with her father and had come in to share annaples five oclock tea gerard godfrey looking the curate from head to foot made his appearance having come up from the far east about some call on mr duttons purse  the two shook hands with pleased surprise and a little heightening of colour but that was all  nuttie had been out to luncheon and was dressed like a mere fashionable young lady in his eyes and when after the classes and clubs and schools of his district had been discussed he asked and i suppose you are taking part in everything here  no that i cant  indeed  i know porlock the second curate here very well and he tells me that his vicar has a wonderful faculty of finding appropriate work for every one  of course you know him  no i dont said nuttie  miss egremont has her appropriate work said mr dutton and the deacon felt himself pushed into his old position at micklethwayte he knew the clergy of the district very well and how persistently either mr egremont or perhaps gregorio prevented their gaining admittance at his house and he guessed but did not know that nuttie could not have got into personal intercourse with them without flat disobedience  annaple threw herself into the breach and talked of st wulstans and the encounter ended leaving the sense of having drifted entirely away from one another and being perfectly heart whole though on the one hand ursulas feeling was of respect and honour and gerards had a considerable element of pity and disapprobation  no said annaple when they were gone he will not cry like the kloarek in the breton ballad who wetted three great missals through with his tears at his first mass  he is very good i am sure but he is a bit of a prig  it is very hard to youth to be good without priggishness said mr dutton  selfassertion is necessary and it may easily be carried too far  buttresses are useful but they are not beauties rejoined annaple  the warehouse arrangement was finally adopted and after the three weeks necessary for the cleaning and fitting of their floor and the bringing in of their furniture mark and annaple began what she termed life among the blacks  nuttie had great designs of constantly seeing annaple sending her supplies from the gardens and preserves at bridgefield taking her out for drives and cultivating a friendship between alwyn and willie who had taken to each other very kindly on the whole  they could not exactly understand each others language and had great fights from time to time over toys for though there was a year between them they were nearly equal in strength but they cared for each others company more than for anything else were always asking to go to one another and roared when the time of parting came at least alwyn did so unreservedly for nuttie had begun to perceive with compunction that billyboy was much the most under control and could try to be good at his mothers word without other bribe than her kiss and smile  ah but he had a mother     chapter xxx  nutties prospects    three hundred pounds and possibilitiesmerry wives of windsor   again nutties plans were doomed to be frustrated  it did not prove to be half so easy to befriend mr and mrs mark egremont as she expected at the distance of half london apart and with no special turn for being patronised on their side  her father took a fancy for almost daily drives with her in the park because then he could have alwyn with him and the little fellows chatter had become his chief amusement  or if she had the carriage to herself there was sure to be something needful to be done which made it impossible to go into the city to take up and set down mrs mark egremont and to leave her to make her way home would be no kindness so nuttie only accomplished a visit once before going out of town and that was by her own exertionsby underground railway and cab  then she found all going prosperously the blacks not half so obnoxious as had been expected of course not thought nuttie in the middle of the summer the lookout over the yard very amusing to billyboy and the large oldfashioned pannelled rooms so cool and airy that annaple was quite delighted with them and contemned the idea of needing a holiday she had made them very pretty and pleasant with her micklethwayte furniture whose only fault was being on too small a scale for these larger spaces but that had been remedied by piecing and making what had been used for two serve for one  the kitchen was on the same floor close at hand which was well for annaple did a good deal there having only one young maid for the rougher work  she had taken lessons in the school of cookery and practised a good deal even at micklethwayte and she was proud of her skill and economy  mark came in for his midday refreshment and looked greatly brightened as if the worst had come and was by no means so bad as he expected  all the time he had been at mr duttons he had been depressed and anxious but now with his boy on his knee he was merrier than nuttie had ever known him  as to exercise there were delightful evening walks sometimes early marketings in the long summer mornings before business beganand altogether it seemed as nuttie told her father afterwards as if she had had a glimpse into a little city arcadia  hein said he how long will it last  and nuttie was carried away to cowes where he had been persuaded to recur to his old favourite sport of yachting  she would have rather liked this if clarence fane had not been there too and continually haunting them  she had been distrustful of him ever since annaples warning and it became a continual worry to the motherless girl to decide whether his civil attentions really meant anything or whether she were only foolish and ridiculous in not accepting them as freely and simply as before  of one thing she became sure namely that gregorio was doing whatever in him lay to bring them together  in this seaside temporary abode great part of the london establishment was left behind and gregorio condescended to act the part of butler with only a single manservant under him and thus he had much more opportunity of regulating the admission of visitors than at home and he certainly often turned mr fane in upon her when she had intended that gentleman to be excluded and contrived to turn a deaf or uncomprehending ear when she desired that there should be no admission of visitors unless her father was absolutely ready for them and also there were times when he must have suggested an invitation to dinner or a joining in a sail  no doubt gregorio would have been delighted to see her married and to be thus free from any counter influence over his master but as she said to herself catch me  even if i cared a rush for the man i could not do it  i dont do my poor father much good but as to leaving poor little alwyn in his clutchesi must be perfectly demented with love even to think of it  there was a desire on the valets part to coax and court little alwyn of which she felt somewhat jealous  the boy was naturally the pet of every one in the household but he was much less out of gregorios reach in the present confined quarters and she could not bear to see him lifted up in the valets arms allowed to play with his watch held to look at distant sails on board the yacht or even fed with sweet biscuits or chocolate creams  the rectory nursery had gone on a strict regimen and nurse was as angry as nuttie herself but there was no preventing it for his father was not above cupboard love and never resisted the entreaties that were always excited by the sight of dainties only laughing when nuttie remonstrated or even saying never mind sister wynnie shes got mrs teachems cap on and making the child laugh by pretending to smuggle in papers of sweets by stealth apart from the severe eyes of sister or nurse  that cut nuttie to the heart  to speak of the evils for which selfindulgence was a preparation would only make her father sneer at her for a second hannah more  it was a language he did not understand and as to the physical unwholesomeness he simply did not choose to believe it  she almost wished alwyn would for once be sick enough to frighten him but that never happened nor would he accept nurses statement of the boy being out of order  poor little alwyn he was less and less of an unmixed joy to her as he was growing out of the bounds of babyhood and her notions of discipline were thwarted by her fathers unbounded indulgence  to her the child was a living soul to be trained for a responsible position here and for the eternal world beyond to her father he was a delightful plaything never to be vexed whose very tempers were amusing especially when they teased the serious elder sister  oh father do you ever think what it will come to nuttie could not help saying one day when mr egremont had prevented her from carrying him off in disgrace to the nursery for tying the rolls up in dinner napkins to enact punch and judy in spite of his own endeavours to prevent the consequent desolation of the preparations  mr egremont shrugged his shoulders and only observed an excuse for a little home tyranny eh  no no wyn we dont want tame little muffs here  nuttie was obliged to run out of the room andit must be confesseddance and stamp out her agony of indignation and misery that her father should be bent on ruining his child for she could not understand that all this was simply the instinctive selfindulgence of a drugged brain and dulled conscience  she did however get a little support and help during a brief stay in the shooting season at bridgefield  the canoness was visiting the condamines at the rectory and very soon understood all the state of things more perhaps from her former nurse than from ursula  she was witness to one of those trying scenes when nuttie had been forbidding the misuse of a beautiful elaborate book of nursery rhymes where alwyn thought proper to kill with repeated stabs the old woman of the shoe when preparing to beat her progeny  just as she was getting the dagger paperknife out of his little hand and was diverting the pout on his swelling lip his father became aware of the contest and immediately the half conquered boy appealed to him sister naughty  wont let wynnie kill cross ugly old woman beating poor little children  a fellow feeling eh sister  kill her away boy tear her out yes give her to sister and tell her thats the way to serve sour females i declare ursula she has got something of your expression  oh wynnie wynnie said nuttie as he trotted up to her is sister cross and ugly and she opened her arms to him  sister wyns own sister said the child affectionately letting himself be kissed as he saw her grieved  she shant be ugly old womanugly old woman go in fire  so perilously near the flame did he run to burn the old woman that mr egremont shouted to her that in spite of all that humbug she was perfectly careless of the child although if she had withheld him she would probably have been blamed for thwarting him  are you quite fair towards ursula the aunt ventured to say when the girl had gone to dress for walking down with her to the rectory it is hard on her and not good for the boy to upset her authority  eh  why the girl is just a governess manquee imbued with the spirit of all those old women who bred her up  a nice life the poor child would have of it but for me  i am sure she is devotedly attached to him  hein  so she thinks but trust human nature for loving to wreak discipline on the child who has cut her out  that is scarcely just alwyn  she was greatly relieved to be cut out  mr egremont laughed at this and his sisterinlaw indignantly added with all the authority of a successful parent anyway nothing is so bad for a child as collision between the authorities in a family ursula is doing her best to act as a mother to that child and it will be very injurious to him to interfere with her influences  shes a good girl enoughgives very little trouble he allowed but im not going to have the boy sat upon  as he spoke the words nuttie returned and as soon as she was out of the house and out of hearing she exclaimed oh aunt jane you see how it is  how am i to prevent my boy from being utterly ruined  i have been speaking to your father said mrs egremont but he does not seem to understand  men dont  a childs faults and fancies seem such trifles to them that they cant see the harm of indulging them and besides they expect to be amused  and is that poor dear little fellow to grow up spoilt said nuttie her eyes hot with unshed tears  i hope not ursula  i have great confidence in your influence for i see you are a sensible girl  this was astonishing praise from the canoness  but you will throw away your chances if you keep up a continual opposition to what your father allows  it will be much less hurtful if alwyn does get too much indulgence and does a little unnecessary mischief than for him to learn to think you the enemy of his pleasures always wanting to check and punish him  oh yes as nuttie was going to answer i know it is for his real good but how is that baby to understand that  indeed my dear i know how it is i have gone through the same sort of thing with basil  oh it could never have been so bad  no of course not but i have had to allow what i did not like for the child rather than let him see the shadow of difference of opinion between us and i dont think it has done him any harm  the great point is that you should keep that poor little fellows affection and respect and make him unwilling to vex you  that he is dear little man  he is sorry when he sees sister grieved he is always distressed if anything is hurt or pained  he is really tenderhearted  yes but boys are boys  that feeling will fail you if you work it too hard and especially if you show vexation at his pleasures  keep that for real evils like falsehood or cruelty  not for disobedience  the evil of disobedience depends much more upon the authority of an order than on the child itself  if he disobeys you under his fathers licence you cannot make much of it  you have him a good deal to yourself  yes  then make use of that time to strengthen his principles and sense of right and wrong as well as to secure his affections  my dear i never saw a girl in a more difficult position than yours but i see you are doing your utmost only i am afraid the love of sedatives is the same  oh aunt i did think he had given it up  you are inexperienced my dear  i see it in his eyes  well im afraid there is no stopping that  mother and nutties voice was choked  she did her best but you have not the same opportunities  it cant be helped with a man of that age  mark might have done something but he is out of the question now poor fellow  indeed aunt jane i think mark and annaple are some of the happiest people i ever saw  i only wish my poor alwyn were as forward as their billy but im not even allowed to teach him his letters because once he cried over them  i wish they had anything to fall back upon said mrs egremont anxiously  they are so unwilling to let any one know of their difficulties that i feel as if i never knew in what straits they may be  you will be sure to let me know ursula if there is anything that i can do for them  that conversation was a great comfort and help to nuttie who was pleased to find herself treated as a real friend by her aunt and perceived the wisdom of her advice  but the watching over the mark egremonts was a very difficult matter to accomplish for when she went back to london she was warned that billy had the whooping cough rendering them unapproachable all the winter so that she could only hear of them through mr dutton whom she continued to see occasionally whenever there was anything to communicate  mr egremont rather liked him and on meeting him in the street would ask him casually in to dinner or to make up a rubber or play piquet for he excelled in these arts and still more in chess and an evening with mr dutton was quite a redletter time with nuttie it gave her an indefinable sense of safety and protection but it was not always to be had for her friend had many engagements being one of the active lay church workers and devoting two regular evenings in each week to gerard godfreys eastern district where he kept all the accounts had a model court and evening class besides hospitably resting tired clergymen and their wives in his pleasant quiet house  in the spring mr egremont was laid up with the worst rheumatic attack he had yet had in consequence of yielding to the imperious will of his son who had insisted on standing in a bleak corner to see the life guards pass by  on this occasion nuttie did not prove herself the heavenborn nurse that the true heroine ought to be but was extremely frightened and altogether dependent on gregorio who knew all about the symptoms and when to send for the doctor and a gardemalade gregorio always talked french to nuttie when he felt himself in the ascendant as he certainly was at present but he became much less gracious when he heard that mrs william egremont might be expected declaring that madame would only excite his master and that her presence was quite unnecessary  her coming had been volunteered but it was a great boon to ursula who was thus helped out in many perplexities although mrs egremont was a great deal at her stepsons and neither lady was of much avail in the sickroom during the stress of the illness  it was never actually dangerous but there was great suffering and much excitement and for four or five days the distress and anxiety were considerable  after this passed off ursula was surprised to find her company preferred to that of her aunt  she was a better souffredouleur was less of a restraint and was besides his regular reader and amanuensis so that as the force of the attack abated he kept her a good deal in his room during the latter part of the day imparting scraps of intelligence skimming the papers for him and reading his letters  there was a lease to be signed and as soon as might be mr bulfinch the redcastle solicitor brought it up and had to be entertained at luncheon  while he was waiting in the drawingroom for mr egremont to be made ready for him he looked with deep interest on the little heir whom ursula presently led off to the other end of the room to the hoard of downstair toys and an elaborate camp was under construction when by the fireside the canoness inquired in a low confidential tone may i ask whether you came about a will  no mrs egremont  i wish i were  it is only about the lease of spinneycotes farm  then there is none  none that i am aware of  none has ever been drawn up by us indeed i was wishing that some influence could be brought to bear which might show the expedience of making some arrangement  any melancholy event is i trust far distant but contingencies should be provided for  exactly so  he is recovering now but these attacks always leave effects on the heart and at his age with his habits no one knows what may happen  of course it would not make much difference to the boy  no the court of chancery would appoint the most suitable natural guardians  but said mrs egremont i am afraid that the personal property when divided would not be much of a provision for her  you are right  the investments are unfortunately and disproportionately small  she ought either to have them all or there should be a charge on the estate said the canoness decisively  if possible he must be made to move  oh dont cried nuttie jumping up from the floor  he mustnt be upset on any account  my dear i had no notion that you heard us exclaimed her aunt  i thought alwyn was making too much noise with his soldiers  i beg your pardon said nuttie perhaps i should have spoken sooner but indeed he must not be worried and disturbed she added somewhat fiercely  dont be afraid my dear said her aunt  mr bulfinch knows that your father is in no condition to have such matters brought before him  certainly said the old lawyer politely and we will trust that miss egremonts prospects may soon come forward on a more auspicious occasion  nuttie could have beaten him but she was obliged to content herself with such a sweeping charge of her zulus among alwyns englishmen that their general shrieked out in indignation against such a variation of the accustomed programme of all their games  nuttie thought she had defended her patient sufficiently but she found she had been mistaken for when her aunt had left them some days later her father began we are well quit of her  those troublesome dictatorial women always get worse when they are left widowstaking upon them to say what their dear husbands would have said forsooth  aunt jane was very kind to me said ursula not in the least knowing what he was thinking of  to you  ay i should think so taking upon her to lecture me about securing a provision for you  oh  i hoped  what he broke in  you knew of it  you set her on i suppose  oh no no father  she and mr bulfinch began about it not meaning me to hearabout a will i meanand i told them i wasnt going to have you worried and i thought i had stopped it altogether  stop a woman bent on her duty  hein  but you are a good girl and shall come to no loss when we have to make your marriage settlement  you wont have to do that father  hein  what do you keep that poor fellow clarence fane dangling in attendance on you for  i dont  im sure i dont want him  i would do anything to keep him at a distance  how now  i thought your grace condescended to him more than to any one else  i dont dislike him unless he has that in his head but as to marrying him  ohhh such a note of horror that elicited a little laugh  so hot against him are we  who is it then  not the umbrella fellow  father how can you she cried with a burning flush of indignation hewhyhe  he has always been a sort of uncle ever since i was a little girl  oh yes adopted uncles are very devout when young ladies rush out to morning prayers at unearthly hours  father with her voice trembling i assure you he doesnti mean he always goes to st michaels unless he has anything particular to say to me  oh yes i understand and mr egremont indulged in a hearty laugh which almost drove poor nuttie beside herself  indeedindeed she stammered in her confusion and suppressed wrath it is nothing of that sort  he is a regular old bachelorhe always was  at what age do men become old bachelors  for he seems to me about the age of poor clarry whom you seem to view as a bugbear  i wish you would not think of such things father i have not the slightest intention of leaving you and dear little wynnie  nothing should tempt me  nothing  hein  then you may as well be on your guard miss egremont or we shall have pleadings that you have encouraged themchurch and worldor both maybe  you pious folk take your little diversions and flirtations just like your poor sisters whom you shake your heads at never guessing how gregorio and i have looked out at you and your adopted uncle parading the street  i wish gregorio would mind his own business and not put such things in your head burst out nuttie  at which mr egremont laughed longer and louder than ever  poor nuttie  it was terrible discomfiture not only for the moment but a notion had been planted in her mind that seemed cruel almost profane and yet which would not be dismissed and made her heart leap with strange bounds at the wild thought could it be true then sink again with shame at her own presumptuous folly in entertaining such a thought for a moment  yet whenever she actually encountered mr dutton her habitual comfort and reliance on him revived and dispelled all the embarrassment which at other times she expected to feel in his presence     chapter xxxi  spes non fracta   summer had quite set in before mr egremont was able to go out for a drive and then he was ordered to buxton  nuttie only once saw her cousins before leaving town for their little boy fulfilled the nursery superstition by whooping till may and all intercourse was prohibited till he had ceased for a whole week to utter a suspicious sound  mr dutton had insisted on the family spending a fortnight at springfield house for change of air and it was there that nuttie was permitted to see them though the children were still forbidden to meet  annaple looked very thin but rattled as merrily as ever  no one could guess she said what a delight it was not to know what one was to have for dinner  to do more than know i am afraid said ursula  well next to the delight of knowing nothing at all about itand even that is only good for a holidayis the delight of seeing a pudding come out smooth and comfortable and unbroken from its basin something attempted something done you know  it is quite as good a work of art as a watercoloured drawing  only not quite so permanent  no it is only ones first pudding that one wants to embalm in a glass case for being so good as not to leave its better part behind in the basin or to collapse as soon as it is in the dish  which my puddings always did in the happy days of old but then i was always hunted ignominiously out of the kitchen and told i wasted good food said nuttie  yes and waste is fearful when mark and billy have to eat it all the same like the poor cows with spoilt hay  i wonder whether your old experiences recall the joy of finding trustworthy eggs within your price  ah i was not housekeeper  i only remember being in disgrace for grumbling when there was no pudding because the hens would not lay  though i heard a woman declaring the other day that there ought to be a machine for them  oh the scenes that i encounter when i am marketing  if i only could describe them for punch  i walked home once with our porters wife carrying two most brilliant sticks of rhubarb all carmine stalk and gamboge leaf and expressing a very natural opinion that the rhubarb tree must be very showy to look at and curious to know in what kind of fruit the medicine grew  oh annaple do you go yourself in that way  mark used to go with me but poor old fellow he has ruinous ideas about prices and quantities and besides now he is so hard workedup and down all dayhe wants a little more of his bed in the morning  and what do you want  i never was a sleepy creature and i get back in time to dress the boy  i generally find him at highjinks on his fathers bed  it uses up a little superfluous energy before the dressing  but surely you have a servant now  ive come to the conclusion that a workmans wife charing is a better institution  no 1 a pet of miss nugents was a nice creature but the london air did for her at once  no 2 also from micklethwayte instantly set up a young man highly respectable and ready to marry on the spot as they did though their united ages dont amount to thirtynine  no 3 was a cockney and couldnt stay because the lookout was so dull and no 4 gossiped with her kind when i thought her safe in the temple gardens with billy whereby he caught the whoopingcough and as she also took the liberty of wearing my fur cloak and was not particular as to accuracy we parted on short notice and i got this woman to come in every day to scrub help make the bed etc  it is much less trouble and the only fault i have to find with her is an absolute incapability of discerning blacks  i believe she thinks i have a monomania against them  still annaple insisted that she did not work half so hard as her nieces muriel and janet in their london season and that her economy was not nearly so trying and difficult as that which lady delmar had been practising for years in order to afford them a summer there nor was her anxiety to make both ends meet by any means equal to her sisters in keeping up appearances and avoiding detrimentals the two sisters met occasionally but lady delmar was so compassionate and patronising that annaples spirit recoiled in offhand levity and rattle and neither regretted the occupation that prevented them from seeing much of one another   a year passed by chiefly spent by mr egremont in the pursuit of comparative health at buxton bagneres and biarritz during which his daughter could do little but attend to him and to little alwyn the boy had been enough left to her and nurse during his fathers acute illness to have become more amenable  he was an affectionate child inheriting with his mothers face her sweetness and docility of nature and he was old enough to be a good deal impressed with the fact that he had made poor papa so ill by teasing him to stand in the cold mr egremont was not at rest without a sight of the child every day if only for a moment and the helplessness and suffering had awed the little fellow a good deal  it was touching to see him pause when galloping about the house when he went past the sickroom and hush his merry voice of his own accord  and in the journeys when his fathers invalided state would have made a fractious or wilful child a serious inconvenience his good temper and contentment were invaluable  he would sit for hours on his sisters lap listening to whispered ofttold tales or playing at impromptu quiet games he could go to sleep anywhere and the wonderful discoveries he made at each new place were the amusement of all his auditors  sister was always his playfellow and companion whenever she could be spared from her father and she had an everincreasing influence over him which she did her best to raise into principle  perhaps she never had a happier moment than when she heard how he had put his hands behind him and steadily refused when gregorio had offered to regale him at a stall of bonbons forming only a thin crust to liqueurs which unfortunately he had already been taught to like  but i told him sister said i mustnt have them said alwyn  and then he made a face and said something in french about you  i know twas you for he said soeur  what was it  never mind wynnie dear we had much better never know  you were sisters own dear steadfast boy and you shall kiss mothers picture  nuttie had a beautiful coloured photograph of her mother finished like a miniature which had been taken at nice in the time of alice egremonts most complete and matured beauty  she had taught alwyn to kiss and greet it every evening before his prayers and such a kiss was his reward when he had shown any special act of goodness for which as she told him mother would have been pleased with her little son  such another boon was his one sunday evening at biarritz when she found that while she was shut up at dinner with her father he had voluntarily gone to church with nurse instead of playing on the beach with some other english children  it was all very long and tiresome he said when asked if he liked it  then why did you go old man  there was no need to drag you there said his father  she didnt drag me said the boy i walked  you need not have walked then master dignity  poor nursie couldnt go without me said alwyn and sister says theres a blessing on those that go  a blessing eh and what idea does that little head entertain of a blessing said mr egremont  alwyn lifted his soft brown eyes reverently and said it is something good speaking as he always did in a baby lisp inimitable here  well  and it comes from god  well what is it  can you see it  nohe looked in perplexity towards nuttie who was in agony all the time lest there should be a scoff that might remain in the childs mind  never mind sister  can you feel it  yes and the little face lighted with such a reality that the incipient mockery turned into wonder on the next question  and how does it feel  oh so nice  it makes wynnie glad here and he spread his hands over his breast and gave a little caper like a kid for very gladness  there said mr egremont leaning back fairly conquered  any one might envy wynnie  goodnight my boy blessing and all  i wonder if one felt like that when one was a little shaver he pursued as alwyn went off to his bed  i think i did sometimes said nuttie but i never was half as good as wynnie  what exclaimed her father  you bred up among the saints  ah but i hadnt the same nature  i never was likeher  welltis very pretty now and i dont know how we could stand a young turk but you mustnt make a girl of him  theres no fear of that said nuttie  he is full of spirit  that old bathing woman calls him un vrai petit diable danglais he is so venturous  which delighted mr egremont as much as the concession that the boys faith was pretty delighted ursula  indeed he went a little further for when she came back from her few minutes at alwyns bedside he proceeded to tell her of the absolute neglect in which his mother a belle of the almacks days had left her nursery  it was the first time he had ever hinted at a shadow of perception that anything in his own life had been amiss and ursula could not but feel a dreamy hopeful wonder whether her sweet little alwyn could be the destined means of doing that in which her mother had failed  it was at least enough to quicken those prayers which had been more dutiful than trustful  and then her hope sank again when she realised that her fathers days were spent between the lull of opiate followed by a certain serenity then in a period of irritability each being more or less prolonged according to health weather or entertainment and closed again by the sedatives in various forms  it relieved her indeed but she felt it a wickedness to be glad of the calm and she was aware that the habit was making inroads on her fathers powers  between that and his defect of eyesight he was often much confused especially about money matters and was more and more dependent  would that it had been only upon her but she was constantly certain that gregorio was taking advantage of his masters helplessness and keeping it up by all means in his power  yet what could be done for the valet was absolutely necessary to his comfort and yet she sometimes thought her father half in dread of him and afraid to expostulate about personal neglects which became more frequent things that would have enraged him from others were only grumbled and fretted over when gregorio caused him real inconvenience by absence or forgetfulness and made very insufficient apology  it seemed like a bondage nuttie thought of her mothers efforts and blamed herself in vain  it was during this journey that she heard of good miss headworths death  the old ladys mind had long failed and the actual present loss to nuttie was not great but it seemed to close a long account of gratitude such as she had not thoroughly felt or understood before and the link with micklethwayte was severed  for mark and annaple prevailed on mrs egremont to install miss nugent as governess to rosalind and adela  in that capacity nuttie hoped to see a good deal of her but of course was again disappointed for her father would not hear of returning to bridgefield  it was draughty and dull and desolate and nothing suited him but london     chapter xxxii  blacks in the ascendant    mans work ends with set of sun   womans work is never doneproverb   it was far on in may when ursula found herself again in the sittingroom over the warehouse  somehow it had not the dainty wellcaredfor air of erst  the pretty table ornaments were out of sight the glass over the clock was dim the hands had stopped some of annaples foes the blacks had effected a lodgment on the parian figures the chintzes showed wear and wash almost grime the carpets pattern was worn a basket full of socks was on the sofa and on the table a dress once belonging to annaples trousseau was laid out converted into its component parts  the wails of a baby could be heard in the distance and the first person to appear was master william sturdy and happy in spite of wofully darned knees to his stockings  mothers coming if baby will stop crying he said and lie in her cradle  your little sister  whats her name  jane christian said the boy with a much more distinct enunciation than alwyn though a year older had yet acquired  she does cry so she wont let mother make my new knickies out of her blue gown  thoughts of the suits that alwyn was discarding came across nuttie could they be offered without offence  she asked however do you remember alwynmy wynnie  wynnie gave me my horse cried the boy unstabling a steed which had seen hard service since the presentation  wheres wynnie  he is at home  you must come and see him said nuttie who had not been allowed to bring him till secure of a clean bill of health but see just outside the door theres something for billy  she had made her servant bring up the parcels to the passage outside and billy was soon hugging a magnificent box of soldiers wherewith he pranced off to show them to his mother leaving the doors open so that ursula could more decidedly hear the babys voice not a healthy childs lusty cry but a poor little feeble wail interspersed with attempts at consolation  come wont she go to emily  oh billyboy how splendid  i hope you thanked cousin ursula  baby jenny now cant you let any one speak but yourself  oh shall i never teach you that balow my babe is not bellow my babe  thats better  now cant you let emily have you while i go to cousin nuttie  let me come  maynt i exclaimed ursula invading the room that served as kitchen where annaple was trying to hush off the child and make her over to a little twelve years old maid who stood in waiting helping willie meantime to unpack his soldiers with smothered exclamations of delight  oh nuttie how good of you  please to excuse the accompaniment there never was such a young lady for selfassertion to make up for there being so little of her  and annaple very thin and tired looking held up the child fearfully small and pinched for four months old to be kissed by nuttie  does she always go on like this  cept when she is asleep said willie  poor wee lassie said annaple theres great excuse for her for the food has not yet been invented that suits her ladyship  you must come and consult nurse  and how are you all  im glad you are at hand nuttie  is mr egremont better  as well as ever he islame and altogether an invalidbut he has not had such bad attacks of pain lately  and his eyes  about the same  he can write and tell one card from another but he cant reador rather it hurts him to do so and he cant bear a strong light  but annaple how are you  that child is wearing you to a shadow  oh im quite wellperfectly  there i think she is gone off at last  you had better walk her about a little emily she will break out again if we try to put her in the cradle  and having handed over the child with only a very low murmur annaple left her combined kitchen and nursery  she flew at the flowers nuttie had brought like a thirsty person crying as she buried her face in them now for beauty  now mark will be refreshed  ah heres a pretty pickle for a reception room  oh dont put it away  i could help you i do so like that kind of work  it is so like old times  it must be put away thank you for mark will be coming in  and the saying about the public washing of garments is specially true of ones own husband  ways and means are worrying to the masculine mind  i thought it was too early for mark  he has an appointment to keep at charing cross or thereabouts so i made him promise to come in in time to put a bit in his head as our irish charwoman says  then i can take him  i have the carriage and i must be at home by halfpast twelve  i wish you would come too annaple  theres plenty of room  you could show the baby to nurse and the boys could have a good game  i would send you back in the evening  mark could come on after his business is done  thank you nuttie i cant todayfor a whole heap of domestic reasons but if you can get mark to come do it would be so good for him  how is mark  he is well quite well said annaple and so good and patient but you see it does take it out of a man when that doleful little noise wont stop all night  we are both acquiring a form of somnambulism but when theres real outofdoor business to be done it is not like proper sleep  or when theres womans indoor business i am afraid said nuttie much concerned at the extreme thinness of annaples face and hands and the weary look of her large eyes  oh one makes that up at odd times she answered brightly  one thing is this work suits mark he feels that he can do it and he gets on well with the men  they asked him to join in their club and he was so much pleased  he gets up subjects for them and i am so glad he has such a pleasure and interest to keep him from missing the society he was used to  it must be very good for them too  mr dutton said he really thought mark had kept them from going in for a strike  besides the glory of the thing said annaple drawing herself up mr dobbs thought so too and raised us ten pounds which made us able to import that little bridgefield lassie to hold babywhenwhen miss jenny will let her  he has some law copying to do besides but i dont like that it burns the candle at both ends and he does get bad headaches sometimes and goes on all the same  you must both come and see my wyn  ah i had never asked after him  i suppose he is as pretty as ever said annaple who secretly thought his beauty too girlish compared with her sturdy billy  prettier i think as he gets more expression  we cant persuade ourselves to cut his hair and it looks so lovely on his sailor suit and he is so good  i could not have believed a child could be so quiet and considerate on a journey  you should have seen him standing by my fathers knee in the railway carriage and amusing him with all that was to be seen and stopping at the least hint that he was chattering too much  billy is wonderfully helpful  ah and annaples eyes lighted up as the step that had music int came up the stair and as mark came in nuttie thought him grown older his hair thinner his shoulders rounded and his office coat shabby but she saw something in his countenance there had never been before  ever since she had known him he had worn a certain air of depression or perhaps more truly of failure and perplexity which kept before her conscious mind the desdichado on ivanhoes shield even when he was a gentleman at ease at the luxurious rectory but there was now not only the settled air of a man who had found his vocation but something of the selfrespect and eagerness of one who was doing it well and feeling himself valued  is baby he began  oh nuttie  are you there  mr dutton told me you were coming  how is my uncle  and the voice was much brisker than in the days of lawntennis  father father look cried the boy  why billyboy you are set up  zouaves and chasseurs  i see where they came from  during the mixture of greetings and inquiries admiration of the flowers and the exhibition of billys treasures annaple glided away and presently placed before him a tray daintily benapkinned and set forth with a little cup of soup  baby is really asleep and emily as proud as a hielandman she said now eat this without more ado for that good nuttie is going to set you down at charing cross  this is the way we spoil our husbands nuttie said mark refections served up at every turn  only bones  the immortal pot au feu said annaple  and you are to go on after you have interviewed your man of steel and have tea with nuttie and pay your respects to your uncle like a dutiful nephew  no that i cant nannie i promised dobbs to go and see a man for him and i must come back as soon as i can after that  he lookedas to figure and airmuch more like his old self when he had changed his coat  they fed him almost against his will with a few of the forced strawberries nuttie had brought  billy pressed on him wonders from a paris bonbon box and annaple fastened a rose and a pink in his buttonhole and came down to the street door with her boy to see him off  what do you think of her was marks first inquiry  think  as mr dutton said long ago never was braver lady  never was there a truer word  i meant as to her health  as to courage spirits and temper there is no question i never saw them fail but are they not almost too much for the frame he asked anxiously  it echoed nutties fear but she tried to frame a cheerful answer she is very thin but she seems well  she never complains but i am sure her strength is not what it was she cannot walk out as she did at first  indeed she gets no real rest day nor night and theres no relieving her  she says you dont get much rest either  more than my share said mark  the poor little thing never sleeps except in someones arms and if awake is not content for a moment except in her mothers  and that has been going on four months  three  ever since we brought her back from redcastle  i have nearly determined to move into some suburb when i get a rise at michaelmas unless she improves  nurse might suggest something  or at any rate tell us what to think  we showed her to a doctor and all he could propose was some kind of food which was no more successful than the rest  did you look at her nuttie  she is a pretty little thing when she is quiet but she dwindles awayat least so it seems to me though annaple will not see it andand if we are not permitted to keep the little one i dread what the effect may be on her  nuttie said something about bravery and goodness thinking in her heart that if the blow fell it would be better for all than the perpetual suffering of the poor little sickly being  ah you dont know what her affections are said mark  you did not see her when she lost her mother and there had been no strain on her powers then  however ive no business to croak  many a child gets over troubles of this kind and as annaple says little jenny will be all the more to us for what we go through with her  the carriage stopped and nuttie asked him if it would delay him too long if she executed a commission about her fathers glasses  he had plenty of time but she was delayed longer than she expected and on her return was surprised to find that he had dropped asleep  ah thats what comes of a moments quiet he said smiling  fine quiet in the roar of ludgate hill  to a cockney tis as the mill to the miller  i like the full stir and tide he added looking out upon it  i never knew what life was before  i should have thought you never knew what hardness and hard work were  thats just it he answered smiling  the swing of it is exhilarationvery different from being a cumberer of the ground  oh mark all the privations and anxiety  the privation thats nothing  indeed i am afraidyes i am ashamed to sayit falls more on my dear wife than myself but if we can only wear through a year or two we shall get a further rise and my poor annaple may get out of this drudgery  please god she and the little one can stand it for a time and i think she has a spring within her that will then as he saw tears in his cousins eyes he added dont be unhappy about it nuttie i have had it in my mind ever so long to tell you that the finding you at micklethwayte was the best thing that ever happened to me  yes so far as character went ursula could believe that it had been so  he was twice the man he would have been without the incentive to work and the constant exercise of patience and cheerfulness but her heart was heavy with apprehension that the weight of the trial might be too heavy  to her eyes the babys life seemed extremely doubtful and annaple looked so fragile that the increase of her burthens any saddening of the heart might destroy her elasticity and crush her outright while even mark seemed to her to be toiling so close within the limits of his powers that a straw might break the camels back  she longed to talk to mr dutton about them but she found herself doomed to a day that perhaps annaple would have thought more trying than her harrowed life  she was a little later than she had intended and her father had been waiting impatiently to have a note read to him so he growled at her impatience to run after that scotch girl  and the note happened to be of an irritating nature moreover the cutlets at luncheon were said to be akin to indiarubber and there was the wrong flavour in the sauce  ursula let that cook do what she pleased without remonstrance  even alwyn did not afford as much satisfaction as usual for the boy was in high spirits and wanted to blow a little trumpet which was more than his father could stand  he was very good when this was silenced but he then began to rush round the room daring his sister to catch the wild colt as he went by  this had likewise to be stopped with the murmur that ursula spoilt the child  she tried to compose matters by turning out the old toys in the ottoman but alwyn had outgrown most of them and did not care for any except a certain wooden donkey minus one ear and a leg which went by the name of sambo and had absorbed a good deal of his affection  he had with difficulty been consoled for sambo being left behind and now turned over everything with considerable clatter in search of him alas  sambo could nowhere be found in the room and alwyn dashed off to inquire of all the household after him  his father meanwhile growled at the childs noise and went on trying the glasses nuttie had brought and pronouncing each pair in turn useless vowing that it was no use to send her anywhere  upon this back came alwyn terribly distressed and indignant for he had extracted from the housemaid left in charge who was as cross as she was trustworthy what that old broken thing master egremont i threw it on the fire  id never have thought a young gentleman of your age would have cared for such rubbish as that  you are a wicked cruel woman returned alwyn with flashing eyes i shall tell papa and sister of you  and in he flew sobbing with grief and wrath for the dear sambo feeling as if it had been a live donkey burnt to death and hiding his face on his sisters breast for consolation  come come wyn said his father who did not brook interruption heres half a sovereign to go and buy a new donkey  it wont be sambo said alwyn ruefully  but you should thank papa said nuttie  thank you papa he said with quivering lip but i dont want a new one  oh sambo sambo burnt and he climbed on nutties lap hid his face against her and cried but her comfortings were broken off by how can you encourage the child in being so foolish  have done wyn dont be such a baby  go out with nurse and buy what you like but i cant have crying here  he tried to stop in sheer amazement but the ground swell of sob could not be controlled  nuttie was going to lead him away and console him with more imaginative sympathy than could be expected from the maids but her father sharply called her back  he wanted her himself and indeed there was no question which was the worse spoilt child  he might idolise alwyn but not so as to clash with his own comforts  the glasses being unsuccessful nuttie proposed to drive back to ludgate hill for him to choose for himself but he would not hear of going into the heat of the city and growled at her for thinking of such a thing  they took an aimless drive instead in the park and nuttie was nearly baked while the carriage was stopped for her father to have a long talk over the prospects of the derby day with one of his most unpleasant associates who stood leaning over the door on the shady side of the carriage no one recking how little protection she derived from her small fringed parasol  she came home tired out and thankful that her father went to rest in his own room  she climbed to the nursery thinking to share alwyns tea and comfort him but she found only nurse there  nurse had a bad foot and dreaded hot pavement so she had sent master alwyn out with her subordinate a country girl to play in mr duttons garden till it should be cool enough to go and make his purchase and a message had since arrived that he was going to drink tea there and mr dutton would take him out  his sister envied him the green shades and had just done her best to cool the back drawingroom and rest herself with a book when mr fane was announced  he talked pleasantly enough and lingered and lingered no doubt intending to be asked to dinner but she was equally determined to do no such thing  she had heard enough of races for one day she thought and at last he took his leave only just before she dressed for dinner  i thought fane was here said mr egremont as he came in no doubt told by gregorio  he has been but he is gone  you didnt ask him to stay and dine  i did not know you wished it  you might have known that i should have liked to see him  i suppose you think your sweet self society enough for any man  i am sorry  im sick of hearing you are sorry  i believe theres nothing you like so well as doing an ungracious thing to a friend of mine  nuttie had learnt to hold her tongue on such occasions  dinner was nearly over and her father had been grumbling again at having no one to take a hand at cards with him when the door opened a little way and alwyns pretty glowing face looked in  he was come to say goodnight rather later than usual and he ran up to his sister with a little bouquet of yellow banksia and forgetmenots mithter buttonso alwyn called himsent you this  he said you would like it cause it came from one that grew at mittletwait  and oh look look  he was hugging a little ship which he proudly exhibited while his fathers brow had darkened at the message  did you buy that asked his sister  yes mr button went with me and we sailed it  we sailed it by the fountain in mr buttons garden and we made a storm  he danced about with glee and mr egremont observed a dear purchase for ten shillings  did it cost all that wyn  they gived me a big silver halfcrown and i gived that to a little boy what came to speak to mr button and had his toes through his boots and he was so glad  your money is not for beggars wyn  the little boy was not a beggar papa  he came with a newspaper to mr button and he is so good to his poor sick mother said alwyn see see sister turning the prow of his small vessel towards her and showing a word on it in pencil which he required her to spell out it was ursula  oh wynnie she said duly flattered did mr dutton do that  he held my hand and i did cried alwyn triumphantly and he will paint it on saturday  then it will dry all sunday and not come off so it will be the ursula for ever and always  here nurse claimed her charge and when the goodnights were over and a murmur recommenced nuttie suggested that if mr dutton was at home perhaps he would come in and make up the game but she encountered the old humour  ill tell you what ursula ill not have that umbrella fellow encouraged about the house and if that child is to be made the medium of communication ill put a stop to it  the words were spoken just as gregorio had entered the room with a handkerchief of his masters  nuttie colouring deeply at the insult met his triumphant eyes bit her lips and deigned no word of reply  an undefined but very slight odour that told her of opium smoke pervaded the stairs that night  it was the only refuge from fretfulness but her heart ached for her father herself and most of all for her little brother  and was she to be cut off from her only counsellor     chapter xxxiii  the lost heir    seemed to the boy some comrade gay   led him forth to the woods to playscott   though it was the derby day mr egremonts racing days were over and he only took his daughter with him in quest of the spectacles he wanted  when they came back nuttie mounted to the nursery but no little brother met her on the stairs and she found nurse in deep displeasure with her subordinate  i sent him out with ellen to play in the garden at springfield and swim his ship where he couldnt come to no harm said nurse being that my foot is that bad i cant walk the length of the street and what does the girl do but lets that there gregorio take the dear child and gogoodness knows wherewithout her  im sure maam said the girl crying i would never have done it but mr gregory said as how twas his papas wish  what was said nuttie  that he shouldnt never go and play at mr duttons again said ellen  i told her she was to take her orders off me and no one else returned nurse except of course you miss egremont as has the right  quite so you should have told mr gregorio so ellen  i did maam but he said those was mr egremonts orders and he said cried the girl unable to withstand the pleasure of repeating something disagreeable that mr egremont wouldnt have no messengers between you and a low tradesman fellow as made umbrellas and wanted to insinuate himself in here  thats quite enough ellen i dont want to hear any impertinences perhaps you did not understand his foreign accent  did he say where he was going  i think he said hed take him to the serpentine to sail his ship said ellen disposed to carry on asseverations of the correctness of her report but nurse ordered her off the scene and proceeded as a confidential servant the girl had no call to repeat it but theres not a doubt of it he did say something of the sort  theres not one of us but knows he is dead against mr dutton because he tried to get master to get to sleep without that nasty opium smoke of his  there was bitter feud between nurse and valet and nuttie could have exchanged with her many a lament but she contented herself with saying i wish he would let master alwyn alone  it is high time they should come in  the child will be tired to death and all dirt  his nice new sailor suit too  going grubbing about at the serpentine with no one knows who as isnt fit for a young gentleman moaned nurse  this however was the worst fear she entertained and it was with a certain malicious satisfaction that she heard her masters bell for gregorio  nuttie descended to explain and whereas the need was not very urgent and she looked distressed and angered at the valet her father received her complaint with well the boy is getting too big to be tied for ever to a nurserymaid  it will do him good to go about with a man  but as dressingtime came on and still neither gregorio nor alwyn appeared mr egremont became impatient and declared that the valet had no business to keep the child out so long indeed he would sooner have taken alarm but for nutties manifest agony of anxiety starting and rushing to listen at every ring at the bell or sound of wheels near at hand  at last at eight oclock there was a peal of the servants bell and the footman who answered it turned round to the anxious crowd mr gregory  he just asked if the child was come home and went off like lightning  the villain  hes lost him shrieked nurse with a wild scream run after him james  catch him up suggested the butler at the same moment  make him tell where he saw him last  james was not a genius but the hall boy an alert young fellow had already dashed down the steps in pursuit and came up with the valet so as to delay him till the other servants stood round and gregorio turned back with them pale breathless evidently terribly dismayed and unwilling to face his master who stood at the top of the steps white with alarm and wrath  sir cried gregorio with a stammering of mixed languages i have been searching everywhere  i was going to give notice to the police je ferai tout  je le trouverai  where did you lose him demanded mr egremont in a hoarse voice such as nuttie had never heard  in the park near the bridge over the serpentine  i was speaking for a few moments to a friend  bah  il etait parti  mais je le trouverai  parker he seeks too  fear not sir i shall find him  find him you scoundrel or never dare to see me again  ive borne with your insolences long and now youve brought them to a height go i say find my boy exclaimed mr egremont with a fierce oath and passionate gesture and gregorio vanished again  bring the carriageno call a cab commanded mr egremont snatching up his hat  who is this parker  the servants hesitated but the butler said he believed the man to be a friend of gregorios employed at one of the clubs  nuttie meanwhile begging her father not to go without her flew upstairs to put on her hat and coming down at full speed found that mr dutton passing by and seeing the open door and the terrified servants on the steps had turned in to ask what was the matter and was hearing in no measured terms from mr egremont how the child had been taken away from his nurse and lost in the park while that scamp gregorio was chattering to some goodfornothing friend  to nutties great relief mr dutton offered to go with the father to assist in the search and the coachman far too anxious and excited to let his master go without him in a cab contrived to bring up the carriage  some of the servants were ordered off to the various police offices  poor nurse who was nearly distracted started in a hansom on her own account persuaded that she should see and recognise traces of her darling at the scene of his loss and she almost raced the carriage which was bound for the same spot  sluggish natures like mr egremonts can sometimes be roused to great violence and then pour forth the long pentup accumulations kept back by indolence and indifference  his only occupation during the rapid drive was to vituperate his valet the curse of his life he said  to hear him talk it would have seemed as if gregorio had been the tyrant who had kept him in bondage all these years fully aware of his falsehood peculation and other rascality but as unable to break the yoke as if he had been in truth the slave of anything but his own evil habit and helpless acquiescence  would it last if gregorio made his appearance at that instant with alwyn in his hand  or even as mr dutton confidently predicted a policeman might bring the boy home before many hours were passed the chief doubt here was that alwyns defective pronunciation which had been rather foolishly encouraged might make it difficult to understand his mode  of saying his own name or even that of the street if he knew it perfectly but the year he had been absent from london had prevented him from acquiring the curious ready local instinct of the true town child and he had been so much guarded and watched that he was likely to be utterly at a loss when left alone and nuttie was wretched at the thought of his terror and loneliness even while mr dutton told her of speedy recoveries of lost children through kind people or the police  they found all the officials of the park already aware and on the alert and quite certain of the impossibility of nurses prime dread that the boy had fallen into the water unseen by any one and been drowned  she was even ready to look into every bush in case he had been frightened and hidden himself and nothing would satisfy her but to stay making these researches when her master had decided on endeavouring to find parker at the club and to ascertain from him particulars of time and place  he was found there  the dinnerhour had brought him back he being a man in authority there very well dressed and deferential declaring himself immensely distressed at the occurrence and at having accosted gregorio and attracted his attention  it was about four oclock he thought and he described the exact spot where the little boy had been sailing his vessel fastened to a string  they might have been talking twenty minutes or half an hour when gregorio missed his charge and since that time both had been doing all in their power to find him until halfpast seven when he had to return to his club and gregorio went to see whether the child had been taken home  by this time mr egremont looked so utterly exhausted that mr dutton availed himself of the hope that the boy might be found safe at home to take him back but alas nothing had been heard there  the poor man was in a restless unmanageable state of excitement almost as terrifying to his daughter as the distress that occasioned it  he swallowed a tumblerful of claret but would not eat nor go to bed and indeed gregorio alone having had the personal charge of him latterly sleeping in his dressingroom none of the other servants knew what to do for him  mr dutton agreed with her that it would be better to send for his doctor as probably he ought to have a sedative and neither would take the responsibility of giving it while he himself declared he neither would nor could rest till he had his boy again  the doctor was dining out and they had two terrible hours while mr egremont paced to the windows threw himself on the sofa denounced gregorio or for a change all the system of police which had made no discovery and ursula for letting the boy be so helpless  mr dutton sometimes diverted his attention for a few minutes and hoped he would doze but the least sound brought him to his feet again and the only congenial occupation was the composition of a description of poor little alwyns person and dress which set nuttie crying so uncontrollably that she had to run out of the room  dr brownlow came at last and was very kind and helpful taking the command and insisting that mr egremont should go to bed and take the dose which he mixed  broadbent the butler was to take gregorios place but he was a ponderous man without much tact and unused to the valets office  i might just as well have a rhinoceros about me said mr egremont in a fit of irritation and it ended nuttie hardly knew how in mr duttons going upstairs to smooth matters  he came down after a time and said i am not satisfied to leave him alone or to broadbent i have his consent to my sleeping in the dressingroom i am just going home to fetch my things  let me find you gone when i come back  you will hear no more tonight  even if he is found they will keep him till morning  it is of no use i cant sleep  even if you dont the mere restful position will make you fitter for the morrow  will you promise me to undress and really go to bed  oh yes if you say i must said nuttie drearily following an instinct of obedience  and remember he said though i do not say it will be so this may be deliverance from bondage  but what a terrible deliverance  bonds are not burst without something terrible  no dont be frightened  remember there is safekeeping for that sweet little fellow wherever he may be  oh mr dutton if i could pray for him but the turmoil seems to have driven away all such things  my boy my boy where is he now who has heard him say his little prayers  his heavenly father has of that we may be secure  you will feel it in the quiet of your own room  goodnight  and i shall know you are praying better than i can murmured nuttie as she returned his goodnight and crept up to her chamber     chapter xxxiv  fetters rent    the gods are just and of our pleasant sins   make whips to scourge usking lear   there was no real sleep for ursula that short summer night  she saw the early dawn listened to the distant roll of marketcarts and wondered when it would be reasonable to be afoot and ready to hear if aught there was to hear  at any hour after seven surely the finders would have mercy and bring the welcome news  and just before seven she fell asleep deeply soundly and never woke till past eight but that was just enough to revive the power of hope and give the sense of a new day  but there was nothing to hearno news  she found mr dutton in the diningroom  he had had to administer another draught to her father and had left him in a sleep which would probably last for some time  if she would go and sit in the outer room after her breakfast he would go out to obtain intelligence  you must have some breakfast she said ringing the bell and wistfully looking over the blinds then exclaiming oh theres mark has he heard anything and out she darted opening the door before he rang  mark have you found him  yes he said gravely looking utterly amazed as she clasped her hands and seemed ready to fling herself on his neck with joy  i came because it will be a great shock to my uncle  then it is so  nurse was right said nuttie turning deadly pale and standing as if before a firing platoon  tell me mark where did they find him  at the faringdon station  i was sent for to identify him  stay said mr dutton as there was a wild horrified look in nutties eyes  do you mean little alwyn  little alwyn  no certainly not  what of him  gregorio managed to lose him in the park yesterday put in mr dutton  that accounts for it then said mark  no it was gregorio himself poor man  he was knocked down by the engine and killed on the spot just by the station at eleven oclock last night  our name was found on him and i was sent for early this morning  there was no doubt about it so i came on here at once to let my uncle know little thinking  oh it is dreadful cried nuttie sinking into a chair  do you remember my father told him never to see his face again unless he found alwyn  broadbent came in at the moment with the coffeepot and stood suspended as he was told what had happened mark adding the detail he was crossing the line in front of the engine  yes sir said the butler  it is an awful dispensation  no doubt he knew it was all up with him  you may not be aware sir of the subject of his conversation in the park  mr parker had just seen a telegram of the result of the derby and he had heavy bets on lady edina  i am afraid sir there can be no doubt that he found a voluntary grave  we will not talk of that  we cannot judge said mark shuddering i said i would send some one from here to arrange what was to be done after the inquest  broadbent immediately undertook to go if his master did not require him and this was thought advisable as his services were certainly not acceptable to mr egremont  mark had thought himself likely to be detained and had provided for his absence and the awestricken trio were consulting together over the breakfasttable eating mechanically from the very exhaustion of agitation when the door opened and mr egremont in his dressinggown was among them exclaiming you are keeping it from me  he had been wakened by the whispers and rushes of the excited maids had rung his bell in vain dressed himself as best he could after so many years of dependence and stumbled downstairs where as with his daughter it was something like a relief to know that hope was not extinguished in alwyns case  but mr egremont was in a very trembling broken condition and much overcome by his valets end after so many years of intimate association  certainly if either of the others had so parted with the man it would have been a horror in the recollection but he did not seem to dwell on it and indeed attention was distracted by every sound at the door since each might bring news of the missing child  one of these tantalising rings proved to be a policeman with poor gregorios keys and a demand for an investigation into any papers he might have left which would show his state of mind  mr egremont was very much annoyed declaring that he would have no stranger meddle with them and that he saw no use in such prying  what difference could it make to any living creature  however when he found there was no help for it he said he must do it himself nuttie offered to help but was sharply strongly refused  mark alone might and should help  then mr dutton volunteered to go and explain matters to mr dobbs so as to get freedom for mark for at least the remainder of the day he would call at the police offices and see what was doing in the search put forward the advertisements and obtain that the serpentine should be dragged for he saw that only that measure would remove one great terror from these anxious hearts  and he said to mark with your permission i will bring back mrs egremont and the children if they will do me the honour to become my guests  she will be a comfort to miss egremont and then you will be at hand in the evening  mark could only be thankful and presently addressed himself to the investigation which his uncle insisted should be made in his own presence though the opiate kept him for the most part dozing in an armchair only rousing up now and then by some noise at the front door or putting queries the replies to which startled him more and more as he grew more wakeful and mark proceeded  all except a few unimportant bills and a bettingbook was locked into a dressingcase that had once belonged to mr egremont and had tricks of secret drawers that only he could explain  it was full of papers and they were a strange revelation that mr egremont might well wish to withhold from his daughter  they went very far back and of course did not come out in order of chronology nor would mark have understood them but for exclamations and comments here and there from his uncle  everything seemed to be therethe old passport and certificate to gregorio savelli when he left his savoyard home to be a waiter at a hotel a few letters in italian probably from his parents which mark could not read but which soon ceased the countersigned character with which he had entered general egremonts service and then came a note or two signed a p e which mr egremont regarded with great annoyance though they only consisted of such phrases as back on wednesday  find an excuse or in french envoyez moi la petite boite  que la porte soit ouverte apres minuit  that was the way groaned mr egremont  the scoundrel he kept all those to be able to show me up to the general if he chose  i was a young man then mark not the straitlaced lad youve always been and the general  a bad old dog he was went far beyond what i ever did but for all that he had no notion of any one going any way but his own and wanted to rein me in as tight as if he had been an epitome of all the virtues  and gregorio seemed a goodnatured young fellow then and made things easy for me though no doubt he meant to have me in his hands in case i tried to shake him off  another discovery affected him far more  it was of a letter in alices handwriting addressed to captain egremont in the yacht ninonposte restante madeira  he had never seen it never known of its existence gregorio had gone to inquire for the letters and had suppressed it mr egremont had wondered how he had become aware of the marriage  his knowledge had from that time been used as a means of enforcing the need of a good understanding with the heir  mr egremont was much moved by the sight of the letter and its date from dieppe about six months after he had left his young wife there he made mark give it to him unread handled it tenderly struggled to read the delicate pointed writing to himself but soon deferred the attempt observing there there i cant stand it now  but you see mark he added after an interval i was not altogether the heartless brute you thought me  mark as he told his wife afterwards could not help thinking of the old preamble to indictments by the temptation of the devil  and by and by out of a pocketbook bearing the date of the generals death came a copy of the certificate of the baptism of ursula alice daughter of alwyn piercefield and alice egremont together with that address which miss headworth had left at dieppe to gratify alices forlorn idea of a possible rescue and which gregorio had asseverated to be nonexistent  doubtless he infinitely preferred his masters wandering bachelor life to the resumption of marriage ties and thus he had contrived to keep mr egremont from meeting the houghtons at florence  at the same time the uncertainty as to alices fate had prevented any other marriage gregorio had taken care that if mr egremont had been villain enough to make such an attempt he should know that his secret could be brought to light  compared with all this wickedness the proofs of fraud and dishonesty were entirely unimportant  gambling had evidently been a passion with the valet and peculation had followed and mark could have traced out the full tide before the reinstatement of mrs egremont in her home the gradual ebb during her reign the diminished restraint under her daughter  the other servants had formerly been implicated but except a young groom and footman mark thought the present set quite free from the taint and was glad to acquit broadbent  but the last telegrams and the bettingbook in the unhappy mans pocket confirmed parkers evidence that of late he had staked almost madly and had risked sums far beyond any means he could raise upon the horse which had failed the bailiff at bridgefield had it had long been guessed played into his hands but to what an extent mark only now discovered  the result was that what he had learnt in the park had so astounded him that his inattention to the child had not been wonderful  he hadas parker testifiedsought the little fellow vehemently and had he been successful he might yet have made some effort trusting to his masters toleration but the loss and reproach had made him an absolutely desperate man  was it blind flight or selfdestruction that he had money about him having cashed a cheque of his masters favoured the first idea and no one would too curiously inquire whether mr egremont was aware of the amount  it was only too true that as he had said gregorio savelli had been the curse of his life having become one of the whips left by pleasant vices and the breaking of the yoke had been not only at a terrible price but to a man in his halfblind and invalid condition the actual loss of the person on whom he had depended was a privation  dr brownlow however knew of a good manservant just set at liberty by the death of an invalid master and promised to send him on trial  it was a day of agitations and disappointments a sample of many that were to follow  there was not a sound of a bell that did not make anxious hearts throb  and oh how many were spent on vain reports on mere calls of sympathy by acquaintance whom the father and sister could not see and on notes of inquiry or condolence that nuttie had to answer  annaple came and was a great help and support to her  poor nurse oblivious of her bad foot or perhaps willing to wreak vengeance on it as the cause of all the mischief had insisted on continuing her search in the morning under all the thorns and rhododendrons where she thought the dear lamb might have hidden and cried himself to sleep and at last had been brought home in a cab quite worn out and despairing  but the screaming baby proved to be a much better comforter to her than any amount of reasonable argument  to soothe it to understand what ailed it to find suitable food for it was an occupation which made the suspense less intolerable  the very handling of an infant would have been congenial and a sickly crying one was only too interesting willie was too near her darlings age to be a welcome sight but he was already a prime pet with the servants at springfield and annaple secure that her children were in safe and experienced hands and overflowing with motherly sympathy for the grievous loss was ready to devote herself to nuttie whether by talk by letter writing or by seeing inquiring friends  she did not expect to be of any use to mr egremont who had always held aloof from and disliked the giggling scotch girl but who came drearily wandering at an unexpected time into the room where she was sitting with his daughter and presently was involved in their conversation  whether it was the absence of the poor familiar or that annaple was no longer a giggling girl but a brave cheerful wife and mother it was certain that he found the same comfort and support in her presence as did nuttie  when fits of restless misery and despair pressed hardest upon him it was soon perceived that annaples cheerful tact enabled her to deal with him as no one else could do  there was the restraint of courtesy towards her such as had worn out towards his daughter and besides her sanguine optimist spirit never became so depressed as did poor nutties  mark went by day to his work but came back to dine at his uncles hear the reports and do what he could for him and meantime annaple spent the chief part of the day in aiding nuttie and mr egremont while her baby really showed signs of improvement in nurses keeping  and so the days went on while every endeavour was made to trace the child but with no result but bitter disappointment  twice strayed children younger than alwynone even a girlwere brought as the lost boy and the advertisements bore fruit in more than one harassing and heartless correspondence with wretches who professed to be ready to restore the child on promises of absolute secrecy and sums of money sent beforehand with all sorts of precautions against interference from the police  the first of these created great excitement and the pursuit was committed to mr dutton  when it proved abortive mr egremonts disappointment and anger were great and he could not be persuaded that all was not the fault of mr duttons suspicion and precaution in holding back the money nor could any one persuade him that it was mere imposture  when another illwritten enigmatical letter arrived he insisted that it was from the same quarter and made broadbent conduct the negotiations with the result that after considerable sums had been paid in circuitous fashions the butler was directed to a railway arch where the child would be deposited and where he found a drabcoloured brat of whom he disposed at the nearest police station after which he came home savagely disgusted  nuttie was not much less so at what she felt as a slight to mr dutton as well as at the failure  when you are doing so much for us  we deserve that you should do nothing more she said with tears shining in her eyes  do not talk in that way he answered  you know my feeling for the dear little fellow himself and  oh yes interrupted nuttie i do trust to that  nobodynot the most indifferent person but must long to save him  yes i know it was doing you a wicked injustice to fancy that you could take offence in that way at a father in such trouble  please forgive me mr dutton  as if i had anything to forgive  as if there were anything on earth that could come before the endeavour to recover him said mr dutton too much moved for his usual precision of speech  yes he is her child said nuttie with a trembling tearful smile  her child  yes and even if he were not he is your brother said mr dutton then hastily gathering himself up as if he had said too much he rose to take leave adding as their hands clasped remember as long as i live you may count upon me  oh i know i know  theres nobody like you but i dont know what i say in this awful suspense  if i had only seen him lying white and cold and peaceful it would have been far better than to think of him pining and miserable among wicked people who would try to bring him up like themselves  mothers own little boy  it will not be allowed it will not be allowed cried mr dutton gods providence is still over him  and there are prayers i knowat our church and mr godfreysand all ours but oh it takes a great deal of faith to lean on them  i wonder if you would annaple if it were willy  we will not ask mrs egremont said mr dutton as annaple made a gesture of something like doubt  it is almost as bad said she coming up and putting her arm round nuttie  but indeed mr dutton she does trust only it is very very sore for heras it is for us all  you are her great comfort said mr dutton as he shook hands with her  he could hardly help thanking me said annaple to her husband afterwards  mr egremont may well call him an adopted uncle  i should say he was a good deal more poor man     chapter xxxv  the hull of the ursula   ten days had passed and mark and annaple were thinking that they ought to return to ordinary life and leave the bereaved ones to endeavour to construct their life afresh under the dreadful wearing uncertainty of their darlings fate  still they were detained by urgent entreaties from father and daughter who both dreaded their departure as additional desolation and as closing the door of hope and certainly even this rest was good for annaple and her baby for whom nurse had discovered a better system had really not cried more for a whole day than befitted a rational child said the mother as she walked back to springfield with her husband in the summer night after dinner on the day that broadbents negotiations had failed  nurse will break her heart at parting with her said mark  i wish we could afford to have her  afford indeed  her wages are about a quarter of your salary sir and after all tis not the nurse that guards the child as we have seen only too plainly  do you think he is alive nan  i begin to think not  he is not so young but that he could make himself known and those advertisements are so widely spread  i am sure poor nuttie would be more at rest if she could give up hope  i did not tell you before nan but dutton was going today to look at a poor little unclaimed childs body that had been found in the thames he knew him better than i so he went  he would have come if said annaple  assuredly  he meant to fetch nurse if he had any doubt but afterwards he was going to his court about his rents  he always does that on saturday evenings  mr dutton himself opened his door to the pair  well said mark  certainly not  the poor child was evidently much younger and had red hair  but look here and he held out a battered something black with a white stripe  mark understood nothing but annaple exclaimed is it his ship  yes i could swear to it for see and he pointed to some grimed almost effaced but still legible capitals which however scarcely any one but himself could have read as ursula  i guided his hand to make those the evening before he was lost said mr dutton  dear little man  and where did you find it  where i never thought of doing so  on the bed of a little crippled boy in the next court to mine  he is rather a friend of mine and i turned in to take him some strawberries  i found him hugging this  how did he get it  our liz brought it to him  our liz is a very wild specimen who has spent her life in eluding the school board officer till she is too old for his clutches but she has a soft spot in her heart for her little brother and i believe another for gerard godfrey  we must be very cautious and not excite any alarm or we shall be baffled altogether  i am not sure that i did quite prudently in giving little alf a fresh boat in exchange for this but i could not help bringing it home  you did not see the girl  no  those girls wander long and late on these hot nights and i do not think i could have got anything out of her  i have been to gerard godfrey and the next step must be left to him  the next question is whether you will tell those poor things at no 5 said mark  mr dutton hesitated  i should have no doubt of giving miss egremont the comfort of knowing that there was a possible clue but if her father insisted on setting on the police there would be very little more hope of success  i am afraid it will be more prudent to wait till we know what godfrey says  he hopes to see the girl tomorrow evening at his mission class but of course she is a very uncertain attendant there  no i cannot trust myself  annaple was forced to brook withholding the hope from the fainting hearts all the ensuing sunday which was a specially trying day as nuttie pined for her dear little companion with the pictures stories and hymns that he had always enjoyed and made pretty childish remarks about such as she began to treasure as memorable  as soon as he could early on monday morning mr dutton repaired to gerard godfreys lodgings and found that the young clergyman had succeeded in seeing the girl and had examined her so as not to put the wild creature on her guard and make her use the weapons of falsehood towards one who had never been looked on as an ally of the police  it appeared that she had brought home the ship or rather its hull from one of the lowest of lodging houses where she had employment as something between charwoman and errand girl  she had found it on what passed for a bed in its present condition one morning when going to make the extremely slight arrangements that the terrible lair which served as a common bedroom underwent and had secreted it as a prize for her little brother  at first she had been stolid and affected utter ignorance as to how it got there but mr godfrey had entreated her as a friend to try to discover and had with all his heart made a pathetic description of the girl he durst not say lady who had always been a mother to her little brother and now had lost him and was in terrible uncertainty as to his fate  that came home to lizzies feelings and she let out what she had seen or picked up in the way of gossipthat the ship had been left behind by its owner whether boy or girl liz was uncertain for it had long fair hair wore a petticoat and had been dosed with gin and something else when carried away  they said it had made noise enough when brought there by funny frank and julia they were performing folk who had come in after the derby day to have a spree and to pick up another kid to do fairies and such like because the last they had had hurt his back and had to be left in the workhouse  yes she had heard tell that they had got the child from mother bet of whom gerard had a vague idea as one of the horrible hags who not only beg themselves but provide outfits for beggars including infants to excite compassion  either she or one of her crew had picked up the child and disposed of his clothes and then finding him too old and intelligent to be safely used for begging purposes she had sold or hired him out to these acrobatic performers who had gone off into that vague and unknown region the country  liz had no notion what was their real name nor where they would go only that they attended races and fairs and as soon as the actual pleasure of communicating information was over she was seized with a panic implored mr godfrey to make no use of her information and explained that the people of the house were quite capable of killing her if they suspected her of betraying any of their transactions  it was impossible to bring any authorities to bear on the quest and mr dutton held it wisest only to write a note telling mr egremont that he had obtained evidence that the child was living and that he was going in pursuit but thought it safer to say no more at present  he gave the note to mark at his office  i cannot trust myself to see your cousin he said  i might be tempted to say more than was consistent with godfreys honour towards his informant  i think you are right said mark  you had better leave me with only indefinite knowledge for i shall be hard pressed  do you not go home first  yes i go to pack up a few things and fetch monsieur  a run in the country will do him good and he may be a valuable auxiliary  i shall find no one at springfield at this hour  what is your plan  i shall venture so far as to apply to the police for the names of the usual attendants at races and fairs and for some idea of their ordinary rounds  i have no doubt that these are known at the chief offices  for the rest i must use my eyes  but tell your cousin that with gods blessing i hope to bring him back to her  he will said ursula when mark gave her the message and from that moment she was calmer  she did not fret mark with questions even as much as annaple did she tried to prevent her father from raging at the scant information and she even endeavoured to employ herself with some of her ordinary occupations though all the time she kept up the ceaseless watch  mr dutton would not have said that without good hope she averred and i trust to him  yet when four five six eight days had passed with no tidings the heart sickness grew almost more than she could bear though she still answered with spirit when her father again took to abusing the umbrellafellow for choosing to keep all in his own hands  even annaple could not help saying to her husband that a precise prim old bachelor was the very last person for a hunt in slums and the like the very sight of him would put the people on their guard and think of his fine words she added  i wish i could go  if i started with a shawl over my head yoked to a barrelorgan i should have a far better chance than he will  i declare mark if he does not succeed well do it  well hire an organ whereon you shall play  ah you shake your head  a musical education is not required and i know i shall do something desperate soon if that dear little boy is not found     chapter xxxvi  nutties knight    the night came on and the bairnies grat   their minnie aneath the mools heard that   lyndhurst 4th julyphilip dutton to miss egremont  found waterloo 615   i knew he would said nuttie with a strange quietness but as she tried to read it to her father her voice choked and she had to hand it to annaple  but for the first time in her life she went up and voluntarily kissed her fathers forehead  and perhaps it was for the first time in his life that the exclamation broke from him thank god  perhaps it was well that the telegram had not come earlier in the day for mr egremont was very restless showing himself much shaken in nerves and spirits before the time for driving to the station which he greatly antedated  nuttie could hardly keep him in the carriage and indeed had to persuade him to return thither when he had once sprung out on the arrival of a wrong train  and after all when the train did come his blue spectacles were directed to the row of doors at the other end and nuttie was anxiously trying to save him from being jostled when a voice said here and close beside them stood mr dutton with a little boy by his side who looked up in her face and said sister  it was said in a dreamy almost puzzled way not with the ecstatic joy nuttie had figured to herself and there was something passive in the mode of his hearing his fathers my boy my boy  instinctively all turned to the harbour of the carriage mr dutton lifted alwyn in and as nuttie received him a pang shot across her as she felt how light how bony the little frame had become in these three weeks  come in  come back with us  tell us all said mr egremont as mr dutton was about to help him in  my dog said mr dutton while alwyn looked up from nestling in nutties lap to say mithter button come  and mothu  we have room for him said mr egremont graciously  here poor fellow  he has the right said mr dutton for he was the real finder  and monsieur curly and shiny occupied with great dignity the back seat beside his master while alwyn in a silent but dreamy content as if he only half understood where he was rested against his sisters bosom with his hands in his fathers  come old chap said his father cheerily tell us all about it  but alwyn only shuddered a little raised his eyelids slightly and gave a tiny faint smile  i think he is very much tired said mr dutton  there was a good deal to be done to make him presentable this morning  you must forgive me for sacrificing his curls there was nothing else to be done with them  ah and nuttie looked again  the boy was in a new rather coarse readymade sailor suit that hung loosely upon his little limbs his hair was short and he was very pale the delicate rosy flush quite gone and with it the round outline of the soft cheek and there were purple marks under the languid eyes  she bent down and kissed him saying was mr button nurse to you wynnie  he smiled again and murmured mr button made me boy again  after a question and answer or two as to main facts of place and time of the discovery mr dutton told his story  i did not effect much with my inquiries after the circuses  all i heard of were of too superior an order for kidnapping practices  however i thought the only way would be to haunt fairs and races and look at their campfollowers  at a place in hertfordshire i saw a performance advertised with several children as fairies so i went to see it  i was soon satisfied that alwyn was not there but it struck me that i had known the face of the prime hero a fine handsome supple fellow who was called in the programme herr adalbert steinfuggen or some such name  well it seemed that he knew me for as i struggled out after a considerable interval i heard myself accosted mr dutton sir surely i have the honour of speaking to mr dutton of micklethwayte i assure you he was the very pink of politeness  do you remember miss egremont abel stone  oh abel stone  he was a choir boy at micklethwayte i remember he was very handsome and had a splendid voice but he was a real monkey for mischief and nobody could manage him but mother  she was always pleading that he should not be turned out and at last he ran away  yes he went off with a circus and there he found his vocation rose and throve married the primadonna and is part owner  he seems very respectable and was so friendly and affectionate that i ventured to consult him when on hearing whom i was seeking he became warmly interested and gave me just the information i wanted he said he had little doubt that funny frank was a clown called brag with whom he had had words some years back for misusing the children he said he did not hold with harshness to the little ones in teaching them to do the feats which certainly were wonderful  if they were frightened they were nervous and met with accidents but make much of them and they thought it all fun and took a pride and pleasure in their performances  however this brag though a clever fellow could not be hindered from bullying and at last he went off with a girl of the troupe and set up on their own account  stone or whatever he pleases to call himself had met them several times but he spoke of them with great contempt as low and they did not frequent the same places as he does  however he referred to one of his men and found that they had been at epsom on the derby day and moreover that there was a report of them having lately narrowly escaped being in a scrape about a child who had been injured  there was no scruple as to advising me where to look for them or as to the best means of detection  stone was very indignant and made me understand that all his young people were either to the manner born or willingly hired out by their parents  i saw them in private life and they looked happy and wellfed but that was no guarantee for funny frank  well i followed him up without success trying each place stone had set down for me till i came last night to lyndhurst a very pretty place in the new forest where there is to be a fair tomorrow beginning this afternoon  stone advised me to look about before the affair opened while unpacking and arranging was going on well after all it was very simple  i strolled out with my dog round the field where the vans and booths were getting into order there was what i thought a little girl in a faded red petticoat sitting on the steps at the bottom of a yellow van with her head on her hands  that was me said alwyn lighting up  and mothu came and kissed fan  yes said mr dutton i verily believe we might have missed one another but monsieur ran up to him and as i was actually whistling him off i heard a little voice say mothu  mothu and saw they werewell embracing one another and then came mithter button mithter button oh take me home  eager caressing hands were held out to monsieur who jumped off the seat to receive the pats and laudations lavished on his curly round pate and had to be reduced to order before mr dutton could answer the question whether he had any further difficulty or danger  i took him up in my arms and a handsome truculentlooking woman burst out on me demanding what i was about with her child  to which i answered that she knew very well he was no such thing  her man came swaggering up declaring impudently that i had better be offbut i believe he saw that the people who came round would not take his part for he gave in much more easily than i expected  i explained as loud as i could that this was a gentlemans son who had been stolen from his nurse in the park  the man began to protest that they had found him deserted and taken him with them out of charity requesting to be paid for his keep  so i thought it better to give them a sovereign at once so as to have no further trouble and get him away as fast as i could the woman came after me making further demands but the sight of a policeman in the distance turned her back  i went up to him and explained  i found he knew all about the loss and the reward and looked regretfully at my prize  we went back to the hotel where i set alwyn to rights as well as i could sent out for some clothes such as the place would produce and which at least as he says made a boy of him again  im afraid the process was rather trying from such unaccustomed hands though he was very good and he has been asleep almost all the way home and his senses all as in a dream bound up  the heavinesswhether weariness or content still continued  alwyn seemed to find it too much trouble to talk and only gave little smiles more like his mother than himself  he clung quite desperately to his sister when mark offered to lift him from the carriage but nurse was close behind and it was good to see the little arms stretched out and the head laid on her shoulder the hand put up to stroke her cheek and the lips whispering wyns own nursie  the jubilant greeting and triumphant procession with which he was borne upstairs seemed almost to oppress him  he appeared almost as if he was afraid of wakening from a happy dream and his lively merriment seemed all gone there were only beams of recognition and gladness at wyns own nursery wyns own pretty cup touching it as if to make sure that it was real and pleased to see the twisted crusts his special treat  but he could not eat much of them and soon laid his head down as one weary with the exhaustion of content and nurse who had allowed that mr dutton had considering all things done much for the outward restoration of the daintiness of her recovered child was impatient to give him the hot bath and nights rest that was to bring back the bright joyous alwyn  so nuttie only lingered for those evening prayers she had yearned after so sorely  when she held his mothers picture to him to be kissed he raised his eyes to her and said will she come to me at night now  who my darling  she mother dear  heres her picture dear boy  not only the pictureshe came out of it when i cried up on the nastysmelling bundle in the van all in the dark  she came  yes she came and made it so nice and hushed me  i wasnt afraid to go to byby when she came  and she sang  sister cant you sing like that  not here im afraid dear dear boy she whispered holding him so tight that he gave a little cry of it hurts  then came the prayers not a word forgotten and the little voice joined in her murmured thanksgiving for bringing him home  she was much moved and awestricken at these words of her little brother but she had to dress in haste for dinner listening the while to her maids rejoinings and vituperations of the wretches who had maltreated the child  when she came down she found no one in the drawingroom but mr dutton whom her father had asked to the happiest meal that had perhaps ever been eaten in that house  she went towards him with winged steps in her white dress oh mr dutton we have not said half enough to you but we never never can  he gave a curious trembling half smile as she held out her hands to him and said the joy is great in itself speaking in a very low voice  oh i am so glad that you did it cried ursula  it would not have been half so sweet to owe it to any one else  miss egremont do you know what you are saying he exclaimed  dont call me miss egremont  you never used to  why should you  i have not dared he began  dared  dont you know you always were our own mr duttonbest wisest friend of all and now more than ever  stay he said i cannot allow you in your fervour to say such things to me unaware of the strength of feeling you are stirring within me  you you  mr dutton cried nuttie with a moments recoil  you dont mean that you care for me  i know it is preposterous he began  preposterous  yes that you should care one bit for silly foolish naughty selfwilled me  oh mr dutton you cant mean it  indeed i would have kept silence and not disturbed you with my presumption if  hush she cried  why it makes me so glad and so proud i dont know what to do  i didnt think anybody was good enough for youunless it was dear dear motherand that it should be me  it is true he said gravely my younger days were spent in a vain dream of that angel then when all that was ended i thought such things were not for me but the old feeling has wakened it seems to me in greater force than ever though i meant to have kept it in control  oh i am glad you didnt  it seems as if the world swam round with wonder and happiness and she held his hand as if to steady herself starting however as annaple opened the door saying weve been sending telegrams with the good news  then an arch light came into her bright eyes but the others were behind her and she said no more     chapter xxxvii  found and taken    the angels of the gateway     bent softly to the child   and stretched glad hands to take him     to the kingdom undefiledb m   come up and see him said nuttie as the diningroom door was shut i must feast my eyes on him  annaple replied by throwing an arm round her and looking into her eyes kissing her on each cheek and then as they reached the landing in the summer twilight waltzing round and round that narrow space with her  you ridiculous person said nuttie  do you mean that you saw  of course i did ive seen ever so long  nonsense  thats impossible  impossible to owls and bats perhaps but to nothing else not to see that there was one sole and single hero in the world to you and that to him there was one single being in the world and that being the case  but annaple you cant guess what he has always been to me  oh dont i knowa sort of archbishop of canterbury and george heriot rolled into one  so much the more reason my dear i dont know when ive been so glad in my life than that your good times should be coming  they are come in knowing this  it is only too wonderful said nuttie as they stood together among the plants in the little conservatory on the way upstairs  i always thought it insulting to him when they teased me about him  they did did they  my father incited by poor gregorio  oh annaple dont let any one guess till we know how my father will take it  what is it ellen as the nurserymaid appeared on the stairs  if you please maam mrs poole would be glad if you are coming up to the nursery  they both hastened up and nurse came out to meet them in the day nursery making a sign to ellen to take her place by the cot and withholding the two ladies  she made them come as far off as possible and then said that she was not at all satisfied about master alwyn there had been the same drowsiness and disinclination to speak and when she had undressed and washed him he had seemed tender all over and cried out and moaned as if her touch hurt him especially on one side where she felt convinced there was some injury but when she asked about it his eyes grew frightened and bewildered and he only cried in a feeble sort of way as if sobs gave him pain  she had soothed him and he had gone into his own bed with the same gentle languid gladness but had presently begun moaning and imploring in his sleep wakening with screams and entreaties oh ill do it ill try and she thought him very feverish  would it not be better that a doctor should see him  nurse was always an alarmist and nuttie could not help thinking that to wake the child to see a stranger tonight would only add to his terror and distress while annaple declared her entire belief that though no doubt the poor little fellow had been cruelly knocked about and bruised a nights rest would probably restore his bright self and make all that was past only like a bad dream  there was no judging tonight and sleep was wonderful reparation to those little beings  then however the moans and murmurs began again and now the awakening cry  they started forward and as nuttie came to the cotside the child threw himself into her bosom with sister  sister  it is sister but his eyes grew round with terror at sight of annaple and clinging tightly to nuttie he gasped send her away dont let her touch me  fans not here  to tell him she was cousin annaple billys mamma had no effect he did not seem able to understand and she could only retirenurse being thus convinced that to let him see another stranger tonight would only do further harm  nuttie and nurse succeeded in reassuring him that he was safe at home and with them and in hushing him off into what they hoped would be a quiet wholesome sleep in spite of the hot sultry night on which annaple laid a good deal of the blame of his restlessness and feverishness  nuttie only came down for a short time before the visitors went away and then she wrote a note to dr brownlow which mark promised to leave as he went to the city in the morning mr egremont in his present relief poohpoohing all fears and backing up annaples belief in the powers of tired natures soft restorer but mr dutton looked grave and said that he had remarked the extreme tenderness but had hoped that much was due to his own inexperience in handling little children the parting clasp of the hand had a world of meaning in it and nuttie openly said that she hoped to tell him after matins at st michaels how the boy was  but she could not be there  when she went upstairs at night the halfdelirious terrors had returned and there was another difficult soothing and comforting before the child slept again  nurse fancied the unwonted presence might disturb him and insisted on her going to her own room  when she returned in the morning it was to find that since daylight he had been more quietly asleep but there was a worn sunken look about his face and she could not be satisfied to leave him alone while the nurses stirred about and breakfasted  he awoke smiling and happy he looked about and said gladly wyn at home  wyns own nursery but he did not want to get up wyn so tired he said speaking of himself in the baby form that he had for several months discarded but he said his pretty thank you and took delight in breakfasting in his cot though still in a subdued way and showing great reluctance to move or be touched  nuttie was sent for to report of him to his father who would not hear for a moment of anxiety declaring that the boy would be quite well if they let him alone he only wanted rest and insisting on following out his intention of seeing a police superintendent to demand whether the kidnapping rascals could not be prosecuted  neither by nuttie nor nurse could much be extracted from the poor little fellow himself about his adventures  he could not bear to think of them and there was a mist of confusion over his mind partly from weakness partly they also thought from the drugged spirits with which he had been more than once dosed  he dimly remembered missing gregorio in the park and that he had tried to find his way home alone but some one a big boy he thought had said he would show him the way took hold of his hand dragged him he knew not where into dreadful dirt and stench and apparently had silenced him with a blow before stripping him  but it was all very indistinct he could not tell how mother bet got hold of him and the being dressed in the rags of a girl had somehow loosed his hold of his own identity  he did not seem at all certain that the poor little dirty petticoated thing who had wakened in a horrible cellar or in a dark jolting van who had been dubbed fan who had been forced by the stick to dance and twist and compelled to drink burning choking stuff was the same with alwyn in his sailor suit or in his white cot  it was dr brownlow who at once detected that there had been much of this dosing and drew forth the fact  it had probably been done whenever it was expedient that he should be hidden or unable to make any appeal to outsiders  alwyn was quite himself by day and showed no unreasonable fear or shyness but he begged not to be touched and though he tried to be good and manly could not keep from cries and screams when the doctor examined him  then it came out  its where he kicked me  who  that manmaster she said i must call him  he kicked poor little fan with his great heavy big bootscause fan would say wyns prayers  who was fan asked the puzzled doctor  himself whispered nuttie  alas himself  wyn was fan said alwyn  fans gone now  and did the man kick poor little fan repeated the doctorhere  oh dontdont  it hurts so  master said he would have none of that and he kicked with his big boot  oh  fan couldnt dance one bit after that  he could not tell how long ago this had been  he seemed to have lost all reckoning of days and probably felt as if ages had past in funny franks van but dr brownlow thought the injury could not be above two or three days old and probably it accounted for there having been no more obstructions put in the way of removing the child since he had ceased to be of use and the discovery of the injury might have brought the perpetrator into trouble  indeed as it was mr egremont caused the police to be written to demanding the arrest of the man and woman brag but they had already decamped and were never traced which was decidedly a relief to those who dreaded all that a prosecution would have involved  and dr brownlow became very grave over the injury  he said it was a surgical case and he should like to have another opinion enjoining that the child should be kept in bed and as quiet as possible till he could bring his friend in the afternoon which was no difficult matter for alwyn seemed to have no desire for anything but rest and the sight of his friends and his treasures which were laid beside him to be gently handled and stroked but not played with  mothu and mithter button were among the friends he craved for but he showed no desire to see billyboy and it was thought best to keep that young gentlemans rampant strength at a distance  the chief difficulty was with his father who declared they were all croaking and that the boy would be as well as ever tomorrow  he went and sat by the cot and talked merrily of the pony that alwyn was to ride and the yachting they would have in the summer and the little fellow smiled and was pleased but went to sleep in the midst then mr egremont went out taking annaple with him because nuttie would not go till the doctors visit was over though he declared that they were certain not to come till long after her return from the drive  he actually went to the dealers and had pony after pony paraded before the carriage choosing a charming toy shetland at last subject to its behaviour with the coachmans little boy while annaple hopefully agreed with him that alwyn would be on its back in another week  he still maintained his opinion outwardly at least when he was met on his return by nuttie with a pale almost thunderstruck face  dr brownlow had called her from trying to soothe away the fright and suffering of the examination to break to her that both he and his colleague thought very seriously of the injury and its consequences and deemed it very doubtful whether the poor little fellow could be pulled through  mr egremont was again angry declared that she had misunderstood and made the worst of it that dr brownlow was a conceited young ass that his friend played into his hands with other amenities of the same kind to which she listened with mingled irritation and pity for his unreasonableness and even at the sympathy which he found in annaples hopeful nature  the young mother never dreaded nor expected what she could not bear to think possible such as the deathwarrant of that beautiful child while nutties nature always expected the worst and indeed had read the doom in the doctors eyes and voice rather than in his words  so annaple backed mr egremont up when he made his daughter write to desire dr brownlow to call in the first advice in london and among them they made so sure that this would be effective that they actually raised nutties hopes so as to buoy her through the feverish early hours of the night when the pain was aggravated the terrors returned the boy was tormented by his duality with fan and the past miseries were acted over again  even nurse and sister did not suffice and mithter button had to be fetched by mark before he could feel quite secure that he was alwyn and not fan  indeed in these lightheaded moments a better notion was gained of what he must have endured than in the daytime when all seemed put aside or forgotten after a time he became capable of being soothed by hymns though still asking why his sister could not sing like that vision of his mother which had comforted him in his previous miseries and craving for her return then at last he fell quietly asleep and nuttie was left with a few sustaining words and a pressure from mr duttons hand  alas the new consultation could only ratify the first opinion  the injury need not have been necessarily fatal though dangerous to any young child and here it had been aggravated by previous illtreatment and by the doses of spirits that had been forced down besides which alwyn was naturally delicate andthough the doctors would not say so to father or sisterthere were hereditary predispositions that gave him the less chance of battling through  yet mr egremont concluded his purchase of the pony and insisted that alwyn should be carried to the window to see it and alwyns smile was almost enough to break nutties heart but his head drooped on nurses shoulder he hardly lifted his heavy eyelids and begged for byby again  even annaple burst into tears at the sight ran out of the room with her sobs and never augured recovery again though still she strove to cheer and while away the poor fathers piteous hours by making the most of every sign that the child was happy and not suffering much  that he would be viewed as a pale placid martyr was his sisters chief comfort  his replies as to the manner of the hurt as well as his lightheaded wanderings had made it more and more evident that the man brags brutality had been excited by his persisting in kneeling down to say his prayers aloudthe only way he knew how to say them indeed there was a recurring anxiety night and morning to kneel which had to be reasoned away even when he was too weak to make the attempt and was only appeased by sister kneeling by his side holding his hands and repeating the little prayers with him it was of his own accord that he added and forgive those people and make them good annaple burst into tears again and almost scolded when she heard of it oh dear oh dear now i know he wont get well  im glad billy isnt so horribly good  nuttie nuttie dont  you know i dont mean it only i just cant bear it  he is the sweetest little fellow in the world  and oh the cruelty of it  yes said nuttie in her dreary calmness he is too sweet and lovely and beautiful and good to be anywhere but safe with mother  for it was more apparent that they could not keep him  it did not last long there were a couple of piteous days of restless pain and distress and then came the more fatal lull and absence of suffering a drowsiness in which the little fellow sank gradually away lying with a strange calm beauty on his face and smiling feebly when he now and then lifted his eyes to rest them on sister or nurse  his father could not bear the sight  it filled him more with angry compassion than with the tender reverence and hushed awe with which ursula watched her darling slipping as it were from her hold  so mr egremont wandered wretchedly about the lower rooms while mark and annaple tried their best for him through the long summer evening darkening into night  by and by alwyn lifted his hand turned his head opened his lips and whispered hark sister she is singing the look of exceeding joy beamed more and more over the pinched little face  shes come again he said and once more come to take wyn to the dear lord  after that there were very few more long breaths before little alwyn egremonts spirit was gone to that unseen world and only the fair little frame left with that wondrous look of delighted recognition on the face     chapter xxxviii  the umbrella man   little alwyn was laid to rest beside his mother in a beautiful summer noontide  his father was not in a state to attend the funeral and was left under the care of annaple his own choice among those who offered to stay and minister to him  it was his own wish that his daughter should be to the last with her little brother  he had even said to her that she had been a good sister and his boy had been very fond of her and he would not keep her away on any account  and with a mans preference for a young and kindly woman he chose annaple to be with him rather than mr dutton remembering likewise that but for him the boy would have died in some workhouse unknown and unclaimed or among the wretches who had caused his death  so nuttie had the comfort of mr duttons going down with her as well as mark and poor brokendown nurse but not a word referring to the confession of that happy evening had passed between them during the mournful fortnight which had since elapsed  may condamine and her husband had made all as fair and consoling as they could  there were whiterobed children to bear the boy from the churchyard gate choristers sang hymns the grave was lined with moss and daisies and white roses decked the little coffin and the mound there was as much of welcome and even of triumph as befitted the innocent child whose death had in it the element of testimony to the truth  and nuttie felt it or would feel it by and by when her spirit felt less as if some precious thing had been torn up by the rootsto be safe and waiting for her elsewhere indeed but that did not solace the yearning longing for the merry loving child nor the aching pity for the crushed blighted creature whom she had watched suffering and dying  it was far beyond her power as yet to acquiesce in her aunts consolation that it was happier for the child himself than if he was to grow up to temptation from without and with an unsound constitution with dangerous hereditary proclivities  she could believe it in faith nay she had already experienced the difficulties her father had thrown in her way of dealing with him she tried to be resigned but the good sense of the canoness was too much for her  it was a day of more haste than suited the ideal of such a time for mr egremont could not be left for a night so there was only time for a luncheon with little jerks of talk and then for an hour spent in short private interviews  mrs egremont obtained from poor nurse poole all the details and moreover her opinion of mr marks baby in whom it having been born under her auspices she took a special interest  nuttie meantime was pacing the shady walk with her dear old friend miss nugent feeling it strange that her heart did not leap up at the bare presence of one she loved so much yet conscious of the soothing of her sympathy  and mary watching her all through had been struck with the increased sweetness and nobleness her countenance had acquired during these years of discipline  more of her mothers expression had come than could have been thought possible in features of such a different mould formed for so much more strength and energy  they had not met since nuttie had been summoned home to her mothers deathbed and their time was chiefly spent on reminiscences alike of the old sorrow and the new but when the time for parting was nearly come mary said affectionately and you my dear  oh i am all right said nuttie and her eyes shone with a light mary did not at the moment understand you need not be anxious for me now  i suppose that unhappy valets death makes your task easier said mary  i think it will said nuttie  poor man  he wasi cant help saying itthe evil genius of the house  dear mother knew it struggled against him and broke down in the struggle  it seems so strange that what she could not do has been done in such a manner and at such a price  i wonder whether she knew it when she welcomed her boy  her influence will aid you still said mary and you have mr dutton to help you too  i was so glad to find he was so near you  oh mr dutton exclaimed ursula in a strange tone that sent a thrill through mary though she knew not why but at that moment they were interrupted very inopportunely by mr bulfinch who could not go away without asking miss egremont whether she thought her father could see him on business if he came up to town the next day  she thought that such an interview would rouse her father and do him good advising him to call on the chance  marks teteatete had been with his sister may to whom he had much to tell of his wife and her gallant patience and energy and how curious it was that now the incubus that had weighed on his uncles household was removed the prejudice had melted away and he had grown so fond of her that next to ursula she was his best comforter  i hope that will lead to more said may  i dont see how said mark  the more we rely only on a blessing on our own exertions the better  even when annaple works within an inch of her life  now that she is on a right tack about the baby that will be easier yes may i do feel sometimes that i have brought her down to drudgery and narrowness and want of variety such as was never meant for her but she will never let me think so  she says that it is living in realities and that it makes her happier than toiling after society or rather after the world and i do believe it is true  im sure it is with me  but such work as yours mark  nonsense may i enjoy it  i did not when i was in the greenleaf firm with an undeveloped sense that goodenough was not to be trusted and we were drifting to the bad yet too green to understand or hinder it but this i thoroughly like  what does one want but honest effective work with some power of dealing with and helping those good fellows the hands to see the right and help themselves  may sighed  and yet now that poor child is gone i feel all the more how hard it is that you should be put out of the rights of your name  i never had any rights  it was the bane of my life to be supposed to have them  nothing but this could have made a man of me  and dont you have regrets for your boy  i dont think i haveprovided we can give him an educationsuch as i failed to make proper use of or annaple might be luxuriating at pera at this moment  well said may pausing as she looked up the vista of trees at the great house i cant bear it to go out of the old name  names may be taken  you dont mean that theres any chance ofoh not that horrid mr fane  certainly not  oh as a trim black figure appeared walking down the open space that man  i am not authorised to tell any one so may  yes i understand  the wretch he is taking stock of the place already  for shame  may no one has deserved so well of them  i dont care he got you into that horrid concern  and got me out of it and found my work for me  i tell you may it is the best thing that could possibly happen to your parish or the estate or my poor uncle either  and you will soon come to a better mind  never while he is to get into your place  turn back before he comes within hailing distance  before mark could do anything towards bringing his sister to a better mind he was seized on by his stepmother to propound a scheme she had hatched namely that as a mutual benefit nurse poole should be allowed the consolation of bringing her chief comforter his little daughter down with her on the visit mrs egremont had invited her to pay at redcastle  he was very grateful though doubtful whether annaple would accept the offer for she was missing her childrens company though they were only at springfield house and she had been with them part of every day  and sad as this month had been it had been such a rest from sheer physical toil that she had gained almost as much by it as the little one  there was a general assembly and coffeedrinking in the verandahmr condamine blanche and her two young sisters were all thereand may had to be duly civil to mr dutton though he came back with some waterlilies that he had fished out of the lake for nuttie and she thought it taking possession  then the londoners set forth for the station and there mark having perhaps had a hint from his wife saw nuttie and mr dutton safely bestowed by broadbent in an empty carriage and then discovered a desire to smoke and left them to themselves  they had not been alone together for more than a second since the evening of alwyns return and there was a great shyness between them which lasted till the first station was past without any irruption of newcomers  nothing had been said but a few comments on the arrangements and the attendants but probably both were trying to begin to speak and at last it was ursula who crossed over so that her face could not be seen and said in an odd tone  mr dutton  yes and he turned instantly on the alert  did you mean itwhat i thought you meant that evening  can you doubt it he said earnestly  but even then i was surprised into the avowal and i would have held it back if possible if i had guessed what was going to happen  ah but then i should not have had that drop of comfort through it all and she laid hold of his hand which returned the pressure strongly but he sedulously guarded both words and tone as he said  listen ursula before you speak again  how dear you must always be to me i cannot tell you but when i then spoke it was with the sense that on every account i should meet with strong opposition from your father and family  and now your position is altered so that the unsuitability is doubled  i am not a young man remember and my thoughts must be for you above all i want you to consider whether in the present state of affairs you would not do better to look on what then passed as unsaid or only as the ebullition of gratitude towards your old friend  let me go abroad and give you full opportunity forfor some fresh beginning likely to be fitter for you  mr dutton how can you say such horrid things  as if a dukedom would make any difference  yes he said turning towards her  if it is only the oldfriend feeling then it is better dropped but if your heart is in it child then we go on come what may  it is due to you  she raised her face towards him now and he gave a grave kiss to her forehead  she drew a long breath and said after a little pause and now i have something to say  one does think of such things even in these sad times and you can help me  i am so glad it is you because i know you will and be rejoiced to do so  you know when mark found us out first dear mother and i always felt that it was a great pity he should not have the estate he had been brought up to expect  i believe dear mother thought it would have been the right thing for me to marry him but i always did mean to give it back to him even when i didnt like him  well then you know it all seemed settled otherwise but now it is so lucky you spoke to me while that dear little fellow was with us because now you will help me to persuade my father that it is the only satisfactory thing to do to let it go in the male line to mark and his willy  i see  i see said mr dutton eagerly  it would be an infinite relief if it could be carried out  i believe my father would like it said nuttie  he cares for the name and now no one prevents it he is fond of mark and still more of annaple  and you  oh mr dutton if he will only take it in the right way i think you will make me able to do what it grieved dear mother never to have brought about for my poor father  my whole self is yours to aid you he said  you know of course that i could not ask you to detach yourself from one to whom you are so necessary  if he will permit us we will watch over him together as doing her work  thank you was all nutties lips could utter though her hand said much more  and before they reached london they had arranged something of a plan of action for propitiating mr egremont and bringing the future prospects to be available so as to save annaple from being worked to death in the meantime     chapter xxxix  annaples ambition fallen   well how did you get on annaple  oh very well poor old man on the whole though it made one pity him doubly that he chose to make as if he forgot everything and you were all gone on a picnic taking me out for a long drive in the afternoonwhere we were least likely to meet any onethat i will say for him  forgetting is not the best for him  as if he could forget  but he was very nice and friendly and put on his best most courteous self  i think he looks on me rather as a protector from the solemn mr edsall  surely edsall treats him well  he was excellently recommended  you know i saw his masters daughter  oh only too well  he takes the management of him as if he were three years old or a lunatic  he simply will not be offended any more than if he had to do with a baby  what should offend him  that mr egremont greatly resents being allowed nothing but by what edsall calls medical sanction  he is too blind you know to venture to pour out anything for himself and besides edsall has all the drugs under lock and key and is coolness itself about any amount of objurgations such as i fancy go on sometimes  do you think he will stand it  who  your uncle  yes i think he will  this man really makes him more comfortable than poor gregorio did  yes nuttie said she was sure that there was neglect if not bullying latterly  but he must miss gregorio terribly  they had been together for at least fiveandtwenty or thirty years and had plenty of gossip together  whereas the present paternal despotism and appalling dignity and gravity will keep him more dependent on his right congeners  if they are of the right sort thats all  he has been making me read him a whole heap of letters indeed as you know i have been doing that all along when he could not get nuttie there were some from mr bulfinch  do you know that bailiff of his must be next door to a swindler  bulfinch is coming up to see him tomorrow  and mark do you know he has been putting out feelers as if to discover whether we would dowhat he asked us to do five years ago  would you  if it were not for the children andand sometimes the extreme pinch i should say it was more like life to work yourself up as a city man said annaple  if you were the squire with all his opportunities it would be a different thing but theres no outlet there and i have often admired the wisdom of the apocryphal saying make not thyself an underling to a foolish man  well it is lucky you think so nannie for though dutton is certainly not a foolish man he will not want an underling  and what do you say to my mothers proposal of having poor poole to stay at redcastle and borrowing baby to comfort her till she goes out again  i hate it said annaple energetically  it is very horrid but it is awfully good of the canoness and i suppose we shall have to let it come to pass and miss all that most charming time of babyhood which is coming  but most likely it will quite set the little woman up and be a real kindness to poor poole  if we could only keep her for good  yes and then our children would not be half so much our own  i do want to be away with them in our own quarters  i wonder when nuttie can spare us but i should like to see her through the great crisis with her father  that crisis was to involve more than annaple in the least expected nuttie found that the momentous confession could not possibly take place before the interview with mr bulfinch at which her presence was needed to help her father with his papers  the principal concern was to show the full enormity of the bailiff and decide upon the steps to be taken the solicitor being anxious for a prosecution while a certain tenderness for poor gregorios memory or perhaps for the exposure of his own carelessness made mr egremont reluctant there was also a proposal brought forward with much diffidence from mr condamines mother to rent bridgefield house but on this as well as respecting a successor to the bailiff mr egremont was to give his answer the next day when mr bulfinch would call again  nuttie was thankful for the business that had filled up the hour after luncheon when alwyn used to play in the drawingroom and delight his father but she was feeling desperate to have the crisis over and resolved to speak when she went out driving with him  it was he however who began  i sounded marks wife yesterday ursula  she is a nice little thing enough and a good wife in her way  a very good wife  except when she persuaded him to turn up his nose at the agency dye think he would take it now since he has tasted the sweets of his umbrella business then as nuttie paused taken by surprise five hundred a year and the home farm would be better than what is it a hundred and fifty and a floor over a warehouse  i dont like to see old wills son wearing himself out there and the lad is a good honest lad with business habits who would do justice to you after i am gone  father said nuttie trembling with the effort i want you to do something better than that  i want you to let mark take the agency with a view to himselfnot me  let him be as he would have been if he had never hunted us up at micklethwayte and put me in his place  eh said mr egremont  it is not entailedworse luck if it had been i should not have been bound to dance attendance at the heels of such an old sinner as the general  no but it ought to go to the heir male and keep in the old name thinkthere have been egremonts at bridgefield for four hundred years  very pretty talk but how will it be with you miss  we shall have fane and i dont know how many more coming after the scent of bridgefield now he said with a heavy sigh ending with a bitter hang them all  and welcome said nuttie answering the thought rather than the words  father i wanted to tell you  you dont mean that any one has been after you at such a time as this he cried  it was beforei mean it was the evening when we were all so glad before we began to be afraid  the umbrella man  by jove  and now went on nuttie in spite of the explosion he would hardly have ventured to go on with it but for thisi mean as her father gave a little laugh of his unpleasant sort he said it would be the greatest possible relief and make it all right for the property to go to the heir male  hein  you think so do you  see how it will be when i come to talk to him  a shrewd fellow like that who got out of the micklethwayte concern just in time  catch him giving up a place like that though he may humbug you  then you will see him father  if you turn him in on me i cant help it  bless me umbrellas everywhere  and here you mean to turn me over to the mercies of that solemn idiot edsall  i should have been better off with poor gregorio  no father mr dutton would not take me from you  we would both try all we could to make you comfortable  convert the old reprobate  is that his dodge  dont father for the sneering tone returned  come now he added in a much more fatherly manner for her voice had struck him  you dont mean that a welllooking girl like you who could have her pick of all the swells in town can really be smitten with a priggish old retired umbrellamonger like that  why he might be your father  he has been getting younger ever since i knew him said nuttie  well  he plays as good a game of whist as any man in england muttered mr egremont leaving his daughter in actual doubt whether he meant this as a recommendation or as expressing a distrust of him as one likely to play his cards to the best advantage  she had to remain in doubt for they overtook clarence fane who came and spoke to them in a very friendly and solicitous manner and showed himself willing to accept a lift in the carriage  mr egremont willing to escape from perplexities as well as to endeavour to drive away if possible the oppression of his grief invited him in and he had some gossip to impart which at first seemed to amuse the hearer after this time of seclusion but the sick and sore heart soon wearied of it and long before the drive was over mr egremont was as much bored as his daughter had been from the first  when mr fane got out he paused a moment to hold ursulas hand in a tender manner while he told her that he had not ventured to intrude he had left a card of inquiry every day but that if ever he could be of the least use in amusing mr egremont he was at her service and would give up any engagement  hein my fine fellow  no doubt you would said mr egremont when his daughter had uttered her cold thanks and they had driven on  i see your little game but it is soon to begin it  we may as well let them know that she is booked before the running begins  it was a remarkable intimation of his acceptance of her engagement but ursula was contented to take it as such and be thankful  mr dutton had his interview as soon as mr egremont had rested after his drive and the result was satisfactory  no doubt much was due to the egremont indolence and want of energy which always preferred to let things take their course  and now that gregorio was no longer present to amuse and take all trouble off his hands mr egremont could hardly have borne to part with his daughter and despite of umbrellas and religion was not sorry to have a perfectly trustworthy soninlaw in the house able to play at cards with him manage his household and obviate all trouble about suitors for the heiress  moreover his better feelings were stirred by gratitude on his poor little sons account and he knew very well that a more brilliant match for his daughter would not have secured for his old age the care and attention he could rely upon here  he was obliged likewise to believe in the disinterestedness which disclaimed all desire for the estate as involving cares and duties for which there had been no training and he was actually glad to keep the property in the direct line  the old liking for mark and sense of the hardship of his exclusion revived strengthened now by regard for annaple together with the present relief from care obtained by making him manager of the estate  when once brought to a point mr egremont was always sudden and impetuous chiefly for the sake of having it over and being unmolested and at rest again  so that very evening while nuttie only ventured on sharing with annaple the glad tidings that mr dutton was accepted and in his marvellous goodness undertook to make his home with her father mark was almost stunned by the news confirmed to him by mr dutton as well as his uncle that he was to be acknowledged as heir of bridgefield egremont and in the meantime manage the estate with an income suitable to an oldest son  presently he came upstairs by himself and beckoned to nuttie rather to the alarm of his wife  ursula he said and took both her hands i cannot have you do this for me  cant you mark  you cant prevent it you see  and dont you know it is the beginning of all my happiness  but indeed i cannot feel it right  it is a strained sense of justice  come and tell her so nannie  what said annaple coming forward  they both paused a moment then nuttie said only that the estate ought to go in the male line  oh is that all said annaple i was afraid mr egremont had a fit  ah  dont you see what it means said mark  they want it to be as if there were an entailto begin treating me as an eldest son at once it is ursulas doing putting herself out of the succession  i always hated being an heiress said nuttie  it would be more dreadful than ever now  annaple do be sensible dont you see it is the only right thing to do  billy was the one word annaple said  yes billy and jenny and all said nuttie before youve all died of your horrid placeoh you havent heard that part of it  of course mark will have to go down to bridgefield and look after the place and live like a gentleman  eight hundred a year murmured mark and the house at the home farm  oh dear gasped annaple i wanted you to be lord mayor and now youll only be a stupid old country squire  no no nuttie itsitsits the sort of thing that one only laughs at because otherwise one would have to do the other thing  and she gripped nuttie tight round the waist and laid her head on her shoulder shaking with a few little sobs which might be one thing or the other  it will save her youth perhaps her life whispered mark lifting nutties hand to his lips for a moment and then vanishing while annaple recovered enough to say im tougher than that sir  but little jenny  oh nuttie i believe it has come in time  ive known all along that one straw more might break the camels back  weve been very happy but i am glad it is over before mark got worn down before his time  grinding is very wholesome but one may have too much and i havent marks scruples nuttie dear for i do think the place is more in his line than yours or mr duttons  yes said ursula you see he was always happy there and i never was  the next thing was for mr dutton and ursula to keep mr egremont up to the point of making his long deferred will nor did they find this so difficult as they expected for having once made up his mind he wished to have the matter concluded and he gave his instructions to bulfinch the next day  of course mark had to give full notice to his employers but the allowance was to begin at once so that annaple only went back to the warehouse to pack up since she was to occupy no 5 while mr egremont and his daughter were going under mr duttons escort to the baths in dauphine an entirely new resort free from the associations he dreaded for he could not yet bear the sight of little willythe rival boy of egremont  but the will was safely signed before he went to the great relief of nuttie who according to the experience of fiction could hardly believe his life safe till what she called justice had been done  after all mr egremont became so dependent on mr dutton during this journey that he did not like the separation at its close and pressed on the marriage even sooner than either of the lovers felt quite reverent towards the recent sorrow  he insisted on bulfinch having the settlements ready for them on their return and only let them wait long enough to keep their residence before there was a very quiet wedding in their parish church with the cousins for bridesmaids  then mark and annaple took care of mr egremont for the fortnight while mr dutton showed his wife his old haunts in france returning to springfield house where there was plenty of room for mr egremont to make his home with them  said annaple to miss nugent i never saw nuttie so youthful and bright  she is more like a girl than i ever saw her since the first  yes said mary she has some one to rest on now  mr egremont lived between three and four years more contented and peaceful than he had ever been though frequently suffering and sometimes giving way to temper and impatience  but mr dutton understood how to manage on these occasions and without giving up his own extensive usefulness could give him such care attention and amusement as beguiled his discomforts and made his daughters task an easier one  how far the sluggish enfeebled nature was capable of a touch of better things or whether his low spirits were repentance no one could judge at any rate sneers had ended and when he was laid beside his wife and boy at bridgefield ursula stood by the grave with a far more tender and hopeful feeling than she could have thought possible when he had rent her away from her old home she looked up at her husband and said is not her work done     the end
