any piece of writing that purports to tell us the secret of success in life yet how often we are disappointed to find nothing but commonplace statements or receipts that we know by heart but never follow most of the life stories of our famous and successful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element that makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp while we are searching far and near for some aladdins lamp to give coveted fortune there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out and take it like the charm in miltons comus    unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain    treads on it daily with his clouted shoon  the interesting human and vividly told story of one of the wisest and most useful lives in our own history and perhaps in any history in franklins autobiography is offered not so much a readymade formula for success as the companionship of a real flesh and blood man of extraordinary mind and quality whose daily walk and conversation will help us to meet our own difficulties much as does the example of a wise and strong friend while we are fascinated by the story we absorb the human experience through which a strong and helpful character is building  the thing that makes franklins autobiography different from every other life story of a great and successful man is just this human aspect of the account franklin told the story of his life as he himself says for the benefit of his posterity he wanted to help them by the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence and wealth he is not unmindful of the importance of his public services and their recognition yet his accounts of these achievements are given only as a part of the story and the vanity displayed is incidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital there is nothing of the impossible in the method and practice of franklin as he sets them forth the youth who reads the fascinating story is astonished to find that franklin in his early years struggled with the same everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a realization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain  there are other reasons why the autobiography should be an intimate friend of american young people here they may establish a close relationship with one of the foremost americans as well as one of the wisest men of his age  the life of benjamin franklin is of importance to every american primarily because of the part he played in securing the independence of the united states and in establishing it as a nation franklin shares with washington the honors of the revolution and of the events leading to the birth of the new nation while washington was the animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies franklin was its ablest champion abroad to franklins cogent reasoning and keen satire we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the american case in england and france while to his personality and diplomacy as well as to his facile pen we are indebted for the foreign alliance and the funds without which washingtons work must have failed his patience fortitude and practical wisdom coupled with selfsacrificing devotion to the cause of his country are hardly less noticeable than similar qualities displayed by washington in fact franklin as a public man was much like washington especially in the entire disinterestedness of his public service  franklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings he has done more than any other american to advance the material prosperity of his countrymen it is said that his widely and faithfully read maxims made philadelphia and pennsylvania wealthy while poor richards pithy sayings translated into many languages have had a worldwide influence  franklin is a good type of our american manhood although not the wealthiest or the most powerful he is undoubtedly in the versatility of his genius and achievements the greatest of our selfmade men the simple yet graphic story in the autobiography of his steady rise from humble boyhood in a tallowchandler shop by industry economy and perseverance in selfimprovement to eminence is the most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our selfmade men it is in itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be attained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following franklins maxims  franklins fame however was not confined to his own country although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of scientific and political thought and activity yet no less a keen judge and critic than lord jeffrey the famous editor of the edinburgh review a century ago said that in one point of view the name of franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of the others which illustrated the eighteenth century distinguished as a statesman he was equally great as a philosopher thus uniting in himself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits to excel in either of which is deemed the highest praise  franklin has indeed been aptly called manysided he was eminent in science and public service in diplomacy and in literature he was the edison of his day turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit of his fellowmen he perceived the identity of lightning and electricity and set up the lightning rod he invented the franklin stove still widely used and refused to patent it he possessed a masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs carlyle called him the father of all the yankees he founded a fire company assisted in founding a hospital and improved the cleaning and lighting of streets he developed journalism established the american philosophical society the public library in philadelphia and the university of pennsylvania he organized a postal system for the colonies which was the basis of the present united states post office bancroft the eminent historian called him the greatest diplomatist of his century he perfected the albany plan of union for the colonies he is the only statesman who signed the declaration of independence the treaty of alliance with france the treaty of peace with england and the constitution as a writer he has produced in his autobiography and in poor richards almanac two works that are not surpassed by similar writing he received honorary degrees from harvard and yale from oxford and st andrews and was made a fellow of the royal society which awarded him the copley gold medal for improving natural knowledge he was one of the eight foreign associates of the french academy of science  the careful study of the autobiography is also valuable because of the style in which it is written if robert louis stevenson is right in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly forcibly and interestingly cannot do better than to study franklins method franklins fame in the scientific world was due almost as much to his modest simple and sincere manner of presenting his discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which he described his experiments as to the results he was able to announce sir humphry davy the celebrated english chemist himself an excellent literary critic as well as a great scientist said a singular felicity guided all franklins researches and by very small means he established very grand truths the style and manner of his publication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the doctrine it contains  franklins place in literature is hard to determine because he was not primarily a literary man his aim in his writings as in his life work was to be helpful to his fellowmen for him writing was never an end in itself but always a means to an end yet his success as a scientist a statesman and a diplomat as well as socially was in no little part due to his ability as a writer his letters charmed all and made his correspondence eagerly sought his political arguments were the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents his scientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple and so clear that plowboy and exquisite could follow his thought or his experiment to its conclusion1      1 the manysided franklin paul l ford  as far as american literature is concerned franklin has no contemporaries before the autobiography only one literary work of importance had been produced in this countrycotton mathers magnalia a church history of new england in a ponderous stiff style franklin was the first american author to gain a wide and permanent reputation in europe the autobiography poor richard father abrahams speech or the way to wealth as well as some of the bagatelles are as widely known abroad as any american writings franklin must also be classed as the first american humorist  english literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the development of prose periodical literature reached its perfection early in the century in the tatler and the spectator of addison and steele pamphleteers flourished throughout the period the homelier prose of bunyan and defoe gradually gave place to the more elegant and artificial language of samuel johnson who set the standard for prose writing from 1745 onward this century saw the beginnings of the modern novel in fieldings tom jones richardsons clarissa harlowe sternes tristram shandy and goldsmiths vicar of wakefield gibbon wrote the decline and fall of the roman empire hume his history of england and adam smith the wealth of nations  in the simplicity and vigor of his style franklin more nearly resembles the earlier group of writers in his first essays he was not an inferior imitator of addison in his numerous parables moral allegories and apologues he showed bunyans influence but franklin was essentially a journalist in his swift terse style he is most like defoe who was the first great english journalist and master of the newspaper narrative the style of both writers is marked by homely vigorous expression satire burlesque repartee here the comparison must end defoe and his contemporaries were authors their vocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or creative power they displayed to authorship franklin laid no claim he wrote no work of the imagination he developed only incidentally a style in many respects as remarkable as that of his english contemporaries he wrote the best autobiography in existence one of the most widely known collections of maxims and an unsurpassed series of political and social satires because he was a man of unusual scope of power and usefulness who knew how to tell his fellowmen the secrets of that power and that usefulness   the story of the autobiography  the account of how franklins autobiography came to be written and of the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an interesting story the autobiography is franklins longest work and yet it is only a fragment the first part written as a letter to his son william franklin was not intended for publication and the composition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in the second part from 1730 on which was written with a view to publication the entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision in fact the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson william temple franklin in editing the work changed some of the phrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar  franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend bishop shipley at twyford in hampshire southern england in 1771 he took the manuscript completed to 1731 with him when he returned to philadelphia in 1775 it was left there with his other papers when he went to france in the following year and disappeared during the confusion incident to the revolution twentythree pages of closely written manuscript fell into the hands of abel james an old friend who sent a copy to franklin at passy near paris urging him to complete the story franklin took up the work at passy in 1784 and carried the narrative forward a few months he changed the plan to meet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader his work was soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788 when he was at home in philadelphia he was now old infirm and suffering and was still engaged in public service under these discouraging conditions the work progressed slowly it finally stopped when the narrative reached the year 1757 copies of the manuscript were sent to friends of franklin in england and france among others to monsieur le veillard at paris  the first edition of the autobiography was published in french at paris in 1791 it was clumsily and carelessly translated and was imperfect and unfinished where the translator got the manuscript is not known le veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication from this faulty french edition many others were printed some in germany two in england and another in france so great was the demand for the work  in the meantime the original manuscript of the autobiography had started on a varied and adventurous career it was left by franklin with his other works to his grandson william temple franklin whom franklin designated as his literary executor when temple franklin came to publish his grandfathers works in 1817 he sent the original manuscript of the autobiography to the daughter of le veillard in exchange for her fathers copy probably thinking the clearer transcript would make better printers copy the original manuscript thus found its way to the le veillard family and connections where it remained until sold in 1867 to mr john bigelow united states minister to france by him it was later sold to mr e dwight church of new york and passed with the rest of mr churchs library into the possession of mr henry e huntington the original manuscript of franklins autobiography now rests in the vault in mr huntingtons residence at fifth avenue and fiftyseventh street new york city  when mr bigelow came to examine his purchase he was astonished to find that what people had been reading for years as the authentic life of benjamin franklin by himself was only a garbled and incomplete version of the real autobiography temple franklin had taken unwarranted liberties with the original mr bigelow says he found more than twelve hundred changes in the text in 1868 therefore mr bigelow published the standard edition of franklins autobiography it corrected errors in the previous editions and was the first english edition to contain the short fourth part comprising the last few pages of the manuscript written during the last year of franklins life mr bigelow republished the autobiography with additional interesting matter in three volumes in 1875 in 1905 and in 1910 the text in this volume is that of mr bigelows editions2      2 for the division into chapters and the chapter     titles however the present editor is responsible  the autobiography has been reprinted in the united states many scores of times and translated into all the languages of europe it has never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at circulating libraries the reason for this popularity is not far to seek for in this work franklin told in a remarkable manner the story of a remarkable life he displayed hard common sense and a practical knowledge of the art of living he selected and arranged his material perhaps unconsciously with the unerring instinct of the journalist for the best effects his success is not a little due to his plain clear vigorous english he used short sentences and words homely expressions apt illustrations and pointed allusions franklin had a most interesting varied and unusual life he was one of the greatest conversationalists of his time  his book is the record of that unusual life told in franklins own unexcelled conversational style it is said that the best parts of boswells famous biography of samuel johnson are those parts where boswell permits johnson to tell his own story in the autobiography a no less remarkable man and talker than samuel johnson is telling his own story throughout  f w p  the gilman country school

st asaphs 1771  dear son i have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors you may remember the inquiries i made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in england and the journey i undertook for that purpose imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life many of which you are yet unacquainted with and expecting the enjoyment of a weeks uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement i sit down to write them for you to which i have besides some other inducements having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which i was born and bred to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity the conducing means i made use of which with the blessing of god so well succeeded my posterity may like to know as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations and therefore fit to be imitated      3 a small village not far from winchester in     hampshire southern england here was the country seat     of the bishop of st asaph dr jonathan shipley the     good bishop as dr franklin used to style him their     relations were intimate and confidential in his pulpit     and in the house of lords as well as in society the     bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the crown     toward the coloniesbigelow  that felicity when i reflected on it has induced me sometimes to say that were it offered to my choice i should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first so i might besides correcting the faults change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable but though this were denied i should still accept the offer since such a repetition is not to be expected the next thing most like living ones life over again seems to be a recollection of that life and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing  hereby too i shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men to be talking of themselves and their own past actions and i shall indulge it without being tiresome to others who through respect to age might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing since this may be read or not as anyone pleases and lastly i may as well confess it since my denial of it will be believed by nobody perhaps i shall a good deal gratify my own vanity4 indeed i scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words without vanity i may say etc but some vain thing immediately followed most people dislike vanity in others whatever share they have of it themselves but i give it fair quarter wherever i meet with it being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor and to others that are within his sphere of action and therefore in many cases it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank god for his vanity among the other comforts of life      4 in this connection woodrow wilson says and yet the     surprising and delightful thing about this book the     autobiography is that take it all in all it has not     the low tone of conceit but is a staunch mans sober     and unaffected assessment of himself and the     circumstances of his career      gibbon and hume the great british historians who were     contemporaries of franklin express in their     autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of     just selfpraise  and now i speak of thanking god i desire with all humility to acknowledge that i owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to his kind providence which lead me to the means i used and gave them success my belief of this induces me to hope though i must not presume that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me in continuing that happiness or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse which i may experience as others have done the complexion of my future fortune being known to him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions  the notes one of my uncles who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes once put into my hands furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors from these notes i learned that the family had lived in the same village ecton in northamptonshire5 for three hundred years and how much longer he knew not perhaps from the time when the name of franklin that before was the name of an order of people6 was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom on a freehold of about thirty acres aided by the smiths business which had continued in the family till his time the eldest son being always bred to that business a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons when i searched the registers at ecton i found an account of their births marriages and burials from the year 1555 only there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding by that register i perceived that i was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back my grandfather thomas who was born in 1598 lived at ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer when he went to live with his son john a dyer at banbury in oxfordshire with whom my father served an apprenticeship there my grandfather died and lies buried we saw his gravestone in 1758 his eldest son thomas lived in the house at ecton and left it with the land to his only child a daughter who with her husband one fisher of wellingborough sold it to mr isted now lord of the manor there my grandfather had four sons that grew up viz thomas john benjamin and josiah i will give you what account i can of them at this distance from my papers and if these are not lost in my absence you will among them find many more particulars      5 see introduction      6 a small landowner  thomas was bred a smith under his father but being ingenious and encouraged in learning as all my brothers were by an esquire palmer then the principal gentleman in that parish he qualified himself for the business of scrivener became a considerable man in the county was a chief mover of all publicspirited undertakings for the county or town of northampton and his own village of which many instances were related of him and much taken notice of and patronized by the then lord halifax he died in 1702 january 6 old style7 just four years to a day before i was born the account we received of his life and character from some old people at ecton i remember struck you as something extraordinary from its similarity to what you knew of mine had he died on the same day you said one might have supposed a transmigration      7 january 17 new style this change in the calendar     was made in 1582 by pope gregory xiii and adopted in     england in 1752 every year whose number in the common     reckoning since christ is not divisible by 4 as well as     every year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by     400 shall have 365 days and all other years shall have     366 days in the eighteenth century there was a     difference of eleven days between the old and the new     style of reckoning which the english parliament     canceled by making the 3rd of september 1752 the 14th     the julian calendar or old style is still retained     in russia and greece whose dates consequently are now     13 days behind those of other christian countries  john was bred a dyer i believe of woollens benjamin was bred a silk dyer serving an apprenticeship at london he was an ingenious man i remember him well for when i was a boy he came over to my father in boston and lived in the house with us some years he lived to a great age his grandson samuel franklin now lives in boston he left behind him two quarto volumes ms of his own poetry consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations of which the following sent to me is a specimen8 he had formed a shorthand of his own which he taught me but never practising it i have now forgot it i was named after this uncle there being a particular affection between him and my father he was very pious a great attender of sermons of the best preachers which he took down in his shorthand and had with him many volumes of them he was also much of a politician too much perhaps for his station there fell lately into my hands in london a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets relating to public affairs from 1641 to 1717 many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering but there still remain eight volumes in folio and twentyfour in quarto and in octavo a dealer in old books met with them and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him he brought them to me it seems my uncle must have left them here when he went to america which was about fifty years since there are many of his notes in the margins      8 the specimen is not in the manuscript of the     autobiography  this obscure family of ours was early in the reformation and continued protestants through the reign of queen mary when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery they had got an english bible and to conceal and secure it it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a jointstool when my greatgreatgrandfather read it to his family he turned up the jointstool upon his knees turning over the leaves then under the tapes one of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming who was an officer of the spiritual court in that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet when the bible remained concealed under it as before this anecdote i had from my uncle benjamin the family continued all of the church of england till about the end of charles the seconds reign when some of the ministers that had been outed for nonconformity holding conventicles9 in northamptonshire

law and frequently disturbed induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom by the same wife he had four children more born there and by a second wife ten more in all seventeen of which i remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table who all grew up to be men and women and married i was the youngest son and the youngest child but two and was born in boston new england10 my mother the second wife was abiah folger daughter of peter folger one of the first settlers of new england of whom honorable mention is made by cotton mather11 in his church history of that country entitled magnalia christi americana as a godly learned englishman if i remember the words rightly i have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces but only one of them was printed which i saw now many years since it was written in 1675 in the homespun verse of that time and people and addressed to those then concerned in the government there it was in favour of liberty of conscience and in behalf of the baptists quakers and other sectaries that had been under persecution ascribing the indian wars and other distresses that had befallen the country to that persecution as so many judgments of god to punish so heinous an offense and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws the whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom the six concluding lines i remember though i have forgotten the two first of the stanza but the purport of them was that his censures proceeded from goodwill and therefore he would be known to be the author    because to be a libeller says he     i hate it with my heart   from

mather 16631728 clergyman author and     scholar pastor of the north church boston he took an     active part in the persecution of witchcraft      12 nantucket  my elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades i was put to the grammarschool at eight years of age my father intending to devote me as the tithe13 of his sons to the service of the church my early readiness in learning to read which must have been very early as i do not remember when i could not read and the opinion of all his friends that i should certainly make a good scholar encouraged him in this purpose of his my uncle benjamin too approved of it and proposed to give me all his shorthand volumes of sermons i suppose as a stock to set up with if i would learn his character14 i continued however at the grammarschool not quite one year though in that time i had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it and farther was removed into the next class above it in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year but my father in the meantime from a view of the expense of a college education which having so large a family he could not well afford and the mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtainreasons that he gave to his friends in my hearingaltered his first intention took me from the grammarschool and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic kept by a then famous man mr george brownell very successful in his profession generally and that by mild encouraging methods under him i acquired fair writing pretty soon but i failed in the arithmetic and made no progress in it at ten years old i was taken home to assist my father in his business which was that of a tallowchandler and sopeboiler a business he was not bred to but had assumed on his arrival in new england and on finding his dyeing trade would not maintain his family being in little request accordingly i was employed in cutting wick for the candles filling the dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles attending the shop going of errands etc      13 tenth      14 system of shorthand  i disliked the trade and had a strong inclination for the sea but my father declared against it however living near the water i was much in and about it learnt early to swim well and to manage boats and when in a boat or canoe with other boys i was commonly allowed to govern especially in any case of difficulty and upon other occasions i was generally a leader among the boys and sometimes led them into scrapes of which i will mention one instance as it shows an early projecting public spirit tho not then justly conducted  there was a saltmarsh that bounded part of the millpond on the edge of which at high water we used to stand to fish for minnows by much trampling we had made it a mere quagmire my proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon and i showed my comrades a large heap of stones which were intended for a new house near the marsh and which would very well suit our purpose accordingly in the evening when the workmen were gone i assembled a number of my playfellows and working with them diligently like so many emmets sometimes two or three to a stone we brought them all away and built our little wharf the next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones which were found in our wharf inquiry was made after the removers we were discovered and complained of several of us were corrected by our fathers and though i pleaded the usefulness of the work mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest  i think you may like to know something of his person and character he had an excellent constitution of body was of middle stature but well set and very strong he was ingenious could draw prettily was skilled a little in music and had a clear pleasing voice so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over it was extremely agreeable to hear he had a mechanical genius too and on occasion was very handy in the use of other tradesmens tools but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters both in private and publick affairs in the latter indeed he was never employed the numerous family he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade but i remember well his being frequently visited by leading people who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred and frequently chosen an arbitrator between contending parties at his table he liked to have as often as he could some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse which might tend to improve the minds of his children by this means he turned our attention to what was good just and prudent in the conduct of life and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table whether it was well or ill dressed in or out of season of good or bad flavor preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind so that i was brot up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me and so unobservant of it that to this day if i am asked i can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what i dined upon this has been a convenience to me in traveling where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate because better instructed tastes and appetites  my mother had likewise an excellent constitution she suckled all her ten children i never knew either my father or mother to have any sickness but that of which they dyd he at 89 and she at 85 years of age they lie buried together at boston where i some years since placed a marble over their grave15 with this inscription

my rambling digressions i perceive myself to be grown old i usd to write more methodically but one does not dress for private company as for a publick ball tis perhaps only negligence  to return i continued thus employed in my fathers business for two years that is till i was twelve years old and my brother john who was bred to that business having left my father married and set up for himself at rhode island there was all appearance that i was destined to supply his place and become a tallowchandler but my dislike to the trade continuing my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable i should break away and get to sea as his son josiah had done to his great vexation he therefore sometimes took me to walk with him and see joiners bricklayers turners braziers etc at their work that he might observe my inclination and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land it has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools and it has been useful to me having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could not readily be got and to construct little machines for my experiments while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and warm in my mind my father at last fixed upon the cutlers trade and my uncle benjamins son samuel who was bred to that business in london being about that time established in boston i was sent to be with him some time on liking but his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father i was taken home again     ii  beginning life as a printer   from a child i was fond of reading and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books pleased with the pilgrims progress my first collection was of john bunyans works in separate little volumes i afterward sold them to enable me to buy r burtons historical collections they were small chapmens books16 and cheap 40 or 50 in all my fathers little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity most of which i read and have since often regretted that at a time when i had such a thirst for knowledge more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved i should not be a clergyman plutarchs lives there was in which i read abundantly and i still think that time spent to great advantage there was also a book of defoes called an essay on projects and another of dr mathers called essays to do good which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life      16 small books sold by chapmen or peddlers  this bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer though he had already one son james of that profession in 1717 my brother james returned from england with a press and letters to set up his business in boston i liked it much better than that of my father but still had a hankering for the sea to prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother i stood out some time but at last was persuaded and signed the indentures when i was yet but twelve years old i was to serve as an apprentice till i was twentyone years of age only i was to be allowed journeymans wages during the last year in a little time i made great proficiency in the business and became a useful hand to my brother i now had access to better books an acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one which i was careful to return soon and clean often i sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night when the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the morning lest it should be missed or wanted  and after some time an ingenious tradesman mr matthew adams who had a pretty collection of books and who frequented our printinghouse took notice of me invited me to his library and very kindly lent me such books as i chose to read i now took a fancy to poetry and made some little pieces my brother thinking it might turn to account encouraged me and put me on composing occasional ballads one was called the lighthouse tragedy and contained an account of the drowning of captain worthilake with his two daughters the other was a sailors song on the taking of teach or blackbeard the pirate they were wretched stuff in the grubstreetballad style17 and when they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them the first sold wonderfully the event being recent having made a great noise this flattered my vanity but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances and telling me versemakers were generally beggars so i escaped being a poet most probably a very bad one but as prose writing has been of great use to me in the course of my life and was a principal means of my advancement i shall tell you how in such a situation i acquired what little ability i have in that way      17 grubstreet famous in english literature as the     home of poor writers  there was another bookish lad in the town john collins by name with whom i was intimately acquainted we sometimes disputed and very fond we were of argument and very desirous of confuting one another which disputatious turn by the way is apt to become a very bad habit making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice and thence besides souring and spoiling the conversation is productive of disgusts and perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for friendship i had caught it by reading my fathers books of dispute about religion persons of good sense i have since observed seldom fall into it except lawyers university men and men of all sorts that have been bred at edinborough  a question was once somehow or other started between collins and me of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning and their abilities for study he was of opinion that it was improper and that they were naturally unequal to it i took the contrary side perhaps a little for disputes sake he was naturally more eloquent had a ready plenty of words and sometimes as i thought bore me down more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons as we parted without settling the point and were not to see one another again for some time i sat down to put my arguments in writing which i copied fair and sent to him he answered and i replied three or four letters of a side had passed when my father happened to find my papers and read them without entering into the discussion he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing observed that though i had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing which i owd to the printinghouse i fell far short in elegance of expression in method and in perspicuity of which he convinced me by several instances i saw the justice of his remarks and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing and determined to endeavor at improvement  about this time i met with an odd volume of the spectator18 it was the third i had never before seen any of them i bought it read it over and over and was much delighted with it i thought the writing excellent and wished if possible to imitate it with this view i took some of the papers and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence laid them by a few days and then without looking at the book tryd to compleat the papers again by expressing each hinted sentiment at length and as fully as it had been expressed before in any suitable words that should come to hand then i compared my spectator with the original discovered some of my faults and corrected them but i found i wanted a stock of words or a readiness in recollecting and using them which i thought i should have acquired before that time if i had gone on making verses since the continual occasion for words of the same import but of different length to suit the measure or of different sound for the rhyme would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind and make me master of it therefore i took some of the tales and turned them into verse and after a time when i had pretty well forgotten the prose turned them back again i also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order before i began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper this was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts by comparing my work afterwards with the original i discovered many faults and amended them but i sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that in certain particulars of small import i had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language and this encouraged me to think i might possibly in time come to be a tolerable english writer of which i was extremely ambitious my time for these exercises and for reading was at night after work or before it began in the morning or on sundays when i contrived to be in the printinghouse alone evading as much as i could the common attendance on public worship which my father used to exact of me when i was under his care and which indeed i still thought a duty thought i could not as it seemed to me afford time to practise it      18 a daily london journal comprising satirical essays     on social subjects published by addison and steele in     17111712 the spectator and its predecessor the     tatler 1709 marked the beginning of periodical     literature  when about 16 years of age i happened to meet with a book written by one tryon recommending a vegetable diet i determined to go into it my brother being yet unmarried did not keep house but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family my refusing to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency and i was frequently chid for my singularity i made myself acquainted with tryons manner of preparing some of his dishes such as boiling potatoes or rice making hasty pudding and a few others and then proposed to my brother that if he would give me weekly half the money he paid for my board i would board myself he instantly agreed to it and i presently found that i could save half what he paid me this was an additional fund for buying books but i had another advantage in it my brother and the rest going from the printinghouse to their meals i remained there alone and dispatching presently my light repast which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastrycooks and a glass of water had the rest of the time till their return for study in which i made the greater progress from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eating and drinking  and now it was that being on some occasion made ashamd of my ignorance in figures which i had twice failed in learning when at school i took cockers book of arithmetick and went through the whole by myself with great ease i also read sellers and shermys books of navigation and became acquainted with the little geometry they contain but never proceeded far in that science and i read about this time locke on human understanding19 and the art of thinking by messrs du port royal20      19 john locke 16321704 a celebrated english     philosopher founder of the socalled commonsense     school of philosophers he drew up a constitution for     the colonists of carolina      20 a noted society of scholarly and devout men     occupying the abbey of port royal near paris who     published learned works among them the one here     referred to better known as the port royal logic  while i was intent on improving my language i met with an english grammar i think it was greenwoods at the end of which there were two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic the latter finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the socratic21 method and soon after i procurd xenophons memorable things of socrates wherein there are many instances of the same method i was charmd with it adopted it dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation and put on the humble inquirer and doubter and being then from reading shaftesbury and collins become a real doubter in many points of our religious doctrine i found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom i used it therefore i took a delight in it practisd it continually and grew very artful and expert in drawing people even of superior knowledge into concessions the consequences of which they did not foresee entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved i continud this method some few years but gradually left it retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence never using when i advanced anything that may possibly be disputed the words certainly undoubtedly or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion but rather say i conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so it appears to me or i should think it so or so for such and such reasons or i imagine it to be so or it is so if i am not mistaken this habit i believe has been of great advantage to me when i have had occasion to inculcate my opinions and persuade men into measures that i have been from time to time engaged in promoting and as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed to please or to persuade i wish wellmeaning sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive assuming manner that seldom fails to disgust tends to create opposition and to defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was given to us to wit giving or receiving information or pleasure for if you would inform a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention if you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fixd in your present opinions modest sensible men who do not love disputation will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error and by such a manner you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire pope22 says judiciously    men should be taught as if you taught them not    and things unknown proposd as things forgot  farther recommending to us    to speak tho sure with seeming diffidence  and he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with another i think less properly    for want of modesty is want of sense  if you ask why less properly i must repeat the lines    immodest words admit of no defense    for want of modesty is want of sense  now is not want of sense where a man is so unfortunate as to want it some apology for his want of modesty and would not the lines stand more justly thus    immodest words admit but this defense    that want of modesty is want of sense  this however i should submit to better judgments      21 socrates confuted his opponents in argument by     asking questions so skillfully devised that the answers     would confirm the questioners position or show the     error of the opponent      22 alexander pope 16881744 the greatest english     poet of the first half of the eighteenth century  my brother had in 1720 or 1721 begun to print a newspaper it was the second that appeared in america23 and was called the new england courant the only one before it was the boston newsletter i remember his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking as not likely to succeed one newspaper being in their judgment enough for america at this time 1771 there are not less than fiveandtwenty he went on however with the undertaking and after having worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets i was employed to carry the papers thro the streets to the customers      23 franklins memory does not serve him correctly here     the courant was really the fifth newspaper established     in america although generally called the fourth     because the first public occurrences published in     boston in 1690 was suppressed after the first issue     following is the order in which the other four papers     were published boston news letter 1704 boston     gazette december 21 1719 the american weekly

massachusetts historical society  transcribers note transcription given at the end of the text  he had some ingenious men among his friends who amusd themselves by writing little pieces for this paper which gaind it credit and made it more in demand and these gentlemen often visited us hearing their conversations and their accounts of the approbation their papers were received with i was excited to try my hand among them but being still a boy and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine i contrived to disguise my hand and writing an anonymous paper i put it in at night under the door of the printinghouse it was found in the morning and communicated to his writing friends when they calld in as usual they read it commented on it in my hearing and i had the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation and that in their different guesses at the author none were named but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity i suppose now that i was rather lucky in my judges and that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as i then esteemd them  encouragd however by this i wrote and conveyed in the same way to the press several more papers which were equally approvd and i kept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty well exhausted and then i discovered24 it when i began to be considered a little more by my brothers acquaintance and in a manner that did not quite please him as he thought probably with reason that it tended to make me too vain and perhaps this might be one occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time though a brother he considered himself as my master and me as his apprentice and accordingly expected the same services from me as he would from another while i thought he demeand me too much in some he requird of me who from a brother expected more indulgence our disputes were often brought before our father and i fancy i was either generally in the right or else a better pleader because the judgment was generally in my favor but my brother was passionate and had often beaten me which i took extreamly amiss and thinking my apprenticeship very tedious i was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it which at length offered in a manner unexpected      24 disclosed  illustration i was employed to carry the papers thro the streets to the customers  one of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point which i have now forgotten gave offense to the assembly he was taken up censurd and imprisond for a month by the speakers warrant i suppose because he would not discover his author i too was taken up and examind before the council but tho i did not give them any satisfaction they contented themselves with admonishing me and dismissed me considering me perhaps as an apprentice who was bound to keep his masters secrets  during my brothers confinement which i resented a good deal notwithstanding our private differences i had the management of the paper and i made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it which my brother took very kindly while others began to consider me in an unfavorable light as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and satyr my brothers discharge was accompanyd with an order of the house a very odd one that james franklin should no longer print the paper called the new england courant  there was a consultation held in our printinghouse among his friends what he should do in this case some proposed to evade the order by changing the name of the paper but my brother seeing inconveniences in that it was finally concluded on as a better way to let it be printed for the future under the name of benjamin franklin and to avoid the censure of the assembly that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice the contrivance was that my old indenture should be returnd to me with a full discharge on the back of it to be shown on occasion but to secure to him the benefit of my service i was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term which were to be kept private a very flimsy scheme it was however it was immediately executed and the paper went on accordingly under my name for several months  at length a fresh difference arising between my brother and me i took upon me to assert my freedom presuming that he would not venture to produce the new indentures it was not fair in me to take this advantage and this i therefore reckon one of the first errata of my life but the unfairness of it weighed little with me when under the impressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged him to bestow upon me though he was otherwise not an illnaturd man perhaps i was too saucy and provoking  when he found i would leave him he took care to prevent my getting employment in any other printinghouse of the town by going round and speaking to every master who accordingly refusd to give me work i then thought of going to new york as the nearest place where there was a printer and i was rather inclind to leave boston when i reflected that i had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing party and from the arbitrary proceedings of the assembly in my brothers case it was likely i might if i stayd soon bring myself into scrapes and farther that my indiscreet disputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel or atheist i determind on the point but my father now siding with my brother i was sensible that if i attempted to go openly means would be used to prevent me my friend collins therefore undertook to manage a little for me he agreed with the captain of a new york sloop for my passage under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his so i sold some of my books to raise a little money was taken on board privately and as we had a fair wind in three days i found myself in new york near 300 miles from home a boy of but 17 without the least recommendation to or knowledge of any person in the place and with very little money in my pocket  illustration sailboat     iii  arrival in philadelphia   my inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out or i might now have gratifyd them but having a trade and supposing myself a pretty good workman i offerd my service to the printer in the place old mr william bradford who had been the first printer in pennsylvania but removed from thence upon the quarrel of george keith he could give me no employment having little to do and help enough already but says he my son at philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand aquilla rose by death if you go thither i believe he may employ you philadelphia was a hundred miles further i set out however in a boat for amboy leaving my chest and things to follow me round by sea  in crossing the bay we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails to pieces prevented our getting into the kill25 and drove us upon long island in our way a drunken dutchman who was a passenger too fell overboard when he was sinking i reached through the water to his shock pate and drew him up so that we got him in again his ducking sobered him a little and he went to sleep taking first out of his pocket a book which he desird i would dry for him it proved to be my old favorite author bunyans

languages of europe and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book except perhaps the bible honest john was the first that i know of who mixd narration and dialogue a method of

 when we drew near the island we found it was at a place where there could be no landing there being a great surff on the stony beach so we dropt anchor and swung round towards the shore some people came down to the water edge and hallowd to us as we did to them but the wind was so high and the surff so loud that we could not hear so as to understand each other there were canoes on the shore and we made signs and hallowd that they should fetch us but they either did not understand us or thought it impracticable so they went away and night coming on we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate and in the meantime the boatman and i concluded to sleep if we could and so crowded into the scuttle with the dutchman who was still wet and the spray beating over the head of our boat leakd thro to us so that we were soon almost as wet as he in this manner we lay all night with very little rest but the wind abating the next day we made a shift to reach amboy before night having been thirty hours on the water without victuals or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum and the water we saild on being salt  in the evening i found myself very feverish and went in to bed but having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a fever i followd the prescription sweat plentifully most of the night my fever left me and in the morning crossing the ferry i proceeded on my journey on foot having fifty miles to burlington where i was told i should find boats that would carry me the rest of the way to philadelphia  illustration it rained very hard all the day  it rained very hard all the day i was thoroughly soakd and by noon a good deal tired so i stopt at a poor inn where i staid all night beginning now to wish that i had never left home i cut so miserable a figure too that i found by the questions askd me i was suspected to be some runaway servant and in danger of being taken up on that suspicion however i proceeded the next day and got in the evening to an inn within eight or ten miles of burlington kept by one dr brown he entered into conversation with me while i took some refreshment and finding i had read a little became very sociable and friendly our acquaintance continud as long as he livd he had been i imagine an itinerant doctor for there was no town in england or country in europe of which he could not give a very particular account he had some letters and was ingenious but much of an unbeliever and wickedly undertook some years after to travesty the bible in doggrel verse as cotton had done virgil by this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published but it never was  at his house i lay that night and the next morning reachd burlington but had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gone a little before my coming and no other expected to go before tuesday this being saturday wherefore i returned to an old woman in the town of whom i had bought gingerbread to eat on the water and askd her advice she invited me to lodge at her house till a passage by water should offer and being tired with my foot traveling i accepted the invitation she understanding i was a printer would have had me stay at that town and follow my business being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with she was very hospitable gave me a dinner of oxcheek with great good will accepting only of a pot of ale in return and i thought myself fixed till tuesday should come however walking in the evening by the side of the river a boat came by which i found was going towards philadelphia with several people in her they took me in and as there was no wind we rowd all the way and about midnight not having yet seen the city some of the company were confident we must have passed it and would row no farther the others knew not where we were so we put toward the shore got into a creek landed near an old fence with the rails of which we made a fire the night being cold in october and there we remained till daylight then one of the company knew the place to be coopers creek a little above philadelphia which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek and arrivd there about eight or nine oclock on the sunday morning and landed at the marketstreet wharf  i have been the more particular in this description of my journey and shall be so of my first entry into that city that you may in your mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure i have since made there i was in my working dress my best clothes being to come round by sea i was dirty from my journey my pockets were stuffd out with shirts and stockings and i knew no soul nor where to look for lodging i was fatigued with traveling rowing and want of rest i was very hungry and my whole stock of cash consisted of a dutch dollar and about a shilling in copper the latter i gave the people of the boat for my passage who at first refusd it on account of my rowing but i insisted on their taking it a man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty perhaps thro fear of being thought to have but little  then i walked up the street gazing about till near the markethouse i met a boy with bread i had made many a meal on bread and inquiring where he got it i went immediately to the bakers he directed me to in secondstreet and askd for bisket intending such as we had in boston but they it seems were not made in philadelphia then i asked for a threepenny loaf and was told they had none such so not considering or knowing the difference of money and the greater cheapness nor the names of his bread i bade him give me threepenny worth of any sort he gave me accordingly three great puffy rolls i was surprisd at the quantity but took it and having no room in my pockets walkd off with a roll under each arm and eating the other thus i went up marketstreet as far as fourthstreet passing by the door of mr read my future wifes father when she standing at the door saw me and thought i made as i certainly did a most awkward ridiculous appearance then i turned and went down chestnutstreet and part of walnutstreet eating my roll all the way and coming round found myself again at marketstreet wharf near the boat i came in to which i went for a draught of the river water and being filled with one of my rolls gave the other two to a woman and her child that came down the river in the boat with us and were waiting to go farther  illustration she standing at the door saw me and thought i made as i certainly did a most awkward ridiculous appearance  thus refreshed i walked again up the street which by this time had many cleandressed people in it who were all walking the same way i joined them and thereby was led into the great meetinghouse of the quakers near the market i sat down among them and after looking round awhile and hearing nothing said being very drowsy thro labour and want of rest the preceding night i fell fast asleep and continud so till the meeting broke up when one was kind enough to rouse me this was therefore the first house i was in or slept in in philadelphia  walking down again toward the river and looking in the faces of people i met a young quaker man whose countenance i likd and accosting him requested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging we were then near the sign of the three mariners here says he is one place that entertains strangers but it is not a reputable house if thee wilt walk with me ill show thee a better he brought me to the crooked billet in waterstreet here i got a dinner and while i was eating it several sly questions were asked me as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance that i might be some runaway  after dinner my sleepiness returnd and being shown to a bed i lay down without undressing and slept till six in the evening was calld to supper went to bed again very early and slept soundly till next morning then i made myself as tidy as i could and went to andrew bradford the printers i found in the shop the old man his father whom i had seen at new york and who traveling on horseback had got to philadelphia before me he introducd me to his son who receivd me civilly gave me a breakfast but told me he did not at present want a hand being lately supplid with one but there was another printer in town lately set up one keimer who perhaps might employ me if not i should be welcome to lodge at his house and he would give me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should offer  the old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer and when we found him neighbour says bradford i have brought to see you a young man of your business perhaps you may want such a one he askd me a few questions put a composing stick in my hand to see how i workd and then said he would employ me soon though he had just then nothing for me to do and taking old bradford whom he had never seen before to be one of the towns people that had a good will for him enterd into a conversation on his present undertaking and prospects while bradford not discovering that he was the other printers father on keimers saying he expected soon to get the greatest part of the business into his own hands drew him on by artful questions and starting little doubts to explain all his views what interest he relid on and in what manner he intended to proceed i who stood by and heard all saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old sophister and the other a mere novice bradford left me with keimer who was greatly surprisd when i told him who the old man was  keimers printinghouse i found consisted of an old shatterd press and one small wornout font of english which he was then using himself composing an elegy on aquilla rose before mentioned an ingenious young man of excellent character much respected in the town clerk of the assembly and a pretty poet keimer made verses too but very indifferently he could not be said to write them for his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head so there being no copy27 but one pair of cases and the elegy likely to require all the letter no one could help him i endeavourd to put his press which he had not yet usd and of which he understood nothing into order fit to be workd with and promising to come and print off his elegy as soon as he should have got it ready i returnd to bradfords who gave me a little job to do for the present and there i lodged and dieted a few days after keimer sent for me to print off the elegy and now he had got another pair of cases28 and a pamphlet to reprint on which he set me to work  these two printers i found poorly qualified for their business bradford had not been bred to it and was very illiterate and keimer tho something of a scholar was a mere compositor knowing nothing of presswork he had been one of the french prophets29 and could act their enthusiastic agitations at this time he did not profess any particular religion but something of all on occasion was very ignorant of the world and had as i afterward found a good deal of the knave in his composition he did not like my lodging at bradfords while i workd with him he had a house indeed but without furniture so he could not lodge me but he got me a lodging at mr reads before mentioned who was the owner of his house and my chest and clothes being come by this time i made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of miss read than i had done when she first happend to see me eating my roll in the street      27 manuscript      28 the frames for holding type are in two sections the     upper for capitals and the lower for small letters      29 protestants of the south of france who became     fanatical under the persecutions of louis xiv and     thought they had the gift of prophecy they had as     mottoes no taxes and liberty of conscience  i began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the town that were lovers of reading with whom i spent my evenings very pleasantly and gaining money by my industry and frugality i lived very agreeably forgetting boston as much as i could and not desiring that any there should know where i resided except my friend collins who was in my secret and kept it when i wrote to him at length an incident happened that sent me back again much sooner than i had intended i had a brotherinlaw robert holmes master of a sloop that traded between boston and delaware he being at newcastle forty miles below philadelphia heard there of me and wrote me a letter mentioning the concern of my friends in boston at my abrupt departure assuring me of their good will to me and that everything would be accommodated to my mind if i would return to which he exhorted me very earnestly i wrote an answer to his letter thankd him for his advice but stated my reasons for quitting boston fully and in such a light as to convince him i was not so wrong as he had apprehended     iv  first visit to boston   sir william keith governor of the province was then at newcastle and captain holmes happening to be in company with him when my letter came to hand spoke to him of me and showd him the letter the governor read it and seemd surprisd when he was told my age he said i appeard a young man of promising parts and therefore should be encouraged the printers at philadelphia were wretched ones and if i would set up there he made no doubt i should succeed for his part he would procure me the public business and do me every other service in his power this my brotherinlaw afterwards told me in boston but i knew as yet nothing of it when one day keimer and i being at work together near the window we saw the governor and another gentleman which proved to be colonel french of newcastle finely dressd come directly across the street to our house and heard them at the door  keimer ran down immediately thinking it a visit to him but the governor inquird for me came up and with a condescension and politeness i had been quite unusd to made me many compliments desired to be acquainted with me blamd me kindly for not having made myself known to him when i first came to the place and would have me away with him to the tavern where he was going with colonel french to taste as he said some excellent madeira i was not a little surprised and keimer stard like a pig poisond30 i went however with the governor and colonel french to a tavern at the corner of thirdstreet and over the madeira he proposd my setting up my business laid before me the probabilities of success and both he and colonel french assurd me i should have their interest and influence in procuring the public business of both governments31 on my doubting whether my father would assist me in it sir william said he would give me a letter to him in which he would state the advantages and he did not doubt of prevailing with him so it was concluded i should return to boston in the first vessel with the governors letter recommending me to my father in the meantime the intention was to be kept a secret and i went on working with keimer as usual the governor sending for me now and then to dine with him a very great honour i thought it and conversing with me in the most affable familiar and friendly manner imaginable      30 temple franklin considered this specific figure     vulgar and changed it to stared with astonishment      31 pennsylvania and delaware  about the end of april 1724 a little vessel offerd for boston i took leave of keimer as going to see my friends the governor gave me an ample letter saying many flattering things of me to my father and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune we struck on a shoal in going down the bay and sprung a leak we had a blustering time at sea and were obligd to pump almost continually at which i took my turn we arrivd safe however at boston in about a fortnight i had been absent seven months and my friends had heard nothing of me for my br holmes was not yet returnd and had not written about me my unexpected appearance surprisd the family all were however very glad to see me and made me welcome except my brother i went to see him at his printinghouse i was better dressd than ever while in his service having a genteel new suit from head to foot a watch and my pockets lind with near five pounds sterling in silver he receivd me not very frankly lookd me all over and turnd to his work again  illustration the journeymen were inquisitive  the journeymen were inquisitive where i had been what sort of a country it was and how i likd it i praisd it much and the happy life i led in it expressing strongly my intention of returning to it and one of them asking what kind of money we had there i producd a handful of silver and spread it before them which was a kind of rareeshow32 they had not been usd to paper being the money of boston33 then i took an opportunity of letting them see my watch and lastly my brother still grum and sullen i gave them a piece of eight34 to drink and took my leave this visit of mine offended him extreamly for when my mother some time after spoke to him of a reconciliation and of her wishes to see us on good terms together and that we might live for the future as brothers he said i had insulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never forget or forgive it in this however he was mistaken      32 a peepshow in a box      33 there were no mints in the colonies so the metal     money was of foreign coinage and not nearly so common as     paper money which was printed in large quantities in     america even in small denominations      34 spanish dollar about equivalent to our dollar  my father received the governors letter with some apparent surprise but said little of it to me for some days when capt holmes returning he showd it to him asked him if he knew keith and what kind of man he was adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of being at mans estate holmes said what he could in favour of the project but my father was clear in the impropriety of it and at last gave a flat denial to it then he wrote a civil letter to sir william thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me but declining to assist me as yet in setting up i being in his opinion too young to be trusted with the management of a business so important and for which the preparation must be so expensive  my friend and companion collins who was a clerk in the postoffice pleasd with the account i gave him of my new country determined to go thither also and while i waited for my fathers determination he set out before me by land to rhode island leaving his books which were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy to come with mine and me to new york where he proposd to wait for me  my father tho he did not approve sir williams proposition was yet pleasd that i had been able to obtain so advantageous a character from a person of such note where i had resided and that i had been so industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a time therefore seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my brother and me he gave his consent to my returning again to philadelphia advisd me to behave respectfully to the people there endeavour to obtain the general esteem and avoid lampooning and libeling to which he thought i had too much inclination telling me that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony i might save enough by the time i was oneandtwenty to set me up and that if i came near the matter he would help me out with the rest this was all i could obtain except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mothers love when i embarkd again for new york now with their approbation and their blessing  the sloop putting in at newport rhode island i visited my brother john who had been married and settled there some years he received me very affectionately for he always lovd me a friend of his one vernon having some money due to him in pennsylvania about thirtyfive pounds currency desired i would receive it for him and keep it till i had his directions what to remit it in accordingly he gave me an order this afterwards occasiond me a good deal of uneasiness  at newport we took in a number of passengers for new york among which were two young women companions and a grave sensible matronlike quaker woman with her attendants i had shown an obliging readiness to do her some little services which impressd her i suppose with a degree of good will toward me therefore when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women which they appeard to encourage she took me aside and said young man i am concernd for thee as thou hast no friend with thee and seems not to know much of the world or of the snares youth is exposd to depend upon it those are very bad women i can see it in all their actions and if thee art not upon thy guard they will draw thee into some danger they are strangers to thee and i advise thee in a friendly concern for thy welfare to have no acquaintance with them as i seemd at first not to think so ill of them as she did she mentioned some things she had observd and heard that had escapd my notice but now convincd me she was right i thankd her for her kind advice and promisd to follow it when we arrivd at new york they told me where they livd and invited me to come and see them but i avoided it and it was well i did for the next day the captain missd a silver spoon and some other things that had been taken out of his cabin and knowing that these were a couple of strumpets he got a warrant to search their lodgings found the stolen goods and had the thieves punishd so tho we had escapd a sunken rock which we scrapd upon in the passage i thought this escape of rather more importance to me  at new york i found my friend collins who had arrivd there some time before me we had been intimate from children and had read the same books together but he had the advantage of more time for reading and studying and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning in which he far outstript me while i livd in boston most of my hours of leisure for conversation were spent with him and he continud a sober as well as an industrious lad was much respected for his learning by several of the clergy and other gentlemen and seemed to promise making a good figure in life but during my absence he had acquird a habit of sotting with brandy and i found by his own account and what i heard from others that he had been drunk every day since his arrival at new york and behavd very oddly he had gamd too and lost his money so that i was obligd to discharge his lodgings and defray his expenses to and at philadelphia which provd extremely inconvenient to me  the then governor of new york burnet son of bishop burnet hearing from the captain that a young man one of his passengers had a great many books desird he would bring me to see him i waited upon him accordingly and should have taken collins with me but that he was not sober the govr treated me with great civility showd me his library which was a very large one and we had a good deal of conversation about books and authors this was the second governor who had done me the honour to take notice of me which to a poor boy like me was very pleasing  we proceeded to philadelphia i received on the way vernons money without which we could hardly have finishd our journey collins wished to be employd in some countinghouse but whether they discoverd his dramming by his breath or by his behaviour tho he had some recommendations he met with no success in any application and continud lodging and boarding at the same house with me and at my expense knowing i had that money of vernons he was continually borrowing of me still promising repayment as soon as he should be in business at length he had got so much of it that i was distressd to think what i should do in case of being calld on to remit it  his drinking continud about which we sometimes quarreld for when a little intoxicated he was very fractious once in a boat on the delaware with some other young men he refused to row in his turn i will be rowd home says he we will not row you says i you must or stay all night on the water says he just as you please the others said let us row what signifies it but my mind being soured with his other conduct i continud to refuse so he swore he would make me row or throw me overboard and coming along stepping on the thwarts toward me when he came up and struck at me i clapped my hand under his crutch and rising pitched him headforemost into the river i knew he was a good swimmer and so was under little concern about him but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat we had with a few strokes pulld her out of his reach and ever when he drew near the boat we askd if he would row striking a few strokes to slide her away from him he was ready to die with vexation and obstinately would not promise to row however seeing him at last beginning to tire we lifted him in and brought him home dripping wet in the evening we hardly exchangd a civil word afterwards and a west india captain who had a commission to procure a tutor for the sons of a gentleman at barbados happening to meet with him agreed to carry him thither he left me then promising to remit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the debt but i never heard of him after  the breaking into this money of vernons was one of the first great errata of my life and this affair showd that my father was not much out in his judgment when he supposd me too young to manage business of importance but sir william on reading his letter said he was too prudent there was great difference in persons and discretion did not always accompany years nor was youth always without it and since he will not set you up says he i will do it myself give me an inventory of the things necessary to be had from england and i will send for them you shall repay me when you are able i am resolvd to have a good printer here and i am sure you must succeed this was spoken with such an appearance of cordiality that i had not the least doubt of his meaning what he said i had hitherto kept the proposition of my setting up a secret in philadelphia and i still kept it had it been known that i depended on the governor probably some friend that knew him better would have advisd me not to rely on him as i afterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises which he never meant to keep yet unsolicited as he was by me how could i think his generous offers insincere i believd him one of the best men in the world  i presented him an inventory of a little printhouse amounting by my computation to about one hundred pounds sterling he likd it but askd me if my being on the spot in england to chuse the types and see that everything was good of the kind might not be of some advantage then says he when there you may make acquaintances and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way i agreed that this might be advantageous then says he get yourself ready to go with annis which was the annual ship and the only one at that time usually passing between london and philadelphia but it would be some months before annis saild so i continued working with keimer fretting about the money collins had got from me and in daily apprehensions of being calld upon by vernon which however did not happen for some years after  i believe i have omitted mentioning that in my first voyage from boston being becalmd off block island our people set about catching cod and hauled up a great many hitherto i had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food and on this occasion i considerd with my master tryon the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder since none of them had or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter all this seemed very reasonable but i had formerly been a great lover of fish and when this came hot out of the fryingpan it smelt admirably well i balancd some time between principle and inclination till i recollected that when the fish were opened i saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs then thought i if you eat one another i dont see why we maynt eat you so i dind upon cod very heartily and continued to eat with other people returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet so convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do     v  early friends in philadelphia   keimer and i livd on a pretty good familiar footing and agreed tolerably well for he suspected nothing of my setting up he retained a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lovd argumentation we therefore had many disputations i used to work him so with my socratic method and had trepannd him so often by questions apparently so distant from any point we had in hand and yet by degrees led to the point and brought him into difficulties and contradictions that at last he grew ridiculously cautious and would hardly answer me the most common question without asking first what do you intend to infer from that however it gave him so high an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way that he seriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of setting up a new sect he was to preach the doctrines and i was to confound all opponents when he came to explain with me upon the doctrines i found several conundrums which i objected to unless i might have my way a little too and introduce some of mine  keimer wore his beard at full length because somewhere in the mosaic law it is said thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard he likewise kept the seventh day sabbath and these two points were essentials with him i dislikd both but agreed to admit them upon condition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food i doubt said he my constitution will not bear that i assurd him it would and that he would be the better for it he was usually a great glutton and i promised myself some diversion in half starving him he agreed to try the practice if i would keep him company i did so and we held it for three months we had our victuals dressd and brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood who had from me a list of forty dishes to be prepard for us at different times in all which there was neither fish flesh nor fowl and the whim suited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it not costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week i have since kept several lents most strictly leaving the common diet for that and that for the common abruptly without the least inconvenience so that i think there is little in the advice of making those changes by easy gradations i went on pleasantly but poor keimer suffered grievously tired of the project longd for the fleshpots of egypt and orderd a roast pig he invited me and two women friends to dine with him but it being brought too soon upon table he could not resist the temptation and ate the whole before we came  i had made some courtship during this time to miss read i had a great respect and affection for her and had some reason to believe she had the same for me but as i was about to take a long voyage and we were both very young only a little above eighteen it was thought most prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present as a marriage if it was to take place would be more convenient after my return when i should be as i expected set up in my business perhaps too she thought my expectations not so well founded as i imagined them to be  my chief acquaintances at this time were charles osborne joseph watson and james ralph all lovers of reading the two first were clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town charles brockden the other was clerk to a merchant watson was a pious sensible young man of great integrity the others rather more lax in their principles of religion particularly ralph who as well as collins had been unsettled by me for which they both made me suffer osborne was sensible candid frank sincere and affectionate to his friends but in literary matters too fond of criticizing ralph was ingenious genteel in his manners and extremely eloquent i think i never knew a prettier talker both of them were great admirers of poetry and began to try their hands in little pieces many pleasant walks we four had together on sundays into the woods near schuylkill where we read to one another and conferrd on what we read  illustration many pleasant walks we four had together  ralph was inclind to pursue the study of poetry not doubting but he might become eminent in it and make his fortune by it alleging that the best poets must when they first began to write make as many faults as he did osborne dissuaded him assurd him he had no genius for poetry and advisd him to think of nothing beyond the business he was bred to that in the mercantile way tho he had no stock he might by his diligence and punctuality recommend himself to employment as a factor and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his own account i approvd the amusing ones self with poetry now and then so far as to improve ones language but no farther  on this it was proposd that we should each of us at our next meeting produce a piece of our own composing in order to improve by our mutual observations criticisms and corrections as language and expression were what we had in view we excluded all considerations of invention by agreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth psalm which describes the descent of a deity when the time of our meeting drew nigh ralph called on me first and let me know his piece was ready i told him i had been busy and having little inclination had done nothing he then showd me his piece for my opinion and i much approvd it as it appeard to me to have great merit now says he osborne never will allow the least merit in anything of mine but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy he is not so jealous of you i wish therefore you would take this piece and produce it as yours i will pretend not to have had time and so produce nothing we shall then see what he will say to it it was agreed and i immediately transcribd it that it might appear in my own hand  we met watsons performance was read there were some beauties in it but many defects osbornes was read it was much better ralph did it justice remarked some faults but applauded the beauties he himself had nothing to produce i was backward seemed desirous of being excused had not had sufficient time to correct etc but no excuse could be admitted produce i must it was read and repeated watson and osborne gave up the contest and joind in applauding it ralph only made some criticisms and proposd some amendments but i defended my text osborne was against ralph and told him he was no better a critic than poet so he dropt the argument as they two went home together osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of what he thought my production having restraind himself before as he said lest i should think it flattery but who would have imagind said he that franklin had been capable of such a performance such painting such force such fire he has even improvd the original in his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words he hesitates and blunders and yet good god how he writes when we next met ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him and osborne was a little laughed at  this transaction fixed ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet i did all i could to dissuade him from it but he continued scribbling verses till pope cured him35 he became however a pretty good prose writer more of him hereafter but as i may not have occasion again to mention the other two i shall just remark here that watson died in my arms a few years after much lamented being the best of our set osborne went to the west indies where he became an eminent lawyer and made money but died young he and i had made a serious agreement that the one who happend first to die should if possible make a friendly visit to the other and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state but he never fulfilld his promise      35 in one of the later editions of the dunciad occur     the following lines         silence ye wolves while ralph to cynthia howls        and makes night hideousanswer him ye owls      to this the poet adds the following note      james ralph a name inserted after the first editions     not known till he writ a swearingpiece called sawney     very abusive of dr swift mr gay and myself     vi  first visit to london   the governor seeming to like my company had me frequently to his house and his setting me up was always mentiond as a fixed thing i was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money for purchasing the press and types paper etc for these letters i was appointed to call at different times when they were to be ready but a future time was still named thus he went on till the ship whose departure too had been several times postponed was on the point of sailing then when i calld to take my leave and receive the letters his secretary dr bard came out to me and said the governor was extremely busy in writing but would be down at newcastle before the ship and there the letters would be delivered to me  ralph though married and having one child had determined to accompany me in this voyage it was thought he intended to establish a correspondence and obtain goods to sell on commission but i found afterwards that thro some discontent with his wifes relations he purposed to leave her on their hands and never return again having taken leave of my friends and interchangd some promises with miss read i left philadelphia in the ship which anchord at newcastle the governor was there but when i went to his lodging the secretary came to me from him with the civillest message in the world that he could not then see me being engaged in business of the utmost importance but should send the letters to me on board wished me heartily a good voyage and a speedy return etc i returned on board a little puzzled but still not doubting  mr andrew hamilton a famous lawyer of philadelphia had taken passage in the same ship for himself and son and with mr denham a quaker merchant and messrs onion and russel masters of an iron work in maryland had engaged the great cabin so that ralph and i were forced to take up with a berth in the steerage and none on board knowing us were considered as ordinary persons but mr hamilton and his son it was james since governor returnd from newcastle to philadelphia the father being recalld by a great fee to plead for a seized ship and just before we saild colonel french coming on board and showing me great respect i was more taken notice of and with my friend ralph invited by the other gentlemen to come into the cabin there being now room accordingly we removd thither  understanding that colonel french had brought on board the governors despatches i askd the captain for those letters that were to be under my care he said all were put into the bag together and he could not then come at them but before we landed in england i should have an opportunity of picking them out so i was satisfied for the present and we proceeded on our voyage we had a sociable company in the cabin and lived uncommonly well having the addition of all mr hamiltons stores who had laid in plentifully in this passage mr denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life the voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one as we had a great deal of bad weather  when we came into the channel the captain kept his word with me and gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governors letters i found none upon which my name was put as under my care i picked out six or seven that by the handwriting i thought might be the promised letters especially as one of them was directed to basket the kings printer and another to some stationer we arrivd in london the 24th of december 1724 i waited upon the stationer who came first in my way delivering the letter as from governor keith i dont know such a person says he but opening the letter o this is from riddlesden i have lately found him to be a compleat rascal and i will have nothing to do with him nor receive any letters from him so putting the letter into my hand he turnd on his heel and left me to serve some customer i was surprized to find these were not the governors letters and after recollecting and comparing circumstances i began to doubt his sincerity i found my friend denham and opened the whole affair to him he let me into keiths character told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me that no one who knew him had the smallest dependence on him and he laught at the notion of the governors giving me a letter of credit having as he said no credit to give on my expressing some concern about what i should do he advised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of my business among the printers here said he you will improve yourself and when you return to america you will set up to greater advantage  illustration so putting the letter into my hand  we both of us happend to know as well as the stationer that riddlesden the attorney was a very knave he had half ruind miss reads father by persuading him to be bound for him by this letter it appeard there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of hamilton supposd to be then coming over with us and that keith was concerned in it with riddlesden denham who was a friend of hamiltons thought he ought to be acquainted with it so when he arrivd in england which was soon after partly from resentment and illwill to keith and riddlesden and partly from goodwill to him i waited on him and gave him the letter he thankd me cordially the information being of importance to him and from that time he became my friend greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions  but what shall we think of a governors playing such pitiful tricks and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy it was a habit he had acquired he wishd to please everybody and having little to give he gave expectations he was otherwise an ingenious sensible man a pretty good writer and a good governor for the people tho not for his constituents the proprietaries whose instructions he sometimes disregarded several of our best laws were of his planning and passed during his administration  ralph and i were inseparable companions we took lodgings together in little britain36 at three shillings and sixpence a weekas much as we could then afford he found some relations but they were poor and unable to assist him he now let me know his intentions of remaining in london and that he never meant to return to philadelphia he had brought no money with him the whole he could muster having been expended in paying his passage i had fifteen pistoles37 so he borrowed occasionally of me to subsist while he was looking out for business he first endeavoured to get into the playhouse believing himself qualifyd for an actor but wilkes38 to whom he applyd advisd him candidly not to think of that employment as it was impossible he should succeed in it then he proposd to roberts a publisher in paternoster row39 to write for him a weekly paper like the spectator on certain conditions which roberts did not approve then he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer to copy for the stationers and lawyers about the temple40 but could find no vacancy      36 one of the oldest parts of london north of st     pauls cathedral called little britain because the     dukes of brittany used to live there see the essay     entitled little britain in washington irvings sketch     book

lawyers residences situated     southwest of st pauls between fleet street and the     thames  i immediately got into work at palmers then a famous printinghouse in bartholomew close and here i continud near a year i was pretty diligent but spent with ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to plays and other places of amusement we had together consumed all my pistoles and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth he seemd quite to forget his wife and child and i by degrees my engagements with miss read to whom i never wrote more than one letter and that was to let her know i was not likely soon to return this was another of the great errata of my life which i should wish to correct if i were to live it over again in fact by our expenses i was constantly kept unable to pay my passage  at palmers i was employed in composing for the second edition of wollastons religion of nature some of his reasonings not appearing to me well founded i wrote a little metaphysical piece in which i made remarks on them it was entitled a dissertation on liberty and necessity pleasure and pain i inscribed it to my friend ralph i printed a small number it occasiond my being more considerd by mr palmer as a young man of some ingenuity tho he seriously expostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet which to him appeard abominable my printing this pamphlet was another erratum  while i lodgd in little britain i made an acquaintance with one wilcox a bookseller whose shop was at the next door he had an immense collection of secondhand books circulating libraries were not then in use but we agreed that on certain reasonable terms which i have now forgotten i might take read and return any of his books this i esteemd a great advantage and i made as much use of it as i could  my pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one lyons a surgeon author of a book entitled the infallibility of human judgment it occasioned an acquaintance between us he took great notice of me called on me often to converse on those subjects carried me to the horns a pale alehouse inlane cheapside and introduced me to dr mandeville author of the fable of the bees who had a club there of which he was the soul being a most facetious entertaining companion lyons too introduced me to dr pemberton at batsons coffeehouse who promisd to give me an opportunity sometime or other of seeing sir isaac newton of which i was extreamly desirous but this never happened  i had brought over a few curiosities among which the principal was a purse made of the asbestos which purifies by fire sir hans sloane heard of it came to see me and invited me to his house in bloomsbury square where he showd me all his curiosities and persuaded me to let him add that to the number for which he paid me handsomely  in our house there lodgd a young woman a milliner who i think had a shop in the cloisters she had been genteelly bred was sensible and lively and of most pleasing conversation ralph read plays to her in the evenings they grew intimate she took another lodging and he followed her they livd together some time but he being still out of business and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her child he took a resolution of going from london to try for a country school which he thought himself well qualified to undertake as he wrote an excellent hand and was a master of arithmetic and accounts this however he deemed a business below him and confident of future better fortune when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed he changed his name and did me the honour to assume mine for i soon after had a letter from him acquainting me that he was settled in a small village in berkshire i think it was where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen boys at sixpence each per week recommending mrs t to my care and desiring me to write to him directing for mr franklin schoolmaster at such a place  he continued to write frequently sending me large specimens of an epic poem which he was then composing and desiring my remarks and corrections these i gave him from time to time but endeavourd rather to discourage his proceeding one of youngs satires41 was then just published i copyd and sent him a great part of it which set in a strong light the folly of pursuing the muses with any hope of advancement by them all was in vain sheets of the poem continued to come by every post in the meantime mrs t having on his account lost her friends and business was often in distresses and usd to send for me and borrow what i could spare to help her out of them i grew fond of her company and being at that time under no religious restraint and presuming upon my importance to her i attempted familiarities another erratum which she repulsd with a proper resentment and acquainted him with my behaviour this made a breach between us and when he returned again to london he let me know he thought i had cancelld all the obligations he had been under to me so i found i was never to expect his repaying me what i lent to him or advancd for him this however was not then of much consequence as he was totally unable and in the loss of his friendship i found myself relieved from a burthen i now began to think of getting a little money beforehand and expecting better work i left palmers to work at wattss near lincolns inn fields a still greater printinghouse42 here i continued all the rest of my stay in london      41 edward young 16811765 an english poet see his     satires vol iii epist ii page 70      42 the printing press at which franklin worked is     preserved in the patent office at washington  at my first admission into this printinghouse i took to working at press imagining i felt a want of the bodily exercise i had been usd to in america where presswork is mixd with composing i drank only water the other workmen near fifty in number were great guzzlers of beer on occasion i carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each hand when others carried but one in both hands they wondered to see from this and several instances that the wateramerican as they called me was stronger than themselves who drank strong beer we had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen my companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese a pint between breakfast and dinner a pint at dinner a pint in the afternoon about six oclock and another when he had done his days work i thought it a detestable custom but it was necessary he supposd to drink strong beer that he might be strong to labour i endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread and therefore if he would eat that with a pint of water it would give him more strength than a quart of beer he drank on however and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every saturday night for that muddling liquor an expense i was free from and thus these poor devils keep themselves always under  illustration i took to working at press  watts after some weeks desiring to have me in the composingroom43 i left the pressmen a new bien venu or sum for drink being five shillings was demanded of me by the compositors i thought it an imposition as i had paid below the master thought so too and forbade my paying it i stood out two or three weeks was accordingly considered as an excommunicate and had so many little pieces of private mischief done me by mixing my sorts transposing my pages breaking my matter etc etc if i were ever so little out of the room and all ascribed to the chappel ghost which they said ever haunted those not regularly admitted that notwithstanding the masters protection i found myself obligd to comply and pay the money convincd of the folly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually      43 franklin now left the work of operating the printing     presses which was largely a matter of manual labor and     began setting type which required more skill and     intelligence  i was now on a fair footing with them and soon acquird considerable influence i proposd some reasonable alterations in their chappel laws44 and carried them against all opposition from my example a great part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer and bread and cheese finding they could with me be supplyd from a neighbouring house with a large porringer of hot watergruel sprinkled with pepper crumbd with bread and a bit of butter in it for the price of a pint of beer viz three halfpence this was a more comfortable as well as cheaper breakfast and keep their heads clearer those who continued sotting with beer all day were often by not paying out of credit at the alehouse and usd to make interest with me to get beer their light as they phrased it being out i watchd the paytable on saturday night and collected what i stood engagd for them having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their accounts this and my being esteemd a pretty good riggite that is a jocular verbal satirist supported my consequence in the society my constant attendance i never making a st monday45 recommended me to the master and my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch which was generally better paid so i went on now very agreeably      44 a printing house is called a chapel because caxton     the first english printer did his printing in a chapel     connected with westminster abbey      45 a holiday taken to prolong the dissipation of     saturdays wages  my lodging in little britain being too remote i found another in dukestreet opposite to the romish chapel it was two pair of stairs backwards at an italian warehouse a widow lady kept the house she had a daughter and a maid servant and a journeyman who attended the warehouse but lodgd abroad after sending to inquire my character at the house where i last lodgd she agreed to take me in at the same rate 3s 6d per week cheaper as she said from the protection she expected in having a man lodge in the house she was a widow an elderly woman had been bred a protestant being a clergymans daughter but was converted to the catholic religion by her husband whose memory she much revered had lived much among people of distinction and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the times of charles the second she was lame in her knees with the gout and therefore seldom stirred out of her room so sometimes wanted company and hers was so highly amusing to me that i was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she desired it our supper was only half an anchovy each on a very little strip of bread and butter and half a pint of ale between us but the entertainment was in her conversation my always keeping good hours and giving little trouble in the family made her unwilling to part with me so that when i talkd of a lodging i had heard of nearer my business for two shillings a week which intent as i now was on saving money made some difference she bid me not think of it for she would abate me two shillings a week for the future so i remained with her at one shilling and sixpence as long as i staid in london  in a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy in the most retired manner of whom my landlady gave me this account that she was a roman catholic had been sent abroad when young and lodgd in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun but the country not agreeing with her she returned to england where there being no nunnery she had vowd to lead the life of a nun as near as might be done in those circumstances accordingly she had given all her estate to charitable uses reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on and out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity living herself on watergruel only and using no fire but to boil it she had lived many years in that garret being permitted to remain there gratis by successive catholic tenants of the house below as they deemed it a blessing to have her there a priest visited her to confess her every day i have askd her says my landlady how she as she livd could possibly find so much employment for a confessor oh said she it is impossible to avoid vain thoughts i was permitted once to visit her she was cheerful and polite and conversd pleasantly the room was clean but had no other furniture than a matras a table with a crucifix and book a stool which she gave me to sit on and a picture over the chimney of saint veronica displaying her handkerchief with the miraculous figure of christs bleeding face on it46 which she explained to me with great seriousness she lookd pale but was never sick and i give it as another instance on how small an income life and health may be supported  at wattss printinghouse i contracted an acquaintance with an ingenious young man one wygate who having wealthy relations had been better educated than most printers was a tolerable latinist spoke french and lovd reading i taught him and a friend of his to swim at twice going into the river and they soon became good swimmers they introducd me to some gentlemen from the country who went to chelsea by water to see the college and don salteros curiosities47 in our return at the request of the company whose curiosity wygate had excited i stripped and leaped into the river and swam from near chelsea to blackfriars48 performing on the way many feats of activity both upon and under water that surprisd and pleasd those to whom they were novelties      46 the story is that she met christ on his way to     crucifixion and offered him her handkerchief to wipe the     blood from his face after which the handkerchief always     bore the image of christs bleeding face      47 james salter a former servant of hans sloane lived     in cheyne walk chelsea his house a barbershop was     known as don salteros coffeehouse the curiosities     were in glass cases and constituted an amazing and     motley collectiona petrified crab from china a     lignified hog jobs tears madagascar lances william     the conquerors flaming sword and henry the eighths     coat of mailsmyth      48 about three miles  i had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise had studied and practisd all thevenots motions and positions added some of my own aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful all these i took this occasion of exhibiting to the company and was much flatterd by their admiration and wygate who was desirous of becoming a master grew more and more attachd to me on that account as well as from the similarity of our studies he at length proposed to me traveling all over europe together supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our business i was once inclined to it but mentioning it to my good friend mr denham with whom i often spent an hour when i had leisure he dissuaded me from it advising me to think only of returning to pennsylvania which he was now about to do  i must record one trait of this good mans character he had formerly been in business at bristol but failed in debt to a number of people compounded and went to america there by a close application to business as a merchant he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few years returning to england in the ship with me he invited his old creditors to an entertainment at which he thankd them for the easy composition they had favoured him with and when they expected nothing but the treat every man at the first remove found under his plate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest  he now told me he was about to return to philadelphia and should carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there he proposd to take me over as his clerk to keep his books in which he would instruct me copy his letters and attend the store he added that as soon as i should be acquainted with mercantile business he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and bread etc to the west indies and procure me commissions from others which would be profitable and if i managd well would establish me handsomely the thing pleasd me for i was grown tired of london remembered with pleasure the happy months i had spent in pennsylvania and wishd again to see it therefore i immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year49 pennsylvania money less indeed than my present gettings as a compositor but affording a better prospect      49 about 167  i now took leave of printing as i thought forever and was daily employed in my new business going about with mr denham among the tradesmen to purchase various articles and seeing them packd up doing errands calling upon workmen to dispatch etc and when all was on board i had a few days leisure on one of these days i was to my surprise sent for by a great man i knew only by name a sir william wyndham and i waited upon him he had heard by some means or other of my swimming from chelsea to blackfriars and of my teaching wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours he had two sons about to set out on their travels he wishd to have them first taught swimming and proposed to gratify me handsomely if i would teach them they were not yet come to town and my stay was uncertain so i could not undertake it but from this incident i thought it likely that if i were to remain in england and open a swimmingschool i might get a good deal of money and it struck me so strongly that had the overture been sooner made me probably i should not so soon have returned to america after many years you and i had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of sir william wyndham become earl of egremont which i shall mention in its place  thus i spent about eighteen months in london most part of the time i workd hard at my business and spent but little upon myself except in seeing plays and in books my friend ralph had kept me poor he owed me about twentyseven pounds which i was now never likely to receive a great sum out of my small earnings i lovd him notwithstanding for he had many amiable qualities i had by no means improvd my fortune but i had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance whose conversation was of great advantage to me and i had read considerably     vii  beginning business in philadelphia   we saild from gravesend on the 23rd of july 1726 for the incidents of the voyage i refer you to my journal where you will find them all minutely related perhaps the most important part of that journal is the plan50 to be found in it which i formed at sea for regulating my future conduct in life it is the more remarkable as being formed when i was so young and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite thro to old age      50 not found in the manuscript journal which was left     among franklins papersbigelow  we landed in philadelphia on the 11th of october where i found sundry alterations keith was no longer governor being superseded by major gordon i met him walking the streets as a common citizen he seemd a little ashamd at seeing me but passd without saying anything i should have been as much ashamd at seeing miss read had not her friends despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my letter persuaded her to marry another one rogers a potter which was done in my absence with him however she was never happy and soon parted from him refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name it being now said that he had another wife he was a worthless fellow tho an excellent workman which was the temptation to her friends he got into debt ran away in 1727 or 1728 went to the west indies and died there keimer had got a better house a shop well supplyd with stationery plenty of new types a number of hands tho none good and seemd to have a great deal of business  mr denham took a store in waterstreet where we opend our goods i attended the business diligently studied accounts and grew in a little time expert at selling we lodgd and boarded together he counselld me as a father having a sincere regard for me i respected and loved him and we might have gone on together very happy but in the beginning of february 17267 when i had just passd my twentyfirst year we both were taken ill my distemper was a pleurisy which very nearly carried me off i suffered a good deal gave up the point in my own mind and was rather disappointed when i found myself recovering regretting in some degree that i must now some time or other have all that disagreeable work to do over again i forget what his distemper was it held him a long time and at length carried him off he left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will as a token of his kindness for me and he left me once more to the wide world for the store was taken into the care of his executors and my employment under him ended  illustration mr denham took a store in waterstreet  my brotherinlaw holmes being now at philadelphia advised my return to my business and keimer tempted me with an offer of large wages by the year to come and take the management of his printinghouse that he might better attend his stationers shop i had heard a bad character of him in london from his wife and her friends and was not fond of having any more to do with him i trid for farther employment as a merchants clerk but not readily meeting with any i closd again with keimer i found in his house these hands hugh meredith a welsh pennsylvanian thirty years of age bred to country work honest sensible had a great deal of solid observation was something of a reader but given to drink stephen potts a young countryman of full age bred to the same of uncommon natural parts and great wit and humor but a little idle these he had agreed with at extream low wages per week to be raisd a shilling every three months as they would deserve by improving in their business and the expectation of these high wages to come on hereafter was what he had drawn them in with meredith was to work at press potts at bookbinding which he by agreement was to teach them though he knew neither one nor tother john a wild irishman brought up to no business whose service for four years keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship he too was to be made a pressman george webb an oxford scholar whose time for four years he had likewise bought intending him for a compositor of whom more presently and david harry a country boy whom he had taken apprentice  i soon perceivd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much higher than he had been usd to give was to have these raw cheap hands formd thro me and as soon as i had instructed them then they being all articled to him he should be able to do without me i went on however very chearfully put his printinghouse in order which had been in great confusion and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to do it better  it was an odd thing to find an oxford scholar in the situation of a bought servant he was not more than eighteen years of age and gave me this account of himself that he was born in gloucester educated at a grammarschool there had been distinguishd among the scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part when they exhibited plays belongd to the witty club there and had written some pieces in prose and verse which were printed in the gloucester newspapers thence he was sent to oxford where he continued about a year but not well satisfid wishing of all things to see london and become a player at length receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas instead of discharging his debts he walkd out of town hid his gown in a furze bush and footed it to london where having no friend to advise him he fell into bad company soon spent his guineas found no means of being introducd among the players grew necessitous pawnd his cloaths and wanted bread walking the street very hungry and not knowing what to do with himself a crimps bill51 was put into his hand offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in america he went directly signd the indentures was put into the ship and came over never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of him he was lively witty goodnaturd and a pleasant companion but idle thoughtless and imprudent to the last degree      51 a crimp was the agent of a shipping company crimps     were sometimes employed to decoy men into such service     as is here mentioned  john the irishman soon ran away with the rest i began to live very agreeably for they all respected me the more as they found keimer incapable of instructing them and that from me they learned something daily we never worked on saturday that being keimers sabbath so i had two days for reading my acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to vernon which i was yet unable to pay being hitherto but a poor æconomist he however kindly made no demand of it  our printinghouse often wanted sorts and there was no letterfounder in america i had seen types cast at jamess in london but without much attention to the manner however i now contrived a mould made use of the letters we had as puncheons struck the mattrices in lead and thus supplyd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies i also engravd several things on occasion i made the ink i was warehouseman and everything and in short quite a factotum  but however serviceable i might be i found that my services became every day of less importance as the other hands improvd in the business and when keimer paid my second quarters wages he let me know that he felt them too heavy and thought i should make an abatement he grew by degrees less civil put on more of the master frequently found fault was captious and seemd ready for an outbreaking i went on nevertheless with a good deal of patience thinking that his encumberd circumstances were partly the cause at length a trifle snapt our connections for a great noise happening near the courthouse i put my head out of the window to see what was the matter keimer being in the street lookd up and saw me calld out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business adding some reproachful words that nettled me the more for their publicity all the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being witnesses how i was treated he came up immediately into the printinghouse continud the quarrel high words passd on both sides he gave me the quarters warning we had stipulated expressing a wish that he had not been obligd to so long a warning i told him his wish was unnecessary for i would leave him that instant and so taking my hat walkd out of doors desiring meredith whom i saw below to take care of some things i left and bring them to my lodgings  meredith came accordingly in the evening when we talked my affair over he had conceivd a great regard for me and was very unwilling that i should leave the house while he remaind in it he dissuaded me from returning to my native country which i began to think of he reminded me that keimer was in debt for all he possessd that his creditors began to be uneasy that he kept his shop miserably sold often without profit for ready money and often trusted without keeping accounts that he must therefore fail which would make a vacancy i might profit of i objected my want of money he then let me know that his father had a high opinion of me and from some discourse that had passd between them he was sure would advance money to set us up if i would enter into partnership with him my time says he will be out with keimer in the spring by that time we may have our press and types in from london i am sensible i am no workman if you like it your skill in the business shall be set against the stock i furnish and we will share the profits equally  the proposal was agreeable and i consented his father was in town and approvd of it the more as he saw i had great influence with his son had prevailed on him to abstain long from dramdrinking and he hopd might break him of that wretched habit entirely when we came to be so closely connected i gave an inventory to the father who carryd it to a merchant the things were sent for the secret was to be kept till they should arrive and in the meantime i was to get work if i could at the other printinghouse but i found no vacancy there and so remained idle a few days when keimer on a prospect of being employd to print some paper money in new jersey which would require cuts and various types that i only could supply and apprehending bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him sent me a very civil message that old friends should not part for a few words the effect of sudden passion and wishing me to return meredith persuaded me to comply as it would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily instructions so i returnd and we went on more smoothly than for some time before the new jersey jobb was obtained i contrivd a copperplate press for it the first that had been seen in the country i cut several ornaments and checks for the bills we went together to burlington where i executed the whole to satisfaction and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water  at burlington i made an acquaintance with many principal people of the province several of them had been appointed by the assembly a committee to attend the press and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed they were therefore by turns constantly with us and generally he who attended brought with him a friend or two for company my mind having been much more improvd by reading than keimers i suppose it was for that reason my conversation seemd to be more valud they had me to their houses introduced me to their friends and showd me much civility while he tho the master was a little neglected in truth he was an odd fish ignorant of common life fond of rudely opposing receivd opinions slovenly to extream dirtiness enthusiastic in some points of religion and a little knavish withal  we continud there near three months and by that time i could reckon among my acquired friends judge allen samuel bustill the secretary of the province isaac pearson joseph cooper and several of the smiths members of assembly and isaac decow the surveyorgeneral the latter was a shrewd sagacious old man who told me that he began for himself when young by wheeling clay for brickmakers learned to write after he was of age carrid the chain for surveyors who taught him surveying and he had now by his industry acquird a good estate and says he i foresee that you will soon work this man out of his business and make a fortune in it at philadelphia he had not then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere these friends were afterwards of great use to me as i occasionally was to some of them they all continued their regard for me as long as they lived  before i enter upon my public appearance in business it may be well to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and morals that you may see how far those influencd the future events of my life my parents had early given me religious impressions and brought me through my childhood piously in the dissenting way but i was scarce fifteen when after doubting by turns of several points as i found them disputed in the different books i read i began to doubt of revelation itself some books against deism52 fell into my hands they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at boyles lectures it happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them for the arguments of the deists which were quoted to be refuted appeared to me much stronger than the refutations in short i soon became a thorough deist my arguments perverted some others particularly collins and ralph but each of them having afterwards wrongd me greatly without the least compunction and recollecting keiths conduct towards me who was another freethinker and my own towards vernon and miss read which at times gave me great trouble i began to suspect that this doctrine tho it might be true was not very useful my london pamphlet which had for its motto these lines of dryden53    whatever is is right though purblind man    sees but a part o the chain the nearest link    his eyes not carrying to the equal beam    that poises all above  and from the attributes of god his infinite wisdom goodness and power concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions no such things existing appeard now not so clever a performance as i once thought it and i doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceivd into my argument so as to infect all that followd as is common in metaphysical reasonings      52 the creed of an eighteenth century theological sect     which while believing in god refused to credit the     possibility of miracles and to acknowledge the validity     of revelation      53 a great english poet dramatist and critic     16311700 the lines are inaccurately quoted from     drydens oedipus act iii scene i line 293  i grew convincd that truth sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life and i formd written resolutions which still remain in my journal book to practice them ever while i lived revelation had indeed no weight with me as such but i entertaind an opinion that though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it or good because it commanded them yet probably these actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us or commanded because they were beneficial to us in their own natures all the circumstances of things considered and this persuasion with the kind hand of providence or some guardian angel or accidental favourable circumstances and situations or all together preserved me thro this dangerous time of youth and the hazardous situations i was sometimes in among strangers remote from the eye and advice of my father without any willful gross immorality or injustice that might have been expected from my want of religion i say willful because the instances i have mentioned had something of necessity in them from my youth inexperience and the knavery of others i had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with i valued it properly and determind to preserve it  we had not been long returnd to philadelphia before the new types arrivd from london we settled with keimer and left him by his consent before he heard of it we found a house to hire near the market and took it to lessen the rent which was then but twentyfour pounds a year tho i have since known it to let for seventy we took in thomas godfrey a glazier and his family who were to pay a considerable part of it to us and we to board with them we had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order before george house an acquaintance of mine brought a countryman to us whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer all our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure and this countrymans five shillings being our firstfruits and coming so seasonably gave me more pleasure than any crown i have since earned and the gratitude i felt toward house has made me often more ready than perhaps i should otherwise have been to assist young beginners  there are croakers in every country always boding its ruin such a one then lived in philadelphia a person of note an elderly man with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking his name was samuel mickle this gentleman a stranger to me stopt one day at my door and asked me if i was the young man who had lately opened a new printinghouse being answered in the affirmative he said he was sorry for me because it was an expensive undertaking and the expense would be lost for philadelphia was a sinking place the people already halfbankrupts or near being so all appearances to the contrary such as new buildings and the rise of rents being to his certain knowledge fallacious for they were in fact among the things that would soon ruin us and he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing or that were soon to exist that he left me half melancholy had i known him before i engaged in this business probably i never should have done it this man continued to live in this decaying place and to declaim in the same strain refusing for many years to buy a house there because all was going to destruction and at last i had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking  i should have mentioned before that in the autumn of the preceding year i had formd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement which was called the junto54 we met on friday evenings the rules that i drew up required that every member in his turn should produce one or more queries on any point of morals politics or natural philosophy to be discussd by the company and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any subject he pleased our debates were to be under the direction of a president and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth without fondness for dispute or desire of victory and to prevent warmth all expressions of positiveness in opinions or direct contradiction were after some time made contraband and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties      54 a spanish term meaning a combination for political     intrigue here a club or society  the first members were joseph breintnal a copyer of deeds for the scriveners a goodnaturd friendly middleagd man a great lover of poetry reading all he could meet with and writing some that was tolerable very ingenious in many little nicknackeries and of sensible conversation  thomas godfrey a selftaught mathematician great in his way and afterward inventor of what is now called hadleys quadrant but he knew little out of his way and was not a pleasing companion as like most great mathematicians i have met with he expected universal precision in everything said or was forever denying or distinguishing upon trifles to the disturbance of all conversation he soon left us  nicholas scull a surveyor afterwards surveyorgeneral who lovd books and sometimes made a few verses  william parsons bred a shoemaker but loving reading had acquird a considerable share of mathematics which he first studied with a view to astrology that he afterwards laught at it he also became surveyorgeneral  william maugridge a joiner a most exquisite mechanic and a solid sensible man  hugh meredith stephen potts and george webb i have characterizd before  robert grace a young gentleman of some fortune generous lively and witty a lover of punning and of his friends  and william coleman then a merchants clerk about my age who had the coolest clearest head the best heart and the exactest morals of almost any man i ever met with he became afterwards a merchant of great note and one of our provincial judges our friendship continued without interruption to his death upwards of forty years and the club continued almost as long and was the best school of philosophy morality and politics that then existed in the province for our queries which were read the week preceding their discussion put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects that we might speak more to the purpose and here too we acquired better habits of conversation everything being studied in our rules which might prevent our disgusting each other from hence the long continuance of the club which i shall have frequent occasion to speak further of hereafter  but my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interest i had everyone of these exerting themselves in recommending business to us breintnal particularly procurd us from the quakers the printing forty sheets of their history the rest being to be done by keimer and upon this we workd exceedingly hard for the price was low it was a folio pro patria size in pica with long primer notes55 i composd of it a sheet a day and meredith worked it off at press it was often eleven at night and sometimes later before i had finished my distribution for the next days work for the little jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back but so determind i was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio that one night when having imposd56 my forms i thought my days work over one of them by accident was broken and two pages reduced to pi57 i immediately distributd and composed it over again before i went to bed and this industry visible to our neighbors began to give us character and credit particularly i was told that mention being made of the new printingoffice at the merchants everynight club the general opinion was that it must fail there being already two printers in the place keimer and bradford but dr baird whom you and i saw many years after at his native place st andrews in scotland gave a contrary opinion for the industry of that franklin says he is superior to anything i ever saw of the kind i see him still at work when i go home from club and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed this struck the rest and we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with stationery but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business      55 a sheet 812 by 1312 inches having the words     pro patria in translucent letters in the body of the     paper picaa size of type as a b c d long primera     smaller size of type as a b c d      56 to arrange and lock up pages or columns of type in a     rectangular iron frame ready for printing      57 reduced to complete disorder  i mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely tho it seems to be talking in my own praise that those of my posterity who shall read it may know the use of that virtue when they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation  george webb who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to purchase his time of keimer now came to offer himself as a journeyman to us we could not then employ him but i foolishly let him know as a secret that i soon intended to begin a newspaper and might then have work for him my hopes of success as i told him were founded on this that the then only newspaper printed by bradford was a paltry thing wretchedly managd no way entertaining and yet was profitable to him i therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good encouragement i requested webb not to mention it but he told it to keimer who immediately to be beforehand with me published proposals for printing one himself on which webb was to be employd i resented this and to counteract them as i could not yet begin our paper i wrote several pieces of entertainment for bradfords paper under the title of the busy body which breintnal continud some months by this means the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper and keimers proposals which we burlesqud and ridiculd were disregarded he began his paper however and after carrying it on three quarters of a year with at most only ninety subscribers he offered it to me for a trifle and i having been ready some time to go on with it took it in hand directly and it provd in a few years extremely profitable to me  i perceive that i am apt to speak in the singular number though our partnership still continud the reason may be that in fact the whole management of the business lay upon me meredith was no compositor a poor pressman and seldom sober my friends lamented my connection with him but i was to make the best of it  illustration i see him still at work when i go home from club  our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in the province a better type and better printed but some spirited remarks of my writing on the dispute then going on between governor burnet and the massachusetts assembly struck the principal people occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talkd of and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers  their example was followd by many and our number went on growing continually this was one of the first good effects of my having learnt a little to scribble another was that the leading men seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me bradford still printed the votes and laws and other publick business he had printed an address of the house to the governor in a coarse blundering manner we reprinted it elegantly and correctly and sent one to every member they were sensible of the difference it strengthened the hands of our friends in the house and they voted us their printers for the year ensuing  among my friends in the house i must not forget mr hamilton before mentioned who was then returned from england and had a seat in it he interested himself for me strongly in that instance as he did in many others afterward continuing his patronage till his death58      58 i got his son once £500marg note  mr vernon about this time put me in mind of the debt i owd him but did not press me i wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment cravd his forbearance a little longer which he allowd me and as soon as i was able i paid the principal with interest and many thanks so that erratum was in some degree corrected  but now another difficulty came upon me which i had never the least reason to expect mr merediths father who was to have paid for our printinghouse according to the expectations given me was able to advance only one hundred pounds currency which had been paid and a hundred more was due to the merchant who grew impatient and sud us all we gave bail but saw that if the money could not be raisd in time the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution and our hopeful prospects must with us be ruined as the press and letters must be sold for payment perhaps at half price  in this distress two true friends whose kindness i have never forgotten nor ever shall forget while i can remember any thing came to me separately unknown to each other and without any application from me offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself if that should be practicable but they did not like my continuing the partnership with meredith who as they said was often seen drunk in the streets and playing at low games in alehouses much to our discredit these two friends were william coleman and robert grace i told them i could not propose a separation while any prospect remaind of the merediths fulfilling their part of our agreement because i thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done and would do if they could but if they finally faild in their performance and our partnership must be dissolvd i should then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends  thus the matter rested for some time when i said to my partner perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in this affair of ours and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he would for you alone if that is the case tell me and i will resign the whole to you and go about my business no said he my father has really been disappointed and is really unable and i am unwilling to distress him farther i see this is a business i am not fit for i was bred a farmer and it was a folly in me to come to town and put myself at thirty years of age an apprentice to learn a new trade many of our welsh people are going to settle in north carolina where land is cheap i am inclind to go with them and follow my old employment you may find friends to assist you if you will take the debts of the company upon you return to my father the hundred pounds he has advanced pay my little personal debts and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle i will relinquish the partnership and leave the whole in your hands i agreed to this proposal it was drawn up in writing signd and seald immediately i gave him what he demanded and he went soon after to carolina from whence he sent me next year two long letters containing the best account that had been given of that country the climate the soil husbandry etc for in those matters he was very judicious i printed them in the papers and they gave great satisfaction to the publick  as soon as he was gone i recurrd to my two friends and because i would not give an unkind preference to either i took half of what each had offered and i wanted of one and half of the other paid off the companys debts and went on with the business in my own name advertising that the partnership was dissolved i think this was in or about the year 1729     viii  business success and first public service   about this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province and that soon to be sunk59 the wealthy inhabitants opposd any addition being against all paper currency from an apprehension that it would depreciate as it had done in new england to the prejudice of all creditors we had discussd this point in our junto where i was on the side of an addition being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade employment and number of inhabitants in the province since i now saw all the old houses inhabited and many new ones building whereas i remembered well that when i first walkd about the streets of philadelphia eating my roll i saw most of the houses in walnut street between second and front streets60 with bills on their doors to be let and many likewise in chestnutstreet and other streets which made me then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another      59 recalled to be redeemed      60 this part of philadelphia is now the center of the     wholesale business district  our debates possessd me so fully of the subject that i wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it entitled the nature and necessity of a paper currency it was well receivd by the common people in general but the rich men dislikd it for it increasd and strengthend the clamor for more money and they happening to have no writers among them that were able to answer it their opposition slackend and the point was carried by a majority in the house my friends there who conceivd i had been of some service thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money a very profitable jobb and a great help to me this was another advantage gaind by my being able to write  the utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as never afterwards to be much disputed so that it grew soon to fiftyfive thousand pounds and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds trade building and inhabitants all the while increasing tho i now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful61      61 paper money is a promise to pay its face value in     gold or silver when a state or nation issues more such     promises than there is a likelihood of its being able to     redeem the paper representing the promises depreciates     in value before the success of the colonies in the     revolution was assured it took hundreds of dollars of     their paper money to buy a pair of boots  i soon after obtaind thro my friend hamilton the printing of the newcastle paper money another profitable jobb as i then thought it small things appearing great to those in small circumstances and these to me were really great advantages as they were great encouragements he procured for me also the printing of the laws and votes of that government which continud in my hands as long as i followd the business  i now opend a little stationers shop i had in it blanks of all sorts the correctest that ever appeard among us being assisted in that by my friend breintnal i had also paper parchment chapmens books etc one whitemash a compositor i had known in london an excellent workman now came to me and workd with me constantly and diligently and i took an apprentice the son of aquilla rose  illustration i sometimes brought home the paper i purchasd at the stores thro the streets on a wheelbarrow  i began now gradually to pay off the debt i was under for the printinghouse in order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman i took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal but to avoid all appearances to the contrary i drest plainly i was seen at no places of idle diversion i never went out a fishing or shooting a book indeed sometimes debauchd me from my work but that was seldom snug and gave no scandal and to show that i was not above my business i sometimes brought home the paper i purchasd at the stores thro the streets on a wheelbarrow thus being esteemd an industrious thriving young man and paying duly for what i bought the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom others proposed supplying me with books and i went on swimmingly in the meantime keimers credit and business declining daily he was at last forcd to sell his printinghouse to satisfy his creditors he went to barbadoes and there lived some years in very poor circumstances  his apprentice david harry whom i had instructed while i workd with him set up in his place at philadelphia having bought his materials i was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in harry as his friends were very able and had a good deal of interest i therefore proposd a partnership to him which he fortunately for me rejected with scorn he was very proud dressd like a gentleman livd expensively took much diversion and pleasure abroad ran in debt and neglected his business upon which all business left him and finding nothing to do he followed keimer to barbadoes taking the printinghouse with him there this apprentice employd his former master as a journeyman they quarrelld often harry went continually behindhand and at length was forcd to sell his types and return to his country work in pennsylvania the person that bought them employd keimer to use them but in a few years he died  there remained now no competitor with me at philadelphia but the old one bradford who was rich and easy did a little printing now and then by straggling hands but was not very anxious about the business however as he kept the postoffice it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news his paper was thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine and therefore had many more which was a profitable thing to him and a disadvantage to me for tho i did indeed receive and send papers by the post yet the publick opinion was otherwise for what i did send was by bribing the riders who took them privately bradford being unkind enough to forbid it which occasiond some resentment on my part and i thought so meanly of him for it that when i afterward came into his situation i took care never to imitate it  i had hitherto continud to board with godfrey who lived in part of my house with his wife and children and had one side of the shop for his glaziers business tho he worked little being always absorbed in his mathematics mrs godfrey projected a match for me with a relations daughter took opportunities of bringing us often together till a serious courtship on my part ensud the girl being in herself very deserving the old folks encouragd me by continual invitations to supper and by leaving us together till at length it was time to explain mrs godfrey managd our little treaty i let her know that i expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for the printinghouse which i believe was not then above a hundred pounds she brought me word they had no such sum to spare i said they might mortgage their house in the loanoffice the answer to this after some days was that they did not approve the match that on inquiry of bradford they had been informed the printing business was not a profitable one the types would soon be worn out and more wanted that s keimer and d harry had failed one after the other and i should probably soon follow them and therefore i was forbidden the house and the daughter shut up  whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract and therefore that we should steal a marriage which would leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleasd i know not but i suspected the latter resented it and went no more mrs godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition and would have drawn me on again but i declared absolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family this was resented by the godfreys we differed and they removed leaving me the whole house and i resolved to take no more inmates  but this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage i lookd round me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places but soon found that the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one i was not to expect money with a wife unless with such a one as i should not otherwise think agreeable a friendly correspondence as neighbours and old acquaintances had continued between me and mrs reads family who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house i was often invited there and consulted in their affairs wherein i sometimes was of service i pitid poor miss reads unfortunate situation who was generally dejected seldom chearful and avoided company i considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in london as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness tho the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine as she had prevented our marrying before i went thither and persuaded the other match in my absence our mutual affection was revived but there were now great objections to our union the match was indeed looked upon as invalid a preceding wife being said to be living in england but this could not easily be provd because of the distance and tho there was a report of his death it was not certain then tho it should be true he had left many debts which his successor might be calld upon to pay we ventured however over all these difficulties and i took her to wife september 1st 1730 none of the inconveniences happened that we had apprehended she proved a good and faithful helpmate62 assisted me much by attending the shop we throve together and have ever mutually endeavourd to make each other happy thus i corrected that great erratum as well as i could      62 mrs franklin survived her marriage over forty     years franklins correspondence abounds with evidence     that their union was a happy one we are grown old     together and if she has any faults i am so used to     them that i dont perceive them the following is a     stanza from one of franklins own songs written for the     junto        of their chloes and phyllises poets may prate          i sing my plain country joan        these twelve years my wife still the joy of my life          blest day that i made her my own  about this time our club meeting not at a tavern but in a little room of mr graces set apart for that purpose a proposition was made by me that since our books were often referrd to in our disquisitions upon the queries it might be convenient to us to have them altogether where we met that upon occasion they might be consulted and by thus clubbing our books to a common library we should while we likd to keep them together have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole it was likd and agreed to and we filld one end of the room with such books as we could best spare the number was not so great as we expected and tho they had been of great use yet some inconveniences occurring for want of due care of them the collection after about a year was separated and each took his books home again  and now i set on foot my first project of a public nature that for a subscription library i drew up the proposals got them put into form by our great scrivener brockden and by the help of my friends in the junto procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with and ten shillings a year for fifty years the term our company was to continue we afterwards obtaind a charter the company being increased to one hundred this was the mother of all the north american subscription libraries now so numerous it is become a great thing itself and continually increasing these libraries have improved the general conversation of the americans made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges63  mem° thus far was written with the intention expressd in the beginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importance to others what follows was written many years after in compliance with the advice containd in these letters and accordingly intended for the public the affairs of the revolution occasiond the interruption64      63 here the first part of the autobiography written     at twyford in 1771 ends the second part which     follows was written at passy in 1784      64 after this memorandum franklin inserted letters     from abel james and benjamin vaughan urging him to     continue his autobiography  continuation of the account of my life begun at passy near paris 1784  it is some time since i receivd the above letters but i have been too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain it might too be much better done if i were at home among my papers which would aid my memory and help to ascertain dates but my return being uncertain and having just now a little leisure i will endeavour to recollect and write what i can if i live to get home it may there be corrected and improvd  not having any copy here of what is already written i know not whether an account is given of the means i used to establish the philadelphia public library which from a small beginning is now become so considerable though i remember to have come down to near the time of that transaction 1730 i will therefore begin here with an account of it which may be struck out if found to have been already given  at the time i establishd myself in pennsylvania there was not a good booksellers shop in any of the colonies to the southward of boston in new york and philada the printers were indeed stationers they sold only paper etc almanacs ballads and a few common schoolbooks those who lovd reading were obliged to send for their books from england the members of the junto had each a few we had left the alehouse where we first met and hired a room to hold our club in i proposd that we should all of us bring our books to that room where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences but become a common benefit each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wishd to read at home this was accordingly done and for some time contented us  finding the advantage of this little collection i proposd to render the benefit from books more common by commencing a public subscription library i drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary and got a skilful conveyancer mr charles brockden to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed by which each subscriber engagd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books and an annual contribution for increasing them so few were the readers at that time in philadelphia and the majority of us so poor that i was not able with great industry to find more than fifty persons mostly young tradesmen willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each and ten shillings per annum on this little fund we began the books were imported the library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned the institution soon manifested its utility was imitated by other towns and in other provinces the libraries were augmented by donations reading became fashionable and our people having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study became better acquainted with books and in a few years were observd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries  when we were about to sign the above mentioned articles which were to be binding on us our heirs etc for fifty years mr brockden the scrivener said to us you are young men but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fixd in the instrument a number of us however are yet living but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company  the objections and reluctances i met with in soliciting the subscriptions made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting ones self as the proposer of any useful project that might be supposd to raise ones reputation in the smallest degree above that of ones neighbours when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project i therefore put myself as much as i could out of sight and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading in this way my affair went on more smoothly and i ever after practisd it on such occasions and from my frequent successes can heartily recommend it the present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid if it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs someone more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers and restoring them to their right owner  this library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study for which i set apart an hour or two each day and thus repaird in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me reading was the only amusement i allowd myself i spent no time in taverns games or frolicks of any kind and my industry in my business continud as indefatigable as it was necessary i was indebted for my printinghouse i had a young family coming on to be educated and i had to contend with for business two printers who were established in the place before me my circumstances however grew daily easier my original habits of frugality continuing and my father having among his instructions to me when a boy frequently repeated a proverb of solomon seest thou a man diligent in his calling he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men i from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction which encouragd me tho i did not think that i should ever literally stand before kings which however has since happened for i have stood before five and even had the honor of sitting down with one the king of denmark to dinner  we have an english proverb that says he that would thrive must ask his wife it was lucky for me that i had one as much disposd to industry and frugality as myself she assisted me chearfully in my business folding and stitching pamphlets tending shop purchasing old linen rags for the papermakers etc etc we kept no idle servants our table was plain and simple our furniture of the cheapest for instance my breakfast was a long time break and milk no tea and i ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a pewter spoon but mark how luxury will enter families and make a progress in spite of principle being calld one morning to breakfast i found it in a china bowl with a spoon of silver they had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife and had cost her the enormous sum of threeandtwenty shillings for which she had no other excuse or apology to make but that she thought her husband deservd a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his neighbors this was the first appearance of plate and china in our house which afterward in a course of years as our wealth increasd augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value  i had been religiously educated as a presbyterian and though some of the dogmas of that persuasion such as the eternal decrees of god election reprobation etc appeared to me unintelligible others doubtful and i early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect sunday being my studying day i never was without some religious principles i never doubted for instance the existence of the deity that he made the world and governd it by his providence that the most acceptable service of god was the doing good to man that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be punished and virtue rewarded either here or hereafter these i esteemd the essentials of every religion and being to be found in all the religions we had in our country i respected them all tho with different degrees of respect as i found them more or less mixd with other articles which without any tendency to inspire promote or confirm morality servd principally to divide us and make us unfriendly to one another this respect to all with an opinion that the worst had some good effects inducd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion and as our province increasd in people and new places of worship were continually wanted and generally erected by voluntary contribution my mite for such purpose whatever might be the sect was never refused  tho i seldom attended any public worship i had still an opinion of its propriety and of its utility when rightly conducted and i regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only presbyterian minister or meeting we had in philadelphia he usd to visit me sometimes as a friend and admonished me to attend his administrations and i was now and then prevaild on to do so once for five sundays successively had he been in my opinion a good preacher perhaps i might have continued65 notwithstanding the occasion i had for the sundays leisure in my course of study but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect and were all to me very dry uninteresting and unedifying since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforcd their aim seeming to be rather to make us presbyterians than good citizens      65 franklin expressed a different view about the duty     of attending church later  at length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of philippians finally brethren whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely or of good report if there be any virtue or any praise think on these things and i imagind in a sermon on such a text we could not miss of having some morality but he confind himself to five points only as meant by the apostle viz 1 keeping holy the sabbath day 2 being diligent in reading the holy scriptures 3 attending duly the publick worship 4 partaking of the sacrament 5 paying a due respect to gods ministers these might be all good things but as they were not the kind of good things that i expected from that text i despaired of ever meeting with them from any other was disgusted and attended his preaching no more i had some years before composd a little liturgy or form of prayer for my own private use viz in 1728 entitled articles of belief and acts of religion i returnd to the use of this and went no more to the public assemblies my conduct might be blameable but i leave it without attempting further to excuse it my present purpose being to relate facts and not to make apologies for them     ix  plan for attaining moral perfection   it was about this time i conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection i wishd to live without committing any fault at any time i would conquer all that either natural inclination custom or company might lead me into as i knew or thought i knew what was right and wrong i did not see why i might not always do the one and avoid the other but i soon found i had undertaken a task of more difficulty than i had imagined66 while my care was employd in guarding against one fault i was often surprised by another habit took the advantage of inattention inclination was sometimes too strong for reason i concluded at length that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping and that the contrary habits must be broken and good ones acquired and established before we can have any dependence on a steady uniform rectitude of conduct for this purpose i therefore contrived the following method      66 compare philippians iv 8  in the various enumerations of the moral virtues i had met with in my reading i found the catalogue more or less numerous as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name temperance for example was by some confined to eating and drinking while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure appetite inclination or passion bodily or mental even to our avarice and ambition i proposd to myself for the sake of clearness to use rather more names with fewer ideas annexd to each than a few names with more ideas and i included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurrd to me as necessary or desirable and annexed to each a short precept which fully expressd the extent i gave to its meaning  these names of virtues with their precepts were  1 temperance  eat not to dullness drink not to elevation  2 silence  speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling conversation  3 order  let all your things have their places let each part of your business have its time  4 resolution  resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you resolve  5 frugality  make no expense but to do good to others or yourself i e waste nothing  6 industry  lose no time be always employd in something useful cut off all unnecessary actions  7 sincerity  use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly and if you speak speak accordingly  8 justice  wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty  9 moderation  avoid extreams forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve  10 cleanliness  tolerate no uncleanliness in body cloaths or habitation  11 tranquillity  be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable  12 chastity  13 humility  imitate jesus and socrates  my intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues i judgd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once but to fix it on one of them at a time and when i should be master of that then to proceed to another and so on till i should have gone thro the thirteen and as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others i arrangd them with that view as they stand above temperance first as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations this being acquird and establishd silence would be more easy and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that i improvd in virtue and considering that in conversation it was obtaind rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue and therefore wishing to break a habit i was getting into of prattling punning and joking which only made me acceptable to trifling company i gave silence the second place this and the next order i expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies resolution once become habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues frugality and industry freeing me from my remaining debt and producing affluence and independence would make more easy the practice of sincerity and justice etc etc conceiving then that agreeably to the advice of pythagoras67 in his golden verses daily examination would be necessary i contrived the following method for conducting that examination  i made a little book in which i allotted a page for each of the virtues68 i ruld each page with red ink so as to have seven columns one for each day of the week marking each column with a letter for the day i crossd these columns with thirteen red lines marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues on which line and in its proper column i might mark by a little black spot every fault i found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day

                         i determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of the virtues successively thus in the first week my great guard was to avoid every the least offense against temperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance only marking every evening the faults of the day thus if in the first week i could keep my first line marked t clear of spots i supposd the habit of that virtue so much strengthend and its opposite weakend that i might venture extending my attention to include the next and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots proceeding thus to the last i could go thro a course compleat in thirteen weeks and four courses in a year and like him who having a garden to weed does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once which would exceed his reach and his strength but works on one of the beds at a time and having accomplishd the first proceeds to a second so i should have i hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress i made in virtue by clearing successively my lines of their spots till in the end by a number of courses i should be happy in viewing a clean book after a thirteen weeks daily examination  this my little book had for its motto these lines from addisons cato    here will i hold if theres a power above us    and that there is all nature cries aloud    thro all her works he must delight in virtue    and that which he delights in must be happy  another from cicero  o vitæ philosophia dux o virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum unus dies bene et ex præceptis tuis actus peccanti

truest interest strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to me  i used also

with occasional intermissions for some time i was surprisd to find myself so much fuller of faults than i had imagined but i had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish to avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book which by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course became full of holes i transferrd my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book on which the lines were drawn with red ink that made a durable stain and on those lines i markd my faults with a blacklead pencil which marks i could easily wipe out with a wet sponge after a while i went thro one course only in a year and afterward only one in several years till at length i omitted them entirely being employd in voyages and business abroad with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered but i always carried my little book with me  my scheme of order gave me the most trouble70 and i found that tho it might be practicable where a mans business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time that of a journeyman printer for instance it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master who must mix with the world and often receive people of business at their own hours order too with regard to places for things papers etc i found extreamly difficult to acquire i had not been early accustomed to it and having an exceeding good memory i was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method this article therefore cost me so much painful attention and my faults in it vexed me so much and i made so little progress in amendment and had such frequent relapses that i was almost ready to give up the attempt and content myself with a faulty character in that respect like the man who in buying an ax of a smith my neighbour desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel he turnd while the smith pressd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone which made the turning of it very fatiguing the man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on and at length would take his ax as it was without farther grinding no said the smith turn on turn on we shall have it bright byandby as yet it is only speckled yes says the man but i think i like a speckled ax best and i believe this may have been the case with many who having for want of some such means as i employd found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue have given up the struggle and concluded that a speckled ax was best for something that pretended to be reason was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as i exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals which if it were known would make me ridiculous that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself to keep his friends in countenance  illustration the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel      70 professor mcmaster tells us that when franklin was     american agent in france his lack of business order was     a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends     strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold     papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most     careless way over the table and floor  in truth i found myself incorrigible with respect to order and now i am grown old and my memory bad i feel very sensibly the want of it but on the whole tho i never arrived at the perfection i had been so ambitious of obtaining but fell far short of it yet i was by the endeavour a better and a happier man than i otherwise should have been if i had not attempted it as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies tho they never reach the wishdfor excellence of those copies their hand is mended by the endeavour and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible  it may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice with the blessing of god their ancestor owd the constant felicity of his life down to his 79th year in which this is written what reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of providence but if they arrive the reflection on past happiness enjoyd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation to temperance he ascribes his longcontinued health and what is still left to him of a good constitution to industry and frugality the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned to sincerity and justice the confidence of his country and the honorable employs it conferred upon him and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues71 even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them all that evenness of temper and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes his company still sought for and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance i hope therefore that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit      71 while there can be no question that franklins moral     improvement and happiness were due to the practice of     these virtues yet most people will agree that we shall     have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to     a virtuous life franklins own suggestion that the     scheme smacks of foppery in morals seems justified     woodrow wilson well puts it men do not take fire from     such thoughts unless something deeper which is missing     here shine through them what may have seemed to the     eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us     nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of     good sense and sound conduct what redeems it from     pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of     usefulness to be seen in franklin himself who set these     standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own     life see galatians chapter v for the christian     plan of moral perfection  it will be remarkd that tho my scheme was not wholly without religion there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect i had purposely avoided them for being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions and intending some time or other to publish it i would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone of any sect against it i purposed writing a little comment on each virtue in which i would have shown the advantages of possessing it and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice and i should have called my book the art of virtue72 because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good that does not instruct and indicate the means but is like the apostles man of verbal charity who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals exhorted them to be fed and clothedjames ii 15 16      72 nothing so likely to make a mans fortune as     virtuemarg note  but it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled i did indeed from time to time put down short hints of the sentiments reasonings etc to be made use of in it some of which i have still by me but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life and public business since have occasioned my postponing it for it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project that required the whole man to execute and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to it has hitherto remaind unfinishd  in this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden but forbidden because they are hurtful the nature of man alone considered that it was therefore everyones interest to be virtuous who wishd to be happy even in this world and i should from this circumstance there being always in the world a number of rich merchants nobility states and princes who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs and such being so rare have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor mans fortune as those of probity and integrity  my list of virtues containd at first but twelve but a quaker friend having kindly informed me that i was generally thought proud that my pride showd itself frequently in conversation that i was not content with being in the right when discussing any point but was overbearing and rather insolent of which he convincd me by mentioning several instances i determined endeavouring to cure myself if i could of this vice or folly among the rest and i added humility to my list giving an extensive meaning to the word  i cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue but i had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it i made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others and all positive assertion of my own i even forbid myself agreeably to the old laws of our junto the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixd opinion such as certainly undoubtedly etc and i adopted instead of them i conceive i apprehend or i imagine a thing to be so or so or it so appears to me at present when another asserted something that i thought an error i denyd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition and in answering i began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right but in the present case there appeard or seemd to me some difference etc i soon found the advantage of this change in my manner the conversations i engagd in went on more pleasantly the modest way in which i proposd my opinions procurd them a readier reception and less contradiction i had less mortification when i was found to be in the wrong and i more easily prevaild with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when i happened to be in the right  and this mode which i at first put on with some violence to natural inclination became at length so easy and so habitual to me that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me and to this habit after my character of integrity i think it principally owing that i had early so much weight with my fellowcitizens when i proposed new institutions or alterations in the old and so much influence in public councils when i became a member for i was but a bad speaker never eloquent subject to much hesitation in my choice of words hardly correct in language and yet i generally carried my points  in reality there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride disguise it struggle with it beat it down stifle it mortify it as much as one pleases it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself you will see it perhaps often in this history for even if i could conceive that i had compleatly overcome it i should probably be proud of my humility  thus far written at passy 1784  i am now about to write at home august 1788 but cannot have the help expected from my papers many of them being lost in the war i have however found the following73      73 this is a marginal memorandumb  having mentioned a great and extensive project which i had conceivd it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project and its object its first rise in my mind appears in the following little paper accidentally preservd viz  observations on my reading history in library may 19th 1731  that the great affairs of the world the wars revolutions etc are carried on and effected by parties  that the view of these parties is their present general interest or what they take to be such  that the different views of these different parties occasion all confusion  that while a party is carrying on a general design each man has his particular private interest in view  that as soon as a party has gaind its general point each member becomes intent upon his particular interest which thwarting others breaks that party into divisions and occasions more confusion  that few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their country whatever they may pretend and tho their actings bring real good to their country yet men primarily considered that their own and their countrys interest was united and did not act from a principle of benevolence  that fewer still in public affairs act with a view to the good of mankind  there seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a united party for virtue by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body to be governd by suitable good and wise rules which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to than common people are to common laws  i at present think that whoever attempts this aright and is well qualified cannot fail of pleasing god and of meeting with success  b f  revolving this project in my mind as to be undertaken hereafter when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure i put down from time to time on pieces of paper such thoughts as occurrd to me respecting it most of these are lost but i find one purporting to be the substance of an intended creed containing as i thought the essentials of every known religion and being free of everything that might shock the professors of any religion it is expressd in these words viz  that there is one god who made all things  that he governs the world by his providence  that he ought to be worshiped by adoration prayer and thanksgiving  but that the most acceptable service of god is doing good to man  that the soul is immortal  and that god will certainly reward virtue and punish vice either here or hereafter  my ideas at that time were that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only that each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks examination and practice of the virtues as in the beforementiond model that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret till it was become considerable to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous welldisposed youths to whom with prudent caution the scheme should be gradually communicated that the members should engage to afford their advice assistance and support to each other in promoting one anothers interests business and advancement in life that for distinction we should be calld the society of the free and easy free as being by the general practice and habit of the virtues free from the dominion of vice and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality free from debt which exposes a man to confinement and a species of slavery to his creditors  this is as much as i can now recollect of the project except that i communicated it in part to two young men who adopted it with some enthusiasm but my then narrow circumstances and the necessity i was under of sticking close to my business occasioned my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time and my multifarious occupations public and private inducd me to continue postponing so that it has been omitted till i have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise though i am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme and might have been very useful by forming a great number of good citizens and i was not discouragd by the seeming magnitude of the undertaking as i have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes and accomplish great affairs among mankind if he first forms a good plan and cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business     x  poor richards almanac and other activities   in 1732 i first publishd my almanack under the name of richard saunders it was continud by me about twentyfive years commonly calld poor richards almanac74 i endeavourd to make it both entertaining and useful and it accordingly came to be in such demand that i reapd considerable profit from it vending annually near ten thousand and observing that it was generally read scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it i considerd it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people who bought scarcely any other books i therefore filled all the little spaces that occurrd between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality as the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue it being more difficult for a man in want to act always honestly as to use here one of those proverbs it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright      74 the almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as     well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather     franklin took his title from poor robin a famous     english almanac and from richard saunders a wellknown     almanac publisher for the maxims of poor richard see     pages 331335  these proverbs which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations i assembled and formd into a connected discourse prefixd to the almanack of 1757 as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction the bringing all these scatterd councils thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression the piece being universally approved was copied in all the newspapers of the continent reprinted in britain on a broadside to be stuck up in houses two translations were made of it in french and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants in pennsylvania as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities some thought it had its share of influence in producing that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years after its publication  two pages from poor

another means of communicating instruction and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from the spectator and other moral writers and sometimes publishd little pieces of my own which had been first composed for reading in our junto of these are a socratic dialogue tending to prove that whatever might be his parts and abilities a vicious man could not properly be called a man of sense and a discourse on selfdenial showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations these may be found in the papers about the beginning of 173575      75 june 23 and july 7 1730smyth  in the conduct of my newspaper i carefully excluded all libeling and personal abuse which is of late years become so disgraceful to our country whenever i was solicited to insert anything of that kind and the writers pleaded as they generally did the liberty of the press and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach in which anyone who would pay had a right to a place my answer was that i would print the piece separately if desired and the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself but that i would not take upon me to spread his detraction and that having contracted with my subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining i could not fill their papers with private altercation in which they had no concern without doing them manifest injustice now many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels and are moreover so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring states and even on the conduct of our best national allies which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences these things i mention as a caution to young printers and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices but refuse steadily as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not on the whole be injurious to their interests  in 1733 i sent one of my journeymen to charleston south carolina where a printer was wanting i furnishd him with a press and letters on an agreement of partnership by which i was to receive onethird of the profits of the business paying onethird of the expense he was a man of learning and honest but ignorant in matters of account and tho he sometimes made me remittances i could get no account from him nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived on his decease the business was continued by his widow who being born and bred in holland where as i have been informd the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of the transactions past but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards and managed the business with such success that she not only brought up reputably a family of children but at the expiration of the term was able to purchase of me the printinghouse and establish her son in it  i mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch of education for our young females as likely to be of more use to them and their children in case of widowhood than either music or dancing by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men and enabling them to continue perhaps a profitable mercantile house with establishd correspondence till a son is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family  about the year 1734 there arrived among us from ireland a young presbyterian preacher named hemphill who delivered with a good voice and apparently extempore most excellent discourses which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions who joind in admiring them among the rest i became one of his constant hearers his sermons pleasing me as they had little of the dogmatical kind but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue or what in the religious stile are called good works those however of our congregation who considered themselves as orthodox presbyterians disapprovd his doctrine and were joind by most of the old clergy who arraignd him of heterodoxy before the synod in order to have him silencd i became his zealous partisan and contributed all i could to raise a party in his favour and we combated for him awhile with some hopes of success there was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion and finding that tho an elegant preacher he was but a poor writer i lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets and one piece in the gazette of april 1735 those pamphlets as is generally the case with controversial writings tho eagerly read at the time were soon out of vogue and i question whether a single copy of them now exists76      76 see a list of books written by or relating to     benjamin franklin by paul leicester ford 1889 p     15smyth  during the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly one of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much admired thought he had somewhere read the sermon before or at least a part of it on search he found that part quoted at length in one of the british reviews from a discourse of dr fosters77 this detection gave many of our party disgust who accordingly abandoned his cause and occasiond our more speedy discomfiture in the synod i stuck by him however as i rather approvd his giving us good sermons composed by others than bad ones of his own manufacture tho the latter was the practice of our common teachers he afterward acknowledgd to me that none of those he preachd were his own adding that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only on our defeat he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune and i quitted the congregation never joining it after tho i continud many years my subscription for the support of its ministers      77 dr james foster 16971753          let modest foster if

appear in genteel company     hawkins history of musicsmyth  i had begun in 1733 to study languages i soon made myself so much a master of the french as to be able to read the books with ease i then undertook the italian an acquaintance who was also learning it usd often to tempt me to play chess with him finding this took up too much of the time i had to spare for study i at length refusd to play any more unless on this condition that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart or in translations etc which tasks the vanquishd was to perform upon honour before our next meeting as we playd pretty equally we thus beat one another into that language i afterwards with a little painstaking acquird as much of the spanish as to read their books also  i have already mentiond that i had only one years instruction in a latin school and that when very young after which i neglected that language entirely but when i had attained an acquaintance with the french italian and spanish i was surprisd to find on looking over a latin testament that i understood so much more of that language than i had imagined which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it and i met with more success as those preceding languages had greatly smoothd my way  from these circumstances i have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages we are told that it is proper to begin first with the latin and having acquird that it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are derivd from it and yet we do not begin with the greek in order more easily to acquire the latin it is true that if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps you will more easily gain them in descending but certainly if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top and i would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth whether since many of those who begin with the latin quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency and what they have learnt becomes almost useless so that their time has been lost it would not have been better to have begun with the french proceeding to the italian etc for tho after spending the same time they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the latin they would however have acquired another tongue or two that being in modern use might be serviceable to them in common life78      78 the authority of franklin the most eminently     practical man of his age in favor of reserving the     study of the dead languages until the mind has reached a     certain maturity is confirmed by the confession of one     of the most eminent scholars of any age      our seminaries of learning says gibbon do not     exactly correspond with the precept of a spartan king     that the child should be instructed in the arts which     will be useful to the man since a finished scholar may     emerge from the head of westminster or eton in total     ignorance of the business and conversation of english     gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century     but these schools may assume the merit of teaching all     that they pretend to teach the latin and greek     languagesbigelow  after ten years absence from boston and having become easy in my circumstances i made a journey thither to visit my relations which i could not sooner well afford in returning i calld at newport to see my brother then settled there with his printinghouse our former differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate he was fast declining in his health and requested of me that in case of his death which he apprehended not far distant i would take home his son then but ten years of age and bring him up to the printing business this i accordingly performd sending him a few years to school before i took him into the office his mother carried on the business till he was grown up when i assisted him with an assortment of new types those of his father being in a manner worn out thus it was that i made my brother ample amends for the service i had deprivd him of by leaving him so early  illustration our former differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate  in 1736 i lost one of my sons a fine boy of four years old by the smallpox taken in the common way i long regretted bitterly and still regret that i had not given it to him by inoculation this i mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it my example showing that the regret may be the same either way and that therefore the safer should be chosen  our club the junto was found so useful and afforded such satisfaction to the members that several were desirous of introducing their friends which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number viz twelve we had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret which was pretty well observd the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance some of whom perhaps we might find it difficult to refuse i was one of those who were against any addition to our number but instead of it made in writing a proposal that every member separately should endeavour to form a subordinate club with the same rules respecting queries etc and without informing them of the connection with the junto the advantages proposed were the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion as the junto member might propose what queries we should desire and was to report to the junto what passd in his separate club the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation and the increase of our influence in public affairs and our power of doing good by spreading thro the several clubs the sentiments of the junto  the project was approvd and every member undertook to form his club but they did not all succeed five or six only were compleated which were called by different names as the vine the union the band etc they were useful to themselves and afforded us a good deal of amusement information and instruction besides answering in some considerable degree our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions of which i shall give some instances in course of time as they happened  my first promotion was my being chosen in 1736 clerk of the general assembly the choice was made that year without opposition but the year following when i was again proposd the choice like that of the members being annual a new member made a long speech against me in order to favour some other candidate i was however chosen which was the more agreeable to me as besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members which securd to me the business of printing the votes laws paper money and other occasional jobbs for the public that on the whole were very profitable  i therefore did not like the opposition of this new member who was a gentleman of fortune and education with talents that were likely to give him in time great influence in the house which indeed afterwards happened i did not however aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect to him but after some time took this other method having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book i wrote a note to him expressing my desire of perusing that book and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days he sent it immediately and i returnd it in about a week with another note expressing strongly my sense of the favour when we next met in the house he spoke to me which he had never done before and with great civility and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions so that we became great friends and our friendship continued to his death this is another instance of the truth of an old maxim i had learned which says he that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged and it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove than to resent return and continue inimical proceedings  in 1737 colonel spotswood late governor of virginia and then postmastergeneral being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at philadelphia respecting some negligence in rendering and inexactitude of his accounts took from him the commission and offered it to me i accepted it readily and found it of great advantage for tho the salary was small it facilitated the correspondence that improvd my newspaper increasd the number demanded as well as the advertisements to be inserted so that it came to afford me a considerable income my old competitors newspaper declind proportionately and i was satisfyd without retaliating his refusal while postmaster to permit my papers being carried by the riders thus he sufferd greatly from his neglect in due accounting and i mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employd in managing affairs for others that they should always render accounts and make remittances with great clearness and punctuality the character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of business     xi  interest in public affairs   i began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs beginning however with small matters the city watch was one of the first things that i conceivd to want regulation it was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the night those who chose never to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excusd which was supposd to be for hiring substitutes but was in reality much more than was necessary for that purpose and made the constableship a place of profit and the constable for a little drink often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with walking the rounds too was often neglected and most of the nights spent in tippling i thereupon wrote a paper to be read in junto representing these irregularities but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this sixshilling tax of the constables respecting the circumstances of those who paid it since a poor widow housekeeper all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds paid as much as the wealthiest merchant who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in his stores  on the whole i proposed as a more effectual watch the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportiond to the property this idea being approvd by the junto was communicated to the other clubs but as arising in each of them and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution yet by preparing the minds of people for the change it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence  about this time i wrote a paper first to be read in junto but it was afterward publishd on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire with cautions against them and means proposed of avoiding them this was much spoken of as a useful piece and gave rise to a project which soon followed it of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires and mutual assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger associates in this scheme were presently found amounting to thirty our articles of agreement obligd every member to keep always in good order and fit for use a certain number of leather buckets with strong bags and baskets for packing and transporting of goods which were to be brought to every fire and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions  the utility of this institution soon appeared and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company they were advised to form another which was accordingly done and this went on one new company being formed after another till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property and now at the time of my writing this tho upward of fifty years since its establishment that which i first formed called the union fire company still subsists and flourishes tho the first members are all deceasd but myself and one who is older by a year than i am the small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been applyd to the purchase of fireengines ladders firehooks and other useful implements for each company so that i question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations and in fact since these institutions the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed  illustration the flames have often been extinguished  in 1739 arrived among us from ireland the reverend mr whitefield79 who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher he was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches but the clergy taking a dislike to him soon refusd him their pulpits and he was obligd to preach in the fields the multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous and it was matter of speculation to me who was one of the number to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much they admird and respected him notwithstanding his common abuse of them by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils it was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants from being thoughtless or indifferent about religion it seemd as if all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk thro the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street      79 george whitefield pronounced hwitfield     17141770 a celebrated english clergyman and pulpit     orator one of the founders of methodism  and it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air subject to its inclemencies the building of a house to meet in was no sooner proposd and persons appointed to receive contributions but sufficient sums were soon receivd to procure the ground and erect the building which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad about the size of westminster hall80 and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected both house and ground were vested in trustees expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at philadelphia the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect but the inhabitants in general so that even if the mufti of constantinople were to send a missionary to preach mohammedanism to us he would find a pulpit at his service      80 a part of the palace of westminster now forming the     vestibule to the houses of parliament in london  mr whitefield in leaving us went preaching all the way thro the colonies to georgia the settlement of that province had lately been begun but instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen accustomed to labour the only people fit for such an enterprise it was with families of broken shopkeepers and other insolvent debtors many of indolent and idle habits taken out of the jails who being set down in the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement perished in numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for the sight of their miserable situation inspird the benevolent heart of mr whitefield with the idea of building an orphan house there in which they might be supported and educated returning northward he preachd up this charity and made large collections for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers of which i myself was an instance  i did not disapprove of the design but as georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen and it was proposed to send them from philadelphia at a great expense i thought it would have been better to have built the house here and brought the children to it this i advisd but he was resolute in his first project rejected my counsel and i therefore refusd to contribute i happened soon after to attend one of his sermons in the course of which i perceived he intended to finish with a collection and i silently resolved he should get nothing from me i had in my pocket a handful of copper money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles in gold as he proceeded i began to soften and concluded to give the coppers another stroke of his oratory made me ashamd of that and determind me to give the silver and he finishd so admirably that i emptyd my pocket wholly into the collectors dish gold and all at this sermon there was also one of our club who being of my sentiments respecting the building in georgia and suspecting a collection might be intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from home towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a strong desire to give and applyd to a neighbour who stood near him to borrow some money for the purpose the application was unfortunately made to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher his answer was at any other time friend hopkinson i would lend to thee freely but not now for thee seems to be out of thy right senses  some of mr whitefields enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument but i who was intimately acquainted with him being employed in printing his sermons and journals etc never had the least suspicion of his integrity but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight as we had no religious connection he usd indeed sometimes to pray for my conversion but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard ours was a mere civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted to his death  the following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood upon one of his arrivals from england at boston he wrote to me that he should come soon to philadelphia but knew not where he could lodge when there as he understood his old friend and host mr benezet was removed to germantown my answer was you know my house if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations you will be most heartily welcome he replyd that if i made that kind offer for christs sake i should not miss of a reward and i returned dont let me be mistaken it was not for christs sake but for your sake one of our common acquaintance jocosely remarkd that knowing it to be the custom of the saints when they received any favour to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders and place it in heaven i had contrivd to fix it on earth  the last time i saw mr whitefield was in london when he consulted me about his orphan house concern and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college  he had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly that he might be heard and understood at a great distance especially as his auditories however numerous observd the most exact silence he preachd one evening from the top of the courthouse steps which are in the middle of marketstreet and on the west side of secondstreet which crosses it at right angles both streets were filld with his hearers to a considerable distance being among the hindmost in marketstreet i had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards the river and i found his voice distinct till i came near frontstreet when some noise in that street obscurd it imagining then a semicircle of which my distance should be the radius and that it were filld with auditors to each of whom i allowd two square feet i computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand this reconcild me to the newspaper accounts of his having preachd to twentyfive thousand people in the fields and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies of which i had sometimes doubted  by hearing him often i came to distinguish easily between sermons newly composd and those which he had often preachd in the course of his travels his delivery of the latter was so improvd by frequent repetitions that every accent every emphasis every modulation of voice was so perfectly well turnd and well placd that without being interested in the subject one could not help being pleasd with the discourse a pleasure of much the same kind with that receivd from an excellent piece of musick this is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals  his writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies unguarded expressions and even erroneous opinions delivered in preaching might have been afterwards explaind or qualifid by supposing others that might have accompanid them or they might have been denyd but litera scripta manet critics attackd his writings violently and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their increase so that i am of opinion if he had never written anything he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect and his reputation might in that case have been still growing even after his death as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed  my business was now continually augmenting and my circumstances growing daily easier my newspaper having become very profitable as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces i experienced too the truth of the observation that after getting the first hundred pound it is more easy to get the second money itself being of a prolific nature  the partnership at carolina having succeeded i was encouragd to engage in others and to promote several of my workmen who had behaved well by establishing them with printinghouses in different colonies on the same terms with that in carolina most of them did well being enabled at the end of our term six years to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves by which means several families were raised partnerships often finish in quarrels but i was happy in this that mine were all carried on and ended amicably owing i think a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled in our articles everything to be done by or expected from each partner so that there was nothing to dispute which precaution i would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships for whatever esteem partners may have for and confidence in each other at the time of the contract little jealousies and disgusts may arise with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business etc which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences     xii  defense of the province   i had on the whole abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in pennsylvania there were however two things that i regretted there being no provision for defense nor for a compleat education of youth no militia nor any college i therefore in 1743 drew up a proposal for establishing an academy and at that time thinking the reverend mr peters who was out of employ a fit person to superintend such an institution i communicated the project to him but he having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries which succeeded declind the undertaking and not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust i let the scheme lie awhile dormant i succeeded better the next year 1744 in proposing and establishing a philosophical society the paper i wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings when collected  with respect to defense spain having been several years at war against great britain and being at length joind by france which brought us into great danger and the laboured and longcontinued endeavour of our governor thomas to prevail with our quaker assembly to pass a militia law and make other provisions for the security of the province having proved abortive i determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people to promote this i first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled plain truth in which i stated our defenceless situation in strong lights with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense and promisd to propose in a few days an association to be generally signed for that purpose the pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect i was calld upon for the instrument of association and having settled the draft of it with a few friends i appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned the house was pretty full i had prepared a number of printed copies and provided pens and ink dispersd all over the room i harangued them a little on the subject read the paper and explained it and then distributed the copies which were eagerly signed not the least objection being made  when the company separated and the papers were collected we found above twelve hundred hands and other copies being dispersed in the country the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand these all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms formed themselves into companies and regiments chose their own officers and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise and other parts of military discipline the women by subscriptions among themselves provided silk colours which they presented to the companies painted with different devices and mottos which i supplied  illustration one of the flags of the pennsylvania association 1747 designed by franklin and made by the women of philadelphia  the officers of the companies composing the philadelphia regiment being met chose me for their colonel but conceiving myself unfit i declind that station and recommended mr lawrence a fine person and man of influence who was accordingly appointed i then proposd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town and furnishing it with cannon it filled expeditiously and the battery was soon erected the merlons being framd of logs and filld with earth we bought some old cannon from boston but these not being sufficient we wrote to england for more soliciting at the same time our proprietaries for some assistance tho without much expectation of obtaining it  meanwhile colonel lawrence william allen abram taylor esqr and myself were sent to new york by the associators commissiond to borrow some cannon of governor clinton he at first refusd us peremptorily but at dinner with his council where there was great drinking of madeira wine as the custom of that place then was he softened by degrees and said he would lend us six after a few more bumpers he advancd to ten and at length he very goodnaturedly conceded eighteen they were fine cannon eighteenpounders with their carriages which we soon transported and mounted on our battery where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted and among the rest i regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier  illustration i regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier  my activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council they took me into confidence and i was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association calling in the aid of religion i proposd to them the proclaiming a fast to promote reformation and implore the blessing of heaven on our undertaking they embracd the motion but as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation my education in new england where a fast is proclaimed every year was here of some advantage i drew it in the accustomed stile it was translated into german81 printed in both languages and divulgd thro the province this gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association and it would probably have been general among all but quakers if the peace had not soon intervend      81 wm penns agents sought recruits for the colony of     pennsylvania in the low countries of germany and there     are still in eastern pennsylvania many germans     inaccurately called pennsylvania dutch many of them use     a germanized english  it was thought by some of my friends that by my activity in these affairs i should offend that sect and thereby lose my interest in the assembly of the province where they formed a great majority a young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the house and wished to succeed me as their clerk acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election and he therefore in good will advisd me to resign as more consistent with my honour than being turnd out my answer to him was that i had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office and never to refuse one when offerd to him i approve says i of his rule and will practice it with a small addition i shall never ask never refuse nor ever resign an office if they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another they shall take it from me i will not by giving it up lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries i heard however no more of this i was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election possibly as they dislikd my late intimacy with the members of council who had joind the governors in all the disputes about military preparations with which the house had long been harassd they might have been pleasd if i would voluntarily have left them but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association and they could not well give another reason  indeed i had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them provided they were not requird to assist in it and i found that a much greater number of them than i could have imagined tho against offensive war were clearly for the defensive many pamphlets pro and con were publishd on the subject and some by good quakers in favour of defense which i believe convincd most of their younger people  a transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments it had been proposd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock then about sixty pounds in tickets of the lottery by our rules no money could be disposd of till the next meeting after the proposal the company consisted of thirty members of which twentytwo were quakers and eight only of other persuasions we eight punctually attended the meeting but tho we thought that some of the quakers would join us we were by no means sure of a majority only one quaker mr james morris appeard to oppose the measure he expressed much sorrow that it had ever been proposd as he said friends were all against it and it would create such discord as might break up the company we told him that we saw no reason for that we were the minority and if friends were against the measure and outvoted us we must and should agreeably to the usage of all societies submit when the hour for business arrivd it was movd to put the vote he allowd we might then do it by the rules but as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing  while we were disputing this a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desird to speak with me i went down and found they were two of our quaker members they told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by that they were determind to come and vote with us if there should be occasion which they hopd would not be the case and desird we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends being thus secure of a majority i went up and after a little seeming hesitation agreed to a delay of another hour this mr morris allowd to be extreamly fair not one of his opposing friends appeard at which he expressd great surprize and at the expiration of the hour we carrid the resolution eight to one and as of the twentytwo quakers eight were ready to vote with us and thirteen by their absence manifested that they were not inclind to oppose the measure i afterward estimated the proportion of quakers sincerely against defense as one to twentyone only for these were all regular members of that society and in good reputation among them and had due notice of what was proposd at that meeting  the honorable and learned mr logan who had always been of that sect was one who wrote an address to them declaring his approbation of defensive war and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments he put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service he told me the following anecdote of his old master william penn respecting defense he came over from england when a young man with that proprietary and as his secretary it was wartime and their ship was chasd by an armed vessel supposd to be an enemy their captain prepard for defense but told william penn and his company of quakers that he did not expect their assistance and they might retire into the cabin which they did except james logan82 who chose to stay upon deck and was quarterd to a gun the supposd enemy provd a friend so there was no fighting but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence william penn rebukd him severely for staying upon deck and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel contrary to the principles of friends especially as it had not been required by the captain this reproof being before all the company piqud the secretary who answerd i being thy servant why did thee not order me to come down but thee was willing enough that i should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger      82 james logan 16741751 came to america with william     penn in 1699 and was the business agent for the penn     family he bequeathed his valuable library preserved at     his country seat senton to the city of     philadelphiasmyth  my being many years in the assembly the majority of which were constantly quakers gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war whenever application was made to them by order of the crown to grant aids for military purposes they were unwilling to offend government on the one hand by a direct refusal and their friends the body of the quakers on the other by compliance contrary to their principles hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable the common mode at last was to grant money under the phrase of its being for the kings use and never to inquire how it was applied  but if the demand was not directly from the crown that phrase was found not so proper and some other was to be invented as when powder was wanting i think it was for the garrison at louisburg and the government of new england solicited a grant of some from pennsylvania which was much urgd on the house by governor thomas they could not grant money to buy powder because that was an ingredient of war but they voted an aid to new england of three thousand pounds to be put into the hands of the governor and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread flour wheat or other grain some of the council desirous of giving the house still further embarrassment advisd the governor not to accept provision as not being the thing he had demanded but he replid i shall take the money for i understand very well their meaning other grain is gunpowder which he accordingly bought and they never objected to it83      83 see the votesmarg note  it was in allusion to this fact that when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery and i had said to my friend mr syng one of our members if we fail let us move the purchase of a fireengine with the money the quakers can have no objection to that and then if you nominate me and i you as a committee for that purpose we will buy a great gun which is certainly a fireengine i see says he you have improvd by being so long in the assembly your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain  these embarrassments that the quakers sufferd from having establishd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful and which being once published they could not afterwards however they might change their minds easily get rid of reminds me of what i think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us that of the dunkers i was acquainted with one of its founders michael welfare soon after it appeard he complaind to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions and chargd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers i told him this had always been the case with new sects and that to put a stop to such abuse i imagind it might be well to publish the articles of their belief and the rules of their discipline he said that it had been proposd among them but not agreed to for this reason when we were first drawn together as a society says he it had pleased god to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines which we once esteemed truths were errors and that others which we had esteemed errors were real truths from time to time he has been pleased to afford us farther light and our principles have been improving and our errors diminishing now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge and we fear that if we should once print our confession of faith we should feel ourselves as if bound and confind by it and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement and our successors still more so as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done to be something sacred never to be departed from  this modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth and that those who differ are so far in the wrong like a man traveling in foggy weather those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog as well as those behind him and also the people in the fields on each side but near him all appears clear tho in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them to avoid this kind of embarrassment the quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the assembly and in the magistracy choosing rather to quit their power than their principle  in order of time i should have mentioned before that having in 1742 invented an open stove84 for the better warming of rooms and at the same time saving fuel as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering i made a present of the model to mr robert grace one of my early friends who having an ironfurnace85 found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing as they were growing in demand to promote that demand i wrote and published a pamphlet entitled an account of the newinvented pennsylvania fireplaces wherein their construction and manner of operation is particularly explained their advantages above every other method of warming rooms demonstrated and all objections that have been raised against the use of them answered and obviated etc this pamphlet had a good effect govr thomas was so pleasd with the construction of this stove as described in it that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years but i declind it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions viz that as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours and this we should do freely and generously      84 the franklin stove is still in use      85 warwick furnace chester county pennsylvania     across the schuylkill river from pottstown  an ironmonger in london however assuming a good deal of my pamphlet and working it up into his own and making some small changes in the machine which rather hurt its operation got a patent for it there and made as i was told a little fortune by it and this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others tho not always with the same success which i never contested as having no desire of profiting by patents myself and hating disputes the use of these fireplaces in very many houses both of this and the neighbouring colonies has been and is a great saving of wood to the inhabitants     xiii  public services and duties  17491753   peace being concluded and the association business therefore at an end i turnd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy the first step i took was to associate in the design a number of active friends of whom the junto furnished a good part the next was to write and publish a pamphlet entitled proposals relating to the education of youth in pennsylvania this i distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis and as soon as i could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it i set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years by so dividing it i judgd the subscription might be larger and i believe it was so amounting to no less if i remember right than five thousand pounds  in the introduction to these proposals i stated their publication not as an act of mine but of some publickspirited gentlemen avoiding as much as i could according to my usual rule the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit  the subscribers to carry the project into immediate execution chose out of their number twentyfour trustees and appointed mr francis86 then attorneygeneral and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy which being done and signed a house was hired masters engagd and the schools opened i think in the same year 1749      86 tench francis uncle of sir philip francis     emigrated from england to maryland and became attorney     for lord baltimore he removed to philadelphia and was     attorneygeneral of pennsylvania from 1741 to 1755 he     died in philadelphia august 16 1758smyth  the scholars increasing fast the house was soon found too small and we were looking out for a piece of ground properly situated with intention to build when providence threw into our way a large house ready built which with a few alterations might well serve our purpose this was the building before mentioned erected by the hearers of mr whitefield and was obtained for us in the following manner  it is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects care was taken in the nomination of trustees in whom the building and ground was to be vested that a predominancy should not be given to any sect lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect contrary to the original intention it was therefore that one of each sect was appointed viz one churchofengland man one presbyterian one baptist one moravian etc those in case of vacancy by death were to fill it by election from among the contributors the moravian happend not to please his colleagues and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect the difficulty then was how to avoid having two of some other sect by means of the new choice  several persons were named and for that reason not agreed to at length one mentiond me with the observation that i was merely an honest man and of no sect at all which prevailed with them to chuse me the enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abatd and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the groundrent and discharging some other debts the building had occasiond which embarrassd them greatly being now a member of both sets of trustees that for the building and that for the academy i had a good opportunity of negotiating with both and brought them finally to an agreement by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy the latter undertaking to discharge the debt to keep forever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers according to the original intention and maintain a freeschool for the instruction of poor children writings were accordingly drawn and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories and different rooms above and below for the several schools and purchasing some additional ground the whole was soon made fit for our purpose and the scholars removd into the building the care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen purchasing materials and superintending the work fell upon me and i went thro it the more cheerfully as it did not then interfere with my private business having the year before taken a very able industrious and honest partner mr david hall with whose character i was well acquainted as he had workd for me four years he took off my hands all care of the printingoffice paying me punctually my share of the profits the partnership continued eighteen years successfully for us both  the trustees of the academy after a while were incorporated by a charter from the governor their funds were increasd by contributions in britain and grants of land from the proprietaries to which the assembly has since made considerable addition and thus was established the present university of philadelphia87 i have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning now near forty years and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receivd their education in it distinguishd by their improvd abilities serviceable in public stations and ornaments to their country      87 later called the university of pennsylvania  when i disengaged myself as above mentioned from private business i flatterd myself that by the sufficient tho moderate fortune i had acquird i had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements i purchased all dr spences apparatus who had come from england to lecture here and i proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity but the publick now considering me as a man of leisure laid hold of me for their purposes every part of our civil government and almost at the same time imposing some duty upon me the governor put me into the commission of the peace the corporation of the city chose me of the common council and soon after an alderman and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in assembly this latter station was the more agreeable to me as i was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates in which as clerk i could take no part and which were often so unentertaining that i was inducd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles or anything to avoid weariness and i conceivd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good i would not however insinuate that my ambition was not flatterd by all these promotions it certainly was for considering my low beginning they were great things to me and they were still more pleasing as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion and by me entirely unsolicited  the office of justice of the peace i tryd a little by attending a few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes but finding that more knowledge of the common law than i possessd was necessary to act in that station with credit i gradually withdrew from it excusing myself by my being obligd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the assembly my election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years without my ever asking any elector for his vote or signifying either directly or indirectly any desire of being chosen on taking my seat in the house my son was appointed their clerk  the year following a treaty being to be held with the indians at carlisle the governor sent a message to the house proposing that they should nominate some of their members to be joind with some members of council as commissioners for that purpose88 the house named the speaker mr norris and myself and being commissiond we went to carlisle and met the indians accordingly      88 see the votes to have this more correctlymarg     note  as those people are extreamly apt to get drunk and when so are very quarrelsome and disorderly we strictly forbade the selling any liquor to them and when they complaind of this restriction we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty we would give them plenty of rum when business was over they promisd this and they kept their promise because they could get no liquor and the treaty was conducted very orderly and concluded to mutual satisfaction they then claimd and received the rum this was in the afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and were lodgd in temporary cabins built in the form of a square just without the town in the evening hearing a great noise among them the commissioners walkd out to see what was the matter we found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square they were all drunk men and women quarreling and fighting their darkcolourd bodies half naked seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied by their horrid yellings formd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagind there was no appeasing the tumult and we retired to our lodging at midnight a number of them came thundering at our door demanding more rum of which we took no notice  the next day sensible they had misbehavd in giving us that disturbance they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology the orator acknowledgd the fault but laid it upon the rum and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying the great spirit who made all things made everything for some use and whatever use he designd anything for that use it should always be put to now when he made rum he said let this be for the indians to get drunk with and it must be so and indeed if it be the design of providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means it has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the seacoast  illustration in the evening hearing a great noise among them the commissioners walkd out to see what was the matter  in 1751 dr thomas bond a particular friend of mine conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in philadelphia a very beneficent design which has been ascribd to me but was originally his for the reception and cure of poor sick persons whether inhabitants of the province or strangers he was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it but the proposal being a novelty in america and at first not well understood he met but with small success  at length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a publicspirited project through without my being concernd in it for says he i am often askd by those to whom i propose subscribing have you consulted franklin upon this business and what does he think of it and when i tell them that i have not supposing it rather out of your line they do not subscribe but say they will consider of it i enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation i not only subscribd to it myself but engagd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others previously however to the solicitation i endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers which was my usual custom in such cases but which he had omitted  the subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous but beginning to flag i saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the assembly and therefore proposd to petition for it which was done the country members did not at first relish the project they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approvd of it my allegation on the contrary that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations they considered as a most extravagant supposition and utterly impossible  on this i formd my plan and asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition and granting them a blank sum of money which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the house could throw the bill out if they did not like it i drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one viz and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock ofvalue the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital free of charge for diet attendance advice and medicines and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the assembly for the time being that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker and he is hereby required to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds in two yearly payments to the treasurer of the said hospital to be applied to the founding building and finishing of the same  this condition carried the bill through for the members who had opposd the grant and now conceivd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense agreed to its passage and then in soliciting subscriptions among the people we urgd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give since every mans donation would be doubled thus the clause workd both ways the subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum and we claimd and receivd the public gift which enabled us to carry the design into execution a convenient and handsome building was soon erected the institution has by constant experience been found useful and flourishes to this day and i do not remember any of my political manoeuvers the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure or wherein after thinking of it i more easily excusd myself for having made some use of cunning  it was about this time that another projector the rev gilbert tennent89 came to me with a request that i would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meetinghouse it was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the presbyterians who were originally disciples of mr whitefield unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellowcitizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions i absolutely refusd he then desired i would furnish him with a list of the names of persons i knew by experience to be generous and publicspirited i thought it would be unbecoming in me after their kind compliance with my solicitations to mark them out to be worried by other beggars and therefore refusd also to give such a list he then desird i would at least give him my advice that i will readily do said i and in the first place i advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something next to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything or not and show them the list of those who have given and lastly do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for in some of them you may be mistaken he laughd and thankd me and said he would take my advice he did so for he askd of everybody and he obtaind a much larger sum than he expected with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meetinghouse that stands in archstreet      89 gilbert tennent 17031764 came to america with his     father rev william tennent and taught for a time in     the log college from which sprang the college of new     jerseysmyth  our city tho laid out with a beautiful regularity the streets large straight and crossing each other at right angles had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpavd and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages ploughd them into a quagmire so that it was difficult to cross them and in dry weather the dust was offensive i had livd near what was calld the jersey market and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions a strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pavd with brick so that being once in the market they had firm footing but were often over shoes in dirt to get there by talking and writing on the subject i was at length instrumental in getting the street pavd with stone between the market and the brickd footpavement that was on each side next the houses this for some time gave an easy access to the market dryshod but the rest of the street not being pavd whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement it shook off and left its dirt upon it and it was soon coverd with mire which was not removd the city as yet having no scavengers  after some inquiry i found a poor industrious man who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it twice a week carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours doors for the sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house i then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtaind by this small expense the greater ease in keeping our houses clean so much dirt not being brought in by peoples feet the benefit to the shops by more custom etc etc as buyers could more easily get at them and by not having in windy weather the dust blown in upon their goods etc etc i sent one of these papers to each house and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences it was unanimously signd and for a time well executed all the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market it being a convenience to all and this raisd a general desire to have all the streets paved and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose  after some time i drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into the assembly it was just before i went to england in 1757 and did not pass till i was gone90 and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment which i thought not for the better but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets which was a great improvement it was by a private person the late mr john clifton his giving a sample of the utility of lamps by placing one at his door that the people were first impressd with the idea of enlighting all the city the honour of this public benefit has also been ascribd to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman i did but follow his example and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplyd with from london those we found inconvenient in these respects they admitted no air below the smoke therefore did not readily go out above but circulated in the globe lodgd on its inside and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford giving besides the daily trouble of wiping them clean and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render it totally useless i therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke by this means they were kept clean and did not grow dark in a few hours as the london lamps do but continud bright till morning and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane easily repaird  i have sometimes wonderd that the londoners did not from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps usd at vauxhall91 have in keeping them clean learn to have such holes in their street lamps but these holes being made for another purpose viz to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro them the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought of and therefore after the lamps have been lit a few hours the streets of london are very poorly illuminated      90 see votes      91 vauxhall gardens once a popular and fashionable     london resort situated on the thames above lambeth the     gardens were closed in 1859 but they will always be     remembered because of sir roger de coverleys visit to     them in the spectator and from the descriptions in     smolletts humphry clinker and thackerays vanity     fair  the mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one i proposd when in london to dr fothergill who was among the best men i have known and a great promoter of useful projects i had observd that the streets when dry were never swept and the light dust carried away but it was sufferd to accumulate till wet weather reducd it to mud and then after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms it was with great labour rakd together and thrown up into carts open above the sides of which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall sometimes to the annoyance of footpassengers the reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses  illustration a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom  an accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time i found at my door in cravenstreet92 one morning a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom she appeared very pale and feeble as just come out of a fit of sickness i askd who employd her to sweep there she said nobody but i am very poor and in distress and i sweeps before gentlefolkses doors and hopes they will give me something i bid her sweep the whole street clean and i would give her a shilling this was at nine oclock at 12 she came for the shilling from the slowness i saw at first in her working i could scarce believe that the work was done so soon and sent my servant to examine it who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean and all the dust placd in the gutter which was in the middle and the next rain washd it quite away so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean      92 a short street near charing cross london  i then judgd that if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours a strong active man might have done it in half the time and here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street running down its middle instead of two one on each side near the footway for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with but when divided into two channels it is often too weak to cleanse either and only makes the mud it finds more fluid so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the footpavement which is thereby rendered foul and slippery and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking my proposal communicated to the good doctor was as follows  for the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of london and westminster it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons and the mud rakd up at other times each in the several streets and lanes of his round that they be furnishd with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes to be kept at their respective stands ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service  that in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened when the scavengers with closecovered carts shall also carry it all away  that the mud when rakd up be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts not placd high upon wheels but low upon sliders with lattice bottoms which being coverd with straw will retain the mud thrown into them and permit the water to drain from it whereby it will become much lighter water making the greatest part of its weight these bodies of carts to be placd at convenient distances and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows they remaining where placd till the mud is draind and then horses brought to draw them away  i have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal on account of the narrowness of some streets and the difficulty of placing the drainingsleds so as not to encumber too much the passage but i am still of opinion that the former requiring the dust to be swept up and carryd away before the shops are open is very practicable in the summer when the days are long for in walking thro the strand and fleetstreet one morning at seven oclock i observd there was not one shop open tho it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours the inhabitants of london chusing voluntarily to live much by candlelight and sleep by sunshine and yet often complain a little absurdly of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow  some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating but when they consider that tho dust blown into the eyes of a single person or into a single shop on a windy day is but of small importance yet the great number of the instances in a populous city and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day thus if you teach a poor young man to shave himself and keep his razor in order you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas the money may be soon spent the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it but in the other case he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers and of their sometimes dirty fingers offensive breaths and dull razors he shaves when most convenient to him and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument with these sentiments i have hazarded the few preceding pages hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city i love having lived many years in it very happily and perhaps to some of our towns in america  having been for some time employed by the postmastergeneral of america as his comptroller in regulating several offices and bringing the officers to account i was upon his death in 1753 appointed jointly with mr william hunter to succeed him by a commission from the postmastergeneral in england the american office never had hitherto paid anything to that of britain we were to have six hundred pounds a year between us if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office to do this a variety of improvements were necessary some of these were inevitably at first expensive so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us but it soon after began to repay us and before i was displacd by a freak of the ministers of which i shall speak hereafter we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of ireland since that imprudent transaction they have receivd from itnot one farthing  the business of the postoffice occasiond my taking a journey this year to new england where the college of cambridge of their own motion presented me with the degree of master of arts yale college in connecticut had before made me a similar compliment thus without studying in any college i came to partake of their honours they were conferrd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy     xiv  albany plan of union   in 1754 war with france being again apprehended a congress of commissioners from the different colonies was by an order of the lords of trade to be assembled at albany there to confer with the chiefs of the six nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours governor hamilton having receivd this order acquainted the house with it requesting they would furnish proper presents for the indians to be given on this occasion and naming the speaker mr norris and myself to join mr thomas penn and mr secretary peters as commissioners to act for pennsylvania the house approvd the nomination and provided the goods for the present and tho they did not much like treating out of the provinces and we met the other commissioners at albany about the middle of june  in our way thither i projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government so far as might be necessary for defense and other important general purposes as we passd thro new york i had there shown my project to mr james alexander and mr kennedy two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs and being fortified by their approbation i venturd to lay it before the congress it then appeared that several of the commissioners had formd plans of the same kind a previous question was first taken whether a union should be established which passd in the affirmative unanimously a committee was then appointed one member from each colony to consider the several plans and report mine happend to be preferrd and with a few amendments was accordingly reported  illustration join or die  by this plan the general government was to be administered by a presidentgeneral appointed and supported by the crown and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies met in their respective assemblies the debates upon it in congress went on daily hand in hand with the indian business many objections and difficulties were started but at length they were all overcome and the plan was unanimously agreed to and copies ordered to be transmitted to the board of trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces its fate was singular the assemblies did not adopt it as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it and in england it was judgd to have too much of the democratic the board of trade therefore did not approve of it nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty but another scheme was formd supposed to answer the same purpose better whereby the governors of the provinces with some members of their respective councils were to meet and order the raising of troops building of forts etc and to draw on the treasury of great britain for the expense which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of parliament laying a tax on america my plan with my reasons in support of it is to be found among my political papers that are printed  being the winter following in boston i had much conversation with governor shirley upon both the plans part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers the different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium and i am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted the colonies so united would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves there would then have been no need of troops from england of course the subsequent pretence for taxing america and the bloody contest it occasioned would have been avoided but such mistakes are not new history is full of the errors of states and princes    look round the habitable world how few    know their own good or knowing it pursue  those who govern having much business on their hands do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects the best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom but forcd by the occasion  the governor of pennsylvania in sending it down to the assembly expressed his approbation of the plan as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention the house however by the management of a certain member took it up when i happend to be absent which i thought not very fair and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all to my no small mortification     xv  quarrels with the proprietary governors   in my journey to boston this year i met at new york with our new governor mr morris just arrivd there from england with whom i had been before intimately acquainted he brought a commission to supersede mr hamilton who tird with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to had resignd mr morris askd me if i thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration i said no you may on the contrary have a very comfortable one if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the assembly my dear friend says he pleasantly how can you advise my avoiding disputes you know i love disputing it is one of my greatest pleasures however to show the regard i have for your counsel i promise you i will if possible avoid them he had some reason for loving to dispute being eloquent an acute sophister and therefore generally successful in argumentative conversation he had been brought up to it from a boy his father as i have heard accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion while sitting at table after dinner but i think the practice was not wise for in the course of my observation these disputing contradicting and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs they get victory sometimes but they never get good will which would be of more use to them we parted he going to philadelphia and i to boston  in returning i met at new york with the votes of the assembly by which it appeard that notwithstanding his promise to me he and the house were already in high contention and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retaind the government i had my share of it for as soon as i got back to my seat in the assembly i was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages and by the committees always desired to make the drafts our answers as well as his messages were often tart and sometimes indecently abusive and as he knew i wrote for the assembly one might have imagined that when we met we could hardly avoid cutting throats but he was so goodnaturd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasiond by the contest and we often dind together  illustration one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street  one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street franklin says he you must go home with me and spend the evening i am to have some company that you will like and taking me by the arm he led me to his house in gay conversation over our wine after supper he told us jokingly that he much admird the idea of sancho panza93 who when it was proposed to give him a government requested it might be a government of blacks as then if he could not agree with his people he might sell them one of his friends who sat next to me says franklin why do you continue to side with these damnd quakers had not you better sell them the proprietor would give you a good price the governor says i has not yet blacked them enough he indeed had laboured hard to blacken the assembly in all his messages but they wipd off his colouring as fast as he laid it on and placd it in return thick upon his own face so that finding he was likely to be negrofied himself he as well as mr hamilton grew tird of the contest and quitted the government  these public quarrels94 were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries our hereditary governors who when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions the assemblies for three years held out against this injustice tho constrained to bend at last at length captain denny who was governor morriss successor ventured to disobey those instructions how that was brought about i shall show hereafter      93 the round selfish and selfimportant squire of     don quixote in cervantes romance of that name      94 my acts in morriss time military etcmarg     note  but i am got forward too fast with my story there are still some transactions to be mentiond that happened during the administration of governor morris  war being in a manner commenced with france the government of massachusetts bay projected an attack upon crown point95 and sent mr quincy to pennsylvania and mr pownall afterward governor pownall to new york to solicit assistance as i was in the assembly knew its temper and was mr quincys countryman he applid to me for my influence and assistance i dictated his address to them which was well received they voted an aid of ten thousand pounds to be laid out in provisions but the governor refusing his assent to their bill which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary the assembly tho very desirous of making their grant to new england effectual were at a loss how to accomplish it mr quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent but he was obstinate      95 on lake champlain ninety miles north of albany it     was captured by the french in 1731 attacked by the     english in 1755 and 1756 and abandoned by the french in     1759 it was finally captured from the english by the     americans in 1775  i then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor by orders on the trustees of the loan office which by law the assembly had the right of drawing there was indeed little or no money at that time in the office and therefore i proposd that the orders should be payable in a year and to bear an interest of five per cent with these orders i supposd the provisions might easily be purchasd the assembly with very little hesitation adopted the proposal the orders were immediately printed and i was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them the fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan together with the revenue arising from the excise which being known to be more than sufficient they obtaind instant credit and were not only receivd in payment for the provisions but many moneyd people who had cash lying by them vested it in those orders which they found advantageous as they bore interest while upon hand and might on any occasion be used as money so that they were eagerly all bought up and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen thus this important affair was by my means completed mr quincy returnd thanks to the assembly in a handsome memorial went home highly pleasd with this success of his embassy and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship     xvi  braddocks expedition   the british government not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as proposd at albany and to trust that union with their defense lest they should thereby grow too military and feel their own strength suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertaind of them sent over general braddock with two regiments of regular english troops for that purpose he landed at alexandria in virginia and thence marchd to frederictown in maryland where he halted for carriages our assembly apprehending from some information that he had conceived violent prejudices against them as averse to the service wishd me to wait upon him not as from them but as postmastergeneral under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence and of which they proposd to pay the expense my son accompanied me on this journey  we found the general at frederictown waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro the back parts of maryland and virginia to collect waggons i stayed with him several days dind with him daily and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices by the information of what the assembly had before his arrival actually done and were still willing to do to facilitate his operations when i was about to depart the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in by which it appeard that they amounted only to twentyfive and not all of those were in serviceable condition the general and all the officers were surprisd declard the expedition was then at an end being impossible and exclaimd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores baggage etc not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary  i happend to say i thought it was pity they had not been landed rather in pennsylvania as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon the general eagerly laid hold of my words and said then you sir who are a man of interest there can probably procure them for us and i beg you will undertake it i askd what terms were to be offerd the owners of the waggons and i was desird to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary this i did and they were agreed to and a commission and instructions accordingly prepard immediately what those terms were will appear in the advertisement i publishd as soon as i arrivd at lancaster which being from the great and sudden effect it producd a piece of some curiosity i shall insert it at length as follows    advertisement     lancaster april 26 1755  whereas one hundred and fifty waggons with four horses to each waggon and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses are wanted for the service of his majestys forces now about to rendezvous at wills creek and his excellency general braddock having been pleased to empower me to contract for the hire of the same i hereby give notice that i shall attend for that purpose at lancaster from this day to next wednesday evening and at york from next thursday morning till friday evening where i shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams or single horses on the following terms viz 1 that there shall be paid for each waggon with four good horses and a driver fifteen shillings per diem and for each able horse with a packsaddle or other saddle and furniture two shillings per diem and for each able horse without a saddle eighteen pence per diem 2 that the pay commence from the time of their joining the forces at wills creek which must be on or before the 20th of may ensuing and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling to wills creek and home again after their discharge 3 each waggon and team and every saddle or pack horse is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner and in case of the loss of any waggon team or other horse in the service the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid 4 seven days pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team or horse at the time of contracting if required and the remainder to be paid by general braddock or by the paymaster of the army at the time of their discharge or from time to time as it shall be demanded 5 no drivers of waggons or persons taking care of the hired horses are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses 6 all oats indian corn or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses is to be taken for the use of the army and a reasonable price paid for the same  notemy son william franklin is empowered to enter into like contracts with any person in cumberland county  b franklin     to the inhabitants of the counties of lancaster            york and cumberland  friends and countrymen  being occasionally96 at the camp at frederic a few days since i found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages which had been expected from this province as most able to furnish them but through the dissensions between our governor and assembly money had not been provided nor any steps taken for that purpose      96 by chance  it was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them  i apprehended that the progress of british soldiers through these counties on such an occasion especially considering the temper they are in and their resentment against us would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means the people of these back counties have lately complained to the assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum for if the service of this expedition should continue as it is more than probable it will for one hundred and twenty days the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds which will be paid you in silver and gold of the kings money  the service will be light and easy for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day and the waggons and baggagehorses as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army must march with the army and no faster and are for the armys sake always placed where they can be most secure whether in a march or in a camp  if you are really as i believe you are good and loyal subjects to his majesty you may now do a most acceptable service and make it easy to yourselves for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver may do it together one furnishing the waggon another one or two horses and another the driver and divide the pay proportionately between you but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you your loyalty will be strongly suspected the kings business must be done so many brave troops come so far for your defense must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you waggons and horses must be had violent measures will probably be used and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it and your case perhaps be little pitied or regarded  i have no particular interest in this affair as except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do good i shall have only my labour for my pains if this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed i am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days and i suppose sir john st clair the hussar with a body of soldiers will immediately enter the province for the purpose which i shall be sorry to hear because i am very sincerely and truly your friend and wellwisher  b franklin  i received of the general about eight hundred pounds to be disbursed in advancemoney to the waggon owners etc but that sum being insufficient i advancd upward of two hundred pounds more and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons with two hundred and fiftynine carrying horses were on their march for the camp the advertisement promised payment according to the valuation in case any waggon or horse should be lost the owners however alleging they did not know general braddock or what dependence might be had on his promise insisted on my bond for the performance which i accordingly gave them  while i was at the camp supping one evening with the officers of colonel dunbars regiment he represented to me his concern for the subalterns who he said were generally not in affluence and could ill afford in this dear country to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march thro a wilderness where nothing was to be purchasd i commiserated their case and resolved to endeavour procuring them some relief i said nothing however to him of my intention but wrote the next morning to the committee of the assembly who had the disposition of some public money warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments my son who had some experience of a camp life and of its wants drew up a list for me which i enclosd in my letter the committee approvd and used such diligence that conducted by my son the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons they consisted of twenty parcels each containing  6 lbs loaf sugar 6 lbs good muscovado do 1 lb good green tea 1 lb good bohea do 6 lbs good ground coffee 6 lbs chocolate 12 cwt best white biscuit 12 lb pepper 1 quart best white wine vinegar 1 gloucester cheese 1 kegg containing 20 lbs good butter 2 doz old madeira wine 2 gallons jamaica spirits 1 bottle flour of mustard 2 wellcurd hams 12 dozen dryd tongues 6 lbs rice 6 lbs raisins  these twenty parcels well packd were placed on as many horses each parcel with the horse being intended as a present for one officer they were very thankfully receivd and the kindness acknowledgd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments in the most grateful terms the general too was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons etc and readily paid my account of disbursements thanking me repeatedly and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him i undertook this also and was busily employd in it till we heard of his defeat advancing for the service of my own money upwards of one thousand pounds sterling of which i sent him an account it came to his hands luckily for me a few days before the battle and he returnd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds leaving the remainder to the next account i consider this payment as good luck having never been able to obtain that remainder of which more hereafter  this general was i think a brave man and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some european war but he had too much selfconfidence too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops and too mean a one of both americans and indians george croghan our indian interpreter joind him on his march with one hundred of those people who might have been of great use to his army as guides scouts etc if he had treated them kindly but he slighted and neglected them and they gradually left him  in conversation with him one day he was giving me some account of his intended progress after taking fort duquesne97 says he i am to proceed to niagara and having taken that to frontenac98 if the season will allow time and i suppose it will for duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days and then i see nothing that can obstruct my march to niagara having before revolvd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road to be cut for them thro the woods and bushes and also what i had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred french who invaded the iroquois country i had conceivd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign but i venturd only to say to be sure sir if you arrive well before duquesne with these fine troops so well provided with artillery that place not yet completely fortified and as we hear with no very strong garrison can probably make but a short resistance the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians who by constant practice are dexterous in laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be attackd by surprise in its flanks and to be cut like a thread into several pieces which from their distance cannot come up in time to support each other      97 pittsburg      98 kingston at the eastern end of lake ontario  he smild at my ignorance and replyd these savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw american militia but upon the kings regular and disciplind troops sir it is impossible they should make any impression i was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession and said no more the enemy however did not take the advantage of his army which i apprehended its long line of march exposd it to but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place and then when more in a body for it had just passed a river where the front had halted till all were come over and in a more open part of the woods than any it had passd attackd its advanced guard by heavy fire from behind trees and bushes which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemys being near him this guard being disordered the general hurried the troops up to their assistance which was done in great confusion thro waggons baggage and cattle and presently the fire came upon their flank the officers being on horseback were more easily distinguishd pickd out as marks and fell very fast and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle having or hearing no orders and standing to be shot at till twothirds of them were killed and then being seizd with a panick the whole fled with precipitation  illustration the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians  the waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamperd their example was immediately followed by others so that all the waggons provisions artillery and stores were left to the enemy the general being wounded was brought off with difficulty his secretary mr shirley was killed by his side and out of eightysix officers sixtythree were killed or wounded and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred these eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army the rest had been left behind with colonel dunbar who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores provisions and baggage the flyers not being pursud arrivd at dunbars camp and the panick they brought with them instantly seizd him and all his people and tho he had now above one thousand men and the enemy who had beaten braddock did not at most exceed four hundred indians and french together instead of proceeding and endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour he ordered all the stores ammunition etc to be destroyd that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements and less lumber to remove he was there met with requests from the governors of virginia maryland and pennsylvania that he would post his troops on the frontier so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants but he continued his hasty march thro all the country not thinking himself safe till he arrived at philadelphia where the inhabitants could protect him this whole transaction gave us americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regulars had not been well founded99      99 other accounts of this expedition and defeat may be     found in fiskes washington and his country or     lodges george washington vol 1  in their first march too from their landing till they got beyond the settlements they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants totally ruining some poor families besides insulting abusing and confining the people if they remonstrated this was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders if we had really wanted any how different was the conduct of our french friends in 1781 who during a march thro the most inhabited part of our country from rhode island to virginia near seven hundred miles occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig a chicken or even an apple  captain orme who was one of the generals aidsdecamp and being grievously wounded was brought off with him and continud with him to his death which happend in a few days told me that he was totally silent all the first day and at night only said who would have thought it that he was silent again the following day saying only at last we shall better know how to deal with them another time and dyd in a few minutes after  the secretarys papers with all the generals orders instructions and correspondence falling into the enemys hands they selected and translated into french a number of the articles which they printed to prove the hostile intentions of the british court before the declaration of war among these i saw some letters of the general to the ministry speaking highly of the great service i had rendered the army and recommending me to their notice david hume100 too who was some years after secretary to lord hertford when minister in france and afterward to general conway when secretary of state told me he had seen among the papers in that office letters from braddock highly recommending me but the expedition having been unfortunate my service it seems was not thought of much value for those recommendations were never of any use to me      100 a famous scotch philosopher and historian     17111776  as to rewards from himself i askd only one which was that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted this he readily granted and several were accordingly returnd to their masters on my application dunbar when the command devolvd on him was not so generous he being at philadelphia on his retreat or rather flight i applyd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of lancaster county that he had enlisted reminding him of the late generals orders on that head he promised me that if the masters would come to him at trenton where he should be in a few days on his march to new york he would there deliver their men to them they accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to trenton and there he refusd to perform his promise to their great loss and disappointment  as soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known all the owners came upon me for the valuation which i had given bond to pay their demands gave me a great deal of trouble my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymasters hands but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from general shirley101 and my assuring them that i had applyd to that general by letter but he being at a distance an answer could not soon be receivd and they must have patience all this was not sufficient to satisfy and some began to sue me general shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims and ordering payment they amounted to near twenty thousand pound which to pay would have ruined me      101 governor of massachusetts and commander of the     british forces in america  before we had the news of this defeat the two doctors bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking fort duquesne i looked grave and said it would i thought be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice they seemd surprisd that i did not immediately comply with their proposal why the dl says one of them you surely dont suppose that the fort will not be taken i dont know that it will not be taken but i know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty i gave them the reasons of my doubting the subscription was dropt and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared dr bond on some other occasion afterward said that he did not like franklins forebodings  governor morris who had continually worried the assembly with message after message before the defeat of braddock to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province without taxing among others the proprietary estates and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success the danger and necessity being greater the assembly however continud firm believing they had justice on their side and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their moneybills in one of the last indeed which was for granting fifty thousand pounds his proposd amendment was only of a single word the bill expressd that all estates real and personal were to be taxed those of the proprietaries not excepted his amendment was for not read only a small but very material alteration however when the news of this disaster reached england our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the assemblys answers to the governors messages raisd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions some going so far as to say that by obstructing the defense of their province they forfeited their right to it they were intimidated by this and sent orders to their receivergeneral to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the assembly for such purpose  this being notified to the house was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax and a new bill was formd with an exempting clause which passed accordingly by this act i was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money sixty thousand pounds i had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage and had at the same time drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia which i carried thro the house without much difficulty as care was taken in it to leave the quakers at their liberty to promote the association necessary to form the militia i wrote a dialogue102 stating and answering all the objections i could think of to such a militia which was printed and had as i thought great effect      102 this dialogue and the militia act are in the     gentlemans magazine for february and march     1756marg note     xvii  franklins defense of the frontier   while the several companies in the city and country were forming and learning their exercise the governor prevaild with me to take charge of our northwestern frontier which was infested by the enemy and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts i undertook this military business tho i did not conceive myself well qualified for it he gave me a commission with full powers and a parcel of blank commissions for officers to be given to whom i thought fit i had but little difficulty in raising men having soon five hundred and sixty under my command my son who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army raisd against canada was my aiddecamp and of great use to me the indians had burned gnadenhut103 a village settled by the moravians and massacred the inhabitants but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts      103 pronounced gna´denhoot  in order to march thither i assembled the companies at bethlehem the chief establishment of those people i was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense the destruction of gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger the principal buildings were defended by a stockade they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from new york and had even placd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses for their women to throw down upon the heads of any indians that should attempt to force into them the armed brethren too kept watch and relievd as methodically as in any garrison town in conversation with the bishop spangenberg i mentiond this my surprise for knowing they had obtained an act of parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies i had supposd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms he answerd me that it was not one of their established principles but that at the time of their obtaining that act it was thought to be a principle with many of their people on this occasion however they to their surprise found it adopted by but a few it seems they were either deceivd in themselves or deceivd the parliament but common sense aided by present danger will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions  it was the beginning of january when we set out upon this business of building forts i sent one detachment toward the minisink with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country and another to the lower part with similar instructions and i concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to gnadenhut where a fort was thot more immediately necessary the moravians procurd me five waggons for our tools stores baggage etc  just before we left bethlehem eleven farmers who had been driven from their plantations by the indians came to me requesting a supply of firearms that they might go back and fetch off their cattle i gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition we had not marchd many miles before it began to rain and it continued raining all day there were no habitations on the road to shelter us till we arrivd near night at the house of a german where and in his barn we were all huddled together as wet as water could make us it was well we were not attackd in our march for our arms were of the most ordinary sort and our men could not keep their gun locks104 dry the indians are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose which we had not they met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned and killed ten of them the one who escapd informd that his and his companions guns would not go off the priming being wet with the rain      104 flintlock guns discharged by means of a spark     struck from flint and steel into powder priming in an     open pan  illustration we had not marchd many miles before it began to rain  the next day being fair we continud our march and arrivd at the desolated gnadenhut there was a sawmill near round which were left several piles of boards with which we soon hutted ourselves an operation the more necessary at that inclement season as we had no tents our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there who had been half interrd by the country people  the next morning our fort was plannd and markd out the circumference measuring four hundred and fiftyfive feet which would require as many palisades to be made of trees one with another of a foot diameter each our axes of which we had seventy were immediately set to work to cut down trees and our men being dexterous in the use of them great despatch was made seeing the trees fall so fast i had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine in six minutes they had it upon the ground and i found it of fourteen inches diameter each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long pointed at one end while these were preparing our other men dug a trench all round of three feet deep in which the palisades were to be planted and our waggons the bodies being taken off and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch105 we had ten carriages with two horses each to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot when they were set up our carpenters built a stage  illustration our axes  were immediately set to work to cut down trees  of boards all round within about six feet high for the men to stand on when to fire thro the loopholes we had one swivel gun which we mounted on one of the angles and fird it as soon as fixd to let the indians know if any were within hearing that we had such pieces and thus our fort if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade was finishd in a week though it raind so hard every other day that the men could not work      105 here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels     of a wagon  this gave me occasion to observe that when men are employd they are best contentd for on the days they worked they were goodnaturd and cheerful and with the consciousness of having done a good days work they spent the evening jollily but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with their pork the bread etc and in continual illhumour which put me in mind of a seacaptain whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work and when his mate once told him that they had done everything and there was nothing further to employ them about oh says he make them scour the anchor  this kind of fort however contemptible is a sufficient defense against indians who have no cannon finding ourselves now posted securely and having a place to retreat to on occasion we venturd out in parties to scour the adjacent country we met with no indians but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings there was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention it being winter a fire was necessary for them but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discoverd their position at a distance they had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter and somewhat deeper we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods with these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes and we observd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies made by their laying all round with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm which with them is an essential point this kind of fire so managd could not discover them either by its light flame sparks or even smoke it appeard that their number was not great and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage  we had for our chaplain a zealous presbyterian minister mr beatty who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations when they enlisted they were promised besides pay and provisions a gill of rum a day which was punctually servd out to them half in the morning and the other half in the evening and i observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it upon which i said to mr beatty it is perhaps below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers you would have them all about you he liked the thot undertook the office and with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor executed it to satisfaction and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended so that i thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for nonattendance on divine service  i had hardly finishd this business and got my fort well stord with provisions when i receivd a letter from the governor acquainting me that he had calld the assembly and wished my attendance there if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary my friends too of the assembly pressing me by their letters to be if possible at the meeting and my three intended forts being now compleated and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection i resolved to return the more willingly as a new england officer colonel clapham experienced in indian war being on a visit to our establishment consented to accept the command i gave him a commission and parading the garrison had it read before them and introducd him to them as an officer who from his skill in military affairs was much more fit to command them than myself and giving them a little exhortation took my leave i was escorted as far as bethlehem where i rested a few days to recover from the fatigue i had undergone the first night being in a good bed i could hardly sleep it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two  while at bethlehem i inquird a little into the practice of the moravians some of them had accompanied me and all were very kind to me i found they workd for a common stock ate at common tables and slept in common dormitories great numbers together in the dormitories i observed loopholes at certain distances all along just under the ceiling which i thought judiciously placed for change of air i was at their church where i was entertaind with good musick the organ being accompanied with violins hautboys flutes clarinets etc i understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men women and children as is our common practice but that they assembled sometimes the married men at other times their wives then the young men the young women and the little children each division by itself the sermon i heard was to the latter who came in and were placd in rows on benches the boys under the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girls conducted by a young woman the discourse seemd well adapted to their capacities and was delivered in a pleasing familiar manner coaxing them as it were to be good they behavd very orderly but looked pale and unhealthy which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors or not allowd sufficient exercise  i inquird concerning the moravian marriages whether the report was true that they were by lot i was told that lots were usd only in particular cases that generally when a young man found himself disposd to marry he informd the elders of his class who consulted the elder ladies that governd the young women as these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils they could best judge what matches were suitable and their judgments were generally acquiescd in but if for example it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man the lot was then recurred to i objected if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties some of them may chance to be very unhappy and so they may answerd my informer if you let the parties chuse for themselves which indeed i could not deny  being returned to philadelphia i found the association went on swimmingly the inhabitants that were not quakers having pretty generally come into it formed themselves into companies and chose their captains lieutenants and ensigns according to the new law dr b visited me and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law and ascribed much to those endeavours i had had the vanity to ascribe all to my dialogue however not knowing but that he might be in the right i let him enjoy his opinion which i take to be generally the best way in such cases the officers meeting chose me to be colonel of the regiment which i this time accepted i forget how many companies we had but we paraded about twelve hundred welllooking men with a company of artillery who had been furnished with six brass fieldpieces which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute the first time i reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus and my new honour proved not much less brittle for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in england  during this short time of my colonelship being about to set out on a journey to virginia the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town as far as the lower ferry just as i was getting on horseback they came to my door between thirty and forty mounted and all in their uniforms i had not been previously acquainted with the project or i should have prevented it being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion and i was a good deal chagrind at their appearance as i could not avoid their accompanying me what made it worse was that as soon as we began to move they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor and it gave him great offense no such honour had been paid him when in the province nor to any of his governors and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal which may be true for aught i know who was and still am ignorant of the etiquette in such cases  this silly affair however greatly increased his rancour against me which was before not a little on account of my conduct in the assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation which i had always opposd very warmly and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it he accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the kings service preventing by my influence in the house the proper form of the bills for raising money and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force he also applied to sir everard fawkener the postmastergeneral to deprive me of my office but it had no other effect than to procure from sir everard a gentle admonition  notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the house in which i as a member had so large a share there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself and we never had any personal difference i have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me for the answers it was known i drew up to his messages might be the effect of professional habit and that being bred a lawyer he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit he for the proprietaries and i for the assembly he would therefore sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points and sometimes tho not often take my advice  we acted in concert to supply braddocks army with provisions and when the shocking news arrived of his defeat the governor sent in haste for me to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties i forget now the advice i gave but i think it was that dunbar should be written to and prevaild with if possible to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection till by reinforcements from the colonies he might be able to proceed on the expedition and after my return from the frontier he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops for the reduction of fort duquesne dunbar and his men being otherwise employed and he proposed to commission me as general i had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he professd to have and i believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men and my influence in assembly the grant of money to pay them and that perhaps without taxing the proprietary estate finding me not so forward to engage as he expected the project was dropt and he soon after left the government being superseded by captain denny     xviii  scientific experiments   before i proceed in relating the part i had in public affairs under this new governors administration it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation  in 1746 being at boston i met there with a dr spence who was lately arrived from scotland and showd me some electric experiments they were imperfectly performd as he was not very expert but being on a subject quite new to me they equally surprisd and pleased me soon after my return to philadelphia our library company receivd from mr p collinson fellow of the royal society106 of london a present of a glass tube with some account of the use of it in making such experiments i eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what i had seen at boston and by much practice acquired great readiness in performing those also which we had an account of from england adding a number of new ones i say much practice for my house was continually full for some time with people who came to see these new wonders      106 the royal society of london for improving natural     knowledge was founded in 1660 and holds the foremost     place among english societies for the advancement of     science  to divide a little this incumbrance among my friends i caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glasshouse with which they furnishd themselves so that we had at length several performers among these the principal was mr kinnersley an ingenious neighbour who being out of business i encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money and drew up for him two lectures in which the experiments were rangd in such order and accompanied with such explanations in such method as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following he procurd an elegant apparatus for the purpose in which all the little machines that i had roughly made for myself were nicely formd by instrumentmakers his lectures were well attended and gave great satisfaction and after some time he went thro the colonies exhibiting them in every capital town and pickd up some money in the west india islands indeed it was with difficulty the experiments could be made from the general moisture of the air  obligd as we were to mr collinson for his present of the tube etc i thought it right he should be informd of our success in using it and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments he got them read in the royal society where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their transactions one paper which i wrote for mr kinnersley on the sameness of lightning with electricity107 i sent to dr mitchel an acquaintance of mine and one of the members also of that society who wrote me word that it had been read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs the papers however being shown to dr fothergill he thought them of too much value to be stifled and advisd the printing of them mr collinson then gave them to cave for publication in his gentlemans magazine but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet and dr fothergill wrote the preface cave it seems judged rightly for his profit for by the additions that arrived afterward they swelld to a quarto volume which has had five editions and cost him nothing for copymoney      107 see page 327  it was however some time before those papers were much taken notice of in england a copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the count de buffon108 a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in france and indeed all over europe he prevailed with m dalibard109 to translate them into french and they were printed at paris the publication offended the abbé nollet preceptor in natural philosophy to the royal family and an able experimenter who had formd and publishd a theory of electricity which then had the general vogue he could not at first believe that such a work came from america and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at paris to decry his system afterwards having been assurd that there really existed such a person as franklin at philadelphia which he had doubted he wrote and published a volume of letters chiefly addressd to me defending his theory and denying the verity of my experiments and of the positions deducd from them      108 a celebrated french naturalist 17071788      109 dalibard who had translated franklins letters to     collinson into french was the first to demonstrate in     a practical application of franklins experiment that     lightning and electricity are the same this was may     10th 1752 one month before franklin flew his famous     kite at philadelphia and proved the fact     himselfmcmaster  i once purposd answering the abbé and actually began the answer but on consideration that my writings contained a description of experiments which anyone might repeat and verify and if not to be verifid could not be defended or of observations offerd as conjectures and not delivered dogmatically therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them and reflecting that a dispute between two persons writing in different languages might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations and thence misconceptions of one anothers meaning much of one of the abbés letters being founded on an error in the translation i concluded to let my papers shift for themselves believing it was better to spend what time i could spare from public business in making new experiments than in disputing about those already made i therefore never answered m nollet and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence for my friend m le roy of the royal academy of sciences took up my cause and refuted him my book was translated into the italian german and latin languages and the doctrine it containd was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of europe in preference to that of the abbé so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect except monsieur b of paris his élève and immediate disciple  what gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity was the success of one of its proposed experiments made by messrs dalibard and de lor at marly for drawing lightning from the clouds this engagd the public attention everywhere m de lor who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy and lecturd in that branch of science undertook to repeat what he called the philadelphia experiments and after they were performed before the king and court all the curious of paris flocked to see them i will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment nor of the infinite pleasure i receivd in the success of a similar one i made soon after with a kite at philadelphia as both are to be found in the histories of electricity  dr wright an english physician when at paris wrote to a friend who was of the royal society an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in england the society on this resumd the consideration of the letters that had been read to them and the celebrated dr watson drew up a summary account of them and of all i had afterwards sent to england on the subject which he accompanied with some praise of the writer this summary was then printed in their transactions and some members of the society in london particularly the very ingenious mr canton having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod and acquainting them with the success they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me without my having made any application for that honour they chose me a member and voted that i should be excusd the customary payments which would have amounted to twentyfive guineas and ever since have given me their transactions gratis they also presented me with the gold medal of sir godfrey copley110 for the year 1753 the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president lord macclesfield wherein i was highly honoured      110 an english baronet died in 1709 donator of a fund     of £100 in trust for the royal society of london for     improving natural knowledge  illustration gold medal of sir godfrey copley     xix  agent of pennsylvania in london   our new governor captain denny brought over for me the before mentioned medal from the royal society which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city he accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me having as he said been long acquainted with my character after dinner when the company as was customary at that time were engagd in drinking he took me aside into another room and acquainted me that he had been advisd by his friends in england to cultivate a friendship with me as one who was capable of giving him the best advice and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me and he begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power he said much to me also of the proprietors good disposition towards the province and of the advantage it might be to us all and to me in particular if the opposition that had been so long continud to his measures was dropt and harmony restord between him and the people in effecting which it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself and i might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses etc etc the drinkers finding we did not return immediately to the table sent us a decanter of madeira which the governor made liberal use of and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises  my answers were to this purpose that my circumstances thanks to god were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me and that being a member of the assembly i could not possibly accept of any that however i had no personal enmity to the proprietary and that whenever the public measures he proposd should appear to be for the good of the people no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself my past opposition having been founded on this that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest with great prejudice to that of the people that i was much obliged to him the governor for his professions of regard to me and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hampered with  on this he did not then explain himself but when he afterwards came to do business with the assembly they appeard again the disputes were renewed and i was as active as ever in the opposition being the penman first of the request to have a communication of the instructions and then of the remarks upon them which may be found in the votes of the time and in the historical review i afterward publishd but between us personally no enmity arose we were often together he was a man of letters had seen much of the world and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation he gave me the first information that my old friend jas ralph was still alive that he was esteemd one of the best political writers in england had been employed in the dispute111 between prince frederic and the king and had obtaind a pension of three hundred a year that his reputation was indeed small as a poet pope having damned his poetry in the dunciad112 but his prose was thought as good as any mans      111 quarrel between george ii and his son frederick     prince of wales who died before his father      112 a satirical poem by alexander pope directed against     various contemporary writers  the assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people but with the service of the crown resolvd to petition the king against them and appointed me their agent to go over to england to present and support the petition the house had sent up a bill to the governor granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the kings use ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general lord loudoun which the governor absolutely refusd to pass in compliance with his instructions  i had agreed with captain morris of the packet at new york for my passage and my stores were put on board when lord loudoun arrivd at philadelphia expressly as he told me to endeavour an accommodation between the governor and assembly that his majestys service might not be obstructed by their dissensions accordingly he desird the governor and myself to meet him that he might hear what was to be said on both sides we met and discussed the business in behalf of the assembly i urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time which were of my writing and are printed with the minutes of the assembly and the governor pleaded his instructions the bond he had given to observe them and his ruin if he disobeyd yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if lord loudoun would advise it this his lordship did not chuse to do though i once thought i had nearly prevaild with him to do it but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the assembly and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose declaring that he would spare none of the kings troops for the defense of our frontiers and that if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves they must remain exposd to the enemy  i acquainted the house with what had passd and presenting them with a set of resolutions i had drawn up declaring our rights and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro force against which we protested they at length agreed to drop that bill and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions this of course the governor passd and i was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage but in the meantime the packet had sailed with my seastores which was some loss to me and my only recompense was his lordships thanks for my service all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share  he set out for new york before me and as the time for dispatching the packetboats was at his disposition and there were two then remaining there one of which he said was to sail very soon i requested to know the precise time that i might not miss her by any delay of mine his answer was i have given out that she is to sail on saturday next but i may let you know entre nous that if you are there by monday morning you will be in time but do not delay longer by some accidental hindrance at a ferry it was monday noon before i arrived and i was much afraid she might have sailed as the wind was fair but i was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor and would not move till the next day one would imagine that i was now on the very point of departing for europe i thought so but i was not then so well acquainted with his lordships character of which indecision was one of the strongest features i shall give some instances it was about the beginning of april that i came to new york and i think it was near the end of june before we saild there were then two of the packetboats which had been long in port but were detained for the generals letters which were always to be ready tomorrow another packet arrivd she too was detaind and before we saild a fourth was expected ours was the first to be dispatchd as having been there longest passengers were engaged in all and some extremely impatient to be gone and the merchants uneasy about their letters and the orders they had given for insurance it being war time for fall goods but their anxiety availd nothing his lordships letters were not ready and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk pen in hand and concluded he must needs write abundantly  going myself one morning to pay my respects i found in his antechamber one innis a messenger of philadelphia who had come from thence express with a packet from governor denny for the general he delivered to me some letters from my friends there which occasiond my inquiring when he was to return and where he lodgd that i might send some letters by him he told me he was orderd to call tomorrow at nine for the generals answer to the governor and should set off immediately i put my letters into his hands the same day a fortnight after i met him again in the same place so you are soon returnd innis returnd no i am not gone yet how so i have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordships letter and it is not yet ready is it possible when he is so great a writer for i see him constantly at his escritoire yes says innis but he is like st george on the signs always on horseback and never rides on this observation of the messenger was it seems well founded for when in england i understood that mr pitt113 gave it as one reason for removing this general and sending generals amherst and wolfe that the minister never heard from him and could not know what he was doing      113 william pitt first earl of chatham 17081778 a     great english statesman and orator under his able     administration england won canada from france he was a     friend of america at the time of our revolution  this daily expectation of sailing and all the three packets going down to sandy hook to join the fleet there the passengers thought it best to be on board lest by a sudden order the ships should sail and they be left behind there if i remember right we were about six weeks consuming our seastores and obligd to procure more at length the fleet saild the general and all his army on board bound to louisburg with the intent to besiege and take that fortress all the packetboats in company ordered to attend the generals ship ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready we were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for england the other two packets he still detained carried them with him to halifax where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts then altered his mind as to besieging louisburg and returned to new york with all his troops together with the two packets above mentioned and all their passengers during his absence the french and savages had taken fort george on the frontier of that province and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation  i saw afterwards in london captain bonnell who commanded one of those packets he told me that when he had been detaind a month he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing a point of consequence for a packetboat and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom he was asked how long time that would require he answered three days the general replied if you can do it in one day i give leave otherwise not for you must certainly sail the day after tomorrow so he never obtaind leave though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months  i saw also in london one of bonnells passengers who was so enragd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at new york and then carrying him to halifax and back again that he swore he would sue him for damages whether he did or not i never heard but as he represented the injury to his affairs it was very considerable  on the whole i wonderd much how such a man came to be intrusted114 with so important a business as the conduct of a great army but having since seen more of the great world and the means of obtaining and motives for giving places my wonder is diminished general shirley on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of braddock would in my opinion if continued in place have made a much better campaign than that of loudoun in 1757 which was frivolous expensive and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception for tho shirley was not a bred soldier he was sensible and sagacious in himself and attentive to good advice from others capable of forming judicious plans and quick and active in carrying them into execution loudoun instead of defending the colonies with his great army left them totally exposd while he paraded idly at halifax by which means fort george was lost besides he derangd all our mercantile operations and distressd our trade by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtaind by the enemy but in reality for beating down their price in favour of the contractors in whose profits it was said perhaps from suspicion only he had a share and when at length the embargo was taken off by neglecting to send notice of it to charlestown the carolina fleet was detaind near three months longer whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home      114 this relation illustrates the corruption that     characterized english public life in the eighteenth     century see page 308 it was gradually overcome in     the early part of the next century  shirley was i believe sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business i was at the entertainment given by the city of new york to lord loudoun on his taking upon him the command shirley tho thereby superseded was present also there was a great company of officers citizens and strangers and some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood there was one among them very low which fell to the lot of mr shirley perceiving it as i sat by him i said they have given you sir too low a seat no matter says he mr franklin i find a low seat the easiest  while i was as afore mentiond detaind at new york i receivd all the accounts of the provisions etc that i had furnishd to braddock some of which accounts could not sooner be obtaind from the different persons i had employd to assist in the business i presented them to lord loudoun desiring to be paid the balance he causd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer who after comparing every article with its voucher certified them to be right and the balance due for which his lordship promisd to give me an order on the paymaster this was however put off from time to time and tho i calld often for it by appointment i did not get it at length just before my departure he told me he had on better consideration concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors and you says he when in england have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury and you will be paid immediately  i mentiond but without effect the great and unexpected expense i had been put to by being detaind so long at new york as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid and on my observing that it was not right i should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money i had advancd as i charged no commission for my service o sir says he you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer we understand better those affairs and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means in the doing it to fill his own pockets i assurd him that was not my case and that i had not pocketed a farthing but he appeard clearly not to believe me and indeed i have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments as to my balance i am not paid it to this day of which more hereafter  our captain of the paquet had boasted much before we sailed of the swiftness of his ship unfortunately when we came to sea she proved the dullest of ninetysix sail to his no small mortification after many conjectures respecting the cause when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours which however gaind upon us the captain ordered all hands to come aft and stand as near the ensign staff as possible we were passengers included about forty persons while we stood there the ship mended her pace and soon left her neighbour far behind which provd clearly what our captain suspected that she was loaded too much by the head the casks of water it seems had been all placd forward these he therefore orderd to be movd further aft on which the ship recoverd her character and proved the best sailer in the fleet  the captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots which is accounted thirteen miles per hour we had on board as a passenger captain kennedy of the navy who contended that it was impossible and that no ship ever sailed so fast and that there must have been some error in the division of the logline or some mistake in heaving the log115 a wager ensud between the two captains to be decided when there should be sufficient wind kennedy thereupon examind rigorously the logline and being satisfid with that he determind to throw the log himself accordingly some days after when the wind blew very fair and fresh and the captain of the paquet lutwidge said he believd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots kennedy made the experiment and ownd his wager lost      115 a piece of wood shaped and weighted so as to keep it     stable when in the water to this is attached a line     knotted at regular distances by these devices it is     possible to tell the speed of a ship  the above fact i give for the sake of the following observation it has been remarkd as an imperfection in the art of shipbuilding that it can never be known till she is tried whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer for that the model of a goodsailing ship has been exactly followd in a new one which has provd on the contrary remarkably dull i apprehend that this may partly be occasiond by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading rigging and sailing of a ship each has his system and the same vessel laden by the judgment and orders of one captain shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another besides it scarce ever happens that a ship is formd fitted for the sea and saild by the same person one man builds the hull another rigs her a third lades and sails her no one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others and therefore cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole  even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea i have often observd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches the wind being the same one would have the sails trimmd sharper or flatter than another so that they seemd to have no certain rule to govern by yet i think a set of experiments might be instituted first to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing next the best dimensions and properest place for the masts then the form and quantity of sails and their position as the wind may be and lastly the disposition of the lading this is an age of experiments and i think a set accurately made and combind would be of great use i am persuaded therefore that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it to whom i wish success  illustration sailing ship  we were several times chasd in our passage but outsaild every thing and in thirty days had soundings we had a good observation and the captain judgd himself so near our port falmouth that if we made a good run in the night we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemys privateers who often cruisd near the entrance of the channel accordingly all the sail was set that we could possibly make and the wind being very fresh and fair we went right before it and made great way the captain after his observation shapd his course as he thought so as to pass wide of the scilly isles but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up st georges channel which deceives seamen and caused the loss of sir cloudesley shovels squadron this indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us  we had a watchman placd in the bow to whom they often called look well out before there and he as often answered ay ay but perhaps had his eyes shut and was half asleep at the time they sometimes answering as is said mechanically for he did not see a light just before us which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at the helm and from the rest of the watch but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discoverd and occasiond a great alarm we being very near it the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel it was midnight and our captain fast asleep but captain kennedy jumping upon deck and seeing the danger ordered the ship to wear round all sails standing an operation dangerous to the masts but it carried us clear and we escaped shipwreck for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected this deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in america if i should live to return there  in the morning it was found by the soundings etc that we were near our port but a thick fog hid the land from our sight about nine oclock the fog began to rise and seemd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a playhouse discovering underneath the town of falmouth the vessels in its harbor and the fields that surrounded it this was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasiond  i set out immediately with my son for london and we only stopt a little by the way to view stonehenge116 on salisbury plain and lord pembrokes house and gardens with his very curious antiquities at wilton we arrived in london the 27th of july 1757117      116 a celebrated prehistoric ruin probably of a temple     built by the early britons near salisbury england it     consists of inner and outer circles of enormous stones     some of which are connected by stone slabs      117 here terminates the autobiography as published     by wm temple franklin and his successors what follows     was written in the last year of dr franklins life and     was never before printed in englishmr bigelows     note in his edition of 1868  as soon as i was settled in a lodging mr charles had provided for me i went to visit dr fothergill to whom i was strongly recommended and whose counsel respecting my proceedings i was advisd to obtain he was against an immediate complaint to government and thought the proprietaries should first be personally applid to who might possibly be inducd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends to accommodate matters amicably i then waited on my old friend and correspondent mr peter collinson who told me that john hanbury the great virginia merchant had requested to be informed when i should arrive that he might carry me to lord granvilles118 who was then president of the council and wished to see me as soon as possible i agreed to go with him the next morning accordingly mr hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that noblemans who receivd me with great civility and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in america and discourse thereupon he said to me you americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution you contend that the kings instructions to his governors are not laws and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion but those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony they are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws they are then considered debated and perhaps amended in council after which they are signed by the king they are then so far as they relate to you the law of the land for the king is the legislator of the colonies119 i told his lordship this was new doctrine to me i had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our assemblies to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them and as the assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent so neither could he make a law for them without theirs he assurd me i was totally mistaken i did not think so however and his lordships conversation having a little alarmd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us i wrote it down as soon as i returnd to my lodgings i recollected that about 20 years before a clause in a bill brought into parliament by the ministry had proposd to make the kings instructions laws in the colonies but the clause was thrown out by the commons for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seemd that they had refusd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves      118 george granville or grenville 17121770 as     english premier from 1763 to 1765 he introduced the     direct taxation of the american colonies and has     sometimes been called the immediate cause of the     revolution      119 this whole passage shows how hopelessly divergent     were the english and american views on the relations     between the mother country and her colonies grenville     here made clear that the americans were to have no voice     in making or amending their laws parliament and the     king were to have absolute power over the colonies no     wonder franklin was alarmed by this new doctrine with     his keen insight into human nature and his consequent     knowledge of american character he foresaw the     inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of     england this conversation with grenville makes these     last pages of the autobiography one of its most     important parts  after some days dr fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries they agreed to a meeting with me at mr t penns house in spring garden the conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations but i suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable we then went into consideration of our several points of complaint which i enumerated the proprietaries justifyd their conduct as well as they could and i the assemblys we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement however it was concluded that i should give them the heads of our complaints in writing and they promisd then to consider them i did so soon after but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor ferdinand john paris who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of maryland lord baltimore which had subsisted 70 years and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the assembly he was a proud angry man and as i had occasionally in the answers of the assembly treated his papers with some severity they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression he had conceived a mortal enmity to me which discovering itself whenever we met i declind the proprietarys proposal that he and i should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves and refusd treating with anyone but them they then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the attorney and solicitorgeneral for their opinion and counsel upon it where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days during which time i made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the attorney and solicitorgeneral what it was when they did receive it i never learnt for they did not communicate it to me but sent a long message to the assembly drawn and signed by paris reciting my paper complaining of its want of formality as a rudeness on my part and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose intimating thereby that i was not such  illustration we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement  the want of formality or rudeness was probably my not having addressd the paper to them with their assumd titles of true and absolute proprietaries of the province of pennsylvania which i omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing what in conversation i had delivered viva voce  but during this delay the assembly having prevailed with govr denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people which was the grand point in dispute they omitted answering the message  when this act however came over the proprietaries counselled by paris determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent accordingly they petitioned the king in council and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employd by them against the act and two by me in support of it they alledgd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people and that if it were sufferd to continue in force and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes they would inevitably be ruined we replyd that the act had no such intention and would have no such effect that the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves this is the purport of what i remember as urged by both sides except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal for that the money £100000 being printed and given to the kings use expended in his service and now spread among the people the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many and the total discouragement of future grants and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly was insisted on in the strongest terms on this lord mansfield one of the counsel rose and beckoning me took me into the clerks chamber while the lawyers were pleading and asked me if i was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act i said certainly then says he you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point i answerd none at all he then calld in paris and after some discourse his lordships proposition was accepted on both sides a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the clerk of the council which i signd with mr charles who was also an agent of the province for their ordinary affairs when lord mansfield returned to the council chamber where finally the law was allowed to pass some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law but the assembly did not think them necessary for one years tax having been levied by the act before the order of council arrived they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries after a full enquiry they unanimously signd a report that they found the tax had been assessd with perfect equity  the assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement as an essential service to the province since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country they gave me their thanks in form when i returnd but the proprietaries were enraged at governor denny for having passd the act and turnd him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe he however having done it at the instance of the general and for his majestys service and having some powerful interest at court despisd the threats and they were never put in execution unfinished

arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross so you have the body of a kite which being properly accommodated with a tail loop and string will rise in the air like those made of paper but this being of silk is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thundergust without tearing to the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharppointed wire rising a foot or more above the wood to the end of the twine next the hand is to be tied a silk ribbon and where the silk and twine join a key may be fastened this kite is to be raised when a thundergust appears to be coming on and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not be wet and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window as soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them and the kite with all the twine will be electrified and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger and when the rain has wet the kite and twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle at this key the phial may be charged and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled and all the electric experiments be performed which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube and thereby the

library     the way to wealth  from father abrahams speech forming the preface to poor richards almanac for 1758  it would be thought a hard government that should tax its people onetenth part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more if we reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth or doing of nothing with that which is spent in idle employments or amusements that amount to nothing sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life sloth like rust consumes faster than labor wears while the used key is always bright as poor richard says but dost thou love life then do not squander time for thats the stuff life is made of as poor richard says how much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave as poor richard says  if time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor richard says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us lost time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity sloth makes all things difficult but industry all easy as poor richard says and he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him as we read in poor richard who adds drive thy business let not that drive thee and early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise  industry need not wish and he that lives upon hope will die fasting  there are no gains without pains  he that hath a trade hath an estate and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor but then the trade must be worked at and the calling well followed or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes  what though you have found no treasure nor has any rich relation left you a legacy diligence is the mother of goodluck as poor richard says and god gives all things to industry  one today is worth two tomorrows and farther have you somewhat to do tomorrow do it today  if you were a servant would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle are you then your own master be ashamed to catch yourself idle  stick to it steadily and you will see great effects for constant dropping wears away stones and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable and little strokes fell great oaks  methinks i hear some of you say must a man afford himself no leisure i will tell thee my friend what poor richard says employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never so that as poor richard says a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things  keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again if you would have your business done go if not send  if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself  a little neglect may breed great mischief adding for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost and for want of a horse the rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the enemy all for the want of care about a horseshoe nail  so much for industry my friends and attention to ones own business but to these we must add frugality  what maintains one vice would bring up two children you may think perhaps that a little tea or a little punch now and then diet a little more costly clothes a little finer and a little entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember what poor richard says many a little makes a mickle  beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship and again who dainties love shall beggars prove and moreover fools make feasts and wise men eat them  buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries  if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing  the second vice is lying the first is running in debt  lying rides upon debts back  poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright  and now to conclude experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other and scarce in that for it is true we may give advice but we cannot give conduct as poor richard says however remember this they that wont be counseled cant be helped as poor richard says and farther that if you will not hear reason shell surely rap your knuckles     the whistle   to madame brillon  passy november 10 1779  i am charmed with your description of paradise and with your plan of living there and i approve much of your conclusion that in the meantime we should draw all the good we can from this world in my opinion we might all draw more good from it than we do and suffer less evil if we would take care not to give too much for whistles for to me it seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are become so by neglect of that caution  you ask what i mean you love stories and will excuse my telling one of myself  when i was a child of seven year old my friends on a holiday filled my pocket with coppers i went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that i met by the way in the hands of another boy i voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one i then came home and went whistling all over the house much pleased with my whistle but disturbing all the family my brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the bargain i had made told me i had given four times as much for it as it was worth put me in mind what good things i might have bought with the rest of the money and laughed at me so much for my folly that i cried with vexation and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure  this however was afterwards of use to me the impression continuing on my mind so that often when i was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing i said to myself dont give too much for the whistle and i saved my money  as i grew up came into the world and observed the actions of men i thought i met with many very many who gave too much for the whistle  when i saw one too ambitious of court favor sacrificing his time in attendance on levees his repose his liberty his virtue and perhaps his friends to attain it i have said to myself this man gives too much for his whistle  when i saw another fond of popularity constantly employing himself in political bustles neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by neglect he pays indeed said i too much for his whistle  if i knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living all the pleasure of doing good to others all the esteem of his fellow citizens and the joys of benevolent friendship for the sake of accumulating wealth poor man said i you pay too much for your whistle  when i met with a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal sensations and ruining his health in their pursuit mistaken man said i you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure you give too much for your whistle  if i see one fond of appearance or fine clothes fine houses fine furniture fine equipages all above his fortune for which he contracts debts and ends his career in a prison alas say i he has paid dear very dear for his whistle  when i see a beautiful sweettempered girl married to an illnatured brute of a husband what a pity say i that she should pay so much for a whistle  in short i conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things and by their giving too much for their whistles  yet i ought to have charity for these unhappy people when i consider that with all this wisdom of which i am boasting there are certain things in the world so tempting for example the apples of king john which happily are not to be bought for if they were put to sale by auction i might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase and find that i had once more given too much for the whistle  adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection  b franklin     a letter to samuel mather  passy may 12 1784  revd sir  it is now more than 60 years since i left boston but i remember well both your father and grandfather having heard them both in the pulpit and seen them in their houses the last time i saw your father was in the beginning of 1724 when i visited him after my first trip to pennsylvania he received me in his library and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage which was crossed by a beam overhead we were still talking as i withdrew he accompanying me behind and i turning partly towards him when he said hastily stoop stoop i did not understand him till i felt my head hit against the beam he was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction and upon this he said to me you are young and have the world before you stoop as you go through it and you will miss many hard thumps this advice thus beat into my head has frequently been of use to me and i often think of it when i see pride mortified and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high

newspaper pages   page 1 of the pennsylvania gazette   numb xl  the  pennsylvania gazette containing the freshest advices foreign and domestick  from thursday september 25 to thursday october 2 1729  the pennsylvania gazette being now to be carryd on by other hands the reader may expect some account of the method we design to proceed in  upon a view of chamberss great dictionaries from whence were taken the materials of the universal instructor in all arts and sciences which usually made the first part of this paper we find that besides their containing many things abstruse or insignificant to us it will probably be fifty years before the whole can be gone thro in this manner of publication there are likewise in those books continual references from things under one letter of the alphabet to those under another which relate to the same subject and are necessary to explain and compleat it those are taken in their turn may perhaps be ten years distant and since it is likely that they who desire to acquaint themselves with any particular art or science would gladly have the whole before them in a much less time we believe our readers will not think such a method of communicating knowledge to be a proper one  however tho we do not intend to continue the publication of those dictionaries in a regular alphabetical method as has hitherto been done yet as several things exhibited from them in the course of these papers have been entertaining to such of the curious who never had and cannot have the advantage of good libraries and as there are many things still behind which being in this manner made generally known may perhaps become of considerable use by giving such hints to the excellent natural geniuss of our country as may contribute either to the improvement of our present manufactures or towards the invention of new ones we propose from time to time to communicate such particular parts as appear to be of the most general consequence  as to the religious courtship part of which has been retald to the publick in these papers the reader may be informd that the whole book will probably in a little time be printed and bound up by itself and those who approve of it will doubtless be better pleasd to have it entire than in this broken interrupted manner  there are many who have long desired to see a good newspaper in pennsylvania and we hope those gentlemen who are able will contribute towards the making this such we ask assistance because we are fully sensible that to publish a good newpaper is not so easy an undertaking as many people imagine it to be the author of a gazette in the opinion of the learned ought to be qualified with an extensive acquaintance with languages a great easiness and command of writing and relating things cleanly and intelligibly and in few words he should be able to speak of war both by land and sea be well acquainted with geography with the history of the time with the several interests of princes and states the secrets of courts and the manners and customs of all nations men thus accomplishd are very rare in this remote part of the world and it would be well if the writer of these papers could make up among his friends what is wanting in himself  upon the whole we may assure the publick that as far as the encouragement we meet with will enable us no care and pains shall be omitted that may make the pennsylvania gazette as agreeable and useful an entertainment as the nature of the thing will allow  the following is the last message sent by his excellency governor burnet to the house of representatives in boston  gentlemen of the house of representatives  it is not with so vain a hope as to convince you that i take the trouble to answer your messages but if possible to open the eyes of the deluded people whom you represent and whom you are at so much pains to keep in ignorance of the true state of their affairs i need not go further for an undeniable proof of this endeavour to blind them than your ordering the letter of messieurs wilks and belcher of the 7th of june last to your speaker to be published this letter is said in page 1 of your votes to inclose a copy of the report of the lords of the committee of his majestys privy council with his majestys approbation and orders thereon in council yet these gentlemen had at the same time the unparallelld presumption to write to the speaker in this manner youll observe by the conclusion what is proposed to be the consequence of your not complying with his majestys instruction the whole matter to be laid     page 4 of

with a reservation to the canton of glaris which is mostly protestant of the share it had before in the sovereignty of that district the three deputies of zurich lucern c ury who were commissioned by the late general dyet to go to wilchingen to try to compose the differences which have been long standing between the inhabitants of that place and the canton of schafhuysen whose subjects they are

of wilchingen persist hitherto in this disobedience  schaffhausen sept 1 they write from italy that the plague is no longer observd at marseilles aix  several other places and that at toulon it is very much decreasd but alas how should it be otherwise when the distemper hath hardly any objects left to work upon at arles it is likewise abated we fear for the same reason mean while it spreads in the gevaudan and two large villages in the neighbourhood of frejus were attackd the beginning of this month the french court hath prohibited all communication with the gevaudan upon severe penalties the plague is certainly got into the small town of  marvegue in that district which town is shut in by eight hundred men letters from geneva say the two battalions employd in surrounding la canourgue are infected and that maages is very much suspected the marquis de quelus had retired to a castle near avignon but the sickness being got among his domesticks he was fled farther away  paris sept 5 the district over which the duke of berwick is to have the command extends to the borders of the bourbonnois and the court puts a great confidence in the care of that general to hinder the infection from spreading the marquis de verceil is actually drawing lines to shut in the gevaudan and twelve regiments of foot and as many of dragoons are marching to reinforce the troops already posted on that side the plague seems to have almost spent itself in provence tho it is yet a great way off of us men talk nevertheless of laying up magazines of all sort of provisions here and of making twenty thousand beds to be set up in the hospitals and tenniscourts  hague sept 9 the deputies of our admiralties had last saturday an extraordinary conference with those of the states general upon the spreading of a report that ten or twelve persons died daily at a certain place in normandy which was therefore suspected to have received the contagion but upon the matter it doth not appear there was the least foundation for such a report tho it is too plain the distemper gains ground space in the southern parts of france  we can by no means penetrate into the designs of the czar who
