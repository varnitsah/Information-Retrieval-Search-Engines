55955295	on the method of zadig  essay 1 from science and hebrew tradition  by thomas henry huxley     retrospective prophecy as a function of science  une marque plus sure que toutes celles de zadig 1cuvier   it is an usual and a commendable practice to preface the discussion of the views of a philosophic thinker by some account of the man and of the circumstances which shaped his life and coloured his way of looking at things but though zadig is cited in one of the most important chapters of cuviers greatest work little is known about him and that little might perhaps be better authenticated than it is  it is said that he lived at babylon in the time of king moabdar but the name of moabdar does not appear in the list of babylonian sovereigns brought to light by the patience and the industry of the decipherers of cuneiform inscriptions in these later years nor indeed am i aware that there is any other authority for his existence than that of the biographer of zadig one arouet de voltaire among whose more conspicuous merits strict historical accuracy is perhaps hardly to be reckoned  happily zadig is in the position of a great many other philosophers what he was like when he was in the flesh indeed whether he existed at all are matters of no great consequence what we care about in a light is that it shows the way not whether it is lamp or candle tallow or wax our only real interest in zadig lies in the conceptions of which he is the putative father and his biographer has stated these with so much clearness and vivacious illustration that we need hardly feel a pang even if critical research should prove king moabdar and all the rest of the story to be unhistorical and reduce zadig himself to the shadowy condition of a solar myth  voltaire tells us that disenchanted with life by sundry domestic misadventures zadig withdrew from the turmoil of babylon to a secluded retreat on the banks of the euphrates where he beguiled his solitude by the study of nature the manifold wonders of the world of life had a particular attraction for the lonely student incessant and patient observation of the plants and animals about him sharpened his naturally good powers of observation and of reasoning until at length he acquired a sagacity which enabled him to perceive endless minute differences among objects which to the untutored eye appeared absolutely alike  it might have been expected that this enlargement of the powers of the mind and of its store of natural knowledge could tend to nothing but the increase of a mans own welfare and the good of his fellowmen but zadig was fated to experience the vanity of such expectations     one day walking near a little wood he saw hastening that   way one of the queens chief eunuchs followed by a troop of   officials who appeared to be in the greatest anxiety running   hither and thither like men distraught in search of some   lost treasure    young man cried the eunuch have you seen the queens dog   zadig answered modestly a bitch i think not a dog   quite right replied the eunuch and zadig continued a very   small spaniel who has lately had puppies she limps with the   left foreleg and has very long ears ah you have seen her   then said the breathless eunuch no answered zadig i have   not seen her and i really was not aware that the queen   possessed a spaniel    by an odd coincidence at the very same time the handsomest   horse in the kings stables broke away from his groom in the   babylonian plain the grand huntsman and all his staff were   seeking the horse with as much anxiety as the eunuch and his   people the spaniel and the grand huntsman asked zadig if he had   not seen the kings horse go that way    a firstrate galloper smallhoofed five feet high   tail three feet and a half long cheek pieces of the bit of   twentythree carat gold shoes silver said zadig    which way did he go where is he cried the grand huntsman    i have not seen anything of the horse and i never heard of   him before replied zadig    the grand huntsman and the chief eunuch made sure that zadig   had stolen both the kings horse and the queens spaniel so   they haled him before the high court of desterham which at once   condemned him to the knout and transportation for life to   siberia but the sentence was hardly pronounced when the lost   horse and spaniel were found so the judges were under the   painful necessity of reconsidering their decision but they   fined zadig four hundred ounces of gold for saying he had seen   that which he had not seen    the first thing was to pay the fine afterwards zadig was   permitted to open his defence to the court which he did in the   following terms    stars of justice abysses of knowledge mirrors of truth   whose gravity is as that of lead whose inflexibility is as that   of iron who rival the diamond in clearness and possess no   little affinity with gold since i am permitted to address your   august assembly i swear by ormuzd that i have never seen the   respectable lady dog of the queen nor beheld the sacrosanct   horse of the king of kings    this is what happened i was taking a walk towards the little   wood near which i subsequently had the honour to meet the   venerable chief eunuch and the most illustrious grand huntsman   i noticed the track of an animal in the sand and it was easy to   see that it was that of a small dog long faint streaks upon the   little elevations of sand between the footmarks convinced me   that it was a she dog with pendent dugs showing that she must   have had puppies not many days since other scrapings of the   sand which always lay close to the marks of the forepaws   indicated that she had very long ears and as the imprint of   one foot was always fainter than those of the other three i   judged that the lady dog of our august queen was if i may   venture to say so a little lame    with respect to the horse of the king of kings permit me to   observe that wandering through the paths which traverse the   wood i noticed the marks of horseshoes they were all   equidistant ah said i this is a famous galloper in a   narrow alley only seven feet wide the dust upon the trunks of   the trees was a little disturbed at three feet and a half from   the middle of the path this horse said i to myself had a   tail three feet and a half long and lashing it from one side   to the other he has swept away the dust branches of the trees   met overhead at the height of five feet and under them i saw   newly fallen leaves so i knew that the horse had brushed some   of the branches and was therefore five feet high as to his   bit it must have been made of twentythree carat gold for he   had rubbed it against a stone which turned out to be a   touchstone with the properties of which i am familiar by   experiment lastly by the marks which his shoes left upon   pebbles of another kind i was led to think that his shoes were   of fine silver    all the judges admired zadigs profound and subtle discernment   and the fame of it reached even the king and the queen from the   anterooms to the presencechamber zadigs name was in   everybodys mouth and although many of the magi were of   opinion that he ought to be burnt as a sorcerer the king   commanded that the four hundred ounces of gold which he had been   fined should be restored to him so the officers of the court   went in state with the four hundred ounces only they retained   three hundred and ninetyeight for legal expenses and their   servants expected fees    those who are interested in learning more of the fateful history   of zadig must turn to the original we are dealing with him only   as a philosopher and this brief excerpt suffices for the   exemplification of the nature of his conclusions and of the   methods by which he arrived at them   these conclusions may be said to be of the nature of retrospective prophecies though it is perhaps a little hazardous to employ phraseology which perilously suggests a contradiction in termsthe word prophecy being so constantly in ordinary use restricted to foretelling strictly however the term prophecy applies as much to outspeaking as to foretelling and even in the restricted sense of divination it is obvious that the essence of the prophetic operation does not lie in its backward or forward relation to the course of time but in the fact that it is the apprehension of that which lies out of the sphere of immediate knowledge the seeing of that which to the natural sense of the seer is invisible  the foreteller asserts that at some future time a properly situated observer will witness certain events the clairvoyant declares that at this present time certain things are to be witnessed a thousand miles away the retrospective prophet would that there were such a word as backteller affirms that so many hours or years ago such and such things were to be seen in all these cases it is only the relation to time which altersthe process of divination beyond the limits of possible direct knowledge remains the same  no doubt it was their instinctive recognition of the analogy between zadigs results and those obtained by authorised inspiration which inspired the babylonian magi with the desire to burn the philosopher zadig admitted that he had never either seen or heard of the horse of the king or of the spaniel of the queen and yet he ventured to assert in the most positive manner that animals answering to their description did actually exist and ran about the plains of babylon if his method was good for the divination of the course of events ten hours old why should it not be good for those of ten years or ten centuries past nay might it not extend ten thousand years and justify the impious in meddling with the traditions of oannes and the fish and all the sacred foundations of babylonian cosmogony  but this was not the worst there was another consideration which obviously dictated to the more thoughtful of the magi the propriety of burning zadig out of hand his defence was worse than his offence it showed that his mode of divination was fraught with danger to magianism in general swollen with the pride of human reason he had ignored the established canons of magian lore and trusting to what after all was mere carnal common sense he professed to lead men to a deeper insight into nature than magian wisdom with all its lofty antagonism to everything common had ever reached what in fact lay at the foundation of all zadigs argument but the coarse commonplace assumption upon which every act of our daily lives is based that we may conclude from an effect to the preexistence of a cause competent to produce that effect  the tracks were exactly like those which dogs and horses leave therefore they were the effects of such animals as causes the marks at the sides of the foreprints of the dog track were exactly such as would be produced by long trailing ears therefore the dogs long ears were the causes of these marksand so on nothing can be more hopelessly vulgar more unlike the majestic development of a system of grandly unintelligible conclusions from sublimely inconceivable premisses such as delights the magian heart in fact zadigs method was nothing but the method of all mankind retrospective prophecies far more astonishing for their minute accuracy than those of zadig are familiar to those who have watched the daily life of nomadic people  from freshly broken twigs crushed leaves disturbed pebbles and imprints hardly discernible by the untrained eye such graduates in the university of nature will divine not only the fact that a party has passed that way but its strength its composition the course it took and the number of hours or days which have elapsed since it passed but they are able to do this because like zadig they perceive endless minute differences where untrained eyes discern nothing and because the unconscious logic of common sense compels them to account for these effects by the causes which they know to be competent to produce them  and such mere methodised savagery was to discover the hidden things of nature better than a priori deductions from the nature of ormuzdperhaps to give a history of the past in which oannes would be altogether ignored decidedly it were better to burn this man at once  if instinct or an unwonted use of reason led moabdars magi to this conclusion two or three thousand years ago all that can be said is that subsequent history has fully justified them for the rigorous application of zadigs logic to the results of accurate and longcontinued observation has founded all those sciences which have been termed historical or palaetiological because they are retrospectively prophetic and strive towards the reconstruction in human imagination of events which have vanished and ceased to be  history in the ordinary acceptation of the word is based upon the interpretation of documentary evidence and documents would have no evidential value unless historians were justified in their assumption that they have come into existence by the operation of causes similar to those of which documents are in our present experience the effects if a written history can be produced otherwise than by human agency or if the man who wrote a given document was actuated by other than ordinary human motives such documents are of no more evidential value than so many arabesques  archaeology which takes up the thread of history beyond the point at which documentary evidence fails us could have no existence except for our well grounded confidence that monuments and works of art or artifice have never been produced by causes different in kind from those to which they now owe their origin and geology which traces back the course of history beyond the limits of archaeology could tell us nothing except for the assumption that millions of years ago water heat gravitation friction animal and vegetable life caused effects of the same kind as they now cause nay even physical astronomy in so far as it takes us back to the uttermost point of time which palaetiological science can reach is founded upon the same assumption if the law of gravitation ever failed to be true even to a small extent for that period the calculations of the astronomer have no application  the power of prediction of prospective prophecy is that which is commonly regarded as the great prerogative of physical science and truly it is a wonderful fact that one can go into a shop and buy for a small price a book the nautical almanac which will foretell the exact position to be occupied by one of jupiters moons six months hence nay more that if it were worth while the astronomerroyal could furnish us with as infallible a prediction applicable to 1980 or 2980  but astronomy is not less remarkable for its power of retrospective prophecy  thales oldest of greek philosophers the dates of whose birth and death are uncertain but who flourished about 600 bc is said to have foretold an eclipse of the sun which took place in his time during a battle between the medes and the lydians sir george airy has written a very learned and interesting memoir 2 in which he proves that such an eclipse was visible in lydia on the afternoon of the 28th of may in the year 585 bc  no one doubts that on the day and at the hour mentioned by the astronomerroyal the people of lydia saw the face of the sun totally obscured but though we implicitly believe this retrospective prophecy it is incapable of verification in the total absence of historical records it is impossible even to conceive any means of ascertaining directly whether the eclipse of thales happened or not all that can be said is that the prospective prophecies of the astronomer are always verified and that inasmuch as his retrospective prophecies are the result of following backwards the very same method as that which invariably leads to verified results when it is worked forwards there is as much reason for placing full confidence in the one as in the other retrospective prophecy is therefore a legitimate function of astronomical science and if it is legitimate for one science it is legitimate for all the fundamental axiom on which it rests the constancy of the order of nature being the common foundation of all scientific thought indeed if there can be grades in legitimacy certain branches of science have the advantage over astronomy in so far as their retrospective prophecies are not only susceptible of verification but are sometimes strikingly verified  such a science exists in that application of the principles of biology to the interpretation of the animal and vegetable remains imbedded in the rocks which compose the surface of the globe which is called palaeontology  at no very distant time the question whether these socalled fossils were really the remains of animals and plants was hotly disputed very learned persons maintained that they were nothing of the kind but a sort of concretion or crystallisation which had taken place within the stone in which they are found and which simulated the forms of animal and vegetable life just as frost on a windowpane imitates vegetation at the present day it would probably be impossible to find any sane advocate of this opinion and the fact is rather surprising that among the people from whom the circlesquarers perpetualmotioners flatearthed men and the like are recruited to say nothing of tableturners and spiritrappers somebody has not perceived the easy avenue to nonsensical notoriety open to any one who will take up the good old doctrine that fossils are all lusus naturae  the position would be impregnable inasmuch as it is quite impossible to prove the contrary if a man choose to maintain that a fossil oyster shell in spite of its correspondence down to every minutest particular with that of an oyster fresh taken out of the sea was never tenanted by a living oyster but is a mineral concretion there is no demonstrating his error all that can be done is to show him that by a parity of reasoning he is bound to admit that a heap of oyster shells outside a fishmongers door may also be sports of nature and that a mutton bone in a dustbin may have had the like origin and when you cannot prove that people are wrong but only that they are absurd the best course is to let them alone  the whole fabric of palaeontology in fact falls to the ground unless we admit the validity of zadigs great principle that like effects imply like causes and that the process of reasoning from a shell or a tooth or a bone to the nature of the animal to which it belonged rests absolutely on the assumption that the likeness of this shell or tooth or bone to that of some animal with which we are already acquainted is such that we are justified in inferring a corresponding degree of likeness in the rest of the two organisms it is on this very simple principle and not upon imaginary laws of physiological correlation about which in most cases we know nothing whatever that the socalled restorations of the palaeontologist are based  abundant illustrations of this truth will occur to every one who is familiar with palaeontology none is more suitable than the case of the socalled belemnites in the early days of the study of fossils this name was given to certain elongated stony bodies ending at one extremity in a conical point and truncated at the other which were commonly reputed to be thunderbolts and as such to have descended from the sky they are common enough in some parts of england and in the condition in which they are ordinarily found it might be difficult to give satisfactory reasons for denying them to be merely mineral bodies  they appear in fact to consist of nothing but concentric layers of carbonate of lime disposed in subcrystalline fibres or prisms perpendicular to the layers among a great number of specimens of these belemnites however it was soon observed that some showed a conical cavity at the blunt end and in still better preserved specimens this cavity appeared to be divided into chambers by delicate saucershaped partitions situated at regular intervals one above the other now there is no mineral body which presents any structure comparable to this and the conclusion suggested itself that the belemnites must be the effects of causes other than those which are at work in inorganic nature on close examination the saucershaped partitions were proved to be all perforated at one point and the perforations being situated exactly in the same line the chambers were seen to be traversed by a canal or siphuncle which thus connected the smallest or aphical chamber with the largest there is nothing like this in the vegetable world but an exactly corresponding structure is met with in the shells of two kinds of existing animals the pearly nautilus and the spirula and only in them these animals belong to the same divisionthe cephalopodaas the cuttlefish the squid and the octopus but they are the only existing members of the group which possess chambered siphunculated shells and it is utterly impossible to trace any physiological connection between the very peculiar structural characters of a cephalopod and the presence of a chambered shell in fact the squid has instead of any such shell a horny pen the cuttlefish has the socalled cuttlebone and the octopus has no shell or at most a mere rudiment of one  nevertheless seeing that there is nothing in nature at all like the chambered shell of the belemnite except the shells of the nautilus and of the spirula it was legitimate to prophesy that the animal from which the fossil proceeded must have belonged to the group of the cephalopoda nautilus and spirula are both very rare animals but the progress of investigation brought to light the singular fact that though each has the characteristic cephalopodous organisation it is very different from the other the shell of nautilus is external that of spirula internal nautilus has four gills spirula two nautilus has multitudinous tentacles spirula has only ten arms beset with hornyrimmed suckers spirula like the squids and cuttlefishes which it closely resembles has a bag of ink which it squirts out to cover its retreat when alarmed nautilus has none  no amount of physiological reasoning could enable any one to say whether the animal which fabricated the belemnite was more like nautilus or more like spirula but the accidental discovery of belemnites in due connection with black elongated masses which were certainly fossilised inkbags inasmuch as the ink could be ground up and used for painting as well as if it were recent sepia settled the question and it became perfectly safe to prophesy that the creature which fabricated the belemnite was a twogilled cephalopod with suckers on its arms and with all the other essential features of our living squids cuttlefishes and spirulae the palaeontologist was by this time able to speak as confidently about the animal of the belemnite as zadig was respecting the queens spaniel he could give a very fair description of its external appearance and even enter pretty fully into the details of its internal organisation and yet could declare that neither he nor any one else had ever seen one and as the queens spaniel was found so happily has the animal of the belemnite a few exceptionally preserved specimens have been discovered which completely verify the retrospective prophecy of those who interpreted the facts of the case by due application of the method of zadig  these belemnites flourished in prodigious abundance in the seas of the mesozoic or secondary age of the worlds geological history but no trace of them has been found in any of the tertiary deposits and they appear to have died out towards the close of the mesozoic epoch the method of zadig therefore applies in full force to the events of a period which is immeasurably remote which long preceded the origin of the most conspicuous mountain masses of the present world and the deposition at the bottom of the ocean of the rocks which form the greater part of the soil of our present continents the euphrates itself at the mouth of which oannes landed is a thing of yesterday compared with a belemnite and even the liberal chronology of magian cosmogony fixes the beginning of the world only at a time when other applications of zadigs method afford convincing evidence that could we have been there to see things would have looked very much as they do now truly the magi were wise in their generation they foresaw rightly that this pestilent application of the principles of common sense inaugurated by zadig would be their ruin  but it may be said that the method of zadig which is simple reasoning from analogy does not account for the most striking feats of modern palaeontologythe reconstruction of entire animals from a tooth or perhaps a fragment of a bone and it may be justly urged that cuvier the great master of this kind of investigation gave a very different account of the process which yielded such remarkable results  cuvier is not the first man of ability who has failed to make his own mental processes clear to himself and he will not be the last the matter can be easily tested search the eight volumes of the recherches sur les ossemens fossiles from cover to cover and nothing but the application of the method of zadig will be found in the arguments by which a fragment of a skeleton is made to reveal the characters of the animal to which it belonged  there is one wellknown case which may represent all it is an excellent illustration of cuviers sagacity and he evidently takes some pride in telling his story about it a split slab of stone arrived from the quarries of montmartre the two halves of which contained the greater part of the skeleton of a small animal on careful examinations of the characters of the teeth and of the lower jaw which happened to be exposed cuvier assured himself that they presented such a very close resemblance to the corresponding parts in the living opossums that he at once assigned the fossil to that genus  now the opossums are unlike most mammals in that they possess two bones attached to the fore part of the pelvis which are commonly called marsupial bones the name is a misnomer originally conferred because it was thought that these bones have something to do with the support of the pouch or marsupium with which some but not all of the opossums are provided as a matter of fact they have nothing to do with the support of the pouch and they exist as much in those opossums which have no pouches as in those which possess them in truth no one knows what the use of these bones may be nor has any valid theory of their physiological import yet been suggested and if we have no knowledge of the physiological importance of the bones themselves it is obviously absurd to pretend that we are able to give physiological reasons why the presence of these bones is associated with certain peculiarities of the teeth and of the jaws if any one knows why four molar teeth and an inflected angle of the jaw are very generally found along with marsupial bones he has not yet communicated that knowledge to the world  if however zadig was right in concluding from the likeness of the hoofprints which he observed to be a horses that the creature which made them had a tail like that of a horse cuvier seeing that the teeth and jaw of his fossil were just like those of an opossum had the same right to conclude that the pelvis would also be like an opossums and so strong was his conviction that this retrospective prophecy about an animal which he had never seen before and which had been dead and buried for millions of years would be verified that he went to work upon the slab which contained the pelvis in confident expectation of finding and laying bare the marsupial bones to the satisfaction of some persons whom he had invited to witness their disinterment as he sayscette operation se fit en presence de quelques personnes a qui jen avais annonce davance le resultat dans lintention de leur prouver par le fait la justice de nos theories zoologiques puisque le vrai cachet dune theorie est sans contredit la faculte quelle donne de prevoir les phenomenes  in the ossemens fossiles cuvier leaves his paper just as it first appeared in the annales du museum as a curious monument of the force of zoological laws and of the use which may be made of them  zoological laws truly but not physiological laws if one sees a live dogs head it is extremely probable that a dogs tail is not far off though nobody can say why that sort of head and that sort of tail go together what physiological connection there is between the two so in the case of the montmartre fossil cuvier finding a thorough opossums head concluded that the pelvis also would be like an opossums but most assuredly the most advanced physiologist of the present day could throw no light on the question why these are associated nor could pretend to affirm that the existence of the one is necessarily connected with that of the other in fact had it so happened that the pelvis of the fossil had been originally exposed while the head lay hidden the presence of the marsupial bones though very like an opossums would by no means have warranted the prediction that the skull would turn out to be that of the opossum it might just as well have been like that of some other marsupial or even like that of the totally different group of monotremes of which the only living representatives are the echidna and the ornithorhynchus  for all practical purposes however the empirical laws of coordination of structures which are embodied in the generalisations of morphology may be confidently trusted if employed with due caution to lead to a just interpretation of fossil remains or in other words we may look for the verification of the retrospective prophecies which are based upon them  and if this be the case the late advances which have been made in palaeontological discovery open out a new field for such prophecies for it has been ascertained with respect to many groups of animals that as we trace them back in time their ancestors gradually cease to exhibit those special modifications which at present characterise the type and more nearly embody the general plan of the group to which they belong  thus in the wellknown case of the horse the toes which are suppressed in the living horse are found to be more and more complete in the older members of the group until at the bottom of the tertiary series of america we find an equine animal which has four toes in front and three behind no remains of the horse tribe are at present known from any mesozoic deposit yet who can doubt that whenever a sufficiently extensive series of lacustrine and fluviatile beds of that age becomes known the lineage which has been traced thus far will be continued by equine quadrupeds with an increasing number of digits until the horse type merges in the fivetoed form towards which these gradations point  but the argument which holds good for the horse holds good not only for all mammals but for the whole animal world and as the study of the pedigrees or lines of evolution to which at present we have access brings to light as it assuredly will do the laws of that process we shall be able to reason from the facts with which the geological record furnishes us to those which have hitherto remained and many of which perhaps may for ever remain hidden the same method of reasoning which enables us when furnished with a fragment of an extinct animal to prophesy the character which the whole organism exhibited will sooner or later enable us when we know a few of the later terms of a genealogical series to predict the nature of the earlier terms  in no very distant future the method of zadig applied to a greater body of facts than the present generation is fortunate enough to handle will enable the biologist to reconstruct the scheme of life from its beginning and to speak as confidently of the character of long extinct beings no trace of which has been preserved as zadig did of the queens spaniel and the kings horse let us hope that they may be better rewarded for their toil and their sagacity than was the babylonian philosopher for perhaps by that time the magi also may be reckoned among the members of a forgotten fauna extinguished in the struggle for existence against their great rival common sense     footnotes  footnote 1 discours sur les revolutions de la surface du globe recherches sur les ossemens fossiles ed iv ti p185  footnote
