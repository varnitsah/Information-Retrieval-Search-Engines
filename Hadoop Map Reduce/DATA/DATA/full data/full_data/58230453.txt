bottomless well   v the fad of the fisherman   vi the hole in the wall   vii the temple of  silence   viii the vengeance of the statue     the man who knew too much  i the face in the target  harold march the rising reviewer and social critic was walking vigorously across a great tableland of moors and commons the horizon of which was fringed with the faroff woods of the famous estate of torwood park he was a goodlooking young man in tweeds with very pale curly hair and pale clear eyes walking in wind and sun in the very landscape of liberty he was still young enough to remember his politics and not merely try to forget them for his errand at torwood park was a political one it was the place of appointment named by no less a person than the chancellor of the exchequer sir howard horne then introducing his socalled socialist budget and prepared to expound it in an interview with so promising a penman harold march was the sort of man who knows everything about politics and nothing about politicians he also knew a great deal about art letters philosophy and general culture about almost everything indeed except the world he was living in  abruptly in the middle of those sunny and windy flats he came upon a sort of cleft almost narrow enough to be called a crack in the land it was just large enough to be the watercourse for a small stream which vanished at intervals under green tunnels of undergrowth as if in a dwarfish forest indeed he had an odd feeling as if he were a giant looking over the valley of the pygmies when he dropped into the hollow however the impression was lost the rocky banks though hardly above the height of a cottage hung over and had the profile of a precipice as he began to wander down the course of the stream in idle but romantic curiosity and saw the water shining in short strips between the great gray boulders and bushes as soft as great green mosses he fell into quite an opposite vein of fantasy it was rather as if the earth had opened and swallowed him into a sort of underworld of dreams and when he became conscious of a human figure dark against the silver stream sitting on a large boulder and looking rather like a large bird it was perhaps with some of the premonitions proper to a man who meets the strangest friendship of his life  the man was apparently fishing or at least was fixed in a fishermans attitude with more than a fishermans immobility march was able to examine the man almost as if he had been a statue for some minutes before the statue spoke he was a tall fair man cadaverous and a little lackadaisical with heavy eyelids and a highbridged nose when his face was shaded with his wide white hat his light mustache and lithe figure gave him a look of youth but the panama lay on the moss beside him and the spectator could see that his brow was prematurely bald and this combined with a certain hollowness about the eyes had an air of headwork and even headache but the most curious thing about him realized after a short scrutiny was that though he looked like a fisherman he was not fishing  he was holding instead of a rod something that might have been a landingnet which some fishermen use but which was much more like the ordinary toy net which children carry and which they generally use indifferently for shrimps or butterflies he was dipping this into the water at intervals gravely regarding its harvest of weed or mud and emptying it out again  no i havent caught anything he remarked calmly as if answering an unspoken query when i do i have to throw it back again especially the big fish but some of the little beasts interest me when i get em  a scientific interest i suppose observed march  of a rather amateurish sort i fear answered the strange fisherman i have a sort of hobby about what they call phenomena of phosphorescence but it would be rather awkward to go about in society carrying stinking fish  i suppose it would said march with a smile  rather odd to enter a drawingroom carrying a large luminous cod continued the stranger in his listless way how quaint it would be if one could carry it about like a lantern or have little sprats for candles some of the seabeasts would really be very pretty like lampshades the blue seasnail that glitters all over like starlight and some of the red starfish really shine like red stars but naturally im not looking for them here  march thought of asking him what he was looking for but feeling unequal to a technical discussion at least as deep as the deepsea fishes he returned to more ordinary topics  delightful sort of hole this is he said  this little dell and river here its like those places stevenson talks about where something ought to happen  i know answered the other  i think its because the place itself so to speak seems to happen and not merely to exist perhaps thats what old picasso and some of the cubists are trying to express by angles and jagged lines look at that wall like low cliffs that juts forward just at right angles to the slope of turf sweeping up to it thats like a silent collision its like a breaker and the backwash of a wave  march looked at the lowbrowed crag overhanging the green slope and nodded he was interested in a man who turned so easily from the technicalities of science to those of art and asked him if he admired the new angular artists  as i feel it the cubists are not cubist enough replied the stranger i mean theyre not thick enough by making things mathematical they make them thin take the living lines out of that landscape simplify it to a right angle and you flatten it out to a mere diagram on paper diagrams have their own beauty but it is of just the other sort they stand for the unalterable things the calm eternal mathematical sort of truths what somebody calls the white radiance of  he stopped and before the next word came something had happened almost too quickly and completely to be realized from behind the overhanging rock came a noise and rush like that of a railway train and a great motor car appeared it topped the crest of cliff black against the sun like a battlechariot rushing to destruction in some wild epic march automatically put out his hand in one futile gesture as if to catch a falling teacup in a drawingroom  for the fraction of a flash it seemed to leave the ledge of rock like a flying ship then the very sky seemed to turn over like a wheel and it lay a ruin amid the tall grasses below a line of gray smoke going up slowly from it into the silent air a little lower the figure of a man with gray hair lay tumbled down the steep green slope his limbs lying all at random and his face turned away  the eccentric fisherman dropped his net and walked swiftly toward the spot his new acquaintance following him as they drew near there seemed a sort of monstrous irony in the fact that the dead machine was still throbbing and thundering as busily as a factory while the man lay so still  he was unquestionably dead the blood flowed in the grass from a hopelessly fatal fracture at the back of the skull but the face which was turned to the sun was uninjured and strangely arresting in itself it was one of those cases of a strange face so unmistakable as to feel familiar we feel somehow that we ought to recognize it even though we do not it was of the broad square sort with great jaws almost like that of a highly intellectual ape the wide mouth shut so tight as to be traced by a mere line the nose short with the sort of nostrils that seem to gape with an appetite for the air the oddest thing about the face was that one of the eyebrows was cocked up at a much sharper angle than the other march thought he had never seen a face so naturally alive as that dead one and its ugly energy seemed all the stranger for its halo of hoary hair some papers lay half fallen out of the pocket and from among them march extracted a cardcase he read the name on the card aloud  sir humphrey turnbull im sure ive heard that name somewhere  his companion only gave a sort of a little sigh and was silent for a moment as if ruminating then he merely said the poor fellow is quite gone and added some scientific terms in which his auditor once more found himself out of his depth  as things are continued the same curiously wellinformed person it will be more legal for us to leave the body as it is until the police are informed in fact i think it will be well if nobody except the police is informed dont be surprised if i seem to be keeping it dark from some of our neighbors round here then as if prompted to regularize his rather abrupt confidence he said ive come down to see my cousin at torwood my name is horne fisher might be a pun on my pottering about here mightnt it  is sir howard horne your cousin asked march  im going to torwood park to see him myself only about his public work of course and the wonderful stand he is making for his principles i think this budget is the greatest thing in english history if it fails it will be the most heroic failure in english history are you an admirer of your great kinsman mr fisher  rather said mr fisher  hes the best shot i know  then as if sincerely repentant of his nonchalance he added with a sort of enthusiasm  no but really hes a beautiful shot  as if fired by his own words he took a sort of leap at the ledges of the rock above him and scaled them with a sudden agility in startling contrast to his general lassitude he had stood for some seconds on the headland above with his aquiline profile under the panama hat relieved against the sky and peering over the countryside before his companion had collected himself sufficiently to scramble up after him  the level above was a stretch of common turf on which the tracks of the fated car were plowed plainly enough but the brink of it was broken as with rocky teeth broken boulders of all shapes and sizes lay near the edge it was almost incredible that any one could have deliberately driven into such a death trap especially in broad daylight  i cant make head or tail of it said march  was he blind or blind drunk  neither by the look of him replied the other  then it was suicide  it doesnt seem a cozy way of doing it remarked the man called fisher besides i dont fancy poor old puggy would commit suicide somehow  poor old who inquired the wondering journalist did you know this unfortunate man  nobody knew him exactly replied fisher with some vagueness but one knew him of course hed been a terror in his time in parliament and the courts and so on especially in that row about the aliens who were deported as undesirables when he wanted one of em hanged for murder he was so sick about it that he retired from the bench since then he mostly motored about by himself but he was coming to torwood too for the weekend and i dont see why he should deliberately break his neck almost at the very door i believe hoggsi mean my cousin howardwas coming down specially to meet him  torwood park doesnt belong to your cousin inquired march  no it used to belong to the winthrops you know replied the other now a new mans got it a man from montreal named jenkins hoggs comes for the shooting i told you he was a lovely shot  this repeated eulogy on the great social statesman affected harold march as if somebody had defined napoleon as a distinguished player of nap but he had another halfformed impression struggling in this flood of unfamiliar things and he brought it to the surface before it could vanish  jenkins he repeated  surely you dont mean jefferson jenkins the social reformer i mean the man whos fighting for the new cottageestate scheme it would be as interesting to meet him as any cabinet minister in the world if youll excuse my saying so  yes hoggs told him it would have to be cottages said fisher he said the breed of cattle had improved too often and people were beginning to laugh and of course you must hang a peerage on to something though the poor chap hasnt got it yet hullo heres somebody else  they had started walking in the tracks of the car leaving it behind them in the hollow still humming horribly like a huge insect that had killed a man the tracks took them to the corner of the road one arm of which went on in the same line toward the distant gates of the park it was clear that the car had been driven down the long straight road and then instead of turning with the road to the left had gone straight on over the turf to its doom but it was not this discovery that had riveted fishers eye but something even more solid at the angle of the white road a dark and solitary figure was standing almost as still as a finger post it was that of a big man in rough shootingclothes bareheaded and with tousled curly hair that gave him a rather wild look on a nearer approach this first more fantastic impression faded in a full light the figure took on more conventional colors as of an ordinary gentleman who happened to have come out without a hat and without very studiously brushing his hair but the massive stature remained and something deep and even cavernous about the setting of the eyes redeemed his animal good looks from the commonplace but march had no time to study the man more closely for much to his astonishment his guide merely observed hullo jack and walked past him as if he had indeed been a signpost and without attempting to inform him of the catastrophe beyond the rocks it was relatively a small thing but it was only the first in a string of singular antics on which his new and eccentric friend was leading him  the man they had passed looked after them in rather a suspicious fashion but fisher continued serenely on his way along the straight road that ran past the gates of the great estate  thats john burke the traveler he condescended to explain i expect youve heard of him shoots big game and all that sorry i couldnt stop to introduce you but i dare say youll meet him later on  i know his book of course said march with renewed interest that is certainly a fine piece of description about their being only conscious of the closeness of the elephant when the colossal head blocked out the moon  yes young halkett writes jolly well i think what  didnt you know halkett wrote burkes book for him burke cant use anything except a gun and you cant write with that oh hes genuine enough in his way you know as brave as a lion or a good deal braver by all accounts  you seem to know all about him observed march with a rather bewildered laugh and about a good many other people  fishers bald brow became abruptly corrugated and a curious expression came into his eyes  i know too much he said  thats whats the matter with me thats whats the matter with all of us and the whole show we know too much too much about one another too much about ourselves thats why im really interested just now about one thing that i dont know  and that is inquired the other  why that poor fellow is dead  they had walked along the straight road for nearly a mile conversing at intervals in this fashion and march had a singular sense of the whole world being turned inside out mr horne fisher did not especially abuse his friends and relatives in fashionable society of some of them he spoke with affection but they seemed to be an entirely new set of men and women who happened to have the same nerves as the men and women mentioned most often in the newspapers yet no fury of revolt could have seemed to him more utterly revolutionary than this cold familiarity it was like daylight on the other side of stage scenery  they reached the great lodge gates of the park and to marchs surprise passed them and continued along the interminable white straight road but he was himself too early for his appointment with sir howard and was not disinclined to see the end of his new friends experiment whatever it might be they had long left the moorland behind them and half the white road was gray in the great shadow of the torwood pine forests themselves like gray bars shuttered against the sunshine and within amid that clear noon manufacturing their own midnight soon however rifts began to appear in them like gleams of colored windows the trees thinned and fell away as the road went forward showing the wild irregular copses in which as fisher said the houseparty had been blazing away all day and about two hundred yards farther on they came to the first turn of the road  at the corner stood a sort of decayed inn with the dingy sign of the grapes the signboard was dark and indecipherable by now and hung black against the sky and the gray moorland beyond about as inviting as a gallows march remarked that it looked like a tavern for vinegar instead of wine  a good phrase said fisher and so it would be if you were silly enough to drink wine in it but the beer is very good and so is the brandy  march followed him to the bar parlor with some wonder and his dim sense of repugnance was not dismissed by the first sight of the innkeeper who was widely different from the genial innkeepers of romance a bony man very silent behind a black mustache but with black restless eyes taciturn as he was the investigator succeeded at last in extracting a scrap of information from him by dint of ordering beer and talking to him persistently and minutely on the subject of motor cars he evidently regarded the innkeeper as in some singular way an authority on motor cars as being deep in the secrets of the mechanism management and mismanagement of motor cars holding the man all the time with a glittering eye like the ancient mariner out of all this rather mysterious conversation there did emerge at last a sort of admission that one particular motor car of a given description had stopped before the inn about an hour before and that an elderly man had alighted requiring some mechanical assistance asked if the visitor required any other assistance the innkeeper said shortly that the old gentleman had filled his flask and taken a packet of sandwiches and with these words the somewhat inhospitable host had walked hastily out of the bar and they heard him banging doors in the dark interior  fishers weary eye wandered round the dusty and dreary inn parlor and rested dreamily on a glass case containing a stuffed bird with a gun hung on hooks above it which seemed to be its only ornament  puggy was a humorist he observed at least in his own rather grim style but it seems rather too grim a joke for a man to buy a packet of sandwiches when he is just going to commit suicide  if you come to that answered march it isnt very usual for a man to buy a packet of sandwiches when hes just outside the door of a grand house hes going to stop at  no    no repeated fisher almost mechanically and then suddenly cocked his eye at his interlocutor with a much livelier expression  by jove thats an idea youre perfectly right and that suggests a very queer idea doesnt it  there was a silence and then march started with irrational nervousness as the door of the inn was flung open and another man walked rapidly to the counter he had struck it with a coin and called out for brandy before he saw the other two guests who were sitting at a bare wooden table under the window when he turned about with a rather wild stare march had yet another unexpected emotion for his guide hailed the man as hoggs and introduced him as sir howard horne  he looked rather older than his boyish portraits in the illustrated papers as is the way of politicians his flat fair hair was touched with gray but his face was almost comically round with a roman nose which when combined with his quick bright eyes raised a vague reminiscence of a parrot he had a cap rather at the back of his head and a gun under his arm harold march had imagined many things about his meeting with the great political reformer but he had never pictured him with a gun under his arm drinking brandy in a public house  so youre stopping at jinks too said fisher  everybody seems to be at jinks  yes replied the chancellor of the exchequer  jolly good shooting at least all of it that isnt jinks shooting i never knew a chap with such good shooting that was such a bad shot mind you hes a jolly good fellow and all that i dont say a word against him but he never learned to hold a gun when he was packing pork or whatever he did they say he shot the cockade off his own servants hat just like him to have cockades of course he shot the weathercock off his own ridiculous gilded summerhouse its the only cock hell ever kill i should think are you coming up there now  fisher said rather vaguely that he was following soon when he had fixed something up and the chancellor of the exchequer left the inn march fancied he had been a little upset or impatient when he called for the brandy but he had talked himself back into a satisfactory state if the talk had not been quite what his literary visitor had expected fisher a few minutes afterward slowly led the way out of the tavern and stood in the middle of the road looking down in the direction from which they had traveled then he walked back about two hundred yards in that direction and stood still again  i should think this is about the place he said  what place asked his companion  the place where the poor fellow was killed said fisher sadly  what do you mean demanded march  he was smashed up on the rocks a mile and a half from here  no he wasnt replied fisher  he didnt fall on the rocks at all didnt you notice that he only fell on the slope of soft grass underneath but i saw that he had a bullet in him already  then after a pause he added  he was alive at the inn but he was dead long before he came to the rocks so he was shot as he drove his car down this strip of straight road and i should think somewhere about here after that of course the car went straight on with nobody to stop or turn it its really a very cunning dodge in its way for the body would be found far away and most people would say as you do that it was an accident to a motorist the murderer must have been a clever brute  but wouldnt the shot be heard at the inn or somewhere asked march  it would be heard but it would not be noticed that continued the investigator is where he was clever again shooting was going on all over the place all day very likely he timed his shot so as to drown it in a number of others certainly he was a firstclass criminal and he was something else as well  what do you mean asked his companion with a creepy premonition of something coming he knew not why  he was a firstclass shot said fisher he had turned his back abruptly and was walking down a narrow grassy lane little more than a cart track which lay opposite the inn and marked the end of the great estate and the beginning of the open moors march plodded after him with the same idle perseverance and found him staring through a gap in giant weeds and thorns at the flat face of a painted paling from behind the paling rose the great gray columns of a row of poplars which filled the heavens above them with darkgreen shadow and shook faintly in a wind which had sunk slowly into a breeze the afternoon was already deepening into evening and the titanic shadows of the poplars lengthened over a third of the landscape  are you a firstclass criminal asked fisher in a friendly tone im afraid im not but i think i can manage to be a sort of fourthrate burglar  and before his companion could reply he had managed to swing himself up and over the fence march followed without much bodily effort but with considerable mental disturbance the poplars grew so close against the fence that they had some difficulty in slipping past them and beyond the poplars they could see only a high hedge of laurel green and lustrous in the level sun something in this limitation by a series of living walls made him feel as if he were really entering a shattered house instead of an open field it was as if he came in by a disused door or window and found the way blocked by furniture when they had circumvented the laurel hedge they came out on a sort of terrace of turf which fell by one green step to an oblong lawn like a bowling green beyond this was the only building in sight a low conservatory which seemed far away from anywhere like a glass cottage standing in its own fields in fairyland fisher knew that lonely look of the outlying parts of a great house well enough he realized that it is more of a satire on aristocracy than if it were choked with weeds and littered with ruins for it is not neglected and yet it is deserted at any rate it is disused it is regularly swept and garnished for a master who never comes  looking over the lawn however he saw one object which he had not apparently expected it was a sort of tripod supporting a large disk like the round top of a table tipped sideways and it was not until they had dropped on to the lawn and walked across to look at it that march realized that it was a target it was worn and weatherstained the gay colors of its concentric rings were faded possibly it had been set up in those faroff victorian days when there was a fashion of archery march had one of his vague visions of ladies in cloudy crinolines and gentlemen in outlandish hats and whiskers revisiting that lost garden like ghosts  fisher who was peering more closely at the target startled him by an exclamation  hullo he said  somebody has been peppering this thing with shot after all and quite lately too why i believe old jinks been trying to improve his bad shooting here  yes and it looks as if it still wanted improving answered march laughing not one of these shots is anywhere near the bullseye they seem just scattered about in the wildest way  in the wildest way repeated fisher still peering intently at the target he seemed merely to assent but march fancied his eye was shining under its sleepy lid and that he straightened his stooping figure with a strange effort  excuse me a moment he said feeling in his pockets i think ive got some of my chemicals and after that well go up to the house and he stooped again over the target putting something with his finger over each of the shotholes so far as march could see merely a dullgray smear then they went through the gathering twilight up the long green avenues to the great house  here again however the eccentric investigator did not enter by the front door he walked round the house until he found a window open and leaping into it introduced his friend to what appeared to be the gunroom rows of the regular instruments for bringing down birds stood against the walls but across a table in the window lay one or two weapons of a heavier and more formidable pattern  hullo these are burkes biggame rifles said fisher i never knew he kept them here he lifted one of them examined it briefly and put it down again frowning heavily almost as he did so a strange young man came hurriedly into the room he was dark and sturdy with a bumpy forehead and a bulldog jaw and he spoke with a curt apology  i left major burkes guns here he said and he wants them packed up hes going away tonight  and he carried off the two rifles without casting a glance at the stranger through the open window they could see his short dark figure walking away across the glimmering garden fisher got out of the window again and stood looking after him  thats halkett whom i told you about he said  i knew he was a sort of secretary and had to do with burkes papers but i never knew he had anything to do with his guns but hes just the sort of silent sensible little devil who might be very good at anything the sort of man you know for years before you find hes a chess champion  he had begun to walk in the direction of the disappearing secretary and they soon came within sight of the rest of the houseparty talking and laughing on the lawn they could see the tall figure and loose mane of the lionhunter dominating the little group  by the way observed fisher when we were talking about burke and halkett i said that a man couldnt very well write with a gun well im not so sure now did you ever hear of an artist so clever that he could draw with a gun theres a wonderful chap loose about here  sir howard hailed fisher and his friend the journalist with almost boisterous amiability the latter was presented to major burke and mr halkett and also by way of a parenthesis to his host mr jenkins a commonplace little man in loud tweeds whom everybody else seemed to treat with a sort of affection as if he were a baby  the irrepressible chancellor of the exchequer was still talking about the birds he had brought down the birds that burke and halkett had brought down and the birds that jenkins their host had failed to bring down it seemed to be a sort of sociable monomania  you and your big game he ejaculated aggressively to burke why anybody could shoot big game you want to be a shot to shoot small game  quite so interposed horne fisher  now if only a hippopotamus could fly up in the air out of that bush or you preserved flying elephants on the estate why then  why even jink might hit that sort of bird cried sir howard hilariously slapping his host on the back even he might hit a haystack or a hippopotamus  look here you fellows said fisher  i want you to come along with me for a minute and shoot at something else not a hippopotamus another kind of queer animal ive found on the estate its an animal with three legs and one eye and its all the colors of the rainbow  what the deuce are you talking about asked burke  you come along and see replied fisher cheerfully  such people seldom reject anything nonsensical for they are always seeking for something new they gravely rearmed themselves from the gunroom and trooped along at the tail of their guide sir howard only pausing in a sort of ecstasy to point out the celebrated gilt summerhouse on which the gilt weathercock still stood crooked it was dusk turning to dark by the time they reached the remote green by the poplars and accepted the new and aimless game of shooting at the old mark  the last light seemed to fade from the lawn and the poplars against the sunset were like great plumes upon a purple hearse when the futile procession finally curved round and came out in front of the target sir howard again slapped his host on the shoulder shoving him playfully forward to take the first shot the shoulder and arm he touched seemed unnaturally stiff and angular mr jenkins was holding his gun in an attitude more awkward than any that his satiric friends had seen or expected  at the same instant a horrible scream seemed to come from nowhere it was so unnatural and so unsuited to the scene that it might have been made by some inhuman thing flying on wings above them or eavesdropping in the dark woods beyond but fisher knew that it had started and stopped on the pale lips of jefferson jenkins of montreal and no one at that moment catching sight of jefferson jenkinss face would have complained that it was commonplace the next moment a torrent of guttural but goodhumored oaths came from major burke as he and the two other men saw what was in front of them the target stood up in the dim grass like a dark goblin grinning at them and it was literally grinning it had two eyes like stars and in similar livid points of light were picked out the two upturned and open nostrils and the two ends of the wide and tight mouth a few white dots above each eye indicated the hoary eyebrows and one of them ran upward almost erect it was a brilliant caricature done in bright dotted lines and march knew of whom it shone in the shadowy grass smeared with sea fire as if one of the submarine monsters had crawled into the twilight garden but it had the head of a dead man  its only luminous paint said burke  old fishers been having a joke with that phosphorescent stuff of his  seems to be meant for old puggy observed sir howard  hits him off very well  with that they all laughed except jenkins when they had all done he made a noise like the first effort of an animal to laugh and horne fisher suddenly strode across to him and said  mr jenkins i must speak to you at once in private  it was by the little watercourse in the moors on the slope under the hanging rock that march met his new friend fisher by appointment shortly after the ugly and almost grotesque scene that had broken up the group in the garden  it was a monkeytrick of mine observed fisher gloomily putting phosphorus on the target but the only chance to make him jump was to give him the horrors suddenly and when he saw the face hed shot at shining on the target he practiced on all lit up with an infernal light he did jump quite enough for my own intellectual satisfaction  im afraid i dont quite understand even now said march exactly what he did or why he did it  you ought to replied fisher with his rather dreary smile for you gave me the first suggestion yourself oh yes you did and it was a very shrewd one you said a man wouldnt take sandwiches with him to dine at a great house it was quite true and the inference was that though he was going there he didnt mean to dine there or at any rate that he might not be dining there it occurred to me at once that he probably expected the visit to be unpleasant or the reception doubtful or something that would prevent his accepting hospitality then it struck me that turnbull was a terror to certain shady characters in the past and that he had come down to identify and denounce one of them the chances at the start pointed to the hostthat is jenkins im morally certain now that jenkins was the undesirable alien turnbull wanted to convict in another shootingaffair but you see the shooting gentleman had another shot in his locker  but you said he would have to be a very good shot protested march  jenkins is a very good shot said fisher  a very good shot who can pretend to be a very bad shot shall i tell you the second hint i hit on after yours to make me think it was jenkins it was my cousins account of his bad shooting hed shot a cockade off a hat and a weathercock off a building now in fact a man must shoot very well indeed to shoot so badly as that he must shoot very neatly to hit the cockade and not the head or even the hat if the shots had really gone at random the chances are a thousand to one that they would not have hit such prominent and picturesque objects they were chosen because they were prominent and picturesque objects they make a story to go the round of society he keeps the crooked weathercock in the summerhouse to perpetuate the story of a legend and then he lay in wait with his evil eye and wicked gun safely ambushed behind the legend of his own incompetence  but there is more than that there is the summerhouse itself i mean there is the whole thing theres all that jenkins gets chaffed about the gilding and the gaudy colors and all the vulgarity thats supposed to stamp him as an upstart now as a matter of fact upstarts generally dont do this god knows theres enough of em in society and one knows em well enough and this is the very last thing they do theyre generally only too keen to know the right thing and do it and they instantly put themselves body and soul into the hands of art decorators and art experts who do the whole thing for them theres hardly another millionaire alive who has the moral courage to have a gilt monogram on a chair like that one in the gunroom for that matter theres the name as well as the monogram names like tompkins and jenkins and jinks are funny without being vulgar i mean they are vulgar without being common if you prefer it they are commonplace without being common they are just the names to be chosen to look ordinary but theyre really rather extraordinary do you know many people called tompkins its a good deal rarer than talbot its pretty much the same with the comic clothes of the parvenu jenkins dresses like a character in punch but thats because he is a character in punch i mean hes a fictitious character hes a fabulous animal he doesnt exist  have you ever considered what it must be like to be a man who doesnt exist i mean to be a man with a fictitious character that he has to keep up at the expense not merely of personal talents to be a new kind of hypocrite hiding a talent in a new kind of napkin this man has chosen his hypocrisy very ingeniously it was really a new one a subtle villain has dressed up as a dashing gentleman and a worthy business man and a philanthropist and a saint but the loud checks of a comical little cad were really rather a new disguise but the disguise must be very irksome to a man who can really do things this is a dexterous little cosmopolitan guttersnipe who can do scores of things not only shoot but draw and paint and probably play the fiddle now a man like that may find the hiding of his talents useful but he could never help wanting to use them where they were useless if he can draw he will draw absentmindedly on blotting paper i suspect this rascal has often drawn poor old puggys face on blotting paper probably he began doing it in blots as he afterward did it in dots or rather shots it was the same sort of thing he found a disused target in a deserted yard and couldnt resist indulging in a little secret shooting like secret drinking you thought the shots all scattered and irregular and so they were but not accidental no two distances were alike but the different points were exactly where he wanted to put them theres nothing needs such mathematical precision as a wild caricature ive dabbled a little in drawing myself and i assure you that to put one dot where you want it is a marvel with a pen close to a piece of paper it was a miracle to do it across a garden with a gun but a man who can work those miracles will always itch to work them if its only in the dark  after a pause march observed thoughtfully but he couldnt have brought him down like a bird with one of those little guns  no that was why i went into the gunroom replied fisher  he did it with one of burkes rifles and burke thought he knew the sound of it thats why he rushed out without a hat looking so wild he saw nothing but a car passing quickly which he followed for a little way and then concluded hed made a mistake  there was another silence during which fisher sat on a great stone as motionless as on their first meeting and watched the gray and silver river eddying past under the bushes then march said abruptly of course he knows the truth now  nobody knows the truth but you and i answered fisher with a certain softening in his voice and i dont think you and i will ever quarrel  what do you mean asked march in an altered accent what have you done about it  horne fisher continued to gaze steadily at the eddying stream at last he said the police have proved it was a motor accident  but you know it was not  i told you that i know too much replied fisher with his eye on the river i know that and i know a great many other things i know the atmosphere and the way the whole thing works i know this fellow has succeeded in making himself something incurably commonplace and comic i know you cant get up a persecution of old toole or little tich if i were to tell hoggs or halkett that old jink was an assassin they would almost die of laughter before my eyes oh i dont say their laughters quite innocent though its genuine in its way they want old jink and they couldnt do without him i dont say im quite innocent i like hoggs i dont want him to be down and out and hed be done for if jink cant pay for his coronet they were devilish near the line at the last election but the only real objection to it is that its impossible nobody would believe it its not in the picture the crooked weathercock would always turn it into a joke  dont you think this is infamous asked march quietly  i think a good many things replied the other  if you people ever happen to blow the whole tangle of society to hell with dynamite i dont know that the human race will be much the worse but dont be too hard on me merely because i know what society is thats why i moon away my time over things like stinking fish  there was a pause as he settled himself down again by the stream and then he added  i told you before i had to throw back the big fish    ii the vanishing prince  this tale begins among a tangle of tales round a name that is at once recent and legendary the name is that of michael oneill popularly called prince michael partly because he claimed descent from ancient fenian princes and partly because he was credited with a plan to make himself prince president of ireland as the last napoleon did of france he was undoubtedly a gentleman of honorable pedigree and of many accomplishments but two of his accomplishments emerged from all the rest he had a talent for appearing when he was not wanted and a talent for disappearing when he was wanted especially when he was wanted by the police it may be added that his disappearances were more dangerous than his appearances in the latter he seldom went beyond the sensationalpasting up seditious placards tearing down official placards making flamboyant speeches or unfurling forbidden flags but in order to effect the former he would sometimes fight for his freedom with startling energy from which men were sometimes lucky to escape with a broken head instead of a broken neck his most famous feats of escape however were due to dexterity and not to violence on a cloudless summer morning he had come down a country road white with dust and pausing outside a farmhouse had told the farmers daughter with elegant indifference that the local police were in pursuit of him the girls name was bridget royce a somber and even sullen type of beauty and she looked at him darkly as if in doubt and said do you want me to hide you upon which he only laughed leaped lightly over the stone wall and strode toward the farm merely throwing over his shoulder the remark thank you i have generally been quite capable of hiding myself in which proceeding he acted with a tragic ignorance of the nature of women and there fell on his path in that sunshine a shadow of doom  while he disappeared through the farmhouse the girl remained for a few moments looking up the road and two perspiring policemen came plowing up to the door where she stood though still angry she was still silent and a quarter of an hour later the officers had searched the house and were already inspecting the kitchen garden and cornfield behind it in the ugly reaction of her mood she might have been tempted even to point out the fugitive but for a small difficulty that she had no more notion than the policemen had of where he could possibly have gone the kitchen garden was inclosed by a very low wall and the cornfield beyond lay aslant like a square patch on a great green hill on which he could still have been seen even as a dot in the distance everything stood solid in its familiar place the apple tree was too small to support or hide a climber the only shed stood open and obviously empty there was no sound save the droning of summer flies and the occasional flutter of a bird unfamiliar enough to be surprised by the scarecrow in the field there was scarcely a shadow save a few blue lines that fell from the thin tree every detail was picked out by the brilliant day light as if in a microscope the girl described the scene later with all the passionate realism of her race and whether or no the policemen had a similar eye for the picturesque they had at least an eye for the facts of the case and were compelled to give up the chase and retire from the scene bridget royce remained as if in a trance staring at the sunlit garden in which a man had just vanished like a fairy she was still in a sinister mood and the miracle took in her mind a character of unfriendliness and fear as if the fairy were decidedly a bad fairy the sun upon the glittering garden depressed her more than the darkness but she continued to stare at it then the world itself went halfwitted and she screamed the scarecrow moved in the sun light it had stood with its back to her in a battered old black hat and a tattered garment and with all its tatters flying it strode away across the hill  she did not analyze the audacious trick by which the man had turned to his advantage the subtle effects of the expected and the obvious she was still under the cloud of more individual complexities and she noticed most of all that the vanishing scarecrow did not even turn to look at the farm and the fates that were running so adverse to his fantastic career of freedom ruled that his next adventure though it had the same success in another quarter should increase the danger in this quarter among the many similar adventures related of him in this manner it is also said that some days afterward another girl named mary cregan found him concealed on the farm where she worked and if the story is true she must also have had the shock of an uncanny experience for when she was busy at some lonely task in the yard she heard a voice speaking out of the well and found that the eccentric had managed to drop himself into the bucket which was some little way below the well only partly full of water in this case however he had to appeal to the woman to wind up the rope and men say it was when this news was told to the other woman that her soul walked over the border line of treason  such at least were the stories told of him in the countryside and there were many moreas that he had stood insolently in a splendid green dressing gown on the steps of a great hotel and then led the police a chase through a long suite of grand apartments and finally through his own bedroom on to a balcony that overhung the river the moment the pursuers stepped on to the balcony it broke under them and they dropped pellmell into the eddying waters while michael who had thrown off his gown and dived was able to swim away it was said that he had carefully cut away the props so that they would not support anything so heavy as a policeman but here again he was immediately fortunate yet ultimately unfortunate for it is said that one of the men was drowned leaving a family feud which made a little rift in his popularity these stories can now be told in some detail not because they are the most marvelous of his many adventures but because these alone were not covered with silence by the loyalty of the peasantry these alone found their way into official reports and it is these which three of the chief officials of the country were reading and discussing when the more remarkable part of this story begins  night was far advanced and the lights shone in the cottage that served for a temporary police station near the coast on one side of it were the last houses of the straggling village and on the other nothing but a waste moorland stretching away toward the sea the line of which was broken by no landmark except a solitary tower of the prehistoric pattern still found in ireland standing up as slender as a column but pointed like a pyramid at a wooden table in front of the window which normally looked out on this landscape sat two men in plain clothes but with something of a military bearing for indeed they were the two chiefs of the detective service of that district the senior of the two both in age and rank was a sturdy man with a short white beard and frosty eyebrows fixed in a frown which suggested rather worry than severity  his name was morton and he was a liverpool man long pickled in the irish quarrels and doing his duty among them in a sour fashion not altogether unsympathetic he had spoken a few sentences to his companion nolan a tall dark man with a cadaverous equine irish face when he seemed to remember something and touched a bell which rang in another room the subordinate he had summoned immediately appeared with a sheaf of papers in his hand  sit down wilson he said  those are the depositions i suppose  yes replied the third officer  i think ive got all there is to be got out of them so i sent the people away  did mary cregan give evidence asked morton with a frown that looked a little heavier than usual  no but her master did answered the man called wilson who had flat red hair and a plain pale face not without sharpness i think hes hanging round the girl himself and is out against a rival theres always some reason of that sort when we are told the truth about anything and you bet the other girl told right enough  well lets hope theyll be some sort of use remarked nolan in a somewhat hopeless manner gazing out into the darkness  anything is to the good said morton that lets us know anything about him  do we know anything about him asked the melancholy irishman  we know one thing about him said wilson and its the one thing that nobody ever knew before we know where he is  are you sure inquired morton looking at him sharply  quite sure replied his assistant  at this very minute he is in that tower over there by the shore if you go near enough youll see the candle burning in the window  as he spoke the noise of a horn sounded on the road outside and a moment after they heard the throbbing of a motor car brought to a standstill before the door morton instantly sprang to his feet  thank the lord thats the car from dublin he said i cant do anything without special authority not if he were sitting on the top of the tower and putting out his tongue at us but the chief can do what he thinks best  he hurried out to the entrance and was soon exchanging greetings with a big handsome man in a fur coat who brought into the dingy little station the indescribable glow of the great cities and the luxuries of the great world  for this was sir walter carey an official of such eminence in dublin castle that nothing short of the case of prince michael would have brought him on such a journey in the middle of the night but the case of prince michael as it happened was complicated by legalism as well as lawlessness on the last occasion he had escaped by a forensic quibble and not as usual by a private escapade and it was a question whether at the moment he was amenable to the law or not it might be necessary to stretch a point but a man like sir walter could probably stretch it as far as he liked  whether he intended to do so was a question to be considered despite the almost aggressive touch of luxury in the fur coat it soon became apparent that sir walters large leonine head was for use as well as ornament and he considered the matter soberly and sanely enough five chairs were set round the plain deal table for who should sir walter bring with him but his young relative and secretary horne fisher sir walter listened with grave attention and his secretary with polite boredom to the string of episodes by which the police had traced the flying rebel from the steps of the hotel to the solitary tower beside the sea there at least he was cornered between the moors and the breakers and the scout sent by wilson reported him as writing under a solitary candle perhaps composing another of his tremendous proclamations indeed it would have been typical of him to choose it as the place in which finally to turn to bay he had some remote claim on it as on a family castle and those who knew him thought him capable of imitating the primitive irish chieftains who fell fighting against the sea  i saw some queerlooking people leaving as i came in said sir walter carey i suppose they were your witnesses but why do they turn up here at this time of night  morton smiled grimly  they come here by night because they would be dead men if they came here by day they are criminals committing a crime that is more horrible here than theft or murder  what crime do you mean asked the other with some curiosity  they are helping the law said morton  there was a silence and sir walter considered the papers before him with an abstracted eye at last he spoke  quite so but look here if the local feeling is as lively as that there are a good many points to consider i believe the new act will enable me to collar him now if i think it best but is it best a serious rising would do us no good in parliament and the government has enemies in england as well as ireland it wont do if i have done what looks a little like sharp practice and then only raised a revolution  its all the other way said the man called wilson rather quickly there wont be half so much of a revolution if you arrest him as there will if you leave him loose for three days longer but anyhow there cant be anything nowadays that the proper police cant manage  mr wilson is a londoner said the irish detective with a smile  yes im a cockney all right replied wilson and i think im all the better for that especially at this job oddly enough  sir walter seemed slightly amused at the pertinacity of the third officer and perhaps even more amused at the slight accent with which he spoke which rendered rather needless his boast about his origin  do you mean to say he asked that you know more about the business here because you have come from london  sounds funny i know but i do believe it answered wilson  i believe these affairs want fresh methods but most of all i believe they want a fresh eye  the superior officers laughed and the redhaired man went on with a slight touch of temper  well look at the facts see how the fellow got away every time and youll understand what i mean why was he able to stand in the place of the scarecrow hidden by nothing but an old hat because it was a village policeman who knew the scarecrow was there was expecting it and therefore took no notice of it now i never expect a scarecrow ive never seen one in the street and i stare at one when i see it in the field its a new thing to me and worth noticing and it was just the same when he hid in the well you are ready to find a well in a place like that you look for a well and so you dont see it i dont look for it and therefore i do look at it  it is certainly an idea said sir walter smiling but what about the balcony balconies are occasionally seen in london  but not rivers right under them as if it was in venice replied wilson  it is certainly a new idea repeated sir walter with something like respect he had all the love of the luxurious classes for new ideas but he also had a critical faculty and was inclined to think after due reflection that it was a true idea as well  growing dawn had already turned the window panes from black to gray when sir walter got abruptly to his feet the others rose also taking this for a signal that the arrest was to be undertaken but their leader stood for a moment in deep thought as if conscious that he had come to a parting of the ways  suddenly the silence was pierced by a long wailing cry from the dark moors outside the silence that followed it seemed more startling than the shriek itself and it lasted until nolan said heavily  tis the banshee somebody is marked for the grave  his long largefeatured face was as pale as a moon and it was easy to remember that he was the only irishman in the room  well i know that banshee said wilson cheerfully ignorant as you think i am of these things i talked to that banshee myself an hour ago and i sent that banshee up to the tower and told her to sing out like that if she could get a glimpse of our friend writing his proclamation  do you mean that girl bridget royce asked morton drawing his frosty brows together has she turned kings evidence to that extent  yes answered wilson  i know very little of these local things you tell me but i reckon an angry woman is much the same in all countries  nolan however seemed still moody and unlike himself its an ugly noise and an ugly business altogether he said if its really the end of prince michael it may well be the end of other things as well when the spirit is on him he would escape by a ladder of dead men and wade through that sea if it were made of blood  is that the real reason of your pious alarms asked wilson with a slight sneer  the irishmans pale face blackened with a new passion  i have faced as many murderers in county clare as you ever fought with in clapham junction mr cockney he said  hush please said morton sharply  wilson you have no kind of right to imply doubt of your superiors conduct i hope you will prove yourself as courageous and trustworthy as he has always been  the pale face of the redhaired man seemed a shade paler but he was silent and composed and sir walter went up to nolan with marked courtesy saying shall we go outside now and get this business done  dawn had lifted leaving a wide chasm of white between a great gray cloud and the great gray moorland beyond which the tower was outlined against the daybreak and the sea  something in its plain and primitive shape vaguely suggested the dawn in the first days of the earth in some prehistoric time when even the colors were hardly created when there was only blank daylight between cloud and clay these dead hues were relieved only by one spot of goldthe spark of the candle alight in the window of the lonely tower and burning on into the broadening daylight as the group of detectives followed by a cordon of policemen spread out into a crescent to cut off all escape the light in the tower flashed as if it were moved for a moment and then went out they knew the man inside had realized the daylight and blown out his candle  there are other windows arent there asked morton and a door of course somewhere round the corner only a round tower has no corners  another example of my small suggestion observed wilson quietly that queer tower was the first thing i saw when i came to these parts and i can tell you a little more about itor at any rate the outside of it there are four windows altogether one a little way from this one but just out of sight those are both on the ground floor and so is the third on the other side making a sort of triangle but the fourth is just above the third and i suppose it looks on an upper floor  its only a sort of loft reached by a ladder said nolan  ive played in the place when i was a child its no more than an empty shell and his sad face grew sadder thinking perhaps of the tragedy of his country and the part that he played in it  the man must have got a table and chair at any rate said wilson but no doubt he could have got those from some cottage if i might make a suggestion sir i think we ought to approach all the five entrances at once so to speak one of us should go to the door and one to each window macbride here has a ladder for the upper window  mr horne fisher languidly turned to his distinguished relative and spoke for the first time  i am rather a convert to the cockney school of psychology he said in an almost inaudible voice  the others seemed to feel the same influence in different ways for the group began to break up in the manner indicated morton moved toward the window immediately in front of them where the hidden outlaw had just snuffed the candle nolan a little farther westward to the next window while wilson followed by macbride with the ladder went round to the two windows at the back sir walter carey himself followed by his secretary began to walk round toward the only door to demand admittance in a more regular fashion  he will be armed of course remarked sir walter casually  by all accounts replied horne fisher he can do more with a candlestick than most men with a pistol but he is pretty sure to have the pistol too  even as he spoke the question was answered with a tongue of thunder morton had just placed himself in front of the nearest window his broad shoulders blocking the aperture for an instant it was lit from within as with red fire followed by a thundering throng of echoes the square shoulders seemed to alter in shape and the sturdy figure collapsed among the tall rank grasses at the foot of the tower a puff of smoke floated from the window like a little cloud the two men behind rushed to the spot and raised him but he was dead  sir walter straightened himself and called out something that was lost in another noise of firing it was possible that the police were already avenging their comrade from the other side fisher had already raced round to the next window and a new cry of astonishment from him brought his patron to the same spot nolan the irish policeman had also fallen sprawling all his great length in the grass and it was red with his blood he was still alive when they reached him but there was death on his face and he was only able to make a final gesture telling them that all was over and with a broken word and a heroic effort motioning them on to where his other comrades were besieging the back of the tower stunned by these rapid and repeated shocks the two men could only vaguely obey the gesture and finding their way to the other windows at the back they discovered a scene equally startling if less final and tragic the other two officers were not dead or mortally wounded but macbride lay with a broken leg and his ladder on top of him evidently thrown down from the top window of the tower while wilson lay on his face quite still as if stunned with his red head among the gray and silver of the sea holly in him however the impotence was but momentary for he began to move and rise as the others came round the tower  my god its like an explosion cried sir walter and indeed it was the only word for this unearthly energy by which one man had been able to deal death or destruction on three sides of the same small triangle at the same instant  wilson had already scrambled to his feet and with splendid energy flew again at the window revolver in hand he fired twice into the opening and then disappeared in his own smoke but the thud of his feet and the shock of a falling chair told them that the intrepid londoner had managed at last to leap into the room then followed a curious silence and sir walter walking to the window through the thinning smoke looked into the hollow shell of the ancient tower except for wilson staring around him there was nobody there  the inside of the tower was a single empty room with nothing but a plain wooden chair and a table on which were pens ink and paper and the candlestick halfway up the high wall there was a rude timber platform under the upper window a small loft which was more like a large shelf it was reached only by a ladder and it seemed to be as bare as the bare walls wilson completed his survey of the place and then went and stared at the things on the table then he silently pointed with his lean forefinger at the open page of the large notebook the writer had suddenly stopped writing even in the middle of a word  i said it was like an explosion said sir walter carey at last and really the man himself seems to have suddenly exploded but he has blown himself up somehow without touching the tower hes burst more like a bubble than a bomb  he has touched more valuable things than the tower said wilson gloomily  there was a long silence and then sir walter said seriously well mr wilson i am not a detective and these unhappy happenings have left you in charge of that branch of the business we all lament the cause of this but i should like to say that i myself have the strongest confidence in your capacity for carrying on the work what do you think we should do next  wilson seemed to rouse himself from his depression and acknowledged the speakers words with a warmer civility than he had hitherto shown to anybody he called in a few of the police to assist in routing out the interior leaving the rest to spread themselves in a search party outside  i think he said the first thing is to make quite sure about the inside of this place as it was hardly physically possible for him to have got outside i suppose poor nolan would have brought in his banshee and said it was supernaturally possible but ive got no use for disembodied spirits when im dealing with facts and the facts before me are an empty tower with a ladder a chair and a table  the spiritualists said sir walter with a smile would say that spirits could find a great deal of use for a table  i dare say they could if the spirits were on the tablein a bottle replied wilson with a curl of his pale lip the people round here when theyre all sodden up with irish whisky may believe in such things i think they want a little education in this country  horne fishers heavy eyelids fluttered in a faint attempt to rise as if he were tempted to a lazy protest against the contemptuous tone of the investigator  the irish believe far too much in spirits to believe in spiritualism he murmured they know too much about em if you want a simple and childlike faith in any spirit that comes along you can get it in your favorite london  i dont want to get it anywhere said wilson shortly i say im dealing with much simpler things than your simple faith with a table and a chair and a ladder now what i want to say about them at the start is this they are all three made roughly enough of plain wood but the table and the chair are fairly new and comparatively clean the ladder is covered with dust and there is a cobweb under the top rung of it that means that he borrowed the first two quite recently from some cottage as we supposed but the ladder has been a long time in this rotten old dustbin probably it was part of the original furniture an heirloom in this magnificent palace of the irish kings  again fisher looked at him under his eyelids but seemed too sleepy to speak and wilson went on with his argument  now its quite clear that something very odd has just happened in this place the chances are ten to one it seems to me that it had something specially to do with this place probably he came here because he could do it only here it doesnt seem very inviting otherwise but the man knew it of old they say it belonged to his family so that altogether i think everything points to something in the construction of the tower itself  your reasoning seems to me excellent said sir walter who was listening attentively but what could it be  you see now what i mean about the ladder went on the detective its the only old piece of furniture here and the first thing that caught that cockney eye of mine but there is something else that loft up there is a sort of lumber room without any lumber so far as i can see its as empty as everything else and as things are i dont see the use of the ladder leading to it it seems to me as i cant find anything unusual down here that it might pay us to look up there  he got briskly off the table on which he was sitting for the only chair was allotted to sir walter and ran rapidly up the ladder to the platform above he was soon followed by the others mr fisher going last however with an appearance of considerable nonchalance  at this stage however they were destined to disappointment wilson nosed in every corner like a terrier and examined the roof almost in the posture of a fly but half an hour afterward they had to confess that they were still without a clew sir walters private secretary seemed more and more threatened with inappropriate slumber and having been the last to climb up the ladder seemed now to lack the energy even to climb down again  come along fisher called out sir walter from below when the others had regained the floor we must consider whether well pull the whole place to pieces to see what its made of  im coming in a minute said the voice from the ledge above their heads a voice somewhat suggestive of an articulate yawn  what are you waiting for asked sir walter impatiently can you see anything there  well yes in a way replied the voice vaguely  in fact i see it quite plain now  what is it asked wilson sharply from the table on which he sat kicking his heels restlessly  well its a man said horne fisher  wilson bounded off the table as if he had been kicked off it what do you mean he cried how can you possibly see a man  i can see him through the window replied the secretary mildly i see him coming across the moor hes making a bee line across the open country toward this tower he evidently means to pay us a visit and considering who it seems to be perhaps it would be more polite if we were all at the door to receive him and in a leisurely manner the secretary came down the ladder  who it seems to be repeated sir walter in astonishment  well i think its the man you call prince michael observed mr fisher airily in fact im sure it is ive seen the police portraits of him  there was a dead silence and sir walters usually steady brain seemed to go round like a windmill  but hang it all he said at last even supposing his own explosion could have thrown him half a mile away without passing through any of the windows and left him alive enough for a country walkeven then why the devil should he walk in this direction the murderer does not generally revisit the scene of his crime so rapidly as all that  he doesnt know yet that it is the scene of his crime answered horne fisher  what on earth do you mean  you credit him with rather singular absence of mind  well the truth is it isnt the scene of his crime said fisher and went and looked out of the window  there was another silence and then sir walter said quietly  what sort of notion have you really got in your head fisher have you developed a new theory about how this fellow escaped out of the ring round him  he never escaped at all answered the man at the window without turning round he never escaped out of the ring because he was never inside the ring he was not in this tower at all at least not when we were surrounding it  he turned and leaned back against the window but in spite of his usual listless manner they almost fancied that the face in shadow was a little pale  i began to guess something of the sort when we were some way from the tower he said did you notice that sort of flash or flicker the candle gave before it was extinguished i was almost certain it was only the last leap the flame gives when a candle burns itself out and then i came into this room and i saw that  he pointed at the table and sir walter caught his breath with a sort of curse at his own blindness for the candle in the candlestick had obviously burned itself away to nothing and left him mentally at least very completely in the dark  then there is a sort of mathematical question went on fisher leaning back in his limp way and looking up at the bare walls as if tracing imaginary diagrams there its not so easy for a man in the third angle to face the other two at the same moment especially if they are at the base of an isosceles i am sorry if it sounds like a lecture on geometry but  im afraid we have no time for it said wilson coldly if this man is really coming back i must give my orders at once  i think ill go on with it though observed fisher staring at the roof with insolent serenity  i must ask you mr fisher to let me conduct my inquiry on my own lines said wilson firmly i am the officer in charge now  yes remarked horne fisher softly but with an accent that somehow chilled the hearer yes but why  sir walter was staring for he had never seen his rather lackadaisical young friend look like that before fisher was looking at wilson with lifted lids and the eyes under them seemed to have shed or shifted a film as do the eyes of an eagle  why are you the officer in charge now he asked why can you conduct the inquiry on your own lines now how did it come about i wonder that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do  nobody spoke and nobody can say how soon anyone would have collected his wits to speak when a noise came from without it was the heavy and hollow sound of a blow upon the door of the tower and to their shaken spirits it sounded strangely like the hammer of doom  the wooden door of the tower moved on its rusty hinges under the hand that struck it and prince michael came into the room nobody had the smallest doubt about his identity his light clothes though frayed with his adventures were of fine and almost foppish cut and he wore a pointed beard or imperial perhaps as a further reminiscence of louis napoleon but he was a much taller and more graceful man that his prototype before anyone could speak he had silenced everyone for an instant with a slight but splendid gesture of hospitality  gentlemen he said this is a poor place now but you are heartily welcome  wilson was the first to recover and he took a stride toward the newcomer  michael oneill i arrest you in the kings name for the murder of francis morton and james nolan it is my duty to warn you  no no mr wilson cried fisher suddenly  you shall not commit a third murder  sir walter carey rose from his chair which fell over with a crash behind him what does all this mean he called out in an authoritative manner  it means said fisher that this man hooker wilson as soon as he had put his head in at that window killed his two comrades who had put their heads in at the other windows by firing across the empty room that is what it means and if you want to know count how many times he is supposed to have fired and then count the charges left in his revolver  wilson who was still sitting on the table abruptly put a hand out for the weapon that lay beside him but the next movement was the most unexpected of all for the prince standing in the doorway passed suddenly from the dignity of a statue to the swiftness of an acrobat and rent the revolver out of the detectives hand  you dog he cried  so you are the type of english truth as i am of irish tragedyyou who come to kill me wading through the blood of your brethren if they had fallen in a feud on the hillside it would be called murder and yet your sin might be forgiven you but i who am innocent i was to be slain with ceremony there would be long speeches and patient judges listening to my vain plea of innocence noting down my despair and disregarding it yes that is what i call assassination but killing may be no murder there is one shot left in this little gun and i know where it should go  wilson turned quickly on the table and even as he turned he twisted in agony for michael shot him through the body where he sat so that he tumbled off the table like lumber  the police rushed to lift him sir walter stood speechless and then with a strange and weary gesture horne fisher spoke  you are indeed a type of the irish tragedy he said you were entirely in the right and you have put yourself in the wrong  the princes face was like marble for a space then there dawned in his eyes a light not unlike that of despair he laughed suddenly and flung the smoking pistol on the ground  i am indeed in the wrong he said  i have committed a crime that may justly bring a curse on me and my children  horne fisher did not seem entirely satisfied with this very sudden repentance he kept his eyes on the man and only said in a low voice what crime do you mean  i have helped english justice replied prince michael  i have avenged your kings officers i have done the work of his hangman for that truly i deserve to be hanged  and he turned to the police with a gesture that did not so much surrender to them but rather command them to arrest him  this was the story that horne fisher told to harold march the journalist many years after in a little but luxurious restaurant near piccadilly he had invited march to dinner some time after the affair he called the face in the target and the conversation had naturally turned on that mystery and afterward on earlier memories of fishers life and the way in which he was led to study such problems as those of prince michael horne fisher was fifteen years older his thin hair had faded to frontal baldness and his long thin hands dropped less with affectation and more with fatigue and he told the story of the irish adventure of his youth because it recorded the first occasion on which he had ever come in contact with crime or discovered how darkly and how terribly crime can be entangled with law  hooker wilson was the first criminal i ever knew and he was a policeman explained fisher twirling his wine glass and all my life has been a mixedup business of the sort he was a man of very real talent and perhaps genius and well worth studying both as a detective and a criminal his white face and red hair were typical of him for he was one of those who are cold and yet on fire for fame and he could control anger but not ambition he swallowed the snubs of his superiors in that first quarrel though he boiled with resentment but when he suddenly saw the two heads dark against the dawn and framed in the two windows he could not miss the chance not only of revenge but of the removal of the two obstacles to his promotion he was a dead shot and counted on silencing both though proof against him would have been hard in any case but as a matter of fact he had a narrow escape in the case of nolan who lived just long enough to say wilson and point we thought he was summoning help for his comrade but he was really denouncing his murderer after that it was easy to throw down the ladder above him for a man up a ladder cannot see clearly what is below and behind and to throw himself on the ground as another victim of the catastrophe  but there was mixed up with his murderous ambition a real belief not only in his own talents but in his own theories he did believe in what he called a fresh eye and he did want scope for fresh methods there was something in his view but it failed where such things commonly fail because the fresh eye cannot see the unseen it is true about the ladder and the scarecrow but not about the life and the soul and he made a bad mistake about what a man like michael would do when he heard a woman scream all michaels very vanity and vainglory made him rush out at once he would have walked into dublin castle for a ladys glove call it his pose or what you will but he would have done it what happened when he met her is another story and one we may never know but from tales ive heard since they must have been reconciled wilson was wrong there but there was something for all that in his notion that the newcomer sees most and that the man on the spot may know too much to know anything he was right about some things he was right about me  about you asked harold march in some wonder  i am the man who knows too much to know anything or at any rate to do anything said horne fisher i dont mean especially about ireland i mean about england i mean about the whole way we are governed and perhaps the only way we can be governed you asked me just now what became of the survivors of that tragedy well wilson recovered and we managed to persuade him to retire but we had to pension that damnable murderer more magnificently than any hero who ever fought for england i managed to save michael from the worst but we had to send that perfectly innocent man to penal servitude for a crime we know he never committed and it was only afterward that we could connive in a sneakish way at his escape and sir walter carey is prime minister of this country which he would probably never have been if the truth had been told of such a horrible scandal in his department it might have done for us altogether in ireland it would certainly have done for him and he is my fathers old friend and has always smothered me with kindness i am too tangled up with the whole thing you see and i was certainly never born to set it right you look distressed not to say shocked and im not at all offended at it let us change the subject by all means if you like what do you think of this burgundy its rather a discovery of mine like the restaurant itself  and he proceeded to talk learnedly and luxuriantly on all the wines of the world on which subject also some moralists would consider that he knew too much    iii the soul of the schoolboy  a large map of london would be needed to display the wild and zigzag course of one days journey undertaken by an uncle and his nephew or to speak more truly of a nephew and his uncle for the nephew a schoolboy on a holiday was in theory the god in the car or in the cab tram tube and so on while his uncle was at most a priest dancing before him and offering sacrifices to put it more soberly the schoolboy had something of the stolid air of a young duke doing the grand tour while his elderly relative was reduced to the position of a courier who nevertheless had to pay for everything like a patron the schoolboy was officially known as summers minor and in a more social manner as stinks the only public tribute to his career as an amateur photographer and electrician the uncle was the rev thomas twyford a lean and lively old gentleman with a red eager face and white hair he was in the ordinary way a country clergyman but he was one of those who achieve the paradox of being famous in an obscure way because they are famous in an obscure world in a small circle of ecclesiastical archaeologists who were the only people who could even understand one anothers discoveries he occupied a recognized and respectable place and a critic might have found even in that days journey at least as much of the uncles hobby as of the nephews holiday  his original purpose had been wholly paternal and festive but like many other intelligent people he was not above the weakness of playing with a toy to amuse himself on the theory that it would amuse a child his toys were crowns and miters and croziers and swords of state and he had lingered over them telling himself that the boy ought to see all the sights of london and at the end of the day after a tremendous tea he rather gave the game away by winding up with a visit in which hardly any human boy could be conceived as taking an interestan underground chamber supposed to have been a chapel recently excavated on the north bank of the thames and containing literally nothing whatever but one old silver coin but the coin to those who knew was more solitary and splendid than the kohinoor it was roman and was said to bear the head of st paul and round it raged the most vital controversies about the ancient british church it could hardly be denied however that the controversies left summers minor comparatively cold  indeed the things that interested summers minor and the things that did not interest him had mystified and amused his uncle for several hours he exhibited the english schoolboys startling ignorance and startling knowledgeknowledge of some special classification in which he can generally correct and confound his elders he considered himself entitled at hampton court on a holiday to forget the very names of cardinal wolsey or william of orange but he could hardly be dragged from some details about the arrangement of the electric bells in the neighboring hotel he was solidly dazed by westminster abbey which is not so unnatural since that church became the lumber room of the larger and less successful statuary of the eighteenth century but he had a magic and minute knowledge of the westminster omnibuses and indeed of the whole omnibus system of london the colors and numbers of which he knew as a herald knows heraldry he would cry out against a momentary confusion between a lightgreen paddington and a darkgreen bayswater vehicle as his uncle would at the identification of a greek ikon and a roman image  do you collect omnibuses like stamps asked his uncle they must need a rather large album or do you keep them in your locker  i keep them in my head replied the nephew with legitimate firmness  it does you credit i admit replied the clergyman i suppose it were vain to ask for what purpose you have learned that out of a thousand things there hardly seems to be a career in it unless you could be permanently on the pavement to prevent old ladies getting into the wrong bus well we must get out of this one for this is our place i want to show you what they call st pauls penny  is it like st pauls cathedral asked the youth with resignation as they alighted  at the entrance their eyes were arrested by a singular figure evidently hovering there with a similar anxiety to enter it was that of a dark thin man in a long black robe rather like a cassock but the black cap on his head was of too strange a shape to be a biretta it suggested rather some archaic headdress of persia or babylon he had a curious black beard appearing only at the corners of his chin and his large eyes were oddly set in his face like the flat decorative eyes painted in old egyptian profiles before they had gathered more than a general impression of him he had dived into the doorway that was their own destination  nothing could be seen above ground of the sunken sanctuary except a strong wooden hut of the sort recently run up for many military and official purposes the wooden floor of which was indeed a mere platform over the excavated cavity below a soldier stood as a sentry outside and a superior soldier an angloindian officer of distinction sat writing at the desk inside indeed the sightseers soon found that this particular sight was surrounded with the most extraordinary precautions i have compared the silver coin to the kohinoor and in one sense it was even conventionally comparable since by a historical accident it was at one time almost counted among the crown jewels or at least the crown relics until one of the royal princes publicly restored it to the shrine to which it was supposed to belong other causes combined to concentrate official vigilance upon it there had been a scare about spies carrying explosives in small objects and one of those experimental orders which pass like waves over bureaucracy had decreed first that all visitors should change their clothes for a sort of official sackcloth and then when this method caused some murmurs that they should at least turn out their pockets colonel morris the officer in charge was a short active man with a grim and leathery face but a lively and humorous eyea contradiction borne out by his conduct for he at once derided the safeguards and yet insisted on them  i dont care a button myself for pauls penny or such things he admitted in answer to some antiquarian openings from the clergyman who was slightly acquainted with him but i wear the kings coat you know and its a serious thing when the kings uncle leaves a thing here with his own hands under my charge but as for saints and relics and things i fear im a bit of a voltairian what you would call a skeptic  im not sure its even skeptical to believe in the royal family and not in the holy family replied mr twyford but of course i can easily empty my pockets to show i dont carry a bomb  the little heap of the parsons possessions which he left on the table consisted chiefly of papers over and above a pipe and a tobacco pouch and some roman and saxon coins the rest were catalogues of old books and pamphlets like one entitled the use of sarum one glance at which was sufficient both for the colonel and the schoolboy they could not see the use of sarum at all the contents of the boys pockets naturally made a larger heap and included marbles a ball of string an electric torch a magnet a small catapult and of course a large pocketknife almost to be described as a small tool box a complex apparatus on which he seemed disposed to linger pointing out that it included a pair of nippers a tool for punching holes in wood and above all an instrument for taking stones out of a horses hoof the comparative absence of any horse he appeared to regard as irrelevant as if it were a mere appendage easily supplied but when the turn came of the gentleman in the black gown he did not turn out his pockets but merely spread out his hands  i have no possessions he said  im afraid i must ask you to empty your pockets and make sure observed the colonel gruffly  i have no pockets said the stranger  mr twyford was looking at the long black gown with a learned eye  are you a monk he asked in a puzzled fashion  i am a magus replied the stranger  you have heard of the magi perhaps i am a magician  oh i say exclaimed summers minor with prominent eyes  but i was once a monk went on the other  i am what you would call an escaped monk yes i have escaped into eternity but the monks held one truth at least that the highest life should be without possessions i have no pocket money and no pockets and all the stars are my trinkets  they are out of reach anyhow observed colonel morris in a tone which suggested that it was well for them ive known a good many magicians myself in indiamango plant and all but the indian ones are all frauds ill swear in fact i had a good deal of fun showing them up more fun than i have over this dreary job anyhow but here comes mr symon who will show you over the old cellar downstairs  mr symon the official guardian and guide was a young man prematurely gray with a grave mouth which contrasted curiously with a very small dark mustache with waxed points that seemed somehow separate from it as if a black fly had settled on his face he spoke with the accent of oxford and the permanent official but in as dead a fashion as the most indifferent hired guide they descended a dark stone staircase at the floor of which symon pressed a button and a door opened on a dark room or rather a room which had an instant before been dark for almost as the heavy iron door swung open an almost blinding blaze of electric lights filled the whole interior the fitful enthusiasm of stinks at once caught fire and he eagerly asked if the lights and the door worked together  yes its all one system replied symon  it was all fitted up for the day his royal highness deposited the thing here you see its locked up behind a glass case exactly as he left it  a glance showed that the arrangements for guarding the treasure were indeed as strong as they were simple a single pane of glass cut off one corner of the room in an iron framework let into the rock walls and the wooden roof above there was now no possibility of reopening the case without elaborate labor except by breaking the glass which would probably arouse the night watchman who was always within a few feet of it even if he had fallen asleep a close examination would have showed many more ingenious safeguards but the eye of the rev thomas twyford at least was already riveted on what interested him much morethe dull silver disk which shone in the white light against a plain background of black velvet  st pauls penny said to commemorate the visit of st paul to britain was probably preserved in this chapel until the eighth century symon was saying in his clear but colorless voice in the ninth century it is supposed to have been carried away by the barbarians and it reappears after the conversion of the northern goths in the possession of the royal family of gothland his royal highness the duke of gothland retained it always in his own private custody and when he decided to exhibit it to the public placed it here with his own hand it was immediately sealed up in such a manner  unluckily at this point summers minor whose attention had somewhat strayed from the religious wars of the ninth century caught sight of a short length of wire appearing in a broken patch in the wall he precipitated himself at it calling out i say does that connect  it was evident that it did connect for no sooner had the boy given it a twitch than the whole room went black as if they had all been struck blind and an instant afterward they heard the dull crash of the closing door  well youve done it now said symon in his tranquil fashion then after a pause he added i suppose theyll miss us sooner or later and no doubt they can get it open but it may take some little time  there was a silence and then the unconquerable stinks observed  rotten that i had to leave my electric torch  i think said his uncle with restraint that we are sufficiently convinced of your interest in electricity  then after a pause he remarked more amiably  i suppose if i regretted any of my own impedimenta it would be the pipe though as a matter of fact its not much fun smoking in the dark everything seems different in the dark  everything is different in the dark said a third voice that of the man who called himself a magician it was a very musical voice and rather in contrast with his sinister and swarthy visage which was now invisible perhaps you dont know how terrible a truth that is all you see are pictures made by the sun faces and furniture and flowers and trees the things themselves may be quite strange to you something else may be standing now where you saw a table or a chair the face of your friend may be quite different in the dark  a short indescribable noise broke the stillness twyford started for a second and then said sharply  really i dont think its a suitable occasion for trying to frighten a child  whos a child cried the indignant summers with a voice that had a crow but also something of a crack in it and whos a funk either not me  i will be silent then said the other voice out of the darkness but silence also makes and unmakes  the required silence remained unbroken for a long time until at last the clergyman said to symon in a low voice  i suppose its all right about air  oh yes replied the other aloud theres a fireplace and a chimney in the office just by the door  a bound and the noise of a falling chair told them that the irrepressible rising generation had once more thrown itself across the room they heard the ejaculation a chimney why ill be and the rest was lost in muffled but exultant cries  the uncle called repeatedly and vainly groped his way at last to the opening and peering up it caught a glimpse of a disk of daylight which seemed to suggest that the fugitive had vanished in safety making his way back to the group by the glass case he fell over the fallen chair and took a moment to collect himself again he had opened his mouth to speak to symon when he stopped and suddenly found himself blinking in the full shock of the white light and looking over the other mans shoulder he saw that the door was standing open  so theyve got at us at last he observed to symon  the man in the black robe was leaning against the wall some yards away with a smile carved on his face  here comes colonel morris went on twyford still speaking to symon one of us will have to tell him how the light went out will you  but symon still said nothing he was standing as still as a statue and looking steadily at the black velvet behind the glass screen he was looking at the black velvet because there was nothing else to look at st pauls penny was gone  colonel morris entered the room with two new visitors presumably two new sightseers delayed by the accident the foremost was a tall fair rather languidlooking man with a bald brow and a highbridged nose his companion was a younger man with light curly hair and frank and even innocent eyes symon scarcely seemed to hear the newcomers it seemed almost as if he had not realized that the return of the light revealed his brooding attitude then he started in a guilty fashion and when he saw the elder of the two strangers his pale face seemed to turn a shade paler  why its horne fisher and then after a pause he said in a low voice im in the devil of a hole fisher  there does seem a bit of a mystery to be cleared up observed the gentleman so addressed  it will never be cleared up said the pale symon  if anybody could clear it up you could but nobody could  i rather think i could said another voice from outside the group and they turned in surprise to realize that the man in the black robe had spoken again  you said the colonel sharply  and how do you propose to play the detective  i do not propose to play the detective answered the other in a clear voice like a bell i propose to play the magician one of the magicians you show up in india colonel  no one spoke for a moment and then horne fisher surprised everybody by saying well lets go upstairs and this gentleman can have a try  he stopped symon who had an automatic finger on the button saying no leave all the lights on its a sort of safeguard  the thing cant be taken away now said symon bitterly  it can be put back replied fisher  twyford had already run upstairs for news of his vanishing nephew and he received news of him in a way that at once puzzled and reassured him on the floor above lay one of those large paper darts which boys throw at each other when the schoolmaster is out of the room it had evidently been thrown in at the window and on being unfolded displayed a scrawl of bad handwriting which ran dear uncle i am all right meet you at the hotel later on and then the signature  insensibly comforted by this the clergyman found his thoughts reverting voluntarily to his favorite relic which came a good second in his sympathies to his favorite nephew and before he knew where he was he found himself encircled by the group discussing its loss and more or less carried away on the current of their excitement but an undercurrent of query continued to run in his mind as to what had really happened to the boy and what was the boys exact definition of being all right  meanwhile horne fisher had considerably puzzled everybody with his new tone and attitude he had talked to the colonel about the military and mechanical arrangements and displayed a remarkable knowledge both of the details of discipline and the technicalities of electricity he had talked to the clergyman and shown an equally surprising knowledge of the religious and historical interests involved in the relic he had talked to the man who called himself a magician and not only surprised but scandalized the company by an equally sympathetic familiarity with the most fantastic forms of oriental occultism and psychic experiment and in this last and least respectable line of inquiry he was evidently prepared to go farthest he openly encouraged the magician and was plainly prepared to follow the wildest ways of investigation in which that magus might lead him  how would you begin now he inquired with an anxious politeness that reduced the colonel to a congestion of rage  it is all a question of a force of establishing communications for a force replied that adept affably ignoring some military mutterings about the police force it is what you in the west used to call animal magnetism but it is much more than that i had better not say how much more as to setting about it the usual method is to throw some susceptible person into a trance which serves as a sort of bridge or cord of communication by which the force beyond can give him as it were an electric shock and awaken his higher senses it opens the sleeping eye of the mind  im suspectible said fisher either with simplicity or with a baffling irony why not open my minds eye for me my friend harold march here will tell you i sometimes see things even in the dark  nobody sees anything except in the dark said the magician  heavy clouds of sunset were closing round the wooden hut enormous clouds of which only the corners could be seen in the little window like purple horns and tails almost as if some huge monsters were prowling round the place but the purple was already deepening to dark gray it would soon be night  do not light the lamp said the magus with quiet authority arresting a movement in that direction i told you before that things happen only in the dark  how such a topsyturvy scene ever came to be tolerated in the colonels office of all places was afterward a puzzle in the memory of many including the colonel they recalled it like a sort of nightmare like something they could not control perhaps there was really a magnetism about the mesmerist perhaps there was even more magnetism about the man mesmerized anyhow the man was being mesmerized for horne fisher had collapsed into a chair with his long limbs loose and sprawling and his eyes staring at vacancy and the other man was mesmerizing him making sweeping movements with his darkly draped arms as if with black wings the colonel had passed the point of explosion and he dimly realized that eccentric aristocrats are allowed their fling he comforted himself with the knowledge that he had already sent for the police who would break up any such masquerade and with lighting a cigar the red end of which in the gathering darkness glowed with protest  yes i see pockets the man in the trance was saying i see many pockets but they are all empty no i see one pocket that is not empty  there was a faint stir in the stillness and the magician said can you see what is in the pocket  yes answered the other there are two bright things i think they are two bits of steel one of the pieces of steel is bent or crooked  have they been used in the removal of the relic from downstairs  yes  there was another pause and the inquirer added do you see anything of the relic itself  i see something shining on the floor like the shadow or the ghost of it it is over there in the corner beyond the desk  there was a movement of men turning and then a sudden stillness as of their stiffening for over in the corner on the wooden floor there was really a round spot of pale light it was the only spot of light in the room the cigar had gone out  it points the way came the voice of the oracle the spirits are pointing the way to penitence and urging the thief to restitution i can see nothing more his voice trailed off into a silence that lasted solidly for many minutes like the long silence below when the theft had been committed then it was broken by the ring of metal on the floor and the sound of something spinning and falling like a tossed halfpenny  light the lamp cried fisher in a loud and even jovial voice leaping to his feet with far less languor than usual i must be going now but i should like to see it before i go why i came on purpose to see it  the lamp was lit and he did see it for st pauls penny was lying on the floor at his feet  oh as for that explained fisher when he was entertaining march and twyford at lunch about a month later i merely wanted to play with the magician at his own game  i thought you meant to catch him in his own trap said twyford i cant make head or tail of anything yet but to my mind he was always the suspect i dont think he was necessarily a thief in the vulgar sense the police always seem to think that silver is stolen for the sake of silver but a thing like that might well be stolen out of some religious mania a runaway monk turned mystic might well want it for some mystical purpose  no replied fisher the runaway monk is not a thief at any rate he is not the thief and hes not altogether a liar either he said one true thing at least that night  and what was that inquired march  he said it was all magnetism as a matter of fact it was done by means of a magnet then seeing they still looked puzzled he added it was that toy magnet belonging to your nephew mr twyford  but i dont understand objected march  if it was done with the schoolboys magnet i suppose it was done by the schoolboy  well replied fisher reflectively it rather depends which schoolboy  what on earth do you mean  the soul of a schoolboy is a curious thing fisher continued in a meditative manner it can survive a great many things besides climbing out of a chimney a man can grow gray in great campaigns and still have the soul of a schoolboy a man can return with a great reputation from india and be put in charge of a great public treasure and still have the soul of a schoolboy waiting to be awakened by an accident and it is ten times more so when to the schoolboy you add the skeptic who is generally a sort of stunted schoolboy you said just now that things might be done by religious mania have you ever heard of irreligious mania i assure you it exists very violently especially in men who like showing up magicians in india but here the skeptic had the temptation of showing up a much more tremendous sham nearer home  a light came into harold marchs eyes as he suddenly saw as if afar off the wider implication of the suggestion but twyford was still wrestling with one problem at a time  do you really mean he said that colonel morris took the relic  he was the only person who could use the magnet replied fisher in fact your obliging nephew left him a number of things he could use he had a ball of string and an instrument for making a hole in the wooden floori made a little play with that hole in the floor in my trance by the way with the lights left on below it shone like a new shilling twyford suddenly bounded on his chair but in that case he cried in a new and altered voice why then of course you said a piece of steel  i said there were two pieces of steel said fisher  the bent piece of steel was the boys magnet the other was the relic in the glass case  but that is silver answered the archaeologist in a voice now almost unrecognizable  oh replied fisher soothingly i dare say it was painted with silver a little  there was a heavy silence and at last harold march said but where is the real relic  where it has been for five years replied horne fisher in the possession of a mad millionaire named vandam in nebraska there was a playful little photograph about him in a society paper the other day mentioning his delusion and saying he was always being taken in about relics  harold march frowned at the tablecloth then after an interval he said i think i understand your notion of how the thing was actually done according to that morris just made a hole and fished it up with a magnet at the end of a string such a monkey trick looks like mere madness but i suppose he was mad partly with the boredom of watching over what he felt was a fraud though he couldnt prove it then came a chance to prove it to himself at least and he had what he called fun with it yes i think i see a lot of details now but its just the whole thing that knocks me how did it all come to be like that  fisher was looking at him with level lids and an immovable manner  every precaution was taken he said  the duke carried the relic on his own person and locked it up in the case with his own hands  march was silent but twyford stammered  i dont understand you you give me the creeps why dont you speak plainer  if i spoke plainer you would understand me less said horne fisher  all the same i should try said march still without lifting his head  oh very well replied fisher with a sigh the plain truth is of course that its a bad business everybody knows its a bad business who knows anything about it but its always happening and in one way one can hardly blame them they get stuck on to a foreign princess thats as stiff as a dutch doll and they have their fling in this case it was a pretty big fling  the face of the rev thomas twyford certainly suggested that he was a little out of his depth in the seas of truth but as the other went on speaking vaguely the old gentlemans features sharpened and set  if it were some decent morganatic affair i wouldnt say but he must have been a fool to throw away thousands on a woman like that at the end it was sheer blackmail but its something that the old ass didnt get it out of the taxpayers he could only get it out of the yank and there you are  the rev thomas twyford had risen to his feet  well im glad my nephew had nothing to do with it he said and if thats what the world is like i hope he will never have anything to do with it  i hope not answered horne fisher  no one knows so well as i do that one can have far too much to do with it  for summers minor had indeed nothing to do with it and it is part of his higher significance that he has really nothing to do with the story or with any such stories the boy went like a bullet through the tangle of this tale of crooked politics and crazy mockery and came out on the other side pursuing his own unspoiled purposes from the top of the chimney he climbed he had caught sight of a new omnibus whose color and name he had never known as a naturalist might see a new bird or a botanist a new flower and he had been sufficiently enraptured in rushing after it and riding away upon that fairy ship    iv the bottomless well  in an oasis or green island in the red and yellow seas of sand that stretch beyond europe toward the sunrise there can be found a rather fantastic contrast which is none the less typical of such a place since international treaties have made it an outpost of the british occupation the site is famous among archaeologists for something that is hardly a monument but merely a hole in the ground but it is a round shaft like that of a well and probably a part of some great irrigation works of remote and disputed date perhaps more ancient than anything in that ancient land there is a green fringe of palm and prickly pear round the black mouth of the well but nothing of the upper masonry remains except two bulky and battered stones standing like the pillars of a gateway of nowhere in which some of the more transcendental archaeologists in certain moods at moonrise or sunset think they can trace the faint lines of figures or features of more than babylonian monstrosity while the more rationalistic archaeologists in the more rational hours of daylight see nothing but two shapeless rocks it may have been noticed however that all englishmen are not archaeologists many of those assembled in such a place for official and military purposes have hobbies other than archaeology and it is a solemn fact that the english in this eastern exile have contrived to make a small golf links out of the green scrub and sand with a comfortable clubhouse at one end of it and this primeval monument at the other they did not actually use this archaic abyss as a bunker because it was by tradition unfathomable and even for practical purposes unfathomed any sporting projectile sent into it might be counted most literally as a lost ball but they often sauntered round it in their interludes of talking and smoking cigarettes and one of them had just come down from the clubhouse to find another gazing somewhat moodily into the well  both the englishmen wore light clothes and white pith helmets and puggrees but there for the most part their resemblance ended and they both almost simultaneously said the same word but they said it on two totally different notes of the voice  have you heard the news asked the man from the club  splendid  splendid replied the man by the well but the first man pronounced the word as a young man might say it about a woman and the second as an old man might say it about the weather not without sincerity but certainly without fervor  and in this the tone of the two men was sufficiently typical of them the first who was a certain captain boyle was of a bold and boyish type dark and with a sort of native heat in his face that did not belong to the atmosphere of the east but rather to the ardors and ambitions of the west the other was an older man and certainly an older resident a civilian officialhorne fisher and his drooping eyelids and drooping light mustache expressed all the paradox of the englishman in the east he was much too hot to be anything but cool  neither of them thought it necessary to mention what it was that was splendid that would indeed have been superfluous conversation about something that everybody knew the striking victory over a menacing combination of turks and arabs in the north won by troops under the command of lord hastings the veteran of so many striking victories was already spread by the newspapers all over the empire let alone to this small garrison so near to the battlefield  now no other nation in the world could have done a thing like that cried captain boyle emphatically  horne fisher was still looking silently into the well a moment later he answered we certainly have the art of unmaking mistakes thats where the poor old prussians went wrong they could only make mistakes and stick to them there is really a certain talent in unmaking a mistake  what do you mean asked boyle what mistakes  well everybody knows it looked like biting off more than he could chew replied horne fisher it was a peculiarity of mr fisher that he always said that everybody knew things which about one person in two million was ever allowed to hear of and it was certainly jolly lucky that travers turned up so well in the nick of time odd how often the right things been done for us by the second in command even when a great man was first in command like colborne at waterloo  it ought to add a whole province to the empire observed the other  well i suppose the zimmernes would have insisted on it as far as the canal observed fisher thoughtfully though everybody knows adding provinces doesnt always pay much nowadays  captain boyle frowned in a slightly puzzled fashion being cloudily conscious of never having heard of the zimmernes in his life he could only remark stolidly  well one cant be a little englander  horne fisher smiled and he had a pleasant smile  every man out here is a little englander he said he wishes he were back in little england  i dont know what youre talking about im afraid said the younger man rather suspiciously one would think you didnt really admire hastings ororanything  i admire him no end replied fisher  hes by far the best man for this post he understands the moslems and can do anything with them thats why im all against pushing travers against him merely because of this last affair  i really dont understand what youre driving at said the other frankly  perhaps it isnt worth understanding answered fisher lightly and anyhow we neednt talk politics do you know the arab legend about that well  im afraid i dont know much about arab legends said boyle rather stiffly  thats rather a mistake replied fisher especially from your point of view lord hastings himself is an arab legend that is perhaps the very greatest thing he really is if his reputation went it would weaken us all over asia and africa well the story about that hole in the ground that goes down nobody knows where has always fascinated me rather its mohammedan in form now but i shouldnt wonder if the tale is a long way older than mohammed its all about somebody they call the sultan aladdin not our friend of the lamp of course but rather like him in having to do with genii or giants or something of that sort they say he commanded the giants to build him a sort of pagoda rising higher and higher above all the stars the utmost for the highest as the people said when they built the tower of babel but the builders of the tower of babel were quite modest and domestic people like mice compared with old aladdin they only wanted a tower that would reach heaven a mere trifle he wanted a tower that would pass heaven and rise above it and go on rising for ever and ever and allah cast him down to earth with a thunderbolt which sank into the earth boring a hole deeper and deeper till it made a well that was without a bottom as the tower was to have been without a top and down that inverted tower of darkness the soul of the proud sultan is falling forever and ever  what a queer chap you are said boyle  you talk as if a fellow could believe those fables  perhaps i believe the moral and not the fable answered fisher but here comes lady hastings you know her i think  the clubhouse on the golf links was used of course for many other purposes besides that of golf it was the only social center of the garrison beside the strictly military headquarters it had a billiard room and a bar and even an excellent reference library for those officers who were so perverse as to take their profession seriously among these was the great general himself whose head of silver and face of bronze like that of a brazen eagle were often to be found bent over the charts and folios of the library the great lord hastings believed in science and study as in other severe ideals of life and had given much paternal advice on the point to young boyle whose appearances in that place of research were rather more intermittent it was from one of these snatches of study that the young man had just come out through the glass doors of the library on to the golf links but above all the club was so appointed as to serve the social conveniences of ladies at least as much as gentlemen and lady hastings was able to play the queen in such a society almost as much as in her own ballroom she was eminently calculated and as some said eminently inclined to play such a part she was much younger than her husband an attractive and sometimes dangerously attractive lady and mr horne fisher looked after her a little sardonically as she swept away with the young soldier then his rather dreary eye strayed to the green and prickly growths round the well growths of that curious cactus formation in which one thick leaf grows directly out of the other without stalk or twig it gave his fanciful mind a sinister feeling of a blind growth without shape or purpose a flower or shrub in the west grows to the blossom which is its crown and is content but this was as if hands could grow out of hands or legs grow out of legs in a nightmare always adding a province to the empire he said with a smile and then added more sadly but i doubt if i was right after all  a strong but genial voice broke in on his meditations and he looked up and smiled seeing the face of an old friend the voice was indeed rather more genial than the face which was at the first glance decidedly grim it was a typically legal face with angular jaws and heavy grizzled eyebrows and it belonged to an eminently legal character though he was now attached in a semimilitary capacity to the police of that wild district cuthbert grayne was perhaps more of a criminologist than either a lawyer or a policeman but in his more barbarous surroundings he had proved successful in turning himself into a practical combination of all three the discovery of a whole series of strange oriental crimes stood to his credit but as few people were acquainted with or attracted to such a hobby or branch of knowledge his intellectual life was somewhat solitary among the few exceptions was horne fisher who had a curious capacity for talking to almost anybody about almost anything  studying botany or is it archaeology inquired grayne  i shall never come to the end of your interests fisher i should say that what you dont know isnt worth knowing  you are wrong replied fisher with a very unusual abruptness and even bitterness its what i do know that isnt worth knowing all the seamy side of things all the secret reasons and rotten motives and bribery and blackmail they call politics i neednt be so proud of having been down all these sewers that i should brag about it to the little boys in the street  what do you mean  whats the matter with you asked his friend i never knew you taken like this before  im ashamed of myself replied fisher  ive just been throwing cold water on the enthusiasms of a boy  even that explanation is hardly exhaustive observed the criminal expert  damned newspaper nonsense the enthusiasms were of course continued fisher but i ought to know that at that age illusions can be ideals and theyre better than the reality anyhow but there is one very ugly responsibility about jolting a young man out of the rut of the most rotten ideal  and what may that be inquired his friend  its very apt to set him off with the same energy in a much worse direction answered fisher a pretty endless sort of direction a bottomless pit as deep as the bottomless well  fisher did not see his friend until a fortnight later when he found himself in the garden at the back of the clubhouse on the opposite side from the links a garden heavily colored and scented with sweet semitropical plants in the glow of a desert sunset two other men were with him the third being the now celebrated second in command familiar to everybody as tom travers a lean dark man who looked older than his years with a furrow in his brow and something morose about the very shape of his black mustache they had just been served with black coffee by the arab now officiating as the temporary servant of the club though he was a figure already familiar and even famous as the old servant of the general he went by the name of said and was notable among other semites for that unnatural length of his yellow face and height of his narrow forehead which is sometimes seen among them and gave an irrational impression of something sinister in spite of his agreeable smile  i never feel as if i could quite trust that fellow said grayne when the man had gone away its very unjust i take it for he was certainly devoted to hastings and saved his life they say but arabs are often like that loyal to one man i cant help feeling he might cut anybody elses throat and even do it treacherously  well said travers with a rather sour smile so long as he leaves hastings alone the world wont mind much  there was a rather embarrassing silence full of memories of the great battle and then horne fisher said quietly  the newspapers arent the world tom dont you worry about them everybody in your world knows the truth well enough  i think wed better not talk about the general just now remarked grayne for hes just coming out of the club  hes not coming here said fisher  hes only seeing his wife to the car  as he spoke indeed the lady came out on the steps of the club followed by her husband who then went swiftly in front of her to open the garden gate as he did so she turned back and spoke for a moment to a solitary man still sitting in a cane chair in the shadow of the doorway the only man left in the deserted club save for the three that lingered in the garden fisher peered for a moment into the shadow and saw that it was captain boyle  the next moment rather to their surprise the general reappeared and remounting the steps spoke a word or two to boyle in his turn then he signaled to said who hurried up with two cups of coffee and the two men reentered the club each carrying his cup in his hand the next moment a gleam of white light in the growing darkness showed that the electric lamps had been turned on in the library beyond  coffee and scientific researches said travers grimly all the luxuries of learning and theoretical research well i must be going for i have my work to do as well and he got up rather stiffly saluted his companions and strode away into the dusk  i only hope boyle is sticking to scientific researches said horne fisher im not very comfortable about him myself but lets talk about something else  they talked about something else longer than they probably imagined until the tropical night had come and a splendid moon painted the whole scene with silver but before it was bright enough to see by fisher had already noted that the lights in the library had been abruptly extinguished he waited for the two men to come out by the garden entrance but nobody came  they must have gone for a stroll on the links he said  very possibly replied grayne  its going to be a beautiful night  a moment or two after he had spoken they heard a voice hailing them out of the shadow of the clubhouse and were astonished to perceive travers hurrying toward them calling out as he came  i shall want your help you fellows he cried theres something pretty bad out on the links  they found themselves plunging through the club smoking room and the library beyond in complete darkness mental as well as material but horne fisher in spite of his affectation of indifference was a person of a curious and almost transcendental sensibility to atmospheres and he already felt the presence of something more than an accident he collided with a piece of furniture in the library and almost shuddered with the shock for the thing moved as he could never have fancied a piece of furniture moving it seemed to move like a living thing yielding and yet striking back the next moment grayne had turned on the lights and he saw he had only stumbled against one of the revolving bookstands that had swung round and struck him but his involuntary recoil had revealed to him his own subconscious sense of something mysterious and monstrous there were several of these revolving bookcases standing here and there about the library on one of them stood the two cups of coffee and on another a large open book it was budges book on egyptian hieroglyphics with colored plates of strange birds and gods and even as he rushed past he was conscious of something odd about the fact that this and not any work of military science should be open in that place at that moment he was even conscious of the gap in the welllined bookshelf from which it had been taken and it seemed almost to gape at him in an ugly fashion like a gap in the teeth of some sinister face  a run brought them in a few minutes to the other side of the ground in front of the bottomless well and a few yards from it in a moonlight almost as broad as daylight they saw what they had come to see  the great lord hastings lay prone on his face in a posture in which there was a touch of something strange and stiff with one elbow erect above his body the arm being doubled and his big bony hand clutching the rank and ragged grass a few feet away was boyle almost as motionless but supported on his hands and knees and staring at the body it might have been no more than shock and accident but there was something ungainly and unnatural about the quadrupedal posture and the gaping face it was as if his reason had fled from him behind there was nothing but the clear blue southern sky and the beginning of the desert except for the two great broken stones in front of the well and it was in such a light and atmosphere that men could fancy they traced in them enormous and evil faces looking down  horne fisher stooped and touched the strong hand that was still clutching the grass and it was as cold as a stone he knelt by the body and was busy for a moment applying other tests then he rose again and said with a sort of confident despair  lord hastings is dead  there was a stony silence and then travers remarked gruffly this is your department grayne i will leave you to question captain boyle i can make no sense of what he says  boyle had pulled himself together and risen to his feet but his face still wore an awful expression making it like a new mask or the face of another man  i was looking at the well he said and when i turned he had fallen down  graynes face was very dark  as you say this is my affair he said i must first ask you to help me carry him to the library and let me examine things thoroughly  when they had deposited the body in the library grayne turned to fisher and said in a voice that had recovered its fullness and confidence i am going to lock myself in and make a thorough examination first i look to you to keep in touch with the others and make a preliminary examination of boyle i will talk to him later and just telephone to headquarters for a policeman and let him come here at once and stand by till i want him  without more words the great criminal investigator went into the lighted library shutting the door behind him and fisher without replying turned and began to talk quietly to travers it is curious he said that the thing should happen just in front of that place  it would certainly be very curious replied travers if the place played any part in it  i think replied fisher that the part it didnt play is more curious still  and with these apparently meaningless words he turned to the shaken boyle and taking his arm began to walk him up and down in the moonlight talking in low tones  dawn had begun to break abrupt and white when cuthbert grayne turned out the lights in the library and came out on to the links fisher was lounging about alone in his listless fashion but the police messenger for whom he had sent was standing at attention in the background  i sent boyle off with travers observed fisher carelessly hell look after him and hed better have some sleep anyhow  did you get anything out of him asked grayne  did he tell you what he and hastings were doing  yes answered fisher he gave me a pretty clear account after all he said that after lady hastings went off in the car the general asked him to take coffee with him in the library and look up a point about local antiquities he himself was beginning to look for budges book in one of the revolving bookstands when the general found it in one of the bookshelves on the wall after looking at some of the plates they went out it would seem rather abruptly on to the links and walked toward the old well and while boyle was looking into it he heard a thud behind him and turned round to find the general lying as we found him he himself dropped on his knees to examine the body and then was paralyzed with a sort of terror and could not come nearer to it or touch it but i think very little of that people caught in a real shock of surprise are sometimes found in the queerest postures  grayne wore a grim smile of attention and said after a short silence  well he hasnt told you many lies its really a creditably clear and consistent account of what happened with everything of importance left out  have you discovered anything in there asked fisher  i have discovered everything answered grayne  fisher maintained a somewhat gloomy silence as the other resumed his explanation in quiet and assured tones  you were quite right fisher when you said that young fellow was in danger of going down dark ways toward the pit whether or no as you fancied the jolt you gave to his view of the general had anything to do with it he has not been treating the general well for some time its an unpleasant business and i dont want to dwell on it but its pretty plain that his wife was not treating him well either i dont know how far it went but it went as far as concealment anyhow for when lady hastings spoke to boyle it was to tell him she had hidden a note in the budge book in the library the general overheard or came somehow to know and he went straight to the book and found it he confronted boyle with it and they had a scene of course and boyle was confronted with something else he was confronted with an awful alternative in which the life of one old man meant ruin and his death meant triumph and even happiness  well observed fisher at last i dont blame him for not telling you the womans part of the story but how do you know about the letter  i found it on the generals body answered grayne but i found worse things than that the body had stiffened in the way rather peculiar to poisons of a certain asiatic sort then i examined the coffee cups and i knew enough chemistry to find poison in the dregs of one of them now the general went straight to the bookcase leaving his cup of coffee on the bookstand in the middle of the room while his back was turned and boyle was pretending to examine the bookstand he was left alone with the coffee cup the poison takes about ten minutes to act and ten minutes walk would bring them to the bottomless well  yes remarked fisher and what about the bottomless well  what has the bottomless well got to do with it asked his friend  it has nothing to do with it replied fisher  that is what i find utterly confounding and incredible  and why should that particular hole in the ground have anything to do with it  it is a particular hole in your case said fisher  but i wont insist on that just now by the way there is another thing i ought to tell you i said i sent boyle away in charge of travers it would be just as true to say i sent travers in charge of boyle  you dont mean to say you suspect tom travers cried the other  he was a deal bitterer against the general than boyle ever was observed horne fisher with a curious indifference  man youre not saying what you mean cried grayne  i tell you i found the poison in one of the coffee cups  there was always said of course added fisher either for hatred or hire we agreed he was capable of almost anything  and we agreed he was incapable of hurting his master retorted grayne  well well said fisher amiably i dare say you are right but i should just like to have a look at the library and the coffee cups  he passed inside while grayne turned to the policeman in attendance and handed him a scribbled note to be telegraphed from headquarters the man saluted and hurried off and grayne following his friend into the library found him beside the bookstand in the middle of the room on which were the empty cups  this is where boyle looked for budge or pretended to look for him according to your account he said  as fisher spoke he bent down in a halfcrouching attitude to look at the volumes in the low revolving shelf for the whole bookstand was not much higher than an ordinary table the next moment he sprang up as if he had been stung  oh my god he cried  very few people if any had ever seen mr horne fisher behave as he behaved just then he flashed a glance at the door saw that the open window was nearer went out of it with a flying leap as if over a hurdle and went racing across the turf in the track of the disappearing policeman grayne who stood staring after him soon saw his tall loose figure returning restored to all its normal limpness and air of leisure he was fanning himself slowly with a piece of paper the telegram he had so violently intercepted  lucky i stopped that he observed  we must keep this affair as quiet as death hastings must die of apoplexy or heart disease  what on earth is the trouble demanded the other investigator  the trouble is said fisher that in a few days we should have had a very agreeable alternativeof hanging an innocent man or knocking the british empire to hell  do you mean to say asked grayne that this infernal crime is not to be punished  fisher looked at him steadily  it is already punished he said  after a moments pause he went on  you reconstructed the crime with admirable skill old chap and nearly all you said was true two men with two coffee cups did go into the library and did put their cups on the bookstand and did go together to the well and one of them was a murderer and had put poison in the others cup but it was not done while boyle was looking at the revolving bookcase he did look at it though searching for the budge book with the note in it but i fancy that hastings had already moved it to the shelves on the wall it was part of that grim game that he should find it first  now how does a man search a revolving bookcase  he does not generally hop all round it in a squatting attitude like a frog he simply gives it a touch and makes it revolve  he was frowning at the floor as he spoke and there was a light under his heavy lids that was not often seen there the mysticism that was buried deep under all the cynicism of his experience was awake and moving in the depths his voice took unexpected turns and inflections almost as if two men were speaking  that was what boyle did he barely touched the thing and it went round as easily as the world goes round yes very much as the world goes round for the hand that turned it was not his god who turns the wheel of all the stars touched that wheel and brought it full circle that his dreadful justice might return  i am beginning said grayne slowly to have some hazy and horrible idea of what you mean  it is very simple said fisher when boyle straightened himself from his stooping posture something had happened which he had not noticed which his enemy had not noticed which nobody had noticed the two coffee cups had exactly changed places  the rocky face of grayne seemed to have sustained a shock in silence not a line of it altered but his voice when it came was unexpectedly weakened  i see what you mean he said and as you say the less said about it the better it was not the lover who tried to get rid of the husband butthe other thing and a tale like that about a man like that would ruin us here had you any guess of this at the start  the bottomless well as i told you answered fisher quietly that was what stumped me from the start not because it had anything to do with it because it had nothing to do with it  he paused a moment as if choosing an approach and then went on when a man knows his enemy will be dead in ten minutes and takes him to the edge of an unfathomable pit he means to throw his body into it what else should he do a born fool would have the sense to do it and boyle is not a born fool well why did not boyle do it the more i thought of it the more i suspected there was some mistake in the murder so to speak somebody had taken somebody there to throw him in and yet he was not thrown in i had already an ugly unformed idea of some substitution or reversal of parts then i stooped to turn the bookstand myself by accident and i instantly knew everything for i saw the two cups revolve once more like moons in the sky  after a pause cuthbert grayne said and what are we to say to the newspapers  my friend harold march is coming along from cairo today said fisher he is a very brilliant and successful journalist but for all that hes a thoroughly honorable man so you must not tell him the truth  half an hour later fisher was again walking to and fro in front of the clubhouse with captain boyle the latter by this time with a very buffeted and bewildered air perhaps a sadder and a wiser man  what about me then he was saying  am i cleared am i not going to be cleared  i believe and hope answered fisher that you are not going to be suspected but you are certainly not going to be cleared there must be no suspicion against him and therefore no suspicion against you any suspicion against him let alone such a story against him would knock us endways from malta to mandalay he was a hero as well as a holy terror among the moslems indeed you might almost call him a moslem hero in the english service of course he got on with them partly because of his own little dose of eastern blood he got it from his mother the dancer from damascus everybody knows that  oh repeated boyle mechanically staring at him with round eyes everybody knows that  i dare say there was a touch of it in his jealousy and ferocious vengeance went on fisher but for all that the crime would ruin us among the arabs all the more because it was something like a crime against hospitality its been hateful for you and its pretty horrid for me but there are some things that damned well cant be done and while im alive thats one of them  what do you mean asked boyle glancing at him curiously why should you of all people be so passionate about it  horne fisher looked at the young man with a baffling expression  i suppose he said its because im a little englander  i can never make out what you mean by that sort of thing answered boyle doubtfully  do you think england is so little as all that said fisher with a warmth in his cold voice that it cant hold a man across a few thousand miles you lectured me with a lot of ideal patriotism my young friend but its practical patriotism now for you and me and with no lies to help it you talked as if everything always went right with us all over the world in a triumphant crescendo culminating in hastings i tell you everything has gone wrong with us here except hastings he was the one name we had left to conjure with and that mustnt go as well no by god its bad enough that a gang of infernal jews should plant us here where theres no earthly english interest to serve and all hell beating up against us simply because nosey zimmern has lent money to half the cabinet its bad enough that an old pawnbroker from bagdad should make us fight his battles we cant fight with our right hand cut off our one score was hastings and his victory which was really somebody elses victory tom travers has to suffer and so have you  then after a moments silence he pointed toward the bottomless well and said in a quieter tone  i told you that i didnt believe in the philosophy of the tower of aladdin i dont believe in the empire growing until it reaches the sky i dont believe in the union jack going up and up eternally like the tower but if you think i am going to let the union jack go down and down eternally like the bottomless well down into the blackness of the bottomless pit down in defeat and derision amid the jeers of the very jews who have sucked us dryno i wont and thats flat not if the chancellor were blackmailed by twenty millionaires with their gutter rags not if the prime minister married twenty yankee jewesses not if woodville and carstairs had shares in twenty swindling mines if the thing is really tottering god help it it mustnt be we who tip it over  boyle was regarding him with a bewilderment that was almost fear and had even a touch of distaste  somehow he said there seems to be something rather horrid about the things you know  there is replied horne fisher  i am not at all pleased with my small stock of knowledge and reflection but as it is partly responsible for your not being hanged i dont know that you need complain of it  and as if a little ashamed of his first boast he turned and strolled away toward the bottomless well    v the fad of the fisherman  a thing can sometimes be too extraordinary to be remembered if it is clean out of the course of things and has apparently no causes and no consequences subsequent events do not recall it and it remains only a subconscious thing to be stirred by some accident long after it drifts apart like a forgotten dream and it was in the hour of many dreams at daybreak and very soon after the end of dark that such a strange sight was given to a man sculling a boat down a river in the west country the man was awake indeed he considered himself rather wide awake being the political journalist harold march on his way to interview various political celebrities in their country seats but the thing he saw was so inconsequent that it might have been imaginary it simply slipped past his mind and was lost in later and utterly different events nor did he even recover the memory till he had long afterward discovered the meaning  pale mists of morning lay on the fields and the rushes along one margin of the river along the other side ran a wall of tawny brick almost overhanging the water he had shipped his oars and was drifting for a moment with the stream when he turned his head and saw that the monotony of the long brick wall was broken by a bridge rather an elegant eighteenthcentury sort of bridge with little columns of white stone turning gray there had been floods and the river still stood very high with dwarfish trees waist deep in it and rather a narrow arc of white dawn gleamed under the curve of the bridge  as his own boat went under the dark archway he saw another boat coming toward him rowed by a man as solitary as himself his posture prevented much being seen of him but as he neared the bridge he stood up in the boat and turned round he was already so close to the dark entry however that his whole figure was black against the morning light and march could see nothing of his face except the end of two long whiskers or mustaches that gave something sinister to the silhouette like horns in the wrong place even these details march would never have noticed but for what happened in the same instant as the man came under the low bridge he made a leap at it and hung with his legs dangling letting the boat float away from under him march had a momentary vision of two black kicking legs then of one black kicking leg and then of nothing except the eddying stream and the long perspective of the wall but whenever he thought of it again long afterward when he understood the story in which it figured it was always fixed in that one fantastic shapeas if those wild legs were a grotesque graven ornament of the bridge itself in the manner of a gargoyle at the moment he merely passed staring down the stream he could see no flying figure on the bridge so it must have already fled but he was half conscious of some faint significance in the fact that among the trees round the bridgehead opposite the wall he saw a lamppost and beside the lamppost the broad blue back of an unconscious policeman  even before reaching the shrine of his political pilgrimage he had many other things to think of besides the odd incident of the bridge for the management of a boat by a solitary man was not always easy even on such a solitary stream and indeed it was only by an unforeseen accident that he was solitary the boat had been purchased and the whole expedition planned in conjunction with a friend who had at the last moment been forced to alter all his arrangements harold march was to have traveled with his friend horne fisher on that inland voyage to willowood place where the prime minister was a guest at the moment more and more people were hearing of harold march for his striking political articles were opening to him the doors of larger and larger salons but he had never met the prime minister yet scarcely anybody among the general public had ever heard of horne fisher but he had known the prime minister all his life for these reasons had the two taken the projected journey together march might have been slightly disposed to hasten it and fisher vaguely content to lengthen it out for fisher was one of those people who are born knowing the prime minister the knowledge seemed to have no very exhilarant effect and in his case bore some resemblance to being born tired but he was distinctly annoyed to receive just as he was doing a little light packing of fishing tackle and cigars for the journey a telegram from willowood asking him to come down at once by train as the prime minister had to leave that night fisher knew that his friend the journalist could not possibly start till the next day and he liked his friend the journalist and had looked forward to a few days on the river he did not particularly like or dislike the prime minister but he intensely disliked the alternative of a few hours in the train nevertheless he accepted prime ministers as he accepted railway trainsas part of a system which he at least was not the revolutionist sent on earth to destroy so he telephoned to march asking him with many apologetic curses and faint damns to take the boat down the river as arranged that they might meet at willowood by the time settled then he went outside and hailed a taxicab to take him to the railway station there he paused at the bookstall to add to his light luggage a number of cheap murder stories which he read with great pleasure and without any premonition that he was about to walk into as strange a story in real life  a little before sunset he arrived with his light suitcase in hand before the gate of the long riverside gardens of willowood place one of the smaller seats of sir isaac hook the master of much shipping and many newspapers he entered by the gate giving on the road at the opposite side to the river but there was a mixed quality in all that watery landscape which perpetually reminded a traveler that the river was near white gleams of water would shine suddenly like swords or spears in the green thickets and even in the garden itself divided into courts and curtained with hedges and high garden trees there hung everywhere in the air the music of water the first of the green courts which he entered appeared to be a somewhat neglected croquet lawn in which was a solitary young man playing croquet against himself yet he was not an enthusiast for the game or even for the garden and his sallow but wellfeatured face looked rather sullen than otherwise he was only one of those young men who cannot support the burden of consciousness unless they are doing something and whose conceptions of doing something are limited to a game of some kind he was dark and well dressed in a light holiday fashion and fisher recognized him at once as a young man named james bullen called for some unknown reason bunker he was the nephew of sir isaac but what was much more important at the moment he was also the private secretary of the prime minister  hullo bunker observed horne fisher  youre the sort of man i wanted to see has your chief come down yet  hes only staying for dinner replied bullen with his eye on the yellow ball hes got a great speech tomorrow at birmingham and hes going straight through tonight hes motoring himself there driving the car i mean its the one thing hes really proud of  you mean youre staying here with your uncle like a good boy replied fisher but what will the chief do at birmingham without the epigrams whispered to him by his brilliant secretary  dont you start ragging me said the young man called bunker im only too glad not to go trailing after him he doesnt know a thing about maps or money or hotels or anything and i have to dance about like a courier as for my uncle as im supposed to come into the estate its only decent to be here sometimes  very proper replied the other  well i shall see you later on and crossing the lawn he passed out through a gap in the hedge  he was walking across the lawn toward the landing stage on the river and still felt all around him under the dome of golden evening an old world savor and reverberation in that riverhaunted garden the next square of turf which he crossed seemed at first sight quite deserted till he saw in the twilight of trees in one corner of it a hammock and in the hammock a man reading a newspaper and swinging one leg over the edge of the net  him also he hailed by name and the man slipped to the ground and strolled forward it seemed fated that he should feel something of the past in the accidents of that place for the figure might well have been an earlyvictorian ghost revisiting the ghosts of the croquet hoops and mallets it was the figure of an elderly man with long whiskers that looked almost fantastic and a quaint and careful cut of collar and cravat having been a fashionable dandy forty years ago he had managed to preserve the dandyism while ignoring the fashions a white tophat lay beside the morning post in the hammock behind him this was the duke of westmoreland the relic of a family really some centuries old and the antiquity was not heraldry but history nobody knew better than fisher how rare such noblemen are in fact and how numerous in fiction but whether the duke owed the general respect he enjoyed to the genuineness of his pedigree or to the fact that he owned a vast amount of very valuable property was a point about which mr fishers opinion might have been more interesting to discover  you were looking so comfortable said fisher that i thought you must be one of the servants im looking for somebody to take this bag of mine i havent brought a man down as i came away in a hurry  nor have i for that matter replied the duke with some pride i never do if theres one animal alive i loathe its a valet i learned to dress myself at an early age and was supposed to do it decently i may be in my second childhood but ive not go so far as being dressed like a child  the prime minister hasnt brought a valet hes brought a secretary instead observed fisher devilish inferior job didnt i hear that harker was down here  hes over there on the landing stage replied the duke indifferently and resumed the study of the morning post  fisher made his way beyond the last green wall of the garden on to a sort of towing path looking on the river and a wooden island opposite there indeed he saw a lean dark figure with a stoop almost like that of a vulture a posture well known in the law courts as that of sir john harker the attorneygeneral his face was lined with headwork for alone among the three idlers in the garden he was a man who had made his own way and round his bald brow and hollow temples clung dull red hair quite flat like plates of copper  i havent seen my host yet said horne fisher in a slightly more serious tone than he had used to the others but i suppose i shall meet him at dinner  you can see him now but you cant meet him answered harker  he nodded his head toward one end of the island opposite and looking steadily in the same direction the other guest could see the dome of a bald head and the top of a fishing rod both equally motionless rising out of the tall undergrowth against the background of the stream beyond the fisherman seemed to be seated against the stump of a tree and facing toward the other bank so that his face could not be seen but the shape of his head was unmistakable  he doesnt like to be disturbed when hes fishing continued harker its a sort of fad of his to eat nothing but fish and hes very proud of catching his own of course hes all for simplicity like so many of these millionaires he likes to come in saying hes worked for his daily bread like a laborer  does he explain how he blows all the glass and stuffs all the upholstery asked fisher and makes all the silver forks and grows all the grapes and peaches and designs all the patterns on the carpets ive always heard he was a busy man  i dont think he mentioned it answered the lawyer what is the meaning of this social satire  well i am a trifle tired said fisher of the simple life and the strenuous life as lived by our little set were all really dependent in nearly everything and we all make a fuss about being independent in something the prime minister prides himself on doing without a chauffeur but he cant do without a factotum and jackofalltrades and poor old bunker has to play the part of a universal genius which god knows he was never meant for the duke prides himself on doing without a valet but for all that he must give a lot of people an infernal lot of trouble to collect such extraordinary old clothes as he wears he must have them looked up in the british museum or excavated out of the tombs that white hat alone must require a sort of expedition fitted out to find it like the north pole and here we have old hook pretending to produce his own fish when he couldnt produce his own fish knives or fish forks to eat it with he may be simple about simple things like food but you bet hes luxurious about luxurious things especially little things i dont include you youve worked too hard to enjoy playing at work  i sometimes think said harker that you conceal a horrid secret of being useful sometimes havent you come down here to see number one before he goes on to birmingham  horne fisher answered in a lower voice  yes and i hope to be lucky enough to catch him before dinner hes got to see sir isaac about something just afterward  hullo exclaimed harker  sir isaacs finished his fishing i know he prides himself on getting up at sunrise and going in at sunset  the old man on the island had indeed risen to his feet facing round and showing a bush of gray beard with rather small sunken features but fierce eyebrows and keen choleric eyes carefully carrying his fishing tackle he was already making his way back to the mainland across a bridge of flat steppingstones a little way down the shallow stream then he veered round coming toward his guests and civilly saluting them there were several fish in his basket and he was in a good temper  yes he said acknowledging fishers polite expression of surprise i get up before anybody else in the house i think the early bird catches the worm  unfortunately said harker it is the early fish that catches the worm  but the early man catches the fish replied the old man gruffly  but from what i hear sir isaac you are the late man too interposed fisher you must do with very little sleep  i never had much time for sleeping answered hook and i shall have to be the late man tonight anyhow the prime minister wants to have a talk he tells me and all things considered i think wed better be dressing for dinner  dinner passed off that evening without a word of politics and little enough but ceremonial trifles the prime minister lord merivale who was a long slim man with curly gray hair was gravely complimentary to his host about his success as a fisherman and the skill and patience he displayed the conversation flowed like the shallow stream through the steppingstones  it wants patience to wait for them no doubt said sir isaac and skill to play them but im generally pretty lucky at it  does a big fish ever break the line and get away inquired the politician with respectful interest  not the sort of line i use answered hook with satisfaction i rather specialize in tackle as a matter of fact if he were strong enough to do that hed be strong enough to pull me into the river  a great loss to the community said the prime minister bowing  fisher had listened to all these futilities with inward impatience waiting for his own opportunity and when the host rose he sprang to his feet with an alertness he rarely showed he managed to catch lord merivale before sir isaac bore him off for the final interview he had only a few words to say but he wanted to get them said  he said in a low voice as he opened the door for the premier i have seen montmirail he says that unless we protest immediately on behalf of denmark sweden will certainly seize the ports  lord merivale nodded  im just going to hear what hook has to say about it he said  i imagine said fisher with a faint smile that there is very little doubt what he will say about it  merivale did not answer but lounged gracefully toward the library whither his host had already preceded him the rest drifted toward the billiard room fisher merely remarking to the lawyer they wont be long we know theyre practically in agreement  hook entirely supports the prime minister assented harker  or the prime minister entirely supports hook said horne fisher and began idly to knock the balls about on the billiard table  horne fisher came down next morning in a late and leisurely fashion as was his reprehensible habit he had evidently no appetite for catching worms but the other guests seemed to have felt a similar indifference and they helped themselves to breakfast from the sideboard at intervals during the hours verging upon lunch so that it was not many hours later when the first sensation of that strange day came upon them it came in the form of a young man with light hair and a candid expression who came sculling down the river and disembarked at the landing stage it was in fact no other than mr harold march whose journey had begun far away up the river in the earliest hours of that day he arrived late in the afternoon having stopped for tea in a large riverside town and he had a pink evening paper sticking out of his pocket he fell on the riverside garden like a quiet and wellbehaved thunderbolt but he was a thunderbolt without knowing it  the first exchange of salutations and introductions was commonplace enough and consisted indeed of the inevitable repetition of excuses for the eccentric seclusion of the host he had gone fishing again of course and must not be disturbed till the appointed hour though he sat within a stones throw of where they stood  you see its his only hobby observed harker apologetically and after all its his own house and hes very hospitable in other ways  im rather afraid said fisher in a lower voice that its becoming more of a mania than a hobby i know how it is when a man of that age begins to collect things if its only collecting those rotten little river fish you remember talbots uncle with his toothpicks and poor old buzzy and the waste of cigar ashes hook has done a lot of big things in his timethe great deal in the swedish timber trade and the peace conference at chicagobut i doubt whether he cares now for any of those big things as he cares for those little fish  oh come come protested the attorneygeneral youll make mr march think he has come to call on a lunatic believe me hook only does it for fun like any other sport only hes of the kind that takes his fun sadly but i bet if there were big news about timber or shipping he would drop his fun and his fish all right  well i wonder said horne fisher looking sleepily at the island in the river  by the way is there any news of anything asked harker of harold march i see youve got an evening paper one of those enterprising evening papers that come out in the morning  the beginning of lord merivales birmingham speech replied march handing him the paper its only a paragraph but it seems to me rather good  harker took the paper flapped and refolded it and looked at the stop press news it was as march had said only a paragraph but it was a paragraph that had a peculiar effect on sir john harker his lowering brows lifted with a flicker and his eyes blinked and for a moment his leathery jaw was loosened he looked in some odd fashion like a very old man then hardening his voice and handing the paper to fisher without a tremor he simply said  well heres a chance for the bet youve got your big news to disturb the old mans fishing  horne fisher was looking at the paper and over his more languid and less expressive features a change also seemed to pass even that little paragraph had two or three large headlines and his eye encountered sensational warning to sweden and we shall protest  what the devil he said and his words softened first to a whisper and then a whistle  we must tell old hook at once or hell never forgive us said harker hell probably want to see number one instantly though it may be too late now im going across to him at once i bet ill make him forget his fish anyhow and turning his back he made his way hurriedly along the riverside to the causeway of flat stones  march was staring at fisher in amazement at the effect his pink paper had produced  what does it all mean he cried  i always supposed we should protest in defense of the danish ports for their sakes and our own what is all this botheration about sir isaac and the rest of you do you think it bad news  bad news repeated fisher with a sort of soft emphasis beyond expression  is it as bad as all that asked his friend at last  as bad as all that repeated fisher  why of course its as good as it can be its great news its glorious news thats where the devil of it comes in to knock us all silly its admirable its inestimable it is also quite incredible  he gazed again at the gray and green colors of the island and the river and his rather dreary eye traveled slowly round to the hedges and the lawns  i felt this garden was a sort of dream he said and i suppose i must be dreaming but there is grass growing and water moving and something impossible has happened  even as he spoke the dark figure with a stoop like a vulture appeared in the gap of the hedge just above him  you have won your bet said harker in a harsh and almost croaking voice the old fool cares for nothing but fishing he cursed me and told me he would talk no politics  i thought it might be so said fisher modestly  what are you going to do next  i shall use the old idiots telephone anyhow replied the lawyer i must find out exactly what has happened ive got to speak for the government myself tomorrow and he hurried away toward the house  in the silence that followed a very bewildering silence so far as march was concerned they saw the quaint figure of the duke of westmoreland with his white hat and whiskers approaching them across the garden fisher instantly stepped toward him with the pink paper in his hand and with a few words pointed out the apocalyptic paragraph the duke who had been walking slowly stood quite still and for some seconds he looked like a tailors dummy standing and staring outside some antiquated shop then march heard his voice and it was high and almost hysterical  but he must see it he must be made to understand it cannot have been put to him properly then with a certain recovery of fullness and even pomposity in the voice i shall go and tell him myself  among the queer incidents of that afternoon march always remembered something almost comical about the clear picture of the old gentleman in his wonderful white hat carefully stepping from stone to stone across the river like a figure crossing the traffic in piccadilly then he disappeared behind the trees of the island and march and fisher turned to meet the attorneygeneral who was coming out of the house with a visage of grim assurance  everybody is saying he said that the prime minister has made the greatest speech of his life peroration and loud and prolonged cheers corrupt financiers and heroic peasants we will not desert denmark again  fisher nodded and turned away toward the towing path where he saw the duke returning with a rather dazed expression in answer to questions he said in a husky and confidential voice  i really think our poor friend cannot be himself he refused to listen heahsuggested that i might frighten the fish  a keen ear might have detected a murmur from mr fisher on the subject of a white hat but sir john harker struck it more decisively  fisher was quite right i didnt believe it myself but its quite clear that the old fellow is fixed on this fishing notion by now if the house caught fire behind him he would hardly move till sunset  fisher had continued his stroll toward the higher embanked ground of the towing path and he now swept a long and searching gaze not toward the island but toward the distant wooded heights that were the walls of the valley an evening sky as clear as that of the previous day was settling down all over the dim landscape but toward the west it was now red rather than gold there was scarcely any sound but the monotonous music of the river then came the sound of a halfstifled exclamation from horne fisher and harold march looked up at him in wonder  you spoke of bad news said fisher  well there is really bad news now i am afraid this is a bad business  what bad news do you mean asked his friend conscious of something strange and sinister in his voice  the sun has set answered fisher  he went on with the air of one conscious of having said something fatal we must get somebody to go across whom he will really listen to he may be mad but theres method in his madness there nearly always is method in madness its what drives men mad being methodical and he never goes on sitting there after sunset with the whole place getting dark wheres his nephew i believe hes really fond of his nephew  look cried march abruptly  why hes been across already there he is coming back  and looking up the river once more they saw dark against the sunset reflections the figure of james bullen stepping hastily and rather clumsily from stone to stone once he slipped on a stone with a slight splash when he rejoined the group on the bank his olive face was unnaturally pale  the other four men had already gathered on the same spot and almost simultaneously were calling out to him what does he say now  nothing he saysnothing  fisher looked at the young man steadily for a moment then he started from his immobility and making a motion to march to follow him himself strode down to the river crossing in a few moments they were on the little beaten track that ran round the wooded island to the other side of it where the fisherman sat then they stood and looked at him without a word  sir isaac hook was still sitting propped up against the stump of the tree and that for the best of reasons a length of his own infallible fishing line was twisted and tightened twice round his throat and then twice round the wooden prop behind him the leading investigator ran forward and touched the fishermans hand and it was as cold as a fish  the sun has set said horne fisher in the same terrible tones and he will never see it rise again  ten minutes afterward the five men shaken by such a shock were again together in the garden looking at one another with white but watchful faces the lawyer seemed the most alert of the group he was articulate if somewhat abrupt  we must leave the body as it is and telephone for the police he said i think my own authority will stretch to examining the servants and the poor fellows papers to see if there is anything that concerns them of course none of you gentlemen must leave this place  perhaps there was something in his rapid and rigorous legality that suggested the closing of a net or trap anyhow young bullen suddenly broke down or perhaps blew up for his voice was like an explosion in the silent garden  i never touched him he cried  i swear i had nothing to do with it  who said you had demanded harker with a hard eye why do you cry out before youre hurt  because you all look at me like that cried the young man angrily do you think i dont know youre always talking about my damned debts and expectations  rather to marchs surprise fisher had drawn away from this first collision leading the duke with him to another part of the garden when he was out of earshot of the others he said with a curious simplicity of manner  westmoreland i am going straight to the point  well said the other staring at him stolidly  you have a motive for killing him said fisher  the duke continued to stare but he seemed unable to speak  i hope you had a motive for killing him continued fisher mildly you see its rather a curious situation if you have a motive for murdering you probably didnt murder but if you hadnt any motive why then perhaps you did  what on earth are you talking about demanded the duke violently  its quite simple said fisher  when you went across he was either alive or dead if he was alive it might be you who killed him or why should you have held your tongue about his death but if he was dead and you had a reason for killing him you might have held your tongue for fear of being accused then after a silence he added abstractedly cyprus is a beautiful place i believe romantic scenery and romantic people very intoxicating for a young man  the duke suddenly clenched his hands and said thickly well i had a motive  then youre all right said fisher holding out his hand with an air of huge relief i was pretty sure you wouldnt really do it you had a fright when you saw it done as was only natural like a bad dream come true wasnt it  while this curious conversation was passing harker had gone into the house disregarding the demonstrations of the sulky nephew and came back presently with a new air of animation and a sheaf of papers in his hand  ive telephoned for the police he said stopping to speak to fisher but i think ive done most of their work for them i believe ive found out the truth theres a paper here he stopped for fisher was looking at him with a singular expression and it was fisher who spoke next  are there any papers that are not there i wonder i mean that are not there now after a pause he added let us have the cards on the table when you went through his papers in such a hurry harker werent you looking for something toto make sure it shouldnt be found  harker did not turn a red hair on his hard head but he looked at the other out of the corners of his eyes  and i suppose went on fisher smoothly that is why you too told us lies about having found hook alive you knew there was something to show that you might have killed him and you didnt dare tell us he was killed but believe me its much better to be honest now  harkers haggard face suddenly lit up as if with infernal flames  honest he cried its not so damned fine of you fellows to be honest youre all born with silver spoons in your mouths and then you swagger about with everlasting virtue because you havent got other peoples spoons in your pockets but i was born in a pimlico lodging house and i had to make my spoon and thered be plenty to say i only spoiled a horn or an honest man and if a struggling man staggers a bit over the line in his youth in the lower parts of the law which are pretty dingy anyhow theres always some old vampire to hang on to him all his life for it  guatemalan golcondas wasnt it said fisher sympathetically  harker suddenly shuddered then he said i believe you must know everything like god almighty  i know too much said horne fisher and all the wrong things  the other three men were drawing nearer to them but before they came too near harker said in a voice that had recovered all its firmness  yes i did destroy a paper but i really did find a paper too and i believe that it clears us all  very well said fisher in a louder and more cheerful tone let us all have the benefit of it  on the very top of sir isaacs papers explained harker there was a threatening letter from a man named hugo it threatens to kill our unfortunate friend very much in the way that he was actually killed it is a wild letter full of taunts you can see it for yourselves but it makes a particular point of poor hooks habit of fishing from the island above all the man professes to be writing from a boat and since we alone went across to him and he smiled in a rather ugly fashion the crime must have been committed by a man passing in a boat  why dear me cried the duke with something almost amounting to animation why i remember the man called hugo quite well he was a sort of body servant and bodyguard of sir isaac you see sir isaac was in some fear of assault he washe was not very popular with several people hugo was discharged after some row or other but i remember him well he was a great big hungarian fellow with great mustaches that stood out on each side of his face  a door opened in the darkness of harold marchs memory or rather oblivion and showed a shining landscape like that of a lost dream it was rather a waterscape than a landscape a thing of flooded meadows and low trees and the dark archway of a bridge and for one instant he saw again the man with mustaches like dark horns leap up on to the bridge and disappear  good heavens he cried  why i met the murderer this morning                          horne fisher and harold march had their day on the river after all for the little group broke up when the police arrived they declared that the coincidence of marchs evidence had cleared the whole company and clinched the case against the flying hugo whether that hungarian fugitive would ever be caught appeared to horne fisher to be highly doubtful nor can it be pretended that he displayed any very demoniac detective energy in the matter as he leaned back in the boat cushions smoking and watching the swaying reeds slide past  it was a very good notion to hop up on to the bridge he said an empty boat means very little he hasnt been seen to land on either bank and hes walked off the bridge without walking on to it so to speak hes got twentyfour hours start his mustaches will disappear and then he will disappear i think there is every hope of his escape  hope repeated march and stopped sculling for an instant  yes hope repeated the other  to begin with im not going to be exactly consumed with corsican revenge because somebody has killed hook perhaps you may guess by this time what hook was a damned bloodsucking blackmailer was that simple strenuous selfmade captain of industry he had secrets against nearly everybody one against poor old westmoreland about an early marriage in cyprus that might have put the duchess in a queer position and one against harker about some flutter with his clients money when he was a young solicitor thats why they went to pieces when they found him murdered of course they felt as if theyd done it in a dream but i admit i have another reason for not wanting our hungarian friend actually hanged for the murder  and what is that asked his friend  only that he didnt commit the murder answered fisher  harold march laid down the oars and let the boat drift for a moment  do you know i was half expecting something like that he said it was quite irrational but it was hanging about in the atmosphere like thunder in the air  on the contrary its finding hugo guilty thats irrational replied fisher dont you see that theyre condemning him for the very reason for which they acquit everybody else harker and westmoreland were silent because they found him murdered and knew there were papers that made them look like the murderers well so did hugo find him murdered and so did hugo know there was a paper that would make him look like the murderer he had written it himself the day before  but in that case said march frowning at what sort of unearthly hour in the morning was the murder really committed it was barely daylight when i met him at the bridge and thats some way above the island  the answer is very simple replied fisher  the crime was not committed in the morning the crime was not committed on the island  march stared at the shining water without replying but fisher resumed like one who had been asked a question  every intelligent murder involves taking advantage of some one uncommon feature in a common situation the feature here was the fancy of old hook for being the first man up every morning his fixed routine as an angler and his annoyance at being disturbed the murderer strangled him in his own house after dinner on the night before carried his corpse with all his fishing tackle across the stream in the dead of night tied him to the tree and left him there under the stars it was a dead man who sat fishing there all day then the murderer went back to the house or rather to the garage and went off in his motor car the murderer drove his own motor car  fisher glanced at his friends face and went on  you look horrified and the thing is horrible but other things are horrible too if some obscure man had been hagridden by a blackmailer and had his family life ruined you wouldnt think the murder of his persecutor the most inexcusable of murders is it any worse when a whole great nation is set free as well as a family by this warning to sweden we shall probably prevent war and not precipitate it and save many thousand lives rather more valuable than the life of that viper oh im not talking sophistry or seriously justifying the thing but the slavery that held him and his country was a thousand times less justifiable if id really been sharp i should have guessed it from his smooth deadly smiling at dinner that night do you remember that silly talk about how old isaac could always play his fish in a pretty hellish sense he was a fisher of men  harold march took the oars and began to row again  i remember he said and about how a big fish might break the line and get away    vi the hole in the wall  two men the one an architect and the other an archaeologist met on the steps of the great house at priors park and their host lord bulmer in his breezy way thought it natural to introduce them it must be confessed that he was hazy as well as breezy and had no very clear connection in his mind beyond the sense that an architect and an archaeologist begin with the same series of letters the world must remain in a reverent doubt as to whether he would on the same principles have presented a diplomatist to a dipsomaniac or a ratiocinator to a rat catcher he was a big fair bullnecked young man abounding in outward gestures unconsciously flapping his gloves and flourishing his stick  you two ought to have something to talk about he said cheerfully old buildings and all that sort of thing this is rather an old building by the way though i say it who shouldnt i must ask you to excuse me a moment ive got to go and see about the cards for this christmas romp my sisters arranging we hope to see you all there of course juliet wants it to be a fancydress affairabbots and crusaders and all that my ancestors i suppose after all  i trust the abbot was not an ancestor said the archaeological gentleman with a smile  only a sort of greatuncle i imagine answered the other laughing then his rather rambling eye rolled round the ordered landscape in front of the house an artificial sheet of water ornamented with an antiquated nymph in the center and surrounded by a park of tall trees now gray and black and frosty for it was in the depth of a severe winter  its getting jolly cold his lordship continued my sister hopes we shall have some skating as well as dancing  if the crusaders come in full armor said the other you must be careful not to drown your ancestors  oh theres no fear of that answered bulmer this precious lake of ours is not two feet deep anywhere and with one of his flourishing gestures he stuck his stick into the water to demonstrate its shallowness they could see the short end bent in the water so that he seemed for a moment to lean his large weight on a breaking staff  the worst you can expect is to see an abbot sit down rather suddenly he added turning away well au revoir ill let you know about it later  the archaeologist and the architect were left on the great stone steps smiling at each other but whatever their common interests they presented a considerable personal contrast and the fanciful might even have found some contradiction in each considered individually the former a mr james haddow came from a drowsy den in the inns of court full of leather and parchment for the law was his profession and history only his hobby he was indeed among other things the solicitor and agent of the priors park estate but he himself was far from drowsy and seemed remarkably wide awake with shrewd and prominent blue eyes and red hair brushed as neatly as his very neat costume the latter whose name was leonard crane came straight from a crude and almost cockney office of builders and house agents in the neighboring suburb sunning itself at the end of a new row of jerrybuilt houses with plans in very bright colors and notices in very large letters but a serious observer at a second glance might have seen in his eyes something of that shining sleep that is called vision and his yellow hair while not affectedly long was unaffectedly untidy it was a manifest if melancholy truth that the architect was an artist but the artistic temperament was far from explaining him there was something else about him that was not definable but which some even felt to be dangerous despite his dreaminess he would sometimes surprise his friends with arts and even sports apart from his ordinary life like memories of some previous existence on this occasion nevertheless he hastened to disclaim any authority on the other mans hobby  i mustnt appear on false pretences he said with a smile i hardly even know what an archaeologist is except that a rather rusty remnant of greek suggests that he is a man who studies old things  yes replied haddow grimly  an archaeologist is a man who studies old things and finds they are new  crane looked at him steadily for a moment and then smiled again  dare one suggest he said that some of the things we have been talking about are among the old things that turn out not to be old  his companion also was silent for a moment and the smile on his rugged face was fainter as he replied quietly  the wall round the park is really old the one gate in it is gothic and i cannot find any trace of destruction or restoration but the house and the estate generallywell the romantic ideas read into these things are often rather recent romances things almost like fashionable novels for instance the very name of this place priors park makes everybody think of it as a moonlit mediaeval abbey i dare say the spiritualists by this time have discovered the ghost of a monk there but according to the only authoritative study of the matter i can find the place was simply called priors as any rural place is called podgers it was the house of a mr prior a farmhouse probably that stood here at some time or other and was a local landmark oh there are a great many examples of the same thing here and everywhere else this suburb of ours used to be a village and because some of the people slurred the name and pronounced it holliwell many a minor poet indulged in fancies about a holy well with spells and fairies and all the rest of it filling the suburban drawingrooms with the celtic twilight whereas anyone acquainted with the facts knows that hollinwall simply means the hole in the wall and probably referred to some quite trivial accident thats what i mean when i say that we dont so much find old things as we find new ones  crane seemed to have grown somewhat inattentive to the little lecture on antiquities and novelties and the cause of his restlessness was soon apparent and indeed approaching lord bulmers sister juliet bray was coming slowly across the lawn accompanied by one gentleman and followed by two others the young architect was in the illogical condition of mind in which he preferred three to one  the man walking with the lady was no other than the eminent prince borodino who was at least as famous as a distinguished diplomatist ought to be in the interests of what is called secret diplomacy he had been paying a round of visits at various english country houses and exactly what he was doing for diplomacy at priors park was as much a secret as any diplomatist could desire the obvious thing to say of his appearance was that he would have been extremely handsome if he had not been entirely bald but indeed that would itself be a rather bald way of putting it fantastic as it sounds it would fit the case better to say that people would have been surprised to see hair growing on him as surprised as if they had found hair growing on the bust of a roman emperor his tall figure was buttoned up in a tightwaisted fashion that rather accentuated his potential bulk and he wore a red flower in his buttonhole of the two men walking behind one was also bald but in a more partial and also a more premature fashion for his drooping mustache was still yellow and if his eyes were somewhat heavy it was with languor and not with age it was horne fisher and he was talking as easily and idly about everything as he always did his companion was a more striking and even more sinister figure and he had the added importance of being lord bulmers oldest and most intimate friend he was generally known with a severe simplicity as mr brain but it was understood that he had been a judge and police official in india and that he had enemies who had represented his measures against crime as themselves almost criminal he was a brown skeleton of a man with dark deep sunken eyes and a black mustache that hid the meaning of his mouth though he had the look of one wasted by some tropical disease his movements were much more alert than those of his lounging companion  its all settled announced the lady with great animation when they came within hailing distance youve all got to put on masquerade things and very likely skates as well though the prince says they dont go with it but we dont care about that its freezing already and we dont often get such a chance in england  even in india we dont exactly skate all the year round observed mr brain  and even italy is not primarily associated with ice said the italian  italy is primarily associated with ices remarked mr horne fisher i mean with ice cream men most people in this country imagine that italy is entirely populated with ice cream men and organ grinders there certainly are a lot of them perhaps theyre an invading army in disguise  how do you know they are not the secret emissaries of our diplomacy asked the prince with a slightly scornful smile an army of organ grinders might pick up hints and their monkeys might pick up all sort of things  the organs are organized in fact said the flippant mr fisher well ive known it pretty cold before now in italy and even in india up on the himalayan slopes the ice on our own little round pond will be quite cozy by comparison  juliet bray was an attractive lady with dark hair and eyebrows and dancing eyes and there was a geniality and even generosity in her rather imperious ways in most matters she could command her brother though that nobleman like many other men of vague ideas was not without a touch of the bully when he was at bay she could certainly command her guests even to the extent of decking out the most respectable and reluctant of them with her mediaeval masquerade and it really seemed as if she could command the elements also like a witch for the weather steadily hardened and sharpened that night the ice of the lake glimmering in the moonlight was like a marble floor and they had begun to dance and skate on it before it was dark  priors park or more properly the surrounding district of holinwall was a country seat that had become a suburb having once had only a dependent village at its doors it now found outside all its doors the signals of the expansion of london mr haddow who was engaged in historical researches both in the library and the locality could find little assistance in the latter he had already realized from the documents that priors park had originally been something like priors farm named after some local figure but the new social conditions were all against his tracing the story by its traditions had any of the real rustics remained he would probably have found some lingering legend of mr prior however remote he might be but the new nomadic population of clerks and artisans constantly shifting their homes from one suburb to another or their children from one school to another could have no corporate continuity they had all that forgetfulness of history that goes everywhere with the extension of education  nevertheless when he came out of the library next morning and saw the wintry trees standing round the frozen pond like a black forest he felt he might well have been far in the depths of the country the old wall running round the park kept that inclosure itself still entirely rural and romantic and one could easily imagine that the depths of that dark forest faded away indefinitely into distant vales and hills the gray and black and silver of the wintry wood were all the more severe or somber as a contrast to the colored carnival groups that already stood on and around the frozen pool for the house party had already flung themselves impatiently into fancy dress and the lawyer with his neat black suit and red hair was the only modern figure among them  arent you going to dress up asked juliet indignantly shaking at him a horned and towering blue headdress of the fourteenth century which framed her face very becomingly fantastic as it was everybody here has to be in the middle ages even mr brain has put on a sort of brown dressing gown and says hes a monk and mr fisher got hold of some old potato sacks in the kitchen and sewed them together hes supposed to be a monk too as to the prince hes perfectly glorious in great crimson robes as a cardinal he looks as if he could poison everybody you simply must be something  i will be something later in the day he replied at present i am nothing but an antiquary and an attorney i have to see your brother presently about some legal business and also some local investigations he asked me to make i must look a little like a steward when i give an account of my stewardship  oh but my brother has dressed up cried the girl  very much so no end if i may say so why hes bearing down on you now in all his glory  the noble lord was indeed marching toward them in a magnificent sixteenthcentury costume of purple and gold with a goldhilted sword and a plumed cap and manners to match indeed there was something more than his usual expansiveness of bodily action in his appearance at that moment it almost seemed so to speak that the plumes on his hat had gone to his head he flapped his great goldlined cloak like the wings of a fairy king in a pantomime he even drew his sword with a flourish and waved it about as he did his walking stick in the light of after events there seemed to be something monstrous and ominous about that exuberance something of the spirit that is called fey at the time it merely crossed a few peoples minds that he might possibly be drunk  as he strode toward his sister the first figure he passed was that of leonard crane clad in lincoln green with the horn and baldrick and sword appropriate to robin hood for he was standing nearest to the lady where indeed he might have been found during a disproportionate part of the time he had displayed one of his buried talents in the matter of skating and now that the skating was over seemed disposed to prolong the partnership the boisterous bulmer playfully made a pass at him with his drawn sword going forward with the lunge in the proper fencing fashion and making a somewhat too familiar shakespearean quotation about a rodent and a venetian coin  probably in crane also there was a subdued excitement just then anyhow in one flash he had drawn his own sword and parried and then suddenly to the surprise of everyone bulmers weapon seemed to spring out of his hand into the air and rolled away on the ringing ice  well i never said the lady as if with justifiable indignation you never told me you could fence too  bulmer put up his sword with an air rather bewildered than annoyed which increased the impression of something irresponsible in his mood at the moment then he turned rather abruptly to his lawyer saying  we can settle up about the estate after dinner ive missed nearly all the skating as it is and i doubt if the ice will hold till tomorrow night i think i shall get up early and have a spin by myself  you wont be disturbed with my company said horne fisher in his weary fashion if i have to begin the day with ice in the american fashion i prefer it in smaller quantities but no early hours for me in december the early bird catches the cold  oh i shant die of catching a cold answered bulmer and laughed                          a considerable group of the skating party had consisted of the guests staying at the house and the rest had tailed off in twos and threes some time before most of the guests began to retire for the night neighbors always invited to priors park on such occasions went back to their own houses in motors or on foot the legal and archeological gentleman had returned to the inns of court by a late train to get a paper called for during his consultation with his client and most of the other guests were drifting and lingering at various stages on their way up to bed horne fisher as if to deprive himself of any excuse for his refusal of early rising had been the first to retire to his room but sleepy as he looked he could not sleep he had picked up from a table the book of antiquarian topography in which haddow had found his first hints about the origin of the local name and being a man with a quiet and quaint capacity for being interested in anything he began to read it steadily making notes now and then of details on which his previous reading left him with a certain doubt about his present conclusions his room was the one nearest to the lake in the center of the woods and was therefore the quietest and none of the last echoes of the evenings festivity could reach him he had followed carefully the argument which established the derivation from mr priors farm and the hole in the wall and disposed of any fashionable fancy about monks and magic wells when he began to be conscious of a noise audible in the frozen silence of the night it was not a particularly loud noise but it seemed to consist of a series of thuds or heavy blows such as might be struck on a wooden door by a man seeking to enter they were followed by something like a faint creak or crack as if the obstacle had either been opened or had given way he opened his own bedroom door and listened but as he heard talk and laughter all over the lower floors he had no reason to fear that a summons would be neglected or the house left without protection he went to his open window looking out over the frozen pond and the moonlit statue in the middle of their circle of darkling woods and listened again but silence had returned to that silent place and after straining his ears for a considerable time he could hear nothing but the solitary hoot of a distant departing train then he reminded himself how many nameless noises can be heard by the wakeful during the most ordinary night and shrugging his shoulders went wearily to bed  he awoke suddenly and sat up in bed with his ears filled as with thunder with the throbbing echoes of a rending cry he remained rigid for a moment and then sprang out of bed throwing on the loose gown of sacking he had worn all day he went first to the window which was open but covered with a thick curtain so that his room was still completely dark but when he tossed the curtain aside and put his head out he saw that a gray and silver daybreak had already appeared behind the black woods that surrounded the little lake and that was all that he did see though the sound had certainly come in through the open window from this direction the whole scene was still and empty under the morning light as under the moonlight then the long rather lackadaisical hand he had laid on a window sill gripped it tighter as if to master a tremor and his peering blue eyes grew bleak with fear it may seem that his emotion was exaggerated and needless considering the effort of common sense by which he had conquered his nervousness about the noise on the previous night but that had been a very different sort of noise it might have been made by half a hundred things from the chopping of wood to the breaking of bottles there was only one thing in nature from which could come the sound that echoed through the dark house at daybreak it was the awful articulate voice of man and it was something worse for he knew what man  he knew also that it had been a shout for help it seemed to him that he had heard the very word but the word short as it was had been swallowed up as if the man had been stifled or snatched away even as he spoke only the mocking reverberations of it remained even in his memory but he had no doubt of the original voice he had no doubt that the great bulls voice of francis bray baron bulmer had been heard for the last time between the darkness and the lifting dawn  how long he stood there he never knew but he was startled into life by the first living thing that he saw stirring in that halffrozen landscape along the path beside the lake and immediately under his window a figure was walking slowly and softly but with great composurea stately figure in robes of a splendid scarlet it was the italian prince still in his cardinals costume most of the company had indeed lived in their costumes for the last day or two and fisher himself had assumed his frock of sacking as a convenient dressing gown but there seemed nevertheless something unusually finished and formal in the way of an early bird about this magnificent red cockatoo it was as if the early bird had been up all night  what is the matter he called sharply leaning out of the window and the italian turned up his great yellow face like a mask of brass  we had better discuss it downstairs said prince borodino  fisher ran downstairs and encountered the great redrobed figure entering the doorway and blocking the entrance with his bulk  did you hear that cry demanded fisher  i heard a noise and i came out answered the diplomatist and his face was too dark in the shadow for its expression to be read  it was bulmers voice insisted fisher  ill swear it was bulmers voice  did you know him well asked the other  the question seemed irrelevant though it was not illogical and fisher could only answer in a random fashion that he knew lord bulmer only slightly  nobody seems to have known him well continued the italian in level tones nobody except that man brain brain is rather older than bulmer but i fancy they shared a good many secrets  fisher moved abruptly as if waking from a momentary trance and said in a new and more vigorous voice but look here hadnt we better get outside and see if anything has happened  the ice seems to be thawing said the other almost with indifference  when they emerged from the house dark stains and stars in the gray field of ice did indeed indicate that the frost was breaking up as their host had prophesied the day before and the very memory of yesterday brought back the mystery of today  he knew there would be a thaw observed the prince he went out skating quite early on purpose did he call out because he landed in the water do you think  fisher looked puzzled  bulmer was the last man to bellow like that because he got his boots wet and thats all he could do here the water would hardly come up to the calf of a man of his size you can see the flat weeds on the floor of the lake as if it were through a thin pane of glass no if bulmer had only broken the ice he wouldnt have said much at the moment though possibly a good deal afterward we should have found him stamping and damning up and down this path and calling for clean boots  let us hope we shall find him as happily employed remarked the diplomatist in that case the voice must have come out of the wood  ill swear it didnt come out of the house said fisher and the two disappeared together into the twilight of wintry trees  the plantation stood dark against the fiery colors of sunrise a black fringe having that feathery appearance which makes trees when they are bare the very reverse of rugged hours and hours afterward when the same dense but delicate margin was dark against the greenish colors opposite the sunset the search thus begun at sunrise had not come to an end by successive stages and to slowly gathering groups of the company it became apparent that the most extraordinary of all gaps had appeared in the party the guests could find no trace of their host anywhere the servants reported that his bed had been slept in and his skates and his fancy costume were gone as if he had risen early for the purpose he had himself avowed but from the top of the house to the bottom from the walls round the park to the pond in the center there was no trace of lord bulmer dead or alive horne fisher realized that a chilling premonition had already prevented him from expecting to find the man alive but his bald brow was wrinkled over an entirely new and unnatural problem in not finding the man at all  he considered the possibility of bulmer having gone off of his own accord for some reason but after fully weighing it he finally dismissed it it was inconsistent with the unmistakable voice heard at daybreak and with many other practical obstacles there was only one gateway in the ancient and lofty wall round the small park the lodge keeper kept it locked till late in the morning and the lodge keeper had seen no one pass fisher was fairly sure that he had before him a mathematical problem in an inclosed space his instinct had been from the first so attuned to the tragedy that it would have been almost a relief to him to find the corpse he would have been grieved but not horrified to come on the noblemans body dangling from one of his own trees as from a gibbet or floating in his own pool like a pallid weed what horrified him was to find nothing  he soon become conscious that he was not alone even in his most individual and isolated experiments he often found a figure following him like his shadow in silent and almost secret clearings in the plantation or outlying nooks and corners of the old wall the darkmustached mouth was as mute as the deep eyes were mobile darting incessantly hither and thither but it was clear that brain of the indian police had taken up the trail like an old hunter after a tiger seeing that he was the only personal friend of the vanished man this seemed natural enough and fisher resolved to deal frankly with him  this silence is rather a social strain he said  may i break the ice by talking about the weatherwhich by the way has already broken the ice i know that breaking the ice might be a rather melancholy metaphor in this case  i dont think so replied brain shortly  i dont fancy the ice had much to do with it i dont see how it could  what would you propose doing asked fisher  well weve sent for the authorities of course but i hope to find something out before they come replied the angloindian i cant say i have much hope from police methods in this country too much red tape habeas corpus and that sort of thing what we want is to see that nobody bolts the nearest we could get to it would be to collect the company and count them so to speak nobodys left lately except that lawyer who was poking about for antiquities  oh hes out of it he left last night answered the other eight hours after bulmers chauffeur saw his lawyer off by the train i heard bulmers own voice as plain as i hear yours now  i suppose you dont believe in spirits said the man from india after a pause he added theres somebody else i should like to find before we go after a fellow with an alibi in the inner temple whats become of that fellow in greenthe architect dressed up as a forester i havent seem him about  mr brain managed to secure his assembly of all the distracted company before the arrival of the police but when he first began to comment once more on the young architects delay in putting in an appearance he found himself in the presence of a minor mystery and a psychological development of an entirely unexpected kind  juliet bray had confronted the catastrophe of her brothers disappearance with a somber stoicism in which there was perhaps more paralysis than pain but when the other question came to the surface she was both agitated and angry  we dont want to jump to any conclusions about anybody brain was saying in his staccato style but we should like to know a little more about mr crane nobody seems to know much about him or where he comes from and it seems a sort of coincidence that yesterday he actually crossed swords with poor bulmer and could have stuck him too since he showed himself the better swordsman of course that may be an accident and couldnt possibly be called a case against anybody but then we havent the means to make a real case against anybody till the police come we are only a pack of very amateur sleuthhounds  and i think youre a pack of snobs said juliet  because mr crane is a genius whos made his own way you try to suggest hes a murderer without daring to say so because he wore a toy sword and happened to know how to use it you want us to believe he used it like a bloodthirsty maniac for no reason in the world and because he could have hit my brother and didnt you deduce that he did thats the sort of way you argue and as for his having disappeared youre wrong in that as you are in everything else for here he comes  and indeed the green figure of the fictitious robin hood slowly detached itself from the gray background of the trees and came toward them as she spoke  he approached the group slowly but with composure but he was decidedly pale and the eyes of brain and fisher had already taken in one detail of the greenclad figure more clearly than all the rest the horn still swung from his baldrick but the sword was gone  rather to the surprise of the company brain did not follow up the question thus suggested but while retaining an air of leading the inquiry had also an appearance of changing the subject  now were all assembled he observed quietly there is a question i want to ask to begin with did anybody here actually see lord bulmer this morning  leonard crane turned his pale face round the circle of faces till he came to juliets then he compressed his lips a little and said  yes i saw him  was he alive and well asked brain quickly  how was he dressed  he appeared exceedingly well replied crane with a curious intonation he was dressed as he was yesterday in that purple costume copied from the portrait of his ancestor in the sixteenth century he had his skates in his hand  and his sword at his side i suppose added the questioner where is your own sword mr crane  i threw it away  in the singular silence that ensued the train of thought in many minds became involuntarily a series of colored pictures  they had grown used to their fanciful garments looking more gay and gorgeous against the dark gray and streaky silver of the forest so that the moving figures glowed like stainedglass saints walking the effect had been more fitting because so many of them had idly parodied pontifical or monastic dress but the most arresting attitude that remained in their memories had been anything but merely monastic that of the moment when the figure in bright green and the other in vivid violet had for a moment made a silver cross of their crossing swords even when it was a jest it had been something of a drama and it was a strange and sinister thought that in the gray daybreak the same figures in the same posture might have been repeated as a tragedy  did you quarrel with him asked brain suddenly  yes replied the immovable man in green  or he quarreled with me  why did he quarrel with you asked the investigator and leonard crane made no reply  horne fisher curiously enough had only given half his attention to this crucial crossexamination his heavylidded eyes had languidly followed the figure of prince borodino who at this stage had strolled away toward the fringe of the wood and after a pause as of meditation had disappeared into the darkness of the trees  he was recalled from his irrelevance by the voice of juliet bray which rang out with an altogether new note of decision  if that is the difficulty it had best be cleared up i am engaged to mr crane and when we told my brother he did not approve of it that is all  neither brain nor fisher exhibited any surprise but the former added quietly  except i suppose that he and your brother went off into the wood to discuss it where mr crane mislaid his sword not to mention his companion  and may i ask inquired crane with a certain flicker of mockery passing over his pallid features what i am supposed to have done with either of them let us adopt the cheerful thesis that i am a murderer it has yet to be shown that i am a magician if i ran your unfortunate friend through the body what did i do with the body did i have it carried away by seven flying dragons or was it merely a trifling matter of turning it into a milkwhite hind  it is no occasion for sneering said the angloindian judge with abrupt authority it doesnt make it look better for you that you can joke about the loss  fishers dreamy and even dreary eye was still on the edge of the wood behind and he became conscious of masses of dark red like a stormy sunset cloud glowing through the gray network of the thin trees and the prince in his cardinals robes reemerged on to the pathway brain had had half a notion that the prince might have gone to look for the lost rapier but when he reappeared he was carrying in his hand not a sword but an ax  the incongruity between the masquerade and the mystery had created a curious psychological atmosphere at first they had all felt horribly ashamed at being caught in the foolish disguises of a festival by an event that had only too much the character of a funeral many of them would have already gone back and dressed in clothes that were more funereal or at least more formal but somehow at the moment this seemed like a second masquerade more artificial and frivolous than the first and as they reconciled themselves to their ridiculous trappings a curious sensation had come over some of them notably over the more sensitive like crane and fisher and juliet but in some degree over everybody except the practical mr brain it was almost as if they were the ghosts of their own ancestors haunting that dark wood and dismal lake and playing some old part that they only half remembered the movements of those colored figures seemed to mean something that had been settled long before like a silent heraldry acts attitudes external objects were accepted as an allegory even without the key and they knew when a crisis had come when they did not know what it was and somehow they knew subconsciously that the whole tale had taken a new and terrible turn when they saw the prince stand in the gap of the gaunt trees in his robes of angry crimson and with his lowering face of bronze bearing in his hand a new shape of death they could not have named a reason but the two swords seemed indeed to have become toy swords and the whole tale of them broken and tossed away like a toy borodino looked like the old world headsman clad in terrible red and carrying the ax for the execution of the criminal and the criminal was not crane  mr brain of the indian police was glaring at the new object and it was a moment or two before he spoke harshly and almost hoarsely  what are you doing with that he asked  seems to be a woodmans chopper  a natural association of ideas observed horne fisher  if you meet a cat in a wood you think its a wildcat though it may have just strolled from the drawingroom sofa as a matter of fact i happen to know that is not the woodmans chopper its the kitchen chopper or meat ax or something like that that somebody has thrown away in the wood i saw it in the kitchen myself when i was getting the potato sacks with which i reconstructed a mediaeval hermit  all the same it is not without interest remarked the prince holding out the instrument to fisher who took it and examined it carefully a butchers cleaver that has done butchers work  it was certainly the instrument of the crime assented fisher in a low voice  brain was staring at the dull blue gleam of the ax head with fierce and fascinated eyes i dont understand you he said there is nothere are no marks on it  it has shed no blood answered fisher but for all that it has committed a crime this is as near as the criminal came to the crime when he committed it  what do you mean  he was not there when he did it explained fisher  its a poor sort of murderer who cant murder people when he isnt there  you seem to be talking merely for the sake of mystification said brain if you have any practical advice to give you might as well make it intelligible  the only practical advice i can suggest said fisher thoughtfully is a little research into local topography and nomenclature they say there used to be a mr prior who had a farm in this neighborhood i think some details about the domestic life of the late mr prior would throw a light on this terrible business  and you have nothing more immediate than your topography to offer said brain with a sneer to help me avenge my friend  well said fisher i should find out the truth about the hole in the wall                           that night at the close of a stormy twilight and under a strong west wind that followed the breaking of the frost leonard crane was wending his way in a wild rotatory walk round and round the high continuous wall that inclosed the little wood he was driven by a desperate idea of solving for himself the riddle that had clouded his reputation and already even threatened his liberty the police authorities now in charge of the inquiry had not arrested him but he knew well enough that if he tried to move far afield he would be instantly arrested horne fishers fragmentary hints though he had refused to expand them as yet had stirred the artistic temperament of the architect to a sort of wild analysis and he was resolved to read the hieroglyph upside down and every way until it made sense if it was something connected with a hole in the wall he would find the hole in the wall but as a matter of fact he was unable to find the faintest crack in the wall his professional knowledge told him that the masonry was all of one workmanship and one date and except for the regular entrance which threw no light on the mystery he found nothing suggesting any sort of hiding place or means of escape walking a narrow path between the winding wall and the wild eastward bend and sweep of the gray and feathery trees seeing shifting gleams of a lost sunset winking almost like lightning as the clouds of tempest scudded across the sky and mingling with the first faint blue light from a slowly strengthened moon behind him he began to feel his head going round as his heels were going round and round the blind recurrent barrier he had thoughts on the border of thought fancies about a fourth dimension which was itself a hole to hide anything of seeing everything from a new angle out of a new window in the senses or of some mystical light and transparency like the new rays of chemistry in which he could see bulmers body horrible and glaring floating in a lurid halo over the woods and the wall he was haunted also with the hint which somehow seemed to be equally horrifying that it all had something to do with mr prior there seemed even to be something creepy in the fact that he was always respectfully referred to as mr prior and that it was in the domestic life of the dead farmer that he had been bidden to seek the seed of these dreadful things as a matter of fact he had found that no local inquiries had revealed anything at all about the prior family  the moonlight had broadened and brightened the wind had driven off the clouds and itself died fitfully away when he came round again to the artificial lake in front of the house for some reason it looked a very artificial lake indeed the whole scene was like a classical landscape with a touch of watteau the palladian facade of the house pale in the moon and the same silver touching the very pagan and naked marble nymph in the middle of the pond rather to his surprise he found another figure there beside the statue sitting almost equally motionless and the same silver pencil traced the wrinkled brow and patient face of horne fisher still dressed as a hermit and apparently practicing something of the solitude of a hermit nevertheless he looked up at leonard crane and smiled almost as if he had expected him  look here said crane planting himself in front of him can you tell me anything about this business  i shall soon have to tell everybody everything about it replied fisher but ive no objection to telling you something first but to begin with will you tell me something what really happened when you met bulmer this morning you did throw away your sword but you didnt kill him  i didnt kill him because i threw away my sword said the other i did it on purposeor im not sure what might have happened  after a pause he went on quietly  the late lord bulmer was a very breezy gentleman extremely breezy he was very genial with his inferiors and would have his lawyer and his architect staying in his house for all sorts of holidays and amusements but there was another side to him which they found out when they tried to be his equals when i told him that his sister and i were engaged something happened which i simply cant and wont describe it seemed to me like some monstrous upheaval of madness but i suppose the truth is painfully simple there is such a thing as the coarseness of a gentleman and it is the most horrible thing in humanity  i know said fisher  the renaissance nobles of the tudor time were like that  it is odd that you should say that crane went on for while we were talking there came on me a curious feeling that we were repeating some scene of the past and that i was really some outlaw found in the woods like robin hood and that he had really stepped in all his plumes and purple out of the picture frame of the ancestral portrait anyhow he was the man in possession and he neither feared god nor regarded man i defied him of course and walked away i might really have killed him if i had not walked away  yes said fisher nodding his ancestor was in possession and he was in possession and this is the end of the story it all fits in  fits in with what cried his companion with sudden impatience i cant make head or tail of it you tell me to look for the secret in the hole in the wall but i cant find any hole in the wall  there isnt any said fisher  thats the secret after reflecting a moment he added unless you call it a hole in the wall of the world look here ill tell you if you like but im afraid it involves an introduction youve got to understand one of the tricks of the modern mind a tendency that most people obey without noticing it in the village or suburb outside theres an inn with the sign of st george and the dragon now suppose i went about telling everybody that this was only a corruption of king george and the dragoon scores of people would believe it without any inquiry from a vague feeling that its probable because its prosaic it turns something romantic and legendary into something recent and ordinary and that somehow makes it sound rational though it is unsupported by reason of course some people would have the sense to remember having seen st george in old italian pictures and french romances but a good many wouldnt think about it at all they would just swallow the skepticism because it was skepticism modern intelligence wont accept anything on authority but it will accept anything without authority thats exactly what has happened here  when some critic or other chose to say that priors park was not a priory but was named after some quite modern man named prior nobody really tested the theory at all it never occurred to anybody repeating the story to ask if there was any mr prior if anybody had ever seen him or heard of him as a matter of fact it was a priory and shared the fate of most prioriesthat is the tudor gentleman with the plumes simply stole it by brute force and turned it into his own private house he did worse things as you shall hear but the point here is that this is how the trick works and the trick works in the same way in the other part of the tale the name of this district is printed holinwall in all the best maps produced by the scholars and they allude lightly not without a smile to the fact that it was pronounced holiwell by the most ignorant and oldfashioned of the poor but it is spelled wrong and pronounced right  do you mean to say asked crane quickly that there really was a well  there is a well said fisher and the truth lies at the bottom of it  as he spoke he stretched out his hand and pointed toward the sheet of water in front of him  the well is under that water somewhere he said and this is not the first tragedy connected with it the founder of this house did something which his fellow ruffians very seldom did something that had to be hushed up even in the anarchy of the pillage of the monasteries the well was connected with the miracles of some saint and the last prior that guarded it was something like a saint himself certainly he was something very like a martyr he defied the new owner and dared him to pollute the place till the noble in a fury stabbed him and flung his body into the well whither after four hundred years it has been followed by an heir of the usurper clad in the same purple and walking the world with the same pride  but how did it happen demanded crane that for the first time bulmer fell in at that particular spot  because the ice was only loosened at that particular spot by the only man who knew it answered horne fisher it was cracked deliberately with the kitchen chopper at that special place and i myself heard the hammering and did not understand it the place had been covered with an artificial lake if only because the whole truth had to be covered with an artificial legend but dont you see that it is exactly what those pagan nobles would have done to desecrate it with a sort of heathen goddess as the roman emperor built a temple to venus on the holy sepulchre but the truth could still be traced out by any scholarly man determined to trace it and this man was determined to trace it  what man asked the other with a shadow of the answer in his mind  the only man who has an alibi replied fisher  james haddow the antiquarian lawyer left the night before the fatality but he left that black star of death on the ice he left abruptly having previously proposed to stay probably i think after an ugly scene with bulmer at their legal interview as you know yourself bulmer could make a man feel pretty murderous and i rather fancy the lawyer had himself irregularities to confess and was in danger of exposure by his client but its my reading of human nature that a man will cheat in his trade but not in his hobby haddow may have been a dishonest lawyer but he couldnt help being an honest antiquary when he got on the track of the truth about the holy well he had to follow it up he was not to be bamboozled with newspaper anecdotes about mr prior and a hole in the wall he found out everything even to the exact location of the well and he was rewarded if being a successful assassin can be regarded as a reward  and how did you get on the track of all this hidden history asked the young architect  a cloud came across the brow of horne fisher  i knew only too much about it already he said and after all its shameful for me to be speaking lightly of poor bulmer who has paid his penalty but the rest of us havent i dare say every cigar i smoke and every liqueur i drink comes directly or indirectly from the harrying of the holy places and the persecution of the poor after all it needs very little poking about in the past to find that hole in the wall that great breach in the defenses of english history it lies just under the surface of a thin sheet of sham information and instruction just as the black and bloodstained well lies just under that floor of shallow water and flat weeds oh the ice is thin but it bears it is strong enough to support us when we dress up as monks and dance on it in mockery of the dear quaint old middle ages they told me i must put on fancy dress so i did put on fancy dress according to my own taste and fancy i put on the only costume i think fit for a man who has inherited the position of a gentleman and yet has not entirely lost the feelings of one  in answer to a look of inquiry he rose with a sweeping and downward gesture  sackcloth he said and i would wear the ashes as well if they would stay on my bald head    vii the temple of silence  harold march and the few who cultivated the friendship of horne fisher especially if they saw something of him in his own social setting were conscious of a certain solitude in his very sociability they seemed to be always meeting his relations and never meeting his family perhaps it would be truer to say that they saw much of his family and nothing of his home his cousins and connections ramified like a labyrinth all over the governing class of great britain and he seemed to be on good or at least on goodhumored terms with most of them for horne fisher was remarkable for a curious impersonal information and interest touching all sorts of topics so that one could sometimes fancy that his culture like his colorless fair mustache and pale drooping features had the neutral nature of a chameleon anyhow he could always get on with viceroys and cabinet ministers and all the great men responsible for great departments and talk to each of them on his own subject on the branch of study with which he was most seriously concerned thus he could converse with the minister for war about silkworms with the minister of education about detective stories with the minister of labor about limoges enamel and with the minister of missions and moral progress if that be his correct title about the pantomime boys of the last four decades and as the first was his first cousin the second his second cousin the third his brotherinlaw and the fourth his uncle by marriage this conversational versatility certainly served in one sense to create a happy family but march never seemed to get a glimpse of that domestic interior to which men of the middle classes are accustomed in their friendships and which is indeed the foundation of friendship and love and everything else in any sane and stable society he wondered whether horne fisher was both an orphan and an only child  it was therefore with something like a start that he found that fisher had a brother much more prosperous and powerful than himself though hardly march thought so entertaining sir henry harland fisher with half the alphabet after his name was something at the foreign office far more tremendous than the foreign secretary apparently it ran in the family after all for it seemed there was another brother ashton fisher in india rather more tremendous than the viceroy sir henry fisher was a heavier but handsomer edition of his brother with a brow equally bald but much more smooth he was very courteous but a shade patronizing not only to march but even as march fancied to horne fisher as well the latter gentleman who had many intuitions about the halfformed thoughts of others glanced at the topic himself as they came away from the great house in berkeley square  why dont you know he observed quietly that i am the fool of the family  it must be a clever family said harold march with a smile  very gracefully expressed replied fisher that is the best of having a literary training well perhaps it is an exaggeration to say i am the fool of the family its enough to say i am the failure of the family  it seems queer to me that you should fail especially remarked the journalist as they say in the examinations what did you fail in  politics replied his friend  i stood for parliament when i was quite a young man and got in by an enormous majority with loud cheers and chairing round the town since then of course ive been rather under a cloud  im afraid i dont quite understand the of course answered march laughing  that part of it isnt worth understanding said fisher  but as a matter of fact old chap the other part of it was rather odd and interesting quite a detective story in its way as well as the first lesson i had in what modern politics are made of if you like ill tell you all about it and the following recast in a less allusive and conversational manner is the story that he told   nobody privileged of late years to meet sir henry harland fisher would believe that he had ever been called harry but indeed he had been boyish enough when a boy and that serenity which shone on him through life and which now took the form of gravity had once taken the form of gayety his friends would have said that he was all the more ripe in his maturity for having been young in his youth his enemies would have said that he was still light minded but no longer light hearted but in any case the whole of the story horne fisher had to tell arose out of the accident which had made young harry fisher private secretary to lord saltoun hence his later connection with the foreign office which had indeed come to him as a sort of legacy from his lordship when that great man was the power behind the throne this is not the place to say much about saltoun little as was known of him and much as there was worth knowing england has had at least three or four such secret statesmen an aristocratic polity produces every now and then an aristocrat who is also an accident a man of intellectual independence and insight a napoleon born in the purple his vast work was mostly invisible and very little could be got out of him in private life except a crusty and rather cynical sense of humor but it was certainly the accident of his presence at a family dinner of the fishers and the unexpected opinion he expressed which turned what might have been a dinnertable joke into a sort of small sensational novel  save for lord saltoun it was a family party of fishers for the only other distinguished stranger had just departed after dinner leaving the rest to their coffee and cigars this had been a figure of some interesta young cambridge man named eric hughes who was the rising hope of the party of reform to which the fisher family along with their friend saltoun had long been at least formally attached the personality of hughes was substantially summed up in the fact that he talked eloquently and earnestly through the whole dinner but left immediately after to be in time for an appointment all his actions had something at once ambitious and conscientious he drank no wine but was slightly intoxicated with words and his face and phrases were on the front page of all the newspapers just then because he was contesting the safe seat of sir francis verner in the great byelection in the west everybody was talking about the powerful speech against squirarchy which he had just delivered even in the fisher circle everybody talked about it except horne fisher himself who sat in a corner lowering over the fire  we jolly well have to thank him for putting some new life into the old party ashton fisher was saying this campaign against the old squires just hits the degree of democracy there is in this county this act for extending county council control is practically his bill so you may say hes in the government even before hes in the house  ones easier than the other said harry carelessly  i bet the squires a bigger pot than the county council in that county verner is pretty well rooted all these rural places are what you call reactionary damning aristocrats wont alter it  he damns them rather well observed ashton  we never had a better meeting than the one in barkington which generally goes constitutional and when he said sir francis may boast of blue blood let us show we have red blood and went on to talk about manhood and liberty the room simply rose at him  speaks very well said lord saltoun gruffly making his only contribution to the conversation so far  then the almost equally silent horne fisher suddenly spoke without taking his brooding eyes off the fire  what i cant understand he said is why nobody is ever slanged for the real reason  hullo remarked harry humorously you beginning to take notice  well take verner continued horne fisher  if we want to attack verner why not attack him why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat who is verner where does he come from his name sounds old but i never heard of it before as the man said of the crucifixion why talk about his blue blood his blood may be gamboge yellow with green spots for all anybody knows all we know is that the old squire hawker somehow ran through his money and his second wifes i suppose for she was rich enough and sold the estate to a man named verner what did he make his money in oil army contracts  i dont know said saltoun looking at him thoughtfully  first thing i ever knew you didnt know cried the exuberant harry  and theres more besides went on horne fisher who seemed to have suddenly found his tongue if we want country people to vote for us why dont we get somebody with some notion about the country we dont talk to people in threadneedle street about nothing but turnips and pigsties why do we talk to people in somerset about nothing but slums and socialism why dont we give the squires land to the squires tenants instead of dragging in the county council  three acres and a cow cried harry emitting what the parliamentary reports call an ironical cheer  yes replied his brother stubbornly  dont you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee why doesnt somebody start a yeoman party in politics appealing to the old traditions of the small landowner and why dont they attack men like verner for what they are which is something about as old and traditional as an american oil trust  youd better lead the yeoman party yourself laughed harry dont you think it would be a joke lord saltoun to see my brother and his merry men with their bows and bills marching down to somerset all in lincoln green instead of lincoln and bennet hats  no answered old saltoun i dont think it would be a joke i think it would be an exceedingly serious and sensible idea  well im jiggered cried harry fisher staring at him i said just now it was the first fact you didnt know and i should say this is the first joke you didnt see  ive seen a good many things in my time said the old man in his rather sour fashion ive told a good many lies in my time too and perhaps ive got rather sick of them but there are lies and lies for all that gentlemen used to lie just as schoolboys lie because they hung together and partly to help one another out but im damned if i can see why we should lie for these cosmopolitan cads who only help themselves theyre not backing us up any more theyre simply crowding us out if a man like your brother likes to go into parliament as a yeoman or a gentleman or a jacobite or an ancient briton i should say it would be a jolly good thing  in the rather startled silence that followed horne fisher sprang to his feet and all his dreary manner dropped off him  im ready to do it tomorrow he cried  i suppose none of you fellows would back me up  then harry fisher showed the finer side of his impetuosity he made a sudden movement as if to shake hands  youre a sport he said and ill back you up if nobody else will but we can all back you up cant we i see what lord saltoun means and of course hes right hes always right  so i will go down to somerset said horne fisher  yes it is on the way to westminster said lord saltoun with a smile  and so it happened that horne fisher arrived some days later at the little station of a rather remote market town in the west accompanied by a light suitcase and a lively brother it must not be supposed however that the brothers cheerful tone consisted entirely of chaff he supported the new candidate with hope as well as hilarity and at the back of his boisterous partnership there was an increasing sympathy and encouragement harry fisher had always had an affection for his more quiet and eccentric brother and was now coming more and more to have a respect for him as the campaign proceeded the respect increased to ardent admiration for harry was still young and could feel the sort of enthusiasm for his captain in electioneering that a schoolboy can feel for his captain in cricket  nor was the admiration undeserved as the new threecornered contest developed it became apparent to others besides his devoted kinsman that there was more in horne fisher than had ever met the eye it was clear that his outbreak by the family fireside had been but the culmination of a long course of brooding and studying on the question the talent he retained through life for studying his subject and even somebody elses subject had long been concentrated on this idea of championing a new peasantry against a new plutocracy he spoke to a crowd with eloquence and replied to an individual with humor two political arts that seemed to come to him naturally he certainly knew much more about rural problems than either hughes the reform candidate or verner the constitutional candidate and he probed those problems with a human curiosity and went below the surface in a way that neither of them dreamed of doing he soon became the voice of popular feelings that are never found in the popular press new angles of criticism arguments that had never before been uttered by an educated voice tests and comparisons that had been made only in dialect by men drinking in the little local public houses crafts half forgotten that had come down by sign of hand and tongue from remote ages when their fathers were freeall this created a curious and double excitement it startled the well informed by being a new and fantastic idea they had never encountered it startled the ignorant by being an old and familiar idea they never thought to have seen revived men saw things in a new light and knew not even whether it was the sunset or the dawn  practical grievances were there to make the movement formidable as fisher went to and fro among the cottages and country inns it was borne in on him without difficulty that sir francis verner was a very bad landlord nor was the story of his acquisition of the land any more ancient and dignified than he had supposed the story was well known in the county and in most respects was obvious enough hawker the old squire had been a loose unsatisfactory sort of person had been on bad terms with his first wife who died as some said of neglect and had then married a flashy south american jewess with a fortune but he must have worked his way through this fortune also with marvelous rapidity for he had been compelled to sell the estate to verner and had gone to live in south america possibly on his wifes estates but fisher noticed that the laxity of the old squire was far less hated than the efficiency of the new squire verners history seemed to be full of smart bargains and financial flutters that left other people short of money and temper but though he heard a great deal about verner there was one thing that continually eluded him something that nobody knew that even saltoun had not known he could not find out how verner had originally made his money  he must have kept it specially dark said horne fisher to himself it must be something hes really ashamed of hang it all what is a man ashamed of nowadays  and as he pondered on the possibilities they grew darker and more distorted in his mind he thought vaguely of things remote and repulsive strange forms of slavery or sorcery and then of ugly things yet more unnatural but nearer home the figure of verner seemed to be blackened and transfigured in his imagination and to stand against varied backgrounds and strange skies  as he strode up a village street brooding thus his eyes encountered a complete contrast in the face of his other rival the reform candidate eric hughes with his blown blond hair and eager undergraduate face was just getting into his motor car and saying a few final words to his agent a sturdy grizzled man named gryce eric hughes waved his hand in a friendly fashion but gryce eyed him with some hostility eric hughes was a young man with genuine political enthusiasms but he knew that political opponents are people with whom one may have to dine any day but mr gryce was a grim little local radical a champion of the chapel and one of those happy people whose work is also their hobby he turned his back as the motor car drove away and walked briskly up the sunlit high street of the little town whistling with political papers sticking out of his pocket  fisher looked pensively after the resolute figure for a moment and then as if by an impulse began to follow it through the busy market place amid the baskets and barrows of market day under the painted wooden sign of the green dragon up a dark side entry under an arch and through a tangle of crooked cobbled streets the two threaded their way the square strutting figure in front and the lean lounging figure behind him like his shadow in the sunshine at length they came to a brown brick house with a brass plate on which was mr gryces name and that individual turned and beheld his pursuer with a stare  could i have a word with you sir asked horne fisher politely the agent stared still more but assented civilly and led the other into an office littered with leaflets and hung all round with highly colored posters which linked the name of hughes with all the higher interests of humanity  mr horne fisher i believe said mr gryce  much honored by the call of course cant pretend to congratulate you on entering the contest im afraid you wont expect that here weve been keeping the old flag flying for freedom and reform and you come in and break the battle line  for mr elijah gryce abounded in military metaphors and in denunciations of militarism he was a squarejawed bluntfeatured man with a pugnacious cock of the eyebrow he had been pickled in the politics of that countryside from boyhood he knew everybodys secrets and electioneering was the romance of his life  i suppose you think im devoured with ambition said horne fisher in his rather listless voice aiming at a dictatorship and all that well i think i can clear myself of the charge of mere selfish ambition i only want certain things done i dont want to do them i very seldom want to do anything and ive come here to say that im quite willing to retire from the contest if you can convince me that we really want to do the same thing  the agent of the reform party looked at him with an odd and slightly puzzled expression and before he could reply fisher went on in the same level tones  youd hardly believe it but i keep a conscience concealed about me and i am in doubt about several things for instance we both want to turn verner out of parliament but what weapon are we to use ive heard a lot of gossip against him but is it right to act on mere gossip just as i want to be fair to you so i want to be fair to him if some of the things ive heard are true he ought to be turned out of parliament and every other club in london but i dont want to turn him out of parliament if they arent true  at this point the light of battle sprang into mr gryces eyes and he became voluble not to say violent he at any rate had no doubt that the stories were true he could testify to his own knowledge that they were true verner was not only a hard landlord but a mean landlord a robber as well as a rackrenter any gentleman would be justified in hounding him out he had cheated old wilkins out of his freehold by a trick fit for a pickpocket he had driven old mother biddle to the workhouse he had stretched the law against long adam the poacher till all the magistrates were ashamed of him  so if youll serve under the old banner concluded mr gryce more genially and turn out a swindling tyrant like that im sure youll never regret it  and if that is the truth said horne fisher are you going to tell it  what do you mean  tell the truth demanded gryce  i mean you are going to tell the truth as you have just told it replied fisher you are going to placard this town with the wickedness done to old wilkins you are going to fill the newspapers with the infamous story of mrs biddle you are going to denounce verner from a public platform naming him for what he did and naming the poacher he did it to and youre going to find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate and when you know the truth as i said before of course you are going to tell it upon those terms i come under the old flag as you call it and haul down my little pennon  the agent was eying him with a curious expression surly but not entirely unsympathetic well he said slowly you have to do these things in a regular way you know or people dont understand ive had a lot of experience and im afraid what you say wouldnt do people understand slanging squires in a general way but those personalities arent considered fair play looks like hitting below the belt  old wilkins hasnt got a belt i suppose replied horne fisher verner can hit him anyhow and nobody must say a word its evidently very important to have a belt but apparently you have to be rather high up in society to have one possibly he added thoughtfullypossibly the explanation of the phrase a belted earl the meaning of which has always escaped me  i mean those personalities wont do returned gryce frowning at the table  and mother biddle and long adam the poacher are not personalities said fisher and suppose we mustnt ask how verner made all the money that enabled him to becomea personality  gryce was still looking at him under lowering brows but the singular light in his eyes had brightened at last he said in another and much quieter voice  look here sir i like you if you dont mind my saying so i think you are really on the side of the people and im sure youre a brave man a lot braver than you know perhaps we darent touch what you propose with a barge pole and so far from wanting you in the old party wed rather you ran your own risk by yourself but because i like you and respect your pluck ill do you a good turn before we part i dont want you to waste time barking up the wrong tree you talk about how the new squire got the money to buy and the ruin of the old squire and all the rest of it well ill give you a hint about that a hint about something precious few people know  i am very grateful said fisher gravely  what is it  its in two words said the other  the new squire was quite poor when he bought the old squire was quite rich when he sold  horne fisher looked at him thoughtfully as he turned away abruptly and busied himself with the papers on his desk then fisher uttered a short phrase of thanks and farewell and went out into the street still very thoughtful  his reflection seemed to end in resolution and falling into a more rapid stride he passed out of the little town along a road leading toward the gate of the great park the country seat of sir francis verner a glitter of sunlight made the early winter more like a late autumn and the dark woods were touched here and there with red and golden leaves like the last rays of a lost sunset from a higher part of the road he had seen the long classical facade of the great house with its many windows almost immediately beneath him but when the road ran down under the wall of the estate topped with towering trees behind he realized that it was half a mile round to the lodge gates after walking for a few minutes along the lane however he came to a place where the wall had cracked and was in process of repair as it was there was a great gap in the gray masonry that looked at first as black as a cavern and only showed at a second glance the twilight of the twinkling trees there was something fascinating about that unexpected gate like the opening of a fairy tale  horne fisher had in him something of the aristocrat which is very near to the anarchist it was characteristic of him that he turned into this dark and irregular entry as casually as into his own front door merely thinking that it would be a short cut to the house he made his way through the dim wood for some distance and with some difficulty until there began to shine through the trees a level light in lines of silver which he did not at first understand the next moment he had come out into the daylight at the top of a steep bank at the bottom of which a path ran round the rim of a large ornamental lake the sheet of water which he had seen shimmering through the trees was of considerable extent but was walled in on every side with woods which were not only dark but decidedly dismal at one end of the path was a classical statue of some nameless nymph and at the other end it was flanked by two classical urns but the marble was weatherstained and streaked with green and gray a hundred other signs smaller but more significant told him that he had come on some outlying corner of the grounds neglected and seldom visited in the middle of the lake was what appeared to be an island and on the island what appeared to be meant for a classical temple not open like a temple of the winds but with a blank wall between its doric pillars we may say it only seemed like an island because a second glance revealed a low causeway of flat stones running up to it from the shore and turning it into a peninsula and certainly it only seemed like a temple for nobody knew better than horne fisher that no god had ever dwelt in that shrine  thats what makes all this classical landscape gardening so desolate he said to himself more desolate than stonehenge or the pyramids we dont believe in egyptian mythology but the egyptians did and i suppose even the druids believed in druidism but the eighteenthcentury gentleman who built these temples didnt believe in venus or mercury any more than we do thats why the reflection of those pale pillars in the lake is truly only the shadow of a shade they were men of the age of reason they who filled their gardens with these stone nymphs had less hope than any men in all history of really meeting a nymph in the forest  his monologue stopped abruptly with a sharp noise like a thundercrack that rolled in dreary echoes round the dismal mere he knew at once what it wassomebody had fired off a gun but as to the meaning of it he was momentarily staggered and strange thoughts thronged into his mind the next moment he laughed for he saw lying a little way along the path below him the dead bird that the shot had brought down  at the same moment however he saw something else which interested him more a ring of dense trees ran round the back of the island temple framing the facade of it in dark foliage and he could have sworn he saw a stir as of something moving among the leaves the next moment his suspicion was confirmed for a rather ragged figure came from under the shadow of the temple and began to move along the causeway that led to the bank even at that distance the figure was conspicuous by its great height and fisher could see that the man carried a gun under his arm there came back into his memory at once the name long adam the poacher  with a rapid sense of strategy he sometimes showed fisher sprang from the bank and raced round the lake to the head of the little pier of stones if once a man reached the mainland he could easily vanish into the woods but when fisher began to advance along the stones toward the island the man was cornered in a blind alley and could only back toward the temple putting his broad shoulders against it he stood as if at bay he was a comparatively young man with fine lines in his lean face and figure and a mop of ragged red hair the look in his eyes might well have been disquieting to anyone left alone with him on an island in the middle of a lake  good morning said horne fisher pleasantly  i thought at first you were a murderer but it seems unlikely somehow that the partridge rushed between us and died for love of me like the heroines in the romances so i suppose you are a poacher  i suppose you would call me a poacher answered the man and his voice was something of a surprise coming from such a scarecrow it had that hard fastidiousness to be found in those who have made a fight for their own refinement among rough surroundings i consider i have a perfect right to shoot game in this place but i am well aware that people of your sort take me for a thief and i suppose you will try to land me in jail  there are preliminary difficulties replied fisher  to begin with the mistake is flattering but i am not a gamekeeper still less am i three gamekeepers who would be i imagine about your fighting weight but i confess i have another reason for not wanting to jail you  and what is that asked the other  only that i quite agree with you answered fisher  i dont exactly say you have a right to poach but i never could see that it was as wrong as being a thief it seems to me against the whole normal notion of property that a man should own something because it flies across his garden he might as well own the wind or think he could write his name on a morning cloud besides if we want poor people to respect property we must give them some property to respect you ought to have land of your own and im going to give you some if i can  going to give me some land repeated long adam  i apologize for addressing you as if you were a public meeting said fisher but i am an entirely new kind of public man who says the same thing in public and in private ive said this to a hundred huge meetings throughout the country and i say it to you on this queer little island in this dismal pond i would cut up a big estate like this into small estates for everybody even for poachers i would do in england as they did in irelandbuy the big men out if possible get them out anyhow a man like you ought to have a little place of his own i dont say you could keep pheasants but you might keep chickens  the man stiffened suddenly and he seemed at once to blanch and flame at the promise as if it were a threat  chickens he repeated with a passion of contempt  why do you object asked the placid candidate because keeping hens is rather a mild amusement for a poacher what about poaching eggs  because i am not a poacher cried adam in a rending voice that rang round the hollow shrines and urns like the echoes of his gun because the partridge lying dead over there is my partridge because the land you are standing on is my land because my own land was only taken from me by a crime and a worse crime than poaching this has been a single estate for hundreds and hundreds of years and if you or any meddlesome mountebank comes here and talks of cutting it up like a cake if i ever hear a word more of you and your leveling lies  you seem to be a rather turbulent public observed horne fisher but do go on what will happen if i try to divide this estate decently among decent people  the poacher had recovered a grim composure as he replied there will be no partridge to rush in between  with that he turned his back evidently resolved to say no more and walked past the temple to the extreme end of the islet where he stood staring into the water fisher followed him but when his repeated questions evoked no answer turned back toward the shore in doing so he took a second and closer look at the artificial temple and noted some curious things about it most of these theatrical things were as thin as theatrical scenery and he expected the classic shrine to be a shallow thing a mere shell or mask but there was some substantial bulk of it behind buried in the trees which had a gray labyrinthian look like serpents of stone and lifted a load of leafy towers to the sky but what arrested fishers eye was that in this bulk of graywhite stone behind there was a single door with great rusty bolts outside the bolts however were not shot across so as to secure it then he walked round the small building and found no other opening except one small grating like a ventilator high up in the wall he retraced his steps thoughtfully along the causeway to the banks of the lake and sat down on the stone steps between the two sculptured funeral urns then he lit a cigarette and smoked it in ruminant manner eventually he took out a notebook and wrote down various phrases numbering and renumbering them till they stood in the following order 1 squire hawker disliked his first wife 2 he married his second wife for her money 3 long adam says the estate is really his 4 long adam hangs round the island temple which looks like a prison 5 squire hawker was not poor when he gave up the estate 6 verner was poor when he got the estate  he gazed at these notes with a gravity which gradually turned to a hard smile threw away his cigarette and resumed his search for a short cut to the great house he soon picked up the path which winding among clipped hedges and flower beds brought him in front of its long palladian facade it had the usual appearance of being not a private house but a sort of public building sent into exile in the provinces  he first found himself in the presence of the butler who really looked much older than the building for the architecture was dated as georgian but the mans face under a highly unnatural brown wig was wrinkled with what might have been centuries only his prominent eyes were alive and alert as if with protest fisher glanced at him and then stopped and said  excuse me werent you with the late squire mr hawker  yes sir said the man gravely  usher is my name what can i do for you  only take me into sir francis verner replied the visitor  sir francis verner was sitting in an easy chair beside a small table in a large room hung with tapestries on the table were a small flask and glass with the green glimmer of a liqueur and a cup of black coffee he was clad in a quiet gray suit with a moderately harmonious purple tie but fisher saw something about the turn of his fair mustache and the lie of his flat hairit suddenly revealed that his name was franz werner  you are mr horne fisher he said  wont you sit down  no thank you replied fisher  i fear this is not a friendly occasion and i shall remain standing possibly you know that i am already standingstanding for parliament in fact  i am aware we are political opponents replied verner raising his eyebrows but i think it would be better if we fought in a sporting spirit in a spirit of english fair play  much better assented fisher  it would be much better if you were english and very much better if you had ever played fair but what ive come to say can be said very shortly i dont quite know how we stand with the law about that old hawker story but my chief object is to prevent england being entirely ruled by people like you so whatever the law would say i will say no more if you will retire from the election at once  you are evidently a lunatic said verner  my psychology may be a little abnormal replied horne fisher in a rather hazy manner i am subject to dreams especially daydreams sometimes what is happening to me grows vivid in a curious double way as if it had happened before have you ever had that mystical feeling that things have happened before  i hope you are a harmless lunatic said verner  but fisher was still staring in an absent fashion at the golden gigantic figures and traceries of brown and red in the tapestries on the walls then he looked again at verner and resumed i have a feeling that this interview has happened before here in this tapestried room and we are two ghosts revisiting a haunted chamber but it was squire hawker who sat where you sit and it was you who stood where i stand he paused a moment and then added with simplicity i suppose i am a blackmailer too  if you are said sir francis i promise you you shall go to jail but his face had a shade on it that looked like the reflection of the green wine gleaming on the table horne fisher regarded him steadily and answered quietly enough  blackmailers do not always go to jail sometimes they go to parliament but though parliament is rotten enough already you shall not go there if i can help it i am not so criminal as you were in bargaining with crime you made a squire give up his country seat i only ask you to give up your parliamentary seat  sir francis verner sprang to his feet and looked about for one of the bell ropes of the oldfashioned curtained room  where is usher he cried with a livid face  and who is usher said fisher softly  i wonder how much usher knows of the truth  verners hand fell from the bell rope and after standing for a moment with rolling eyes he strode abruptly from the room fisher went but by the other door by which he had entered and seeing no sign of usher let himself out and betook himself again toward the town  that night he put an electric torch in his pocket and set out alone in the darkness to add the last links to his argument there was much that he did not know yet but he thought he knew where he could find the knowledge the night closed dark and stormy and the black gap in the wall looked blacker than ever the wood seemed to have grown thicker and darker in a day if the deserted lake with its black woods and gray urns and images looked desolate even by daylight under the night and the growing storm it seemed still more like the pool of acheron in the land of lost souls as he stepped carefully along the jetty stones he seemed to be traveling farther and farther into the abyss of night and to have left behind him the last points from which it would be possible to signal to the land of the living the lake seemed to have grown larger than a sea but a sea of black and slimy waters that slept with abominable serenity as if they had washed out the world there was so much of this nightmare sense of extension and expansion that he was strangely surprised to come to his desert island so soon but he knew it for a place of inhuman silence and solitude and he felt as if he had been walking for years  nerving himself to a more normal mood he paused under one of the dark dragon trees that branched out above him and taking out his torch turned in the direction of the door at the back of the temple it was unbolted as before and the thought stirred faintly in him that it was slightly open though only by a crack the more he thought of it however the more certain he grew that this was but one of the common illusions of light coming from a different angle he studied in a more scientific spirit the details of the door with its rusty bolts and hinges when he became conscious of something very near himindeed nearly above his head something was dangling from the tree that was not a broken branch for some seconds he stood as still as a stone and as cold what he saw above him were the legs of a man hanging presumably a dead man hanged but the next moment he knew better the man was literally alive and kicking and an instant after he had dropped to the ground and turned on the intruder simultaneously three or four other trees seemed to come to life in the same fashion five or six other figures had fallen on their feet from these unnatural nests it was as if the place were an island of monkeys but a moment after they had made a stampede toward him and when they laid their hands on him he knew that they were men  with the electric torch in his hand he struck the foremost of them so furiously in the face that the man stumbled and rolled over on the slimy grass but the torch was broken and extinguished leaving everything in a denser obscurity he flung another man flat against the temple wall so that he slid to the ground but a third and fourth carried fisher off his feet and began to bear him struggling toward the doorway even in the bewilderment of the battle he was conscious that the door was standing open somebody was summoning the roughs from inside  the moment they were within they hurled him upon a sort of bench or bed with violence but no damage for the settee or whatever it was seemed to be comfortably cushioned for his reception their violence had in it a great element of haste and before he could rise they had all rushed for the door to escape whatever bandits they were that infested this desert island they were obviously uneasy about their job and very anxious to be quit of it he had the flying fancy that regular criminals would hardly be in such a panic the next moment the great door crashed to and he could hear the bolts shriek as they shot into their place and the feet of the retreating men scampering and stumbling along the causeway but rapidly as it happened it did not happen before fisher had done something that he wanted to do unable to rise from his sprawling attitude in that flash of time he had shot out one of his long legs and hooked it round the ankle of the last man disappearing through the door the man swayed and toppled over inside the prison chamber and the door closed between him and his fleeing companions clearly they were in too much haste to realize that they had left one of their company behind  the man sprang to his feet again and hammered and kicked furiously at the door fishers sense of humor began to recover from the struggle and he sat up on his sofa with something of his native nonchalance but as he listened to the captive captor beating on the door of the prison a new and curious reflection came to him  the natural course for a man thus wishing to attract his friends attention would be to call out to shout as well as kick this man was making as much noise as he could with his feet and hands but not a sound came from his throat why couldnt he speak at first he thought the man might be gagged which was manifestly absurd then his fancy fell back on the ugly idea that the man was dumb he hardly knew why it was so ugly an idea but it affected his imagination in a dark and disproportionate fashion there seemed to be something creepy about the idea of being left in a dark room with a deaf mute it was almost as if such a defect were a deformity it was almost as if it went with other and worse deformities it was as if the shape he could not trace in the darkness were some shape that should not see the sun  then he had a flash of sanity and also of insight the explanation was very simple but rather interesting obviously the man did not use his voice because he did not wish his voice to be recognized he hoped to escape from that dark place before fisher found out who he was and who was he one thing at least was clear he was one or other of the four or five men with whom fisher had already talked in these parts and in the development of that strange story  now i wonder who you are he said aloud with all his old lazy urbanity i suppose its no use trying to throttle you in order to find out it would be displeasing to pass the night with a corpse besides i might be the corpse ive got no matches and ive smashed my torch so i can only speculate who could you be now let us think  the man thus genially addressed had desisted from drumming on the door and retreated sullenly into a corner as fisher continued to address him in a flowing monologue  probably you are the poacher who says he isnt a poacher he says hes a landed proprietor but he will permit me to inform him that whatever he is hes a fool what hope can there ever be of a free peasantry in england if the peasants themselves are such snobs as to want to be gentlemen how can we make a democracy with no democrats as it is you want to be a landlord and so you consent to be a criminal and in that you know you are rather like somebody else and now i think of it perhaps you are somebody else  there was a silence broken by breathing from the corner and the murmur of the rising storm that came in through the small grating above the mans head horne fisher continued  are you only a servant perhaps that rather sinister old servant who was butler to hawker and verner if so you are certainly the only link between the two periods but if so why do you degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner when you at least saw the last of a genuine national gentry people like you are generally at least patriotic doesnt england mean anything to you mr usher all of which eloquence is possibly wasted as perhaps you are not mr usher  more likely you are verner himself and its no good wasting eloquence to make you ashamed of yourself nor is it any good to curse you for corrupting england nor are you the right person to curse it is the english who deserve to be cursed and are cursed because they allowed such vermin to crawl into the high places of their heroes and their kings i wont dwell on the idea that youre verner or the throttling might begin after all is there anyone else you could be surely youre not some servant of the other rival organization i cant believe youre gryce the agent and yet gryce had a spark of the fanatic in his eye too and men will do extraordinary things in these paltry feuds of politics or if not the servant is it the    no i cant believe it    not the red blood of manhood and liberty    not the democratic ideal     he sprang up in excitement and at the same moment a growl of thunder came through the grating beyond the storm had broken and with it a new light broke on his mind there was something else that might happen in a moment  do you know what that means he cried  it means that god himself may hold a candle to show me your infernal face  then next moment came a crash of thunder but before the thunder a white light had filled the whole room for a single split second  fisher had seen two things in front of him one was the blackandwhite pattern of the iron grating against the sky the other was the face in the corner it was the face of his brother  nothing came from horne fishers lips except a christian name which was followed by a silence more dreadful than the dark at last the other figure stirred and sprang up and the voice of harry fisher was heard for the first time in that horrible room  youve seen me i suppose he said and we may as well have a light now you could have turned it on at any time if youd found the switch  he pressed a button in the wall and all the details of that room sprang into something stronger than daylight indeed the details were so unexpected that for a moment they turned the captives rocking mind from the last personal revelation the room so far from being a dungeon cell was more like a drawingroom even a ladys drawingroom except for some boxes of cigars and bottles of wine that were stacked with books and magazines on a side table a second glance showed him that the more masculine fittings were quite recent and that the more feminine background was quite old his eye caught a strip of faded tapestry which startled him into speech to the momentary oblivion of bigger matters  this place was furnished from the great house he said  yes replied the other and i think you know why  i think i do said horne fisher and before i go on to more extraordinary things i will say what i think squire hawker played both the bigamist and the bandit his first wife was not dead when he married the jewess she was imprisoned on this island she bore him a child here who now haunts his birthplace under the name of long adam a bankruptcy company promoter named werner discovered the secret and blackmailed the squire into surrendering the estate thats all quite clear and very easy and now let me go on to something more difficult and that is for you to explain what the devil you are doing kidnaping your born brother  after a pause henry fisher answered  i suppose you didnt expect to see me he said  but after all what could you expect  im afraid i dont follow said horne fisher  i mean what else could you expect after making such a muck of it said his brother sulkily we all thought you were so clever how could we know you were going to bewell really such a rotten failure  this is rather curious said the candidate frowning  without vanity i was not under the impression that my candidature was a failure all the big meetings were successful and crowds of people have promised me votes  i should jolly well think they had said henry grimly youve made a landslide with your confounded acres and a cow and verner can hardly get a vote anywhere oh its too rotten for anything  what on earth do you mean  why you lunatic cried henry in tones of ringing sincerity you dont suppose you were meant to win the seat did you oh its too childish i tell you verners got to get in of course hes got to get in hes to have the exchequer next session and theres the egyptian loan and lord knows what else we only wanted you to split the reform vote because accidents might happen after hughes had made a score at barkington  i see said fisher and you i think are a pillar and ornament of the reform party as you say i am not clever  the appeal to party loyalty fell on deaf ears for the pillar of reform was brooding on other things at last he said in a more troubled voice  i didnt want you to catch me i knew it would be a shock but i tell you what you never would have caught me if i hadnt come here myself to see they didnt ill treat you and to make sure everything was as comfortable as it could be there was even a sort of break in his voice as he added i got those cigars because i knew you liked them  emotions are queer things and the idiocy of this concession suddenly softened horne fisher like an unfathomable pathos  never mind old chap he said well say no more about it ill admit that youre really as kindhearted and affectionate a scoundrel and hypocrite as ever sold himself to ruin his country there i cant say handsomer than that thank you for the cigars old man ill have one if you dont mind  by the time that horne fisher had ended his telling of this story to harold march they had come out into one of the public parks and taken a seat on a rise of ground overlooking wide green spaces under a blue and empty sky and there was something incongruous in the words with which the narration ended  i have been in that room ever since said horne fisher  i am in it now i won the election but i never went to the house my life has been a life in that little room on that lonely island plenty of books and cigars and luxuries plenty of knowledge and interest and information but never a voice out of that tomb to reach the world outside i shall probably die there and he smiled as he looked across the vast green park to the gray horizon    viii the vengeance of the statue  it was on the sunny veranda of a seaside hotel overlooking a pattern of flower beds and a strip of blue sea that horne fisher and harold march had their final explanation which might be called an explosion  harold march had come to the little table and sat down at it with a subdued excitement smoldering in his somewhat cloudy and dreamy blue eyes in the newspapers which he tossed from him on to the table there was enough to explain some if not all of his emotion public affairs in every department had reached a crisis the government which had stood so long that men were used to it as they are used to a hereditary despotism had begun to be accused of blunders and even of financial abuses some said that the experiment of attempting to establish a peasantry in the west of england on the lines of an early fancy of horne fishers had resulted in nothing but dangerous quarrels with more industrial neighbors there had been particular complaints of the ill treatment of harmless foreigners chiefly asiatics who happened to be employed in the new scientific works constructed on the coast indeed the new power which had arisen in siberia backed by japan and other powerful allies was inclined to take the matter up in the interests of its exiled subjects and there had been wild talk about ambassadors and ultimatums but something much more serious in its personal interest for march himself seemed to fill his meeting with his friend with a mixture of embarrassment and indignation  perhaps it increased his annoyance that there was a certain unusual liveliness about the usually languid figure of fisher the ordinary image of him in marchs mind was that of a pallid and baldbrowed gentleman who seemed to be prematurely old as well as prematurely bald he was remembered as a man who expressed the opinions of a pessimist in the language of a lounger even now march could not be certain whether the change was merely a sort of masquerade of sunshine or that effect of clear colors and cleancut outlines that is always visible on the parade of a marine resort relieved against the blue dado of the sea but fisher had a flower in his buttonhole and his friend could have sworn he carried his cane with something almost like the swagger of a fighter with such clouds gathering over england the pessimist seemed to be the only man who carried his own sunshine  look here said harold march abruptly youve been no end of a friend to me and i never was so proud of a friendship before but theres something i must get off my chest the more i found out the less i understood how you could stand it and i tell you im going to stand it no longer  horne fisher gazed across at him gravely and attentively but rather as if he were a long way off  you know i always liked you said fisher quietly but i also respect you which is not always the same thing you may possibly guess that i like a good many people i dont respect perhaps it is my tragedy perhaps it is my fault but you are very different and i promise you this that i will never try to keep you as somebody to be liked at the price of your not being respected  i know you are magnanimous said march after a silence and yet you tolerate and perpetuate everything that is mean then after another silence he added do you remember when we first met when you were fishing in that brook in the affair of the target and do you remember you said that after all it might do no harm if i could blow the whole tangle of this society to hell with dynamite  yes and what of that asked fisher  only that im going to blow it to hell with dynamite said harold march and i think it right to give you fair warning for a long time i didnt believe things were as bad as you said they were but i never felt as if i could have bottled up what you knew supposing you really knew it well the long and the short of it is that ive got a conscience and now at last ive also got a chance ive been put in charge of a big independent paper with a free hand and were going to open a cannonade on corruption  that will beattwood i suppose said fisher reflectively timber merchant knows a lot about china  he knows a lot about england said march doggedly and now i know it too were not going to hush it up any longer the people of this country have a right to know how theyre ruledor rather ruined the chancellor is in the pocket of the money lenders and has to do as he is told otherwise hes bankrupt and a bad sort of bankruptcy too with nothing but cards and actresses behind it the prime minister was in the petrolcontract business and deep in it too the foreign minister is a wreck of drink and drugs when you say that plainly about a man who may send thousands of englishmen to die for nothing youre called personal if a poor engine driver gets drunk and sends thirty or forty people to death nobody complains of the exposure being personal the engine driver is not a person  i quite agree with you said fisher calmly  you are perfectly right  if you agree with us why the devil dont you act with us demanded his friend if you think its right why dont you do whats right its awful to think of a man of your abilities simply blocking the road to reform  we have often talked about that replied fisher with the same composure the prime minister is my fathers friend the foreign minister married my sister the chancellor of the exchequer is my first cousin i mention the genealogy in some detail just now for a particular reason the truth is i have a curious kind of cheerfulness at the moment it isnt altogether the sun and the sea sir i am enjoying an emotion that is entirely new to me a happy sensation i never remember having had before  what the devil do you mean  i am feeling proud of my family said horne fisher  harold march stared at him with round blue eyes and seemed too much mystified even to ask a question fisher leaned back in his chair in his lazy fashion and smiled as he continued  look here my dear fellow let me ask a question in turn you imply that i have always known these things about my unfortunate kinsmen so i have do you suppose that attwood hasnt always known them do you suppose he hasnt always known you as an honest man who would say these things when he got a chance why does attwood unmuzzle you like a dog at this moment after all these years i know why he does i know a good many things far too many things and therefore as i have the honor to remark i am proud of my family at last  but why repeated march rather feebly  i am proud of the chancellor because he gambled and the foreign minister because he drank and the prime minister because he took a commission on a contract said fisher firmly i am proud of them because they did these things and can be denounced for them and know they can be denounced for them and are standing firm for all that i take off my hat to them because they are defying blackmail and refusing to smash their country to save themselves i salute them as if they were going to die on the battlefield  after a pause he continued  and it will be a battlefield too and not a metaphorical one we have yielded to foreign financiers so long that now it is war or ruin even the people even the country people are beginning to suspect that they are being ruined that is the meaning of the regrettable incidents in the newspapers  the meaning of the outrages on orientals asked march  the meaning of the outrages on orientals replied fisher is that the financiers have introduced chinese labor into this country with the deliberate intention of reducing workmen and peasants to starvation our unhappy politicians have made concession after concession and now they are asking concessions which amount to our ordering a massacre of our own poor if we do not fight now we shall never fight again they will have put england in an economic position of starving in a week but we are going to fight now i shouldnt wonder if there were an ultimatum in a week and an invasion in a fortnight all the past corruption and cowardice is hampering us of course the west country is pretty stormy and doubtful even in a military sense and the irish regiments there that are supposed to support us by the new treaty are pretty well in mutiny for of course this infernal coolie capitalism is being pushed in ireland too but its to stop now and if the government message of reassurance gets through to them in time they may turn up after all by the time the enemy lands for my poor old gang is going to stand to its guns at last of course its only natural that when they have been whitewashed for half a century as paragons their sins should come back on them at the very moment when they are behaving like men for the first time in their lives well i tell you march i know them inside out and i know they are behaving like heroes every man of them ought to have a statue and on the pedestal words like those of the noblest ruffian of the revolution que mon nom soit fletri que la france soit libre  good god cried march shall we never get to the bottom of your mines and countermines  after a silence fisher answered in a lower voice looking his friend in the eyes  did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them he asked gently did you think i had found nothing but filth in the deep seas into which fate has thrown me believe me you never know the best about men till you know the worst about them it does not dispose of their strange human souls to know that they were exhibited to the world as impossibly impeccable wax works who never looked after a woman or knew the meaning of a bribe even in a palace life can be lived well and even in a parliament life can be lived with occasional efforts to live it well i tell you it is as true of these rich fools and rascals as it is true of every poor footpad and pickpocket that only god knows how good they have tried to be god alone knows what the conscience can survive or how a man who has lost his honor will still try to save his soul  there was another silence and march sat staring at the table and fisher at the sea then fisher suddenly sprang to his feet and caught up his hat and stick with all his new alertness and even pugnacity  look here old fellow he cried let us make a bargain before you open your campaign for attwood come down and stay with us for one week to hear what were really doing i mean with the faithful few formerly known as the old gang occasionally to be described as the low lot there are really only five of us that are quite fixed and organizing the national defense and were living like a garrison in a sort of brokendown hotel in kent come and see what were really doing and what there is to be done and do us justice and after that with unalterable love and affection for you publish and be damned  thus it came about that in the last week before war when events moved most rapidly harold march found himself one of a sort of small house party of the people he was proposing to denounce they were living simply enough for people with their tastes in an old brownbrick inn faced with ivy and surrounded by rather dismal gardens at the back of the building the garden ran up very steeply to a road along the ridge above and a zigzag path scaled the slope in sharp angles turning to and fro amid evergreens so somber that they might rather be called everblack here and there up the slope were statues having all the cold monstrosity of such minor ornaments of the eighteenth century and a whole row of them ran as on a terrace along the last bank at the bottom opposite the back door this detail fixed itself first in marchs mind merely because it figured in the first conversation he had with one of the cabinet ministers  the cabinet ministers were rather older than he had expected to find them the prime minister no longer looked like a boy though he still looked a little like a baby but it was one of those old and venerable babies and the baby had soft gray hair everything about him was soft to his speech and his way of walking but over and above that his chief function seemed to be sleep people left alone with him got so used to his eyes being closed that they were almost startled when they realized in the stillness that the eyes were wide open and even watching one thing at least would always make the old gentleman open his eyes the one thing he really cared for in this world was his hobby of armored weapons especially eastern weapons and he would talk for hours about damascus blades and arab swordmanship lord james herries the chancellor of the exchequer was a short dark sturdy man with a very sallow face and a very sullen manner which contrasted with the gorgeous flower in his buttonhole and his festive trick of being always slightly overdressed it was something of a euphemism to call him a wellknown man about town there was perhaps more mystery in the question of how a man who lived for pleasure seemed to get so little pleasure out of it sir david archer the foreign secretary was the only one of them who was a selfmade man and the only one of them who looked like an aristocrat he was tall and thin and very handsome with a grizzled beard his gray hair was very curly and even rose in front in two rebellious ringlets that seemed to the fanciful to tremble like the antennae of some giant insect or to stir sympathetically with the restless tufted eyebrows over his rather haggard eyes for the foreign secretary made no secret of his somewhat nervous condition whatever might be the cause of it  do you know that mood when one could scream because a mat is crooked he said to march as they walked up and down in the back garden below the line of dingy statues women get into it when theyve worked too hard and ive been working pretty hard lately of course it drives me mad when herries will wear his hat a little crookedhabit of looking like a gay dog sometime i swear ill knock it off that statue of britannia over there isnt quite straight it sticks forward a bit as if the lady were going to topple over the damned thing is that it doesnt topple over and be done with it see its clamped with an iron prop dont be surprised if i get up in the middle of the night to hike it down  they paced the path for a few moments in silence and then he continued its odd those little things seem specially big when there are bigger things to worry about wed better go in and do some work  horne fisher evidently allowed for all the neurotic possibilities of archer and the dissipated habits of herries and whatever his faith in their present firmness did not unduly tax their time and attention even in the case of the prime minister he had got the consent of the latter finally to the committing of the important documents with the orders to the western armies to the care of a less conspicuous and more solid personan uncle of his named horne hewitt a rather colorless country squire who had been a good soldier and was the military adviser of the committee he was charged with expediting the government pledge along with the concerted military plans to the halfmutinous command in the west and the still more urgent task of seeing that it did not fall into the hands of the enemy who might appear at any moment from the east over and above this military official the only other person present was a police official a certain doctor prince originally a police surgeon and now a distinguished detective sent to be a bodyguard to the group he was a squarefaced man with big spectacles and a grimace that expressed the intention of keeping his mouth shut nobody else shared their captivity except the hotel proprietor a crusty kentish man with a crabapple face one or two of his servants and another servant privately attached to lord james herries he was a young scotchman named campbell who looked much more distinguished than his biliouslooking master having chestnut hair and a long saturnine face with large but fine features he was probably the one really efficient person in the house  after about four days of the informal council march had come to feel a sort of grotesque sublimity about these dubious figures defiant in the twilight of danger as if they were hunchbacks and cripples left alone to defend a town all were working hard and he himself looked up from writing a page of memoranda in a private room to see horne fisher standing in the doorway accoutered as if for travel he fancied that fisher looked a little pale and after a moment that gentleman shut the door behind him and said quietly  well the worst has happened or nearly the worst  the enemy has landed cried march and sprang erect out of his chair  oh i knew the enemy would land said fisher with composure yes hes landed but thats not the worst that could happen the worst is that theres a leak of some sort even from this fortress of ours its been a bit of a shock to me i can tell you though i suppose its illogical after all i was full of admiration at finding three honest men in politics i ought not to be full of astonishment if i find only two  he ruminated a moment and then said in such a fashion that march could hardly tell if he were changing the subject or no  its hard at first to believe that a fellow like herries who had pickled himself in vice like vinegar can have any scruple left but about that ive noticed a curious thing patriotism is not the first virtue patriotism rots into prussianism when you pretend it is the first virtue but patriotism is sometimes the last virtue a man will swindle or seduce who will not sell his country but who knows  but what is to be done cried march indignantly  my uncle has the papers safe enough replied fisher and is sending them west tonight but somebody is trying to get at them from outside i fear with the assistance of somebody inside all i can do at present is to try to head off the man outside and i must get away now and do it i shall be back in about twentyfour hours while im away i want you to keep an eye on these people and find out what you can au revoir he vanished down the stairs and from the window march could see him mount a motor cycle and trail away toward the neighboring town  on the following morning march was sitting in the window seat of the old inn parlor which was oakpaneled and ordinarily rather dark but on that occasion it was full of the white light of a curiously clear morningthe moon had shone brilliantly for the last two or three nights he was himself somewhat in shadow in the corner of the window seat and lord james herries coming in hastily from the garden behind did not see him lord james clutched the back of a chair as if to steady himself and sitting down abruptly at the table littered with the last meal poured himself out a tumbler of brandy and drank it he sat with his back to march but his yellow face appeared in a round mirror beyond and the tinge of it was like that of some horrible malady as march moved he started violently and faced round  my god he cried have you seen whats outside  outside repeated the other glancing over his shoulder at the garden  oh go and look for yourself cried herries in a sort of fury hewitts murdered and his papers stolen thats all  he turned his back again and sat down with a thud his square shoulders were shaking harold march darted out of the doorway into the back garden with its steep slope of statues  the first thing he saw was doctor prince the detective peering through his spectacles at something on the ground the second was the thing he was peering at even after the sensational news he had heard inside the sight was something of a sensation  the monstrous stone image of britannia was lying prone and face downward on the garden path and there stuck out at random from underneath it like the legs of a smashed fly an arm clad in a white shirt sleeve and a leg clad in a khaki trouser and hair of the unmistakable sandy gray that belonged to horne fishers unfortunate uncle there were pools of blood and the limbs were quite stiff in death  couldnt this have been an accident said march finding words at last  look for yourself i say repeated the harsh voice of herries who had followed him with restless movements out of the door the papers are gone i tell you the fellow tore the coat off the corpse and cut the papers out of the inner pocket theres the coat over there on the bank with the great slash in it  but wait a minute said the detective prince quietly in that case there seems to be something of a mystery a murderer might somehow have managed to throw the statue down on him as he seems to have done but i bet he couldnt easily have lifted it up again ive tried and im sure it would want three men at least yet we must suppose on that theory that the murderer first knocked him down as he walked past using the statue as a stone club then lifted it up again took him out and deprived him of his coat then put him back again in the posture of death and neatly replaced the statue i tell you its physically impossible and how else could he have unclothed a man covered with that stone monument its worse than the conjurers trick when a man shuffles a coat off with his wrists tied  could he have thrown down the statue after hed stripped the corpse asked march  and why asked prince sharply  if hed killed his man and got his papers hed be away like the wind he wouldnt potter about in a garden excavating the pedestals of statues besideshullo whos that up there  high on the ridge above them drawn in dark thin lines against the sky was a figure looking so long and lean as to be almost spidery the dark silhouette of the head showed two small tufts like horns and they could almost have sworn that the horns moved  archer shouted herries with sudden passion and called to him with curses to come down the figure drew back at the first cry with an agitated movement so abrupt as almost to be called an antic the next moment the man seemed to reconsider and collect himself and began to come down the zigzag garden path but with obvious reluctance his feet falling in slower and slower rhythm through marchs mind were throbbing the phrases that this man himself had used about going mad in the middle of the night and wrecking the stone figure just so he could fancy the maniac who had done such a thing might climb the crest of the hill in that feverish dancing fashion and look down on the wreck he had made but the wreck he had made here was not only a wreck of stone  when the man emerged at last on to the garden path with the full light on his face and figure he was walking slowly indeed but easily and with no appearance of fear  this is a terrible thing he said  i saw it from above i was taking a stroll along the ridge  do you mean that you saw the murder demanded march or the accident i mean did you see the statue fall  no said archer i mean i saw the statue fallen  prince seemed to be paying but little attention his eye was riveted on an object lying on the path a yard or two from the corpse it seemed to be a rusty iron bar bent crooked at one end  one thing i dont understand he said is all this blood the poor fellows skull isnt smashed most likely his neck is broken but blood seems to have spouted as if all his arteries were severed i was wondering if some other instrument    that iron thing for instance but i dont see that even that is sharp enough i suppose nobody knows what it is  i know what it is said archer in his deep but somewhat shaky voice ive seen it in my nightmares it was the iron clamp or prop on the pedestal stuck on to keep the wretched image upright when it began to wobble i suppose anyhow it was always stuck in the stonework there and i suppose it came out when the thing collapsed  doctor prince nodded but he continued to look down at the pools of blood and the bar of iron  im certain theres something more underneath all this he said at last perhaps something more underneath the statue i have a huge sort of hunch that there is we are four men now and between us we can lift that great tombstone there  they all bent their strength to the business there was a silence save for heavy breathing and then after an instant of the tottering and staggering of eight legs the great carven column of rock was rolled away and the body lying in its shirt and trousers was fully revealed the spectacles of doctor prince seemed almost to enlarge with a restrained radiance like great eyes for other things were revealed also one was that the unfortunate hewitt had a deep gash across the jugular which the triumphant doctor instantly identified as having been made with a sharp steel edge like a razor the other was that immediately under the bank lay littered three shining scraps of steel each nearly a foot long one pointed and another fitted into a gorgeously jeweled hilt or handle it was evidently a sort of long oriental knife long enough to be called a sword but with a curious wavy edge and there was a touch or two of blood on the point  i should have expected more blood hardly on the point observed doctor prince thoughtfully but this is certainly the instrument the slash was certainly made with a weapon shaped like this and probably the slashing of the pocket as well i suppose the brute threw in the statue by way of giving him a public funeral  march did not answer he was mesmerized by the strange stones that glittered on the strange sword hilt and their possible significance was broadening upon him like a dreadful dawn it was a curious asiatic weapon he knew what name was connected in his memory with curious asiatic weapons lord james spoke his secret thought for him and yet it startled him like an irrelevance  where is the prime minister  herries had cried suddenly and somehow like the bark of a dog at some discovery  doctor prince turned on him his goggles and his grim face and it was grimmer than ever  i cannot find him anywhere he said  i looked for him at once as soon as i found the papers were gone that servant of yours campbell made a most efficient search but there are no traces  there was a long silence at the end of which herries uttered another cry but upon an entirely new note  well you neednt look for him any longer he said for here he comes along with your friend fisher they look as if theyd been for a little walking tour  the two figures approaching up the path were indeed those of fisher splashed with the mire of travel and carrying a scratch like that of a bramble across one side of his bald forehead and of the great and grayhaired statesman who looked like a baby and was interested in eastern swords and swordmanship but beyond this bodily recognition march could make neither head nor tail of their presence or demeanor which seemed to give a final touch of nonsense to the whole nightmare the more closely he watched them as they stood listening to the revelations of the detective the more puzzled he was by their attitudefisher seemed grieved by the death of his uncle but hardly shocked at it the older man seemed almost openly thinking about something else and neither had anything to suggest about a further pursuit of the fugitive spy and murderer in spite of the prodigious importance of the documents he had stolen when the detective had gone off to busy himself with that department of the business to telephone and write his report when herries had gone back probably to the brandy bottle and the prime minister had blandly sauntered away toward a comfortable armchair in another part of the garden horne fisher spoke directly to harold march  my friend he said i want you to come with me at once there is no one else i can trust so much as that the journey will take us most of the day and the chief business cannot be done till nightfall so we can talk things over thoroughly on the way but i want you to be with me for i rather think it is my hour  march and fisher both had motor bicycles and the first half of their days journey consisted in coasting eastward amid the unconversational noise of those uncomfortable engines but when they came out beyond canterbury into the flats of eastern kent fisher stopped at a pleasant little public house beside a sleepy stream and they sat down to eat and to drink and to speak almost for the first time it was a brilliant afternoon birds were singing in the wood behind and the sun shone full on their ale bench and table but the face of fisher in the strong sunlight had a gravity never seen on it before  before we go any farther he said there is something you ought to know you and i have seen some mysterious things and got to the bottom of them before now and its only right that you should get to the bottom of this one but in dealing with the death of my uncle i must begin at the other end from where our old detective yarns began i will give you the steps of deduction presently if you want to listen to them but i did not reach the truth of this by steps of deduction i will first of all tell you the truth itself because i knew the truth from the first the other cases i approached from the outside but in this case i was inside i myself was the very core and center of everything  something in the speakers pendent eyelids and grave gray eyes suddenly shook march to his foundations and he cried distractedly i dont understand as men do when they fear that they do understand there was no sound for a space but the happy chatter of the birds and then horne fisher said calmly  it was i who killed my uncle if you particularly want more it was i who stole the state papers from him  fisher cried his friend in a strangled voice  let me tell you the whole thing before we part continued the other and let me put it for the sake of clearness as we used to put our old problems now there are two things that are puzzling people about that problem arent there the first is how the murderer managed to slip off the dead mans coat when he was already pinned to the ground with that stone incubus the other which is much smaller and less puzzling is the fact of the sword that cut his throat being slightly stained at the point instead of a good deal more stained at the edge well i can dispose of the first question easily horne hewitt took off his own coat before he was killed i might say he took off his coat to be killed  do you call that an explanation exclaimed march  the words seem more meaningless than the facts  well let us go on to the other facts continued fisher equably the reason that particular sword is not stained at the edge with hewitts blood is that it was not used to kill hewitt  but the doctor protested march declared distinctly that the wound was made by that particular sword  i beg your pardon replied fisher  he did not declare that it was made by that particular sword he declared it was made by a sword of that particular pattern  but it was quite a queer and exceptional pattern argued march surely it is far too fantastic a coincidence to imagine  it was a fantastic coincidence reflected horne fisher its extraordinary what coincidences do sometimes occur by the oddest chance in the world by one chance in a million it so happened that another sword of exactly the same shape was in the same garden at the same time it may be partly explained by the fact that i brought them both into the garden myself    come my dear fellow surely you can see now what it means put those two things together there were two duplicate swords and he took off his coat for himself it may assist your speculations to recall the fact that i am not exactly an assassin  a duel exclaimed march recovering himself  of course i ought to have thought of that but who was the spy who stole the papers  my uncle was the spy who stole the papers replied fisher or who tried to steal the papers when i stopped himin the only way i could the papers that should have gone west to reassure our friends and give them the plans for repelling the invasion would in a few hours have been in the hands of the invader what could i do to have denounced one of our friends at this moment would have been to play into the hands of your friend attwood and all the party of panic and slavery besides it may be that a man over forty has a subconscious desire to die as he has lived and that i wanted in a sense to carry my secrets to the grave perhaps a hobby hardens with age and my hobby has been silence perhaps i feel that i have killed my mothers brother but i have saved my mothers name anyhow i chose a time when i knew you were all asleep and he was walking alone in the garden i saw all the stone statues standing in the moonlight and i myself was like one of those stone statues walking in a voice that was not my own i told him of his treason and demanded the papers and when he refused i forced him to take one of the two swords the swords were among some specimens sent down here for the prime ministers inspection he is a collector you know they were the only equal weapons i could find to cut an ugly tale short we fought there on the path in front of the britannia statue he was a man of great strength but i had somewhat the advantage in skill his sword grazed my forehead almost at the moment when mine sank into the joint in his neck he fell against the statue like caesar against pompeys hanging on to the iron rail his sword was already broken when i saw the blood from that deadly wound everything else went from me i dropped my sword and ran as if to lift him up as i bent toward him something happened too quick for me to follow i do not know whether the iron bar was rotted with rust and came away in his hand or whether he rent it out of the rock with his apelike strength but the thing was in his hand and with his dying energies he swung it over my head as i knelt there unarmed beside him i looked up wildly to avoid the blow and saw above us the great bulk of britannia leaning outward like the figurehead of a ship the next instant i saw it was leaning an inch or two more than usual and all the skies with their outstanding stars seemed to be leaning with it for the third second it was as if the skies fell and in the fourth i was standing in the quiet garden looking down on that flat ruin of stone and bone at which you were looking today he had plucked out the last prop that held up the british goddess and she had fallen and crushed the traitor in her fall i turned and darted for the coat which i knew to contain the package ripped it up with my sword and raced away up the garden path to where my motor bike was waiting on the road above i had every reason for haste but i fled without looking back at the statue and the body and i think the thing i fled from was the sight of that appalling allegory  then i did the rest of what i had to do all through the night and into the daybreak and the daylight i went humming through the villages and markets of south england like a traveling bullet till i came to the headquarters in the west where the trouble was i was just in time i was able to placard the place so to speak with the news that the government had not betrayed them and that they would find supports if they would push eastward against the enemy theres no time to tell you all that happened but i tell you it was the day of my life a triumph like a torchlight procession with torchlights that might have been firebrands the mutinies simmered down the men of somerset and the western counties came pouring into the market places the men who died with arthur and stood firm with alfred the irish regiments rallied to them after a scene like a riot and marched eastward out of the town singing fenian songs there was all that is not understood about the dark laughter of that people in the delight with which even when marching with the english to the defense of england they shouted at the top of their voices high upon the gallows tree stood the noblehearted three    with englands cruel cord about them cast however the chorus was god save ireland and we could all have sung that just then in one sense or another  but there was another side to my mission i carried the plans of the defense and to a great extent luckily the plans of the invasion also i wont worry you with strategics but we knew where the enemy had pushed forward the great battery that covered all his movements and though our friends from the west could hardly arrive in time to intercept the main movement they might get within long artillery range of the battery and shell it if they only knew exactly where it was they could hardly tell that unless somebody round about here sent up some sort of signal but somehow i rather fancy that somebody will  with that he got up from the table and they remounted their machines and went eastward into the advancing twilight of evening the levels of the landscape were repeated in flat strips of floating cloud and the last colors of day clung to the circle of the horizon receding farther and farther behind them was the semicircle of the last hills and it was quite suddenly that they saw afar off the dim line of the sea it was not a strip of bright blue as they had seen it from the sunny veranda but of a sinister and smoky violet a tint that seemed ominous and dark here horne fisher dismounted once more  we must walk the rest of the way he said and the last bit of all i must walk alone  he bent down and began to unstrap something from his bicycle it was something that had puzzled his companion all the way in spite of what held him to more interesting riddles it appeared to be several lengths of pole strapped together and wrapped up in paper fisher took it under his arm and began to pick his way across the turf the ground was growing more tumbled and irregular and he was walking toward a mass of thickets and small woods night grew darker every moment we must not talk any more said fisher i shall whisper to you when you are to halt dont try to follow me then for it will only spoil the show one man can barely crawl safely to the spot and two would certainly be caught  i would follow you anywhere replied march but i would halt too if that is better  i know you would said his friend in a low voice perhaps youre the only man i ever quite trusted in this world  a few paces farther on they came to the end of a great ridge or mound looking monstrous against the dim sky and fisher stopped with a gesture he caught his companions hand and wrung it with a violent tenderness and then darted forward into the darkness march could faintly see his figure crawling along under the shadow of the ridge then he lost sight of it and then he saw it again standing on another mound two hundred yards away beside him stood a singular erection made apparently of two rods he bent over it and there was the flare of a light all marchs schoolboy memories woke in him and he knew what it was it was the stand of a rocket the confused incongruous memories still possessed him up to the very moment of a fierce but familiar sound and an instant after the rocket left its perch and went up into endless space like a starry arrow aimed at the stars march thought suddenly of the signs of the last days and knew he was looking at the apocalyptic meteor of something like a day of judgment  far up in the infinite heavens the rocket drooped and sprang into scarlet stars for a moment the whole landscape out to the sea and back to the crescent of the wooded hills was like a lake of ruby light of a red strangely rich and glorious as if the world were steeped in wine rather than blood or the earth were an earthly paradise over which paused forever the sanguine moment of morning  god save england cried fisher with a tongue like the peal of a trumpet and now it is for god to save  as darkness sank again over land and sea there came another sound far away in the passes of the hills behind them the guns spoke like the baying of great hounds something that was not a rocket that came not hissing but screaming went over harold marchs head and expanded beyond the mound into light and deafening din staggering the brain with unbearable brutalities of noise another came and then another and the world was full of uproar and volcanic vapor and chaotic light the artillery of the west country and the irish had located the great enemy battery and were pounding it to pieces  in the mad excitement of that moment march peered through the storm looking again for the long lean figure that stood beside the stand of the rocket then another flash lit up the whole ridge the figure was not there  before the fires of the rocket had faded from the sky long before the first gun had sounded from the distant hills a splutter of rifle fire had flashed and flickered all around from the hidden trenches of the enemy something lay in the shadow at the foot of the ridge as stiff as the stick of the fallen rocket and the man who knew too much knew what is worth knowing
