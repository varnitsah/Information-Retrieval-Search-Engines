nutkin  he had a brother called twinkleberry and a great many cousins they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake  illustration  in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes and amongst those trees stands a hollow oaktree which is the house of an owl who is called old brown  illustration  one autumn when the nuts were ripe and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and greennutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood and down to the edge of the lake  illustration  they made little rafts out of twigs and they paddled away over the water to owl island to gather nuts  each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar and spread out his tail for a sail  illustration  they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for old brown and put them down upon his doorstep  then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow and said politely  old mr brown will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island  illustration  but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry singing      riddle me riddle me rottottote      a little wee man in a red red coat      a staff in his hand and a stone in his throat      if youll tell me this riddle ill give you a groat  now this riddle is as old as the hills mr brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin  he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep  illustration  the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts and sailed away home in the evening  illustration  but next morning they all came back again to owl island and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole and laid it on the stone in front of old browns doorway and said  mr brown will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts  illustration  but nutkin who had no respect began to dance up and down tickling old mr brown with a nettle and singing      old mr b riddlemeree      hitty pitty within the wall      hitty pitty without the wall      if you touch hitty pitty      hitty pitty will bite you  mr brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house  illustration  he shut the door in nutkins face presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree and nutkin peeped through the keyhole and sang      a house full a hole full      and you cannot gather a bowlfull    illustration  the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks  but nutkin gathered oakapplesyellow and scarletand sat upon a beechstump playing marbles and watching the door of old mr brown  illustration  on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing they caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown  they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl island  illustration  twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow but nutkin who had no nice manners brought no present at all he ran in front singing      the man in the wilderness said to me     how many strawberries grow in the sea      i answered him as i thought good      as many red herrings as grow in the wood  but old mr brown took no interest in riddlesnot even when the answer was provided for him  illustration  on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles which were as good as plums in plumpudding for old brown each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf fastened with a pineneedle pin  but nutkin sang as rudely as ever       old mr b riddlemeree       flour of england fruit of spain       met together in a shower of rain       put in a bag tied round with a string     if youll tell me this riddle ill give you a ring   which was ridiculous of nutkin because he had not got any ring to give to old brown  illustration  the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes but nutkin gathered robins pincushions off a briar bush and stuck them full of pineneedle pins  illustration  on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone they had stolen it out of a bumble bees nest on the tippitty top of the hill  but nutkin skipped up and down singing      humabum buzz buzz humabum buzz       as i went over tippletine       i met a flock of bonny swine     some yellownacked some yellow backed       they were the very bonniest swine       that eer went over tippletine  illustration  old mr brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin  but he ate up the honey  illustration  the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts  but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fircones  illustration  on the sixth day which was saturday the squirrels came again for the last time they brought a newlaid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for old brown  but nutkin ran in front laughing and shouting      humpty dumpty lies in the beck      with a white counterpane round his neck      forty doctors and forty wrights      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights  illustration  now old mr brown took an interest in eggs he opened one eye and shut it again but still he did not speak  illustration  nutkin became more and more impertinent        old mr b old mr b     hickamore hackamore on the kings kitchen door     all the kings horses and all the kings men     couldnt drive hickamore hackamore     off the kings kitchen door  nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam but still old brown said nothing at all  illustration  nutkin began again      arthur obower has broken his band      he comes roaring up the land      the king of scots with all his power      cannot turn arthur of the bower  nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind and he took a running jump right onto the head of old brown  then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud squeak  the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes  illustration  when they came back very cautiously peeping round the treethere was old brown sitting on his doorstep quite still with his eyes closed as if nothing had happened                                       but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket  illustration  this looks like the end of the story but it isnt  illustration  old brown carried nutkin into his house and held him up by the tail intending to skin him but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window  illustration  and to this day if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle he will throw sticks at you and stamp his feet and scold and shout  cuckcuckcuckcurrrcuckkk   the end
