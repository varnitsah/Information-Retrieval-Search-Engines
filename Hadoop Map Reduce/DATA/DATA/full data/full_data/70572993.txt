70572993	captains all  by ww jacobs    over the side  illustration over the side  of all classes of men those who follow the sea are probably the most prone to superstition  afloat upon the black waste of waters at the mercy of wind and sea with vast depths and strange creatures below them a belief in the supernatural is easier than ashore under the cheerful gaslamps  strange stories of the sea are plentiful and an incident which happened within my own experience has made me somewhat chary of dubbing a man fool or coward because he has encountered something he cannot explain  there are stories of the supernatural with prosaic sequels there are others to which the sequel has never been published  i was fifteen years old at the time and as my father who had a strong objection to the sea would not apprentice me to it i shipped before the mast on a sturdy little brig called the endeavour bound for riga  she was a small craft but the skipper was as fine a seaman as one could wish for and in fair weather an easy man to sail under  most boys have a rough time of it when they first go to sea but with a strong sense of what was good for me i had attached myself to a brawny goodnatured infant named bill smith and it was soon understood that whoever hit me struck bill by proxy  not that the crew were particularly brutal but a sound cuffing occasionally is held by most seamen to be beneficial to a lads health and morals  the only really spiteful fellow among them was a man named jem dadd  he was a morose sallowlooking man of about forty with a strong taste for the supernatural and a stronger taste still for frightening his fellows with it  i have seen bill almost afraid to go on deck of a night for his trick at the wheel after a few of his reminiscences  rats were a favourite topic with him and he would never allow one to be killed if he could help it for he claimed for them that they were the souls of drowned sailors hence their love of ships and their habit of leaving them when they became unseaworthy  he was a firm believer in the transmigration of souls some idea of which he had no doubt picked up in eastern ports and gave his shivering auditors to understand that his arrangements for his own immediate future were already perfected  we were six or seven days out when a strange thing happened  dadd had the second watch one night and bill was to relieve him  they were not very strict aboard the brig in fair weather and when a mans time was up he just made the wheel fast and running forard shouted down the focsle  on this night i happened to awake suddenly in time to see bill slip out of his bunk and stand by me rubbing his red eyelids with his knuckles  dadds giving me a long time he whispered seeing that i was awake its a whole hour after his time  he pattered up on deck and i was just turning over thankful that i was too young to have a watch to keep when he came softly down again and taking me by the shoulders shook me roughly  jack he whispered  jack  i raised myself on my elbows and in the light of the smoking lamp saw that he was shaking all over  come on deck he said thickly  i put on my clothes and followed him quietly to the sweet cool air above  it was a beautiful clear night but from his manner i looked nervously around for some cause of alarm  i saw nothing  the deck was deserted except for the solitary figure at the wheel  look at him whispered bill bending a contorted face to mine  i walked aft a few steps and bill followed slowly  then i saw that jem dadd was leaning forward clumsily on the wheel with his hands clenched on the spokes  hes asleep said i stopping short  bill breathed hard  hes in a queer sleep said he kind o trance more like  go closer  i took fast hold of bills sleeve and we both went  the light of the stars was sufficient to show that dadds face was very white and that his dim black eyes were wide open and staring in a very strange and dreadful manner straight before him  dadd said i softly dadd  there was no reply and with a view of arousing him i tapped one sinewy hand as it gripped the wheel and even tried to loosen it  he remained immovable and suddenly with a great cry my courage deserted me and bill and i fairly bolted down into the cabin and woke the skipper  then we saw how it was with jem and two strong seamen forcibly loosened the grip of those rigid fingers and laying him on the deck covered him with a piece of canvas  the rest of the night two men stayed at the wheel and gazing fearfully at the outline of the canvas longed for dawn  it came at last and breakfast over the body was sewn up in canvas and the skipper held a short service compiled from a bible which belonged to the mate and what he remembered of the burial service proper  then the corpse went overboard with a splash and the men after standing awkwardly together for a few minutes slowly dispersed to their duties  for the rest of that day we were all very quiet and restrained pity for the dead man being mingled with a dread of taking the wheel when night came  the wheels haunted said the cook solemnly mark my words theres more of you will be took the same way dadd was  the cook like myself had no watch to keep  the men bore up pretty well until night came on again and then they unanimously resolved to have a double watch  the cook sorely against his will was impressed into the service and i glad to oblige my patron agreed to stay up with bill  some of the pleasure had vanished by the time night came and i seemed only just to have closed my eyes when bill came and with a rough shake or two informed me that the time had come  any hope that i might have had of escaping the ordeal was at once dispelled by his expectant demeanour and the helpful way in which he assisted me with my clothes and yawning terribly i followed him on deck  the night was not so clear as the preceding one and the air was chilly with a little moisture in it  i buttoned up my jacket and thrust my hands in my pockets  everything quiet asked bill as he stepped up and took the wheel  ay ay said roberts quiet as the grave and followed by his willing mate he went below  i sat on the deck by bills side as with a light touch on the wheel he kept the brig to her course  it was weary work sitting there doing nothing and thinking of the warm berth below and i believe that i should have fallen asleep but that my watchful companion stirred me with his foot whenever he saw me nodding  i suppose i must have sat there shivering and yawning for about an hour when tired of inactivity i got up and went and leaned over the side of the vessel  the sound of the water gurgling and lapping by was so soothing that i began to doze  i was recalled to my senses by a smothered cry from bill and running to him i found him staring to port in an intense and uncomfortable fashion at my approach he took one hand from the wheel and gripped my arm so tightly that i was like to have screamed with the pain of it  jack said he in a shaky voice while you was away something popped its head up and looked over the ships side  youve been dreaming said i in a voice which was a very fair imitation of bills own  dreaming repeated bill dreaming  ah look there  he pointed with outstretched finger and my heart seemed to stop beating as i saw a mans head appear above the side  for a brief space it peered at us in silence and then a dark figure sprang like a cat on to the deck and stood crouching a short distance away  a mist came before my eyes and my tongue failed me but bill let off a roar such as i have never heard before or since  it was answered from below both aft and forard and the men came running up on deck just as they left their beds  whats up shouted the skipper glancing aloft  for answer bill pointed to the intruder and the men who had just caught sight of him came up and formed a compact knot by the wheel  come over the side it did panted bill come over like a ghost out of the sea  the skipper took one of the small lamps from the binnacle and holding it aloft walked boldly up to the cause of alarm  in the little patch of light we saw a ghastly blackbearded man dripping with water regarding us with unwinking eyes which glowed red in the light of the lamp  where did you come from asked the skipper  the figure shook its head  where did you come from he repeated walking up and laying his hand on the others shoulder  then the intruder spoke but in a strange fashion and in strange words we leaned forward to listen but even when he repeated them we could make nothing of them  hes a furriner said roberts  blest if ive ever eard the lingo afore said bill  does anybody rekernize it  nobody did and the skipper after another attempt gave it up and falling back upon the universal language of signs pointed first to the man and then to the sea  the other understood him and in a heavy slovenly fashion portrayed a man drifting in an open boat and clutching and clambering up the side of a passing ship  as his meaning dawned upon us we rushed to the stern and leaning over peered into the gloom but the night was dark and we saw nothing  well said the skipper turning to bill with a mighty yawn take him below and give him some grub and the next time a gentleman calls on you dont make such a confounded row about it  he went below followed by the mate and after some slight hesitation roberts stepped up to the intruder and signed to him to follow  he came stolidly enough leaving a trail of water on the deck and after changing into the dry things we gave him fell to but without much appearance of hunger upon some salt beef and biscuits regarding us between bites with black lacklustre eyes  he seems as though hes awalking in his sleep said the cook  he aint very hungry said one of the men he seems to mumble his food  hungry repeated bill who had just left the wheel  course he aint famished  he had his tea last night  the men stared at him in bewilderment  dont you see said bill still in a hoarse whisper aint you ever seen them eyes afore  dont you know what he used to say about dying its jem dadd come back to us  jem dadd got another mans body as he always said he would  rot said roberts trying to speak bravely but he got up and with the others huddled together at the end of the focsle and stared in a bewildered fashion at the sodden face and short squat figure of our visitor  for his part having finished his meal he pushed his plate from him and leaning back on the locker looked at the empty bunks  roberts caught his eye and with a nod and a wave of his hand indicated the bunks  the fellow rose from the locker and amid a breathless silence climbed into one of themjem dadds  he slept in the dead sailors bed that night the only man in the focsle who did sleep properly and turned out heavily and lumpishly in the morning for breakfast  the skipper had him on deck after the meal but could make nothing of him  to all his questions he replied in the strange tongue of the night before and though our fellows had been to many ports and knew a word or two of several languages none of them recognized it  the skipper gave it up at last and left to himself he stared about him for some time regardless of our interest in his movements and then leaning heavily against the side of the ship stayed there so long that we thought he must have fallen asleep  hes halfdead now whispered roberts  hush said bill mebbe hes been in the water a week or two and cant quite make it out  see how hes looking at it now  he stayed on deck all day in the sun but as night came on returned to the warmth of the focsle  the food we gave him remained untouched and he took little or no notice of us though i fancied that he saw the fear we had of him  he slept again in the dead mans bunk and when morning came still lay there  until dinnertime nobody interfered with him and then roberts pushed forward by the others approached him with some food  he motioned it away with a dirty bloated hand and making signs for water drank it eagerly  for two days he stayed there quietly the black eyes always open the stubby fingers always on the move  on the third morning bill who had conquered his fear sufficiently to give him water occasionally called softly to us  come and look at him said he  whats the matter with him  hes dying said the cook with a shudder  he cant be going to die yet said bill blankly  as he spoke the mans eyes seemed to get softer and more lifelike and he looked at us piteously and helplessly  from face to face he gazed in mute inquiry and then striking his chest feebly with his fist uttered two words  we looked at each other blankly and he repeated them eagerly and again touched his chest  its his name said the cook and we all repeated them  he smiled in an exhausted fashion and then rallying his energies held up a forefinger as we stared at this new riddle he lowered it and held up all four fingers doubled  come away quavered the cook hes putting a spell on us  we drew back at that and back farther still as he repeated the motions then bills face cleared suddenly and he stepped towards him  he means his wife and younkers he shouted eagerly  this aint no jem dadd  it was good then to see how our fellows drew round the dying sailor and strove to cheer him  bill to show he understood the finger business nodded cheerily and held his hand at four different heights from the floor  the last was very low so low that the man set his lips together and strove to turn his heavy head from us  poor devil said bill he wants us to tell his wife and children whats become of him  he must ha been dying when he come aboard  what was his name again  but the name was not easy to english lips and we had already forgotten it  ask him again said the cook and write it down  whos got a pen  he went to look for one as bill turned to the sailor to get him to repeat it  then he turned round again and eyed us blankly for by this time the owner had himself forgotten it
