77304429	george eliot  scenes of clerical life     introduction by grace rhys     dent london  everymans library  all rights reserved  printed in great britain  this edition was first published in everymans library in 1910     introduction   george eliot or mary ann evans was born at arbury farm in the parish of chilvers coton warwickshire on the 22nd of november 1819 she was the fifth and last child of her father by his second wifeof that father whose sound sense and integrity she so keenly appreciated and who was to a certain extent the original of her famous characters of adam bede and caleb garth  both during and after her schooldays george eliots history was that of a mind continually outgrowing its conditions she became an excellent housewife and a devoted daughter but her nature was too large for so cramped a life you may try she writes in daniel deronda but you can never imagine what it is to have a mans force of genius in you and to suffer the slavery of being a girl  while her powers were growing she necessarily passed through many phases she became deeply religious and wrote poetry pious and sweet fair of its kind music was a passion with her in a characteristic letter written at the age of twenty to a friend she tries but fails to describe her experience on hearing the messiah of birmingham with a stupid drowsy sensation produced by standing sentinel over damson cheese and a warm stove i cannot do better than ask you to read if accessible wordsworths short poem on the power of sound there you have a concise history of george eliots life at this period divided as it was between music literature and damson cheese  sixteen years of mental work and effort then lay between her and her first achievement years during which she read industriously and thought more than she read the classics french german and italian literature she laid them all under contribution she had besides the art of fortunate friendship her mind naturally chose out the greater intelligences among those she encountered it was through a warm and enduring friendship with herbert spencer that she met at last with george henry lewes whose wife she became  in this way she served no trifling apprenticeship natural genius experience of life culture and great companionship had joined to make her what she was a philosopher both natural and developed and what is more rare a philosopher with a sense of humour and a perception of the dramatic thus when her chance came she was fully equipped to meet it  it came when at the age of thirtysix she began to write amos barton her first attempt at fiction and one that fixed her career the story appeared in blackwoods magazine and was followed by mr gilfils love story and janets repentance of the three mr gilfils love story is perhaps the most finished and artistic while amos barton has qualities of humour and tenderness that have not often been equalled janets repentance strong though it is and containing the remarkable sketch of mr tryan is perhaps less surely attractive  the stories all three of them have a particular value as records of an english country life that is rapidly passing away moreover it is country life seen through the medium of a powerful and rightjudging personality it is her intimate and thorough knowledge of big things and small of literature and damson cheese enabling her and us to see all round her characters that provides these characters with their ample background of light and shade  it is well to realise that since george eliots day the fashion of writing the temper of the modern mind are quite changed it is a curious fact that the more sophisticated we become the simpler grows our speech nowadays we talk as nearly as we may in words of one syllable our style is stripped more and more of its latinity our writers are more and more in love with french methodswith the delicate clearness of short phrases in which every word tells with the rejection of all intellectual ambulations round about a subject to the fanatics of this modern method the style of george eliot appears strange impossible it does not occur to them that her method has virtues which lack to theirs they may give us a little laboured masterpiece of art in which the vital principle is wanting george eliot was great because she gave us passages from life as it was lived in her day which will be vital so long as they are sympathetically read  george eliot can be simple enough when she goes straight forward with her narrative as for instance in the scene of milly bartons death then her english is clear and sweet for she writes from the heart but take the opening chapter of the same story and then you find her philosophical latinity in full swing the curious and interesting thing being that this otherwise ponderous work which is quite of a sort to alarm a frenchman is entirely suffused by humour and enshrines moreover the most charming character studies  these lively and acute portraits drawn from english country life give its abiding value to george eliots work take the character of mr pilgrim the doctor who is never so comfortable as when relaxing his professional legs in one of those excellent farmhouses where the mice are sleek and the mistress sickly or of mrs hackit a thin woman with a chronic liver complaint which would have secured her mr pilgrims entire regard and unreserved good word even if he had not been in awe of her tongue  or take mrs patten a pretty little old woman of eighty with a close cap and tiny flat white curls round her face whose function is quiescence in an easychair under the sense of compound interest gradually accumulating and who does her malevolence gently or mr hackit a shrewd substantial man who was fond of soothing the acerbities of the feminine mind by a jocose compliment where but in george eliot would you get a teaparty described with such charming acceptance of whim  george eliot wrote poems at various times which showed she never could have won fame as a poet but there are moments of her prose that prove she shared at times the poets vision such a moment is that when the half brokenhearted little catarina looks out on a windy night landscape lit by moonlight the trees are harassed by that tossing motion when they would like to be at rest the shivering grass makes her quake with sympathetic cold the willows by the pool bent low and white under that invisible harshness seem agitated and helpless like herself the italicised sentence represents the highwater mark of george eliots prose that passage alone should vindicate her imaginative power  g r                                   contents                    the sad fortunes of the rev amos barton                    mr gilfils love story                    janets repentance    scenes of clerical life    the sad fortunes of the rev amos barton    chapter 1   shepperton church was a very differentlooking building fiveandtwenty years ago to be sure its substantial stone tower looks at you through its intelligent eye the clock with the friendly expression of former days but in everything else what changes now there is a wide span of slated roof flanking the old steeple the windows are tall and symmetrical the outer doors are resplendent with oakgraining the inner doors reverentially noiseless with a garment of red baize and the walls you are convinced no lichen will ever again effect a settlement onthey are smooth and innutrient as the summit of the rev amos bartons head after ten years of baldness and supererogatory soap pass through the baize doors and you will see the nave filled with wellshaped benches understood to be free seats while in certain eligible corners less directly under the fire of the clergymans eye there are pews reserved for the shepperton gentility ample galleries are supported on iron pillars and in one of them stands the crowning glory the very clasp or aigrette of shepperton churchadornmentnamely an organ not very much out of repair on which a collector of small rents differentiated by the force of circumstances into an organist will accompany the alacrity of your departure after the blessing by a sacred minuet or an easy gloria  immense improvement says the wellregulated mind which unintermittingly rejoices in the new police the tithe commutation act the pennypost and all guarantees of human advancement and has no moments when conservativereforming intellect takes a nap while imagination does a little toryism by the sly revelling in regret that dear old brown crumbling picturesque inefficiency is everywhere giving place to spickandspan newpainted newvarnished efficiency which will yield endless diagrams plans elevations and sections but alas no picture mine i fear is not a wellregulated mind it has an occasional tenderness for old abuses it lingers with a certain fondness over the days of nasal clerks and topbooted parsons and has a sigh for the departed shades of vulgar errors so it is not surprising that i recall with a fond sadness shepperton church as it was in the old days with its outer coat of rough stucco its redtiled roof its heterogeneous windows patched with desultory bits of painted glass and its little flight of steps with their wooden rail running up the outer wall and leading to the schoolchildrens gallery  then inside what dear old quaintnesses which i began to look at with delight even when i was so crude a members of the congregation that my nurse found it necessary to provide for the reinforcement of my devotional patience by smuggling breadandbutter into the sacred edifice there was the chancel guarded by two little cherubims looking uncomfortably squeezed between arch and wall and adorned with the escutcheons of the oldinport family which showed me inexhaustible possibilities of meaning in their bloodred hands their deathsheads and crossbones their leopards paws and maltese crosses there were inscriptions on the panels of the singinggallery telling of benefactions to the poor of shepperton with an involuted elegance of capitals and final flourishes which my alphabetic erudition traced with evernew delight no benches in those days but huge roomy pews round which devout churchgoers sat during lessons trying to look anywhere else than into each others eyes no low partitions allowing you with a dreary absence of contrast and mystery to see everything at all moments but tall dark panels under whose shadow i sank with a sense of retirement through the litany only to feel with more intensity my burst into the conspicuousness of public life when i was made to stand up on the seat during the psalms or the singing and the singing was no mechanical affair of official routine it had a drama as the moment of psalmody approached by some process to me as mysterious and untraceable as the opening of the flowers or the breakingout of the stars a slate appeared in front of the gallery advertising in bold characters the psalm about to be sung lest the sonorous announcement of the clerk should still leave the bucolic mind in doubt on that head then followed the migration of the clerk to the gallery where in company with a bassoon two keybugles a carpenter understood to have an amazing power of singing counter and two lesser musical stars he formed the complement of a choir regarded in shepperton as one of distinguished attraction occasionally known to draw hearers from the next parish the innovation of hymnbooks was as yet undreamed of even the new version was regarded with a sort of melancholy tolerance as part of the common degeneracy in a time when prices had dwindled and a cotton gown was no longer stout enough to last a lifetime for the lyrical taste of the best heads in shepperton had been formed on sternhold and hopkins but the greatest triumphs of the shepperton choir were reserved for the sundays when the slate announced an anthem with a dignified abstinence from particularization both words and music lying far beyond the reach of the most ambitious amateur in the congregation an anthem in which the keybugles always ran away at a great pace while the bassoon every now and then boomed a flying shot after them  as for the clergyman mr gilfil an excellent old gentleman who smoked very long pipes and preached very short sermons i must not speak of him or i might be tempted to tell the story of his life which had its little romance as most lives have between the ages of teetotum and tobacco and at present i am concerned with quite another sort of clergymanthe rev amos barton who did not come to shepperton until long after mr gilfil had departed this lifeuntil after an interval in which evangelicalism and the catholic question had begun to agitate the rustic mind with controversial debates a popish blacksmith had produced a strong protestant reaction by declaring that as soon as the emancipation bill was passed he should do a great stroke of business in gridirons and the disinclination of the shepperton parishioners generally to dim the unique glory of st lawrence rendered the church and constitution an affair of their business and bosoms a zealous evangelical preacher had made the old soundingboard vibrate with quite a different sort of elocution from mr gilfils the hymnbook had almost superseded the old and new versions and the great square pews were crowded with new faces from distant corners of the parishperhaps from dissenting chapels  you are not imagining i hope that amos barton was the incumbent of shepperton he was no such thing those were days when a man could hold three small livings starve a curate apiece on two of them and live badly himself on the third it was so with the vicar of shepperton a vicar given to bricks and mortar and thereby running into debt far away in a northern countywho executed his vicarial functions towards shepperton by pocketing the sum of thirtyfive pounds ten per annum the net surplus remaining to him from the proceeds of that living after the disbursement of eighty pounds as the annual stipend of his curate and now pray can you solve me the following problem given a man with a wife and six children let him be obliged always to exhibit himself when outside his own door in a suit of black broadcloth such as will not undermine the foundations of the establishment by a paltry plebeian glossiness or an unseemly whiteness at the edges in a snowy cravat which is a serious investment of labour in the hemming starching and ironing departments and in a hat which shows no symptom of taking to the hideous doctrine of expediency and shaping itself according to circumstances let him have a parish large enough to create an external necessity for abundant shoeleather and an internal necessity for abundant beef and mutton as well as poor enough to require frequent priestly consolation in the shape of shillings and sixpences and lastly let him be compelled by his own pride and other peoples to dress his wife and children with gentility from bonnetstrings to shoestrings by what process of division can the sum of eighty pounds per annum be made to yield a quotient which will cover that mans weekly expenses this was the problem presented by the position of the rev amos barton as curate of shepperton rather more than twenty years ago  what was thought of this problem and of the man who had to work it out by some of the welltodo inhabitants of shepperton two years or more after mr bartons arrival among them you shall hear if you will accompany me to cross farm and to the fireside of mrs patten a childless old lady who had got rich chiefly by the negative process of spending nothing mrs pattens passive accumulation of wealth through all sorts of bad times on the farm of which she had been sole tenant since her husbands death her epigrammatic neighbour mrs hackit sarcastically accounted for by supposing that sixpences grew on the bents of cross farm while mr hackit expressing his views more literally reminded his wife that money breeds money mr and mrs hackit from the neighbouring farm are mrs pattens guests this evening so is mr pilgrim the doctor from the nearest markettown who though occasionally affecting aristocratic airs and giving late dinners with enigmatic sidedishes and poisonous port is never so comfortable as when he is relaxing his professional legs in one of those excellent farmhouses where the mice are sleek and the mistress sickly and he is at this moment in clover  for the flickering of mrs pattens bright fire is reflected in her bright copper teakettle the homemade muffins glisten with an inviting succulence and mrs pattens niece a single lady of fifty who has refused the most ineligible offers out of devotion to her aged aunt is pouring the rich cream into the fragrant tea with a discreet liberality  reader did you ever taste such a cup of tea as miss gibbs is this moment handing to mr pilgrim do you know the dulcet strength the animating blandness of tea sufficiently blended with real farmhouse cream nomost likely you are a miserable townbred reader who think of cream as a thinnish white fluid delivered in infinitesimal pennyworths down area steps or perhaps from a presentiment of calves brains you refrain from any lacteal addition and rasp your tongue with unmitigated bohea you have a vague idea of a milch cow as probably a whiteplaster animal standing in a buttermans window and you know nothing of the sweet history of genuine cream such as miss gibbss how it was this morning in the udders of the large sleek beasts as they stood lowing a patient entreaty under the milkingshed how it fell with a pleasant rhythm into bettys pail sending a delicious incense into the cool air how it was carried into that temple of moist cleanliness the dairy where it quietly separated itself from the meaner elements of milk and lay in mellowed whiteness ready for the skimmingdish which transferred it to miss gibbss glass creamjug if i am right in my conjecture you are unacquainted with the highest possibilities of tea and mr pilgrim who is holding that cup in his hands has an idea beyond you  mrs hackit declines cream she has so long abstained from it with an eye to the weekly buttermoney that abstinence wedded to habit has begotten aversion she is a thin woman with a chronic livercomplaint which would have secured her mr pilgrims entire regard and unreserved good word even if he had not been in awe of her tongue which was as sharp as his own lancet she has brought her knittingno frivolous fancy knitting but a substantial woollen stocking the clickclick of her knittingneedles is the running accompaniment to all her conversation and in her utmost enjoyment of spoiling a friends selfsatisfaction she was never known to spoil a stocking mrs patten does not admire this excessive clickclicking activity quiescence in an easychair under the sense of compound interest perpetually accumulating has long seemed an ample function to her and she does her malevolence gently she is a pretty little old woman of eighty with a close cap and tiny flat white curls round her face as natty and unsoiled and invariable as the waxen image of a little old lady under a glasscase once a ladysmaid and married for her beauty she used to adore her husband and now she adores her money cherishing a quiet bloodrelations hatred for her niece janet gibbs who she knows expects a large legacy and whom she is determined to disappoint her money shall all go in a lump to a distant relation of her husbands and janet shall be saved the trouble of pretending to cry by finding that she is left with a miserable pittance  mrs patten has more respect for her neighbour mr hackit than for most people mr hackit is a shrewd substantial man whose advice about crops is always worth listening to and who is too well off to want to borrow money  and now that we are snug and warm with this little teaparty while it is freezing with february bitterness outside we will listen to what they are talking about  so said mr pilgrim with his mouth only half empty of muffin you had a row in shepperton church last sunday i was at jim hoods the bassoonmans this morning attending his wife and he swears hell be revenged on the parsona confounded methodistical meddlesome chap who must be putting his finger in every pie what was it all about  o a passill o nonsense said mr hackit sticking one thumb between the buttons of his capacious waistcoat and retaining a pinch of snuff with the otherfor he was but moderately given to the cups that cheer but not inebriate and had already finished his tea they began to sing the wedding psalm for a newmarried couple as pretty a psalm an as pretty a tune as any in the prayerbook its been sung for every newmarried couple since i was a boy and what can be better here mr hackit stretched out his left arm threw back his head and broke into melody       o what a happy thing it is      and joyful for to see      brethren to dwell together in      friendship and unity  but mr barton is all for th hymns and a sort o music as i cant join in at all  and so said mr pilgrim recalling mr hackit from lyrical reminiscences to narrative he called out silence did he when he got into the pulpit and gave a hymn out himself to some meetinghouse tune  yes said mrs hackit stooping towards the candle to pick up a stitch and turned as red as a turkeycock i often say when he preaches about meekness he gives himself a slap in the face hes like mehes got a temper of his own  rather a lowbred fellow i think barton said mr pilgrim who hated the reverend amos for two reasonsbecause he had called in a new doctor recently settled in shepperton and because being himself a dabbler in drugs he had the credit of having cured a patient of mr pilgrims they say his father was a dissenting shoemaker and hes half a dissenter himself why doesnt he preach extempore in that cottage up here of a sunday evening  tchuhthis was mr hackits favourite interjectionthat preaching without books no good only when a man has a gift and has the bible at his fingers ends it was all very well for parryhed a gift and in my youth ive heard the ranters out o doors in yorkshire go on for an hour or two on end without ever sticking fast a minute there was one clever chap i remember as used to say youre like the woodpigeon it says do do do all day and never sets about any work itself thats bringing it home to people but our parsons no gift at all that way he can preach as good a sermon as need be heard when he writes it down but when he tries to preach wiout book he rambles about and doesnt stick to his text and every now and then he flounders about like a sheep as has cast itself and cant get onts legs again you wouldnt like that mrs patten if you was to go to church now  eh dear said mrs patten falling back in her chair and lifting up her little withered hands what ud mr gilfil say if he was worthy to know the changes as have come about i the church these last ten years i dont understand these new sort o doctrines when mr barton comes to see me he talks about nothing but my sins and my need o marcy now mr hackit ive never been a sinner from the fust beginning when i went into service i alys did my duty by my emplyers i was a good wife as any in the countynever aggravated my husband the cheesefactor used to say my cheese was alys to be depended on ive known women as their cheeses swelled a shame to be seen when their husbands had counted on the cheesemoney to make up their rent and yet theyd three gowns to my one if im not to be saved i know a many as are in a bad way but its well for me as i cant go to church any longer for if th old singers are to be done away with therell be nothing left as it was in mr pattens time and whats more i hear youve settled to pull the church down and build it up new  now the fact was that the rev amos barton on his last visit to mrs patten had urged her to enlarge her promised subscription of twenty pounds representing to her that she was only a steward of her riches and that she could not spend them more for the glory of god than by giving a heavy subscription towards the rebuilding of shepperton churcha practical precept which was not likely to smooth the way to her acceptance of his theological doctrine mr hackit who had more doctrinal enlightenment than mrs patten had been a little shocked by the heathenism of her speech and was glad of the new turn given to the subject by this question addressed to him as churchwarden and an authority in all parochial matters  ah he answered the parsons bothered us into it at last and were to begin pulling down this spring but we havent got money enough yet i was for waiting till wed made up the sum and for my part i think the congregations fell off o late though mr barton says thats because theres been no room for the people when theyve come you see the congregation got so large in parrys time the people stood in the aisles but theres never any crowd now as i can see  well said mrs hackit whose goodnature began to act now that it was a little in contradiction with the dominant tone of the conversation i like mr barton i think hes a good sort o man for all hes not overburthend i th upper storey and his wifes as nice a ladylike woman as id wish to see how nice she keeps her children and little enough money to dot with and a delicate creatursix children and another acoming i dont know how they make both ends meet im sure now her aunt has left em but i sent em a cheese and a sack o potatoes last week thats something towards filling the little mouths  ah said mr hackit and my wife makes mr barton a good stiff glass o brandyandwater when he comes into supper after his cottage preaching the parson likes it it puts a bit o colour into is face and makes him look a deal handsomer  this allusion to brandyandwater suggested to miss gibbs the introduction of the liquor decanters now that the tea was cleared away for in bucolic society fiveandtwenty years ago the human animal of the male sex was understood to be perpetually athirst and something to drink was as necessary a condition of thought as time and space  now that cottage preaching said mr pilgrim mixing himself a strong glass of cold without i was talking about it to our parson ely the other day and he doesnt approve of it at all he said it did as much harm as good to give a too familiar aspect to religious teaching that was what ely saidit does as much harm as good to give a too familiar aspect to religious teaching  mr pilgrim generally spoke with an intermittent kind of splutter indeed one of his patients had observed that it was a pity such a clever man had a pediment in his speech but when he came to what he conceived the pith of his argument or the point of his joke he mouthed out his words with slow emphasis as a hen when advertising her accouchement passes at irregular intervals from pianissimo semiquavers to fortissimo crotchets he thought this speech of mr elys particularly metaphysical and profound and the more decisive of the question because it was a generality which represented no particulars to his mind  well i dont know about that said mrs hackit who had always the courage of her opinion but i know some of our labourers and stockingers as used never to come to church come to the cottage and thats better than never hearing anything good from weeks end to weeks end and theres that track societys as mr barton has begunive seen more o the poor people with going tracking than all the time ive lived in the parish before and thered need be something done among em for the drinking at them benefit clubs is shameful theres hardly a steady man or steady woman either but whats a dissenter  during this speech of mrs hackits mr pilgrim had emitted a succession of little snorts something like the treble grunts of a guineapig which were always with him the sign of suppressed disapproval but he never contradicted mrs hackita woman whose potluck was always to be relied on and who on her side had unlimited reliance on bleeding blistering and draughts  mrs patten however felt equal disapprobation and had no reasons for suppressing it  well she remarked ive heared of no good from interfering with ones neighbours poor or rich and i hate the sight o women going about trapesing from house to house in all weathers wet or dry and coming in with their petticoats dagged and their shoes all over mud janet wanted to join in the tracking but i told her id have nobody tracking out o my house when im gone she may do as she likes i never dagged my petticoats in my life and ive no opinion o that sort o religion  no said mr hackit who was fond of soothing the acerbities of the feminine mind with a jocose compliment you held your petticoats so high to show your tight ankles it isnt everybody as likes to show her ankles  this joke met with general acceptance even from the snubbed janet whose ankles were only tight in the sense of looking extremely squeezed by her boots but janet seemed always to identify herself with her aunts personality holding her own under protest  under cover of the general laughter the gentlemen replenished their glasses mr pilgrim attempting to give his the character of a stirrupcup by observing that he must be going miss gibbs seized this opportunity of telling mrs hackit that she suspected betty the dairymaid of frying the best bacon for the shepherd when he sat up with her to help brew whereupon mrs hackit replied that she had always thought betty false and mrs patten said there was no bacon stolen when she was able to manage mr hackit who often complained that he never saw the like to women with their maidshe never had any trouble with his men avoided listening to this discussion by raising the question of vetches with mr pilgrim the stream of conversation had thus diverged and no more was said about the rev amos barton who is the main object of interest to us just now so we may leave cross farm without waiting till mrs hackit resolutely donning her clogs and wrappings renders it incumbent on mr pilgrim also to fulfil his frequent threat of going     chapter 2   it was happy for the rev amos barton that he did not like us overhear the conversation recorded in the last chapter indeed what mortal is there of us who would find his satisfaction enhanced by an opportunity of comparing the picture he presents to himself of his own doings with the picture they make on the mental retina of his neighbours we are poor plants buoyed up by the airvessels of our own conceit alas for us if we get a few pinches that empty us of that windy selfsubsistence the very capacity for good would go out of us for tell the most impassioned orator suddenly that his wig is awry or his shirtlap hanging out and that he is tickling people by the oddity of his person instead of thrilling them by the energy of his periods and you would infallibly dry up the spring of his eloquence that is a deep and wide saying that no miracle can be wrought without faithwithout the workers faith in himself as well as the recipients faith in him and the greater part of the workers faith in himself is made up of the faith that others believe in him  let me be persuaded that my neighbour jenkins considers me a blockhead and i shall never shine in conversation with him any more let me discover that the lovely phoebe thinks my squint intolerable and i shall never be able to fix her blandly with my disengaged eye again thank heaven then that a little illusion is left to us to enable us to be useful and agreeablethat we dont know exactly what our friends think of usthat the world is not made of lookingglass to show us just the figure we are making and just what is going on behind our backs by the help of dear friendly illusion we are able to dream that we are charming and our faces wear a becoming air of selfpossession we are able to dream that other men admire our talentsand our benignity is undisturbed we are able to dream that we are doing much goodand we do a little thus it was with amos barton on that very thursday evening when he was the subject of the conversation at cross farm he had been dining at mr farquhars the secondary squire of the parish and stimulated by unwonted gravies and portwine had been delivering his opinion on affairs parochial and otherwise with considerable animation and he was now returning home in the moonlighta little chill it is true for he had just now no greatcoat compatible with clerical dignity and a fur boa round ones neck with a waterproof cape over ones shoulders doesnt frighten away the cold from ones legs but entirely unsuspicious not only of mr hackits estimate of his oratorical powers but also of the critical remarks passed on him by the misses farquhar as soon as the drawingroom door had closed behind him miss julia had observed that she never heard any one sniff so frightfully as mr barton didshe had a great mind to offer him her pockethandkerchief and miss arabella wondered why he always said he was going for to do a thing he excellent man was meditating fresh pastoral exertions on the morrow he would set on foot his lending library in which he had introduced some books that would be a pretty sharp blow to the dissentersone especially purporting to be written by a working man who out of pure zeal for the welfare of his class took the trouble to warn them in this way against those hypocritical thieves the dissenting preachers the rev amos barton profoundly believed in the existence of that working man and had thoughts of writing to him dissent he considered would have its head bruised in shepperton for did he not attack it in two ways he preached lowchurch doctrineas evangelical as anything to be heard in the independent chapel and he made a highchurch assertion of ecclesiastical powers and functions clearly the dissenters would feel that the parson was too many for them nothing like a man who combines shrewdness with energy the wisdom of the serpent mr barton considered was one of his strong points  look at him as he winds through the little churchyard the silver light that falls aslant on church and tomb enables you to see his slim black figure made all the slimmer by tight pantaloons as it flits past the pale gravestones he walks with a quick step and is now rapping with sharp decision at the vicarage door it is opened without delay by the nurse cook and housemaid all at oncethat is to say by the robust maidofallwork nanny and as mr barton hangs up his hat in the passage you see that a narrow face of no particular complexioneven the smallpox that has attacked it seems to have been of a mongrel indefinite kindwith features of no particular shape and an eye of no particular expression is surmounted by a slope of baldness gently rising from brow to crown you judge him rightly to be about forty the house is quiet for it is halfpast ten and the children have long been gone to bed he opens the sittingroom door but instead of seeing his wife as he expected stitching with the nimblest of fingers by the light of one candle he finds her dispensing with the light of a candle altogether she is softly pacing up and down by the red firelight holding in her arms little walter the yearold baby who looks over her shoulder with large wideopen eyes while the patient mother pats his back with her soft hand and glances with a sigh at the heap of large and small stockings lying unmended on the table  she was a lovely womanmrs amos barton a large fair gentle madonna with thick close chestnut curls beside her wellrounded cheeks and with large tender shortsighted eyes the flowing lines of her tall figure made the limpest dress look graceful and her old frayed black silk seemed to repose on her bust and limbs with a placid elegance and sense of distinction in strong contrast with the uneasy sense of being no fit that seemed to express itself in the rustling of mrs farquhars gros de naples the caps she wore would have been pronounced when off her head utterly heavy and hideousfor in those days even fashionable caps were large and floppy but surmounting her long arched neck and mingling their borders of cheap lace and ribbon with her chestnut curls they seemed miracles of successful millinery among strangers she was shy and tremulous as a girl of fifteen she blushed crimson if any one appealed to her opinion yet that tall graceful substantial presence was so imposing in its mildness that men spoke to her with an agreeable sensation of timidity  soothing unspeakable charm of gentle womanhood which supersedes all acquisitions all accomplishments you would never have asked at any period of mrs amos bartons life if she sketched or played the piano you would even perhaps have been rather scandalized if she had descended from the serene dignity of being to the assiduous unrest of doing happy the man you would have thought whose eye will rest on her in the pauses of his fireside readingwhose hot aching forehead will be soothed by the contact of her cool soft hand who will recover himself from dejection at his mistakes and failures in the loving light of her unreproaching eyes you would not perhaps have anticipated that this bliss would fall to the share of precisely such a man as amos barton whom you have already surmised not to have the refined sensibilities for which you might have imagined mrs bartons qualities to be destined by preestablished harmony but i for one do not grudge amos barton this sweet wife i have all my life had a sympathy for mongrel ungainly dogs who are nobodys pets and i would rather surprise one of them by a pat and a pleasant morsel than meet the condescending advances of the loveliest skyeterrier who has his cushion by my ladys chair that to be sure is not the way of the world if it happens to see a fellow of fine proportions and aristocratic mien who makes no faux pas and wins golden opinions from all sorts of men it straightway picks out for him the loveliest of unmarried women and says there would be a proper match not at all say i let that successful wellshapen discreet and able gentleman put up with something less than the best in the matrimonial department and let the sweet woman go to make sunshine and a soft pillow for the poor devil whose legs are not models whose efforts are often blunders and who in general gets more kicks than halfpence shethe sweet womanwill like it as well for her sublime capacity of loving will have all the more scope and i venture to say mrs bartons nature would never have grown half so angelic if she had married the man you would perhaps have had in your eye for hera man with sufficient income and abundant personal eclat besides amos was an affectionate husband and in his way valued his wife as his best treasure  but now he has shut the door behind him and said well milly  well dear was the corresponding greeting made eloquent by a smile  so that young rascal wont go to sleep cant you give him to nanny  why nanny has been busy ironing this evening but i think ill take him to her now and mrs barton glided towards the kitchen while her husband ran upstairs to put on his maizecoloured dressinggown in which costume he was quietly filling his long pipe when his wife returned to the sittingroom maize is a colour that decidedly did not suit his complexion and it is one that soon soils why then did mr barton select it for domestic wear perhaps because he had a knack of hitting on the wrong thing in garb as well as in grammar  mrs barton now lighted her candle and seated herself before her heap of stockings she had something disagreeable to tell her husband but she would not enter on it at once have you had a nice evening dear  yes pretty well ely was there to dinner but went away rather early miss arabella is setting her cap at him with a vengeance but i dont think hes much smitten ive a notion elys engaged to some one at a distance and will astonish all the ladies who are languishing for him here by bringing home his bride one of these days elys a sly dog hell like that  did the farquhars say anything about the singing last sunday  yes farquhar said he thought it was time there was some improvement in the choir but he was rather scandalized at my setting the tune of lydia he says hes always hearing it as he passes the independent meeting here mr barton laughedhe had a way of laughing at criticisms that other people thought damagingand thereby showed the remainder of a set of teeth which like the remnants of the old guard were few in number and very much the worse for wear but he continued mrs farquhar talked the most about mr bridmain and the countess she has taken up all the gossip about them and wanted to convert me to her opinion but i told her pretty strongly what i thought  dear me why will people take so much pains to find out evil about others i have had a note from the countess since you went asking us to dine with them on friday  here mrs barton reached the note from the mantelpiece and gave it to her husband we will look over his shoulder while he reads it  sweetest milly bring your lovely face with your husband to dine with us on friday at sevendo if not i will be sulky with you till sunday when i shall be obliged to see you and shall long to kiss you that very moment yours according to your answer  caroline czerlaski  just like her isnt it said mrs barton i suppose we can go  yes i have no engagement the clerical meeting is tomorrow you know  and dear woods the butcher called to say he must have some money next week he has a payment to make up  this announcement made mr barton thoughtful he puffed more rapidly and looked at the fire  i think i must ask hackit to lend me twenty pounds for it is nearly two months till ladyday and we cant give woods our last shilling  i hardly like you to ask mr hackit dearhe and mrs hackit have been so very kind to us they have sent us so many things lately  then i must ask oldinport im going to write to him tomorrow morning for to tell him the arrangement ive been thinking of about having service in the workhouse while the church is being enlarged if he agrees to attend service there once or twice the other people will come net the large fish and youre sure to have the small fry  i wish we could do without borrowing money and yet i dont see how we can poor fred must have some new shoes i couldnt let him go to mrs bonds yesterday because his toes were peeping out dear child and i cant let him walk anywhere except in the garden he must have a pair before sunday really boots and shoes are the greatest trouble of my life everything else one can turn and turn about and make old look like new but theres no coaxing boots and shoes to look better than they are  mrs barton was playfully undervaluing her skill in metamorphosing boots and shoes she had at that moment on her feet a pair of slippers which had long ago lived through the prunella phase of their existence and were now running a respectable career as black silk slippers having been neatly covered with that material by mrs bartons own neat fingers wonderful fingers those they were never empty for if she went to spend a few hours with a friendly parishioner out came her thimble and a piece of calico or muslin which before she left had become a mysterious little garment with all sorts of hemmed ins and outs she was even trying to persuade her husband to leave off tight pantaloons because if he would wear the ordinary guncases she knew she could make them so well that no one would suspect the sex of the tailor  but by this time mr barton has finished his pipe the candle begins to burn low and mrs barton goes to see if nanny has succeeded in lulling walter to sleep nanny is that moment putting him in the little cot by his mothers bedside the head with its thin wavelets of brown hair indents the little pillow and a tiny waxen dimpled fist hides the rosy lips for baby is given to the infantile peccadillo of thumbsucking so nanny could now join in the short evening prayer and all could go to bed mrs barton carried upstairs the remainder of her heap of stockings and laid them on a table close to her bedside where also she placed a warm shawl removing her candle before she put it out to a tin socket fixed at the head of her bed her body was very weary but her heart was not heavy in spite of mr woods the butcher and the transitory nature of shoeleather for her heart so overflowed with love she felt sure she was near a fountain of love that would care for husband and babes better than she could foresee so she was soon asleep but about halfpast five oclock in the morning if there were any angels watching round her bedand angels might be glad of such an office they saw mrs barton rise up quietly careful not to disturb the slumbering amos who was snoring the snore of the just light her candle prop herself upright with the pillows throw the warm shawl round her shoulders and renew her attack on the heap of undarned stockings she darned away until she heard nanny stirring and then drowsiness came with the dawn the candle was put out and she sank into a doze but at nine oclock she was at the breakfasttable busy cutting breadandbutter for five hungry mouths while nanny baby on one arm in rosy cheeks fat neck and nightgown brought in a jug of hot milkandwater nearest her mother sits the nineyearold patty the eldest child whose sweet fair face is already rather grave sometimes and who always wants to run upstairs to save mammas legs which get so tired of an evening then there are four other blond headstwo boys and two girls gradually decreasing in size down to chubby who is making a round o of her mouth to receive a bit of papas baton papas attention was divided between petting chubby rebuking the noisy fred which he did with a somewhat excessive sharpness and eating his own breakfast he had not yet looked at mamma and did not know that her cheek was paler than usual but patty whispered mamma have you the headache  happily coal was cheap in the neighbourhood of shepperton and mr hackit would any time let his horses draw a load for the parson without charge so there was a blazing fire in the sittingroom and not without need for the vicarage garden as they looked out on it from the bowwindow was hard with black frost and the sky had the white woolly look that portends snow  breakfast over mr barton mounted to his study and occupied himself in the first place with his letter to mr oldinport it was very much the same sort of letter as most clergymen would have written under the same circumstances except that instead of perambulate the rev amos wrote preambulate and instead of if haply if happily the contingency indicated being the reverse of happy mr barton had not the gift of perfect accuracy in english orthography and syntax which was unfortunate as he was known not to be a hebrew scholar and not in the least suspected of being an accomplished grecian these lapses in a man who had gone through the eleusinian mysteries of a university education surprised the young ladies of his parish extremely especially the misses farquhar whom he had once addressed in a letter as dear mads apparently an abbreviation for madams the persons least surprised at the rev amoss deficiencies were his clerical brethren who had gone through the mysteries themselves  at eleven oclock mr barton walked forth in cape and boa with the sleet driving in his face to read prayers at the workhouse euphemistically called the college the college was a huge square stone building standing on the best apology for an elevation of ground that could be seen for about ten miles around shepperton a flat ugly district this depressing enough to look at even on the brightest days the roads are black with coaldust the brick houses dingy with smoke and at that timethe time of handloom weaversevery other cottage had a loom at its window where you might see a pale sicklylooking man or woman pressing a narrow chest against a board and doing a sort of treadmill work with legs and arms a troublesome district for a clergyman at least to one who like amos barton understood the cure of souls in something more than an official sense for over and above the rustic stupidity furnished by the farmlabourers the miners brought obstreperous animalism and the weavers in an acrid radicalism and dissent indeed mrs hackit often observed that the colliers who many of them earned better wages than mr barton passed their time in doing nothing but swilling ale and smoking like the beasts that perish speaking we may presume in a remotely analogical sense and in some of the alehouse corners the drink was flavoured by a dingy kind of infidelity something like rinsings of tom paine in ditchwater a certain amount of religious excitement created by the popular preaching of mr parry amoss predecessor had nearly died out and the religious life of shepperton was falling back towards lowwater mark here you perceive was a terrible stronghold of satan and you may well pity the rev amos barton who had to stand singlehanded and summon it to surrender we read indeed that the walls of jericho fell down before the sound of trumpets but we nowhere hear that those trumpets were hoarse and feeble doubtless they were trumpets that gave forth clear ringing tones and sent a mighty vibration through brick and mortar but the oratory of the rev amos resembled rather a belgian railwayhorn which shows praiseworthy intentions inadequately fulfilled he often missed the right note both in public and private exhortation and got a little angry in consequence for though amos thought himself strong he did not feel himself strong nature had given him the opinion but not the sensation without that opinion he would probably never have worn cambric bands but would have been an excellent cabinetmaker and deacon of an independent church as his father was before him he was not a shoemaker as mr pilgrim had reported he might then have sniffed long and loud in the corner of his pew in gun street chapel he might have indulged in halting rhetoric at prayermeetings and have spoken faulty english in private life and these little infirmities would not have prevented him honest faithful man that he was from being a shining light in the dissenting circle of bridgeport a tallow dip of the longeight description is an excellent thing in the kitchen candlestick and bettys nose and eye are not sensitive to the difference between it and the finest wax it is only when you stick it in the silver candlestick and introduce it into the drawingroom that it seems plebeian dim and ineffectual alas for the worthy man who like that candle gets himself into the wrong place it is only the very largest souls who will be able to appreciate and pity himwho will discern and love sincerity of purpose amid all the bungling feebleness of achievement  but now amos barton has made his way through the sleet as far as the college has thrown off his hat cape and boa and is reading in the dreary stonefloored diningroom a portion of the morning service to the inmates seated on the benches before him remember the new poorlaw had not yet come into operation and mr barton was not acting as paid chaplain of the union but as the pastor who had the cure of all souls in his parish pauper as well as other after the prayers he always addressed to them a short discourse on some subject suggested by the lesson for the day striving if by this means some edifying matter might find its way into the pauper mind and conscienceperhaps a task as trying as you could well imagine to the faith and patience of any honest clergyman for on the very first bench these were the faces on which his eye had to rest watching whether there was any stirring under the stagnant surface  right in front of himprobably because he was stonedeaf and it was deemed more edifying to hear nothing at a short distance than at a long onesat old maxum as he was familiarly called his real patronymic remaining a mystery to most persons a fine philological sense discerns in this cognomen an indication that the pauper patriarch had once been considered pithy and sententious in his speech but now the weight of ninetyfive years lay heavy on his tongue as well as in his ears and he sat before the clergyman with protruded chin and munching mouth and eyes that seemed to look at emptiness  next to him sat poll fodgeknown to the magistracy of her county as mary higginsa oneeyed woman with a scarred and seamy face the most notorious rebel in the workhouse said to have once thrown her broth over the masters coattails and who in spite of natures apparent safeguards against that contingency had contributed to the perpetuation of the fodge characteristics in the person of a small boy who was behaving naughtily on one of the back benches miss fodge fixed her one sore eye on mr barton with a sort of hardy defiance  beyond this member of the softer sex at the end of the bench sat silly jim a young man afflicted with hydrocephalus who rolled his head from side to side and gazed at the point of his nose these were the supporters of old maxum on his right  on his left sat mr fitchett a tall fellow who had once been a footman in the oldinport family and in that giddy elevation had enunciated a contemptuous opinion of boiled beef which had been traditionally handed down in shepperton as the direct cause of his ultimate reduction to pauper commons his calves were now shrunken and his hair was grey without the aid of powder but he still carried his chin as if he were conscious of a stiff cravat he set his dilapidated hat on with a knowing inclination towards the left ear and when he was on fieldwork he carted and uncarted the manure with a sort of flunkey grace the ghost of that jaunty demeanour with which he used to usher in my ladys morning visitors the flunkey nature was nowhere completely subdued but in his stomach and he still divided society into gentry gentrys flunkeys and the people who provided for them a clergyman without a flunkey was an anomaly belonging to neither of these classes mr fitchett had an irrepressible tendency to drowsiness under spiritual instruction and in the recurrent regularity with which he dozed off until he nodded and awaked himself he looked not unlike a piece of mechanism ingeniously contrived for measuring the length of mr bartons discourse  perfectly wideawake on the contrary was his lefthand neighbour mrs brick one of those hard undying old women to whom age seems to have given a network of wrinkles as a coat of magic armour against the attacks of winters warm or cold the point on which mrs brick was still sensitivethe theme on which you might possibly excite her hope and fearwas snuff it seemed to be an embalming powder helping her soul to do the office of salt  and now eke out an audience of which this front benchful was a sample with a certain number of refractory children over whom mr spratt the master of the workhouse exercised an irate surveillance and i think you will admit that the universitytaught clergyman whose office it is to bring home the gospel to a handful of such souls has a sufficiently hard task for to have any chance of success short of miraculous intervention he must bring his geographical chronological exegetical mind pretty nearly to the pauper point of view or of no view he must have some approximate conception of the mode in which the doctrines that have so much vitality in the plenum of his own brain will comport themselves in vacuothat is to say in a brain that is neither geographical chronological nor exegetical it is a flexible imagination that can take such a leap as that and an adroit tongue that can adapt its speech to so unfamiliar a position the rev amos barton had neither that flexible imagination nor that adroit tongue he talked of israel and its sins of chosen vessels of the paschal lamb of blood as a medium of reconciliation and he strove in this way to convey religious truth within reach of the fodge and fitchett mind this very morning the first lesson was the twelfth chapter of exodus and mr bartons exposition turned on unleavened bread nothing in the world more suited to the simple understanding than instruction through familiar types and symbols but there is always this danger attending it that the interest or comprehension of your hearers may stop short precisely at the point where your spiritual interpretation begins and mr barton this morning succeeded in carrying the pauper imagination to the doughtub but unfortunately was not able to carry it upwards from that wellknown object to the unknown truths which it was intended to shadow forth  alas a natural incapacity for teaching finished by keeping terms at cambridge where there are able mathematicians and butter is sold by the yard is not apparently the medium through which christian doctrine will distil as welcome dew on withered souls  and so while the sleet outside was turning to unquestionable snow and the stony diningroom looked darker and drearier and mr fitchett was nodding his lowest and mr spratt was boxing the boys ears with a constant rinforzando as he felt more keenly the approach of dinnertime mr barton wound up his exhortation with something of the february chill at his heart as well as his feet mr fitchett thoroughly roused now the instruction was at an end obsequiously and gracefully advanced to help mr barton in putting on his cape while mrs brick rubbed her withered forefinger round and round her little shoeshaped snuffbox vainly seeking for the fraction of a pinch i cant help thinking that if mr barton had shaken into that little box a small portion of scotch highdried he might have produced something more like an amiable emotion in mrs bricks mind than anything she had felt under his mornings exposition of the unleavened bread but our good amos laboured under a deficiency of small tact as well as of small cash and when he observed the action of the old womans forefinger he said in his brusque way so your snuff is all gone eh  mrs bricks eyes twinkled with the visionary hope that the parson might be intending to replenish her box at least mediately through the present of a small copper  ah well youll soon be going where there is no more snuff youll be in need of mercy then you must remember that you may have to seek for mercy and not find it just as youre seeking for snuff  at the first sentence of this admonition the twinkle subsided from mrs bricks eyes the lid of her box went click and her heart was shut up at the same moment  but now mr bartons attention was called for by mr spratt who was dragging a small and unwilling boy from the rear mr spratt was a smallfeatured smallstatured man with a remarkable power of language mitigated by hesitation who piqued himself on expressing unexceptionable sentiments in unexceptional language on all occasions  mr barton sirawawexcuse my trespassing on your timeawto beg that you will administer a rebuke to this boy he isawawmost inveterate in illbehaviour during servicetime  the inveterate culprit was a boy of seven vainly contending against candles at his nose by feeble sniffing but no sooner had mr spratt uttered his impeachment than miss fodge rushed forward and placed herself between mr barton and the accused  thats my child muster barton she exclaimed further manifesting her maternal instincts by applying her apron to her offsprings nose hes alys afindin faut wi him and apoundin him for nothin let him goo an eat his roost goose as is asmellin up in our noses while were aswallering them greasy broth an let my boy alooan  mr spratts small eyes flashed and he was in danger of uttering sentiments not unexceptionable before the clergyman but mr barton foreseeing that a prolongation of this episode would not be to edification said silence in his severest tones  let me hear no abuse your boy is not likely to behave well if you set him the example of being saucy then stooping down to master fodge and taking him by the shoulder do you like being beaten  noa  then what a silly boy you are to be naughty if you were not naughty you wouldnt be beaten but if you are naughty god will be angry as well as mr spratt and god can burn you for ever that will be worse than being beaten  master fodges countenance was neither affirmative nor negative of this proposition  but continued mr barton if you will be a good boy god will love you and you will grow up to be a good man now let me hear next thursday that you have been a good boy  master fodge had no distinct vision of the benefit that would accrue to him from this change of courses but mr barton being aware that miss fodge had touched on a delicate subject in alluding to the roast goose was determined to witness no more polemics between her and mr spratt so saying good morning to the latter he hastily left the college  the snow was falling in thicker and thicker flakes and already the vicaragegarden was cloaked in white as he passed through the gate mrs barton heard him open the door and ran out of the sittingroom to meet him  im afraid your feet are very wet dear what a terrible morning let me take your hat your slippers are at the fire  mr barton was feeling a little cold and cross it is difficult when you have been doing disagreeable duties without praise on a snowy day to attend to the very minor morals so he showed no recognition of millys attentions but simply said fetch me my dressinggown will you  it is down dear i thought you wouldnt go into the study because you said you would letter and number the books for the lending library patty and i have been covering them and they are all ready in the sittingroom  oh i cant do those this morning said mr barton as he took off his boots and put his feet into the slippers milly had brought him you must put them away into the parlour  the sittingroom was also the day nursery and schoolroom and while mammas back was turned dickey the second boy had insisted on superseding chubby in the guidance of a headless horse of the redwafered species which she was drawing round the room so that when papa opened the door chubby was giving tongue energetically  milly some of these children must go away i want to be quiet  yes dear hush chubby go with patty and see what nanny is getting for our dinner now fred and sophy and dickey help me to carry these books into the parlour there are three for dickey carry them steadily  papa meanwhile settled himself in his easychair and took up a work on episcopacy which he had from the clerical book society thinking he would finish it and return it this afternoon as he was going to the clerical meeting at milby vicarage where the book society had its headquarters  the clerical meetings and book society which had been founded some eight or ten months had had a noticeable effect on the rev amos barton when he first came to shepperton he was simply an evangelical clergyman whose christian experiences had commenced under the teaching of the rev mr johns of gun street chapel and had been consolidated at cambridge under the influence of mr simeon john newton and thomas scott were his doctrinal ideals he would have taken in the christian observer and the record if he could have afforded it his anecdotes were chiefly of the piousjocose kind current in dissenting circles and he thought an episcopalian establishment unobjectionable  but by this time the effect of the tractarian agitation was beginning to be felt in backward provincial regions and the tractarian satire on the lowchurch party was beginning to tell even on those who disavowed or resisted tractarian doctrines the vibration of an intellectual movement was felt from the golden head to the miry toes of the establishment and so it came to pass that in the district round milby the markettown close to shepperton the clergy had agreed to have a clerical meeting every month wherein they would exercise their intellects by discussing theological and ecclesiastical questions and cement their brotherly love by discussing a good dinner a book society naturally suggested itself as an adjunct of this agreeable plan and thus you perceive there was provision made for ample friction of the clerical mind  now the rev amos barton was one of those men who have a decided will and opinion of their own he held himself bolt upright and had no selfdistrust he would march very determinedly along the road he thought best but then it was wonderfully easy to convince him which was the best road and so a very little unwonted reading and unwonted discussion made him see that an episcopalian establishment was much more than unobjectionable and on many other points he began to feel that he held opinions a little too farsighted and profound to be crudely and suddenly communicated to ordinary minds he was like an onion that has been rubbed with spices the strong original odour was blended with something new and foreign the lowchurch onion still offended refined high church nostrils and the new spice was unwelcome to the palate of the genuine onioneater  we will not accompany him to the clerical meeting today because we shall probably want to go thither some day when he will be absent and just now i am bent on introducing you to mr bridmain and the countess czerlaski with whom mr and mrs barton are invited to dine tomorrow     chapter 3   outside the moon is shedding its cold light on the cold snow and the whitebearded firtrees round camp villa are casting a blue shadow across the white ground while the rev amos barton and his wife are audibly crushing the crisp snow beneath their feet as about seven oclock on friday evening they approach the door of the abovenamed desirable country residence containing dining breakfast and drawing rooms etc situated only half a mile from the markettown of milby  inside there is a bright fire in the drawingroom casting a pleasant but uncertain light on the delicate silk dress of a lady who is reclining behind a screen in the corner of the sofa and allowing you to discern that the hair of the gentleman who is seated in the armchair opposite with a newspaper over his knees is becoming decidedly grey a little king charles with a crimson ribbon round his neck who has been lying curled up in the very middle of the hearthrug has just discovered that that zone is too hot for him and is jumping on the sofa evidently with the intention of accommodating his person on the silk gown on the table there are two waxcandles which will be lighted as soon as the expected knock is heard at the door  the knock is heard the candles are lighted and presently mr and mrs barton are ushered inmr barton erect and clerical in a faultless tie and shining cranium mrs barton graceful in a newlyturned black silk  now this is charming of you said the countess czerlaski advancing to meet them and embracing milly with careful elegance i am really ashamed of my selfishness in asking my friends to come and see me in this frightful weather then giving her hand to amos and you mr barton whose time is so precious but i am doing a good deed in drawing you away from your labours i have a plot to prevent you from martyrizing yourself  while this greeting was going forward mr bridmain and jet the spaniel looked on with the air of actors who had no idea of byplay mr bridmain a stiff and rather thickset man gave his welcome with a laboured cordiality it was astonishing how very little he resembled his beautiful sister  for the countess czerlaski was undeniably beautiful as she seated herself by mrs barton on the sofa millys eyes indeed restedmust it be confessedchiefly on the details of the tasteful dress the rich silk of a pinkish lilac hue the countess always wore delicate colours in an evening the black lace pelerine and the black lace veil falling at the back of the small closelybraided head for milly had one weaknessdont love her any the less for it it was a pretty womans weaknessshe was fond of dress and often when she was making up her own economical millinery she had romantic visions how nice it would be to put on really handsome stylish thingsto have very stiff balloon sleeves for example without which a womans dress was nought in those days you and i too reader have our weakness have we not which makes us think foolish things now and then perhaps it may lie in an excessive admiration for small hands and feet a tall lithe figure large dark eyes and dark silken braided hair all these the countess possessed and she had moreover a delicatelyformed nose the least bit curved and a clear brunette complexion her mouth it must be admitted receded too much from her nose and chin and to a prophetic eye threatened nutcrackers in advanced age but by the light of fire and wax candles that age seemed very far off indeed and you would have said that the countess was not more than thirty  look at the two women on the sofa together the large fair mildeyed milly is timid even in friendship it is not easy to her to speak of the affection of which her heart is full the lithe dark thinlipped countess is racking her small brain for caressing words and charming exaggerations  and how are all the cherubs at home said the countess stooping to pick up jet and without waiting for an answer i have been kept indoors by a cold ever since sunday or i should not have rested without seeing you what have you done with those wretched singers mr barton  o we have got a new choir together which will go on very well with a little practice i was quite determined that the old set of singers should be dismissed i had given orders that they should not sing the wedding psalm as they call it again to make a newmarried couple look ridiculous and they sang it in defiance of me i could put them into the ecclesiastical court if i chose for to do so for lifting up their voices in church in opposition to the clergyman  and a most wholesome discipline that would be said the countess indeed you are too patient and forbearing mr barton for my part i lose my temper when i see how far you are from being appreciated in that miserable shepperton  if as is probable mr barton felt at a loss what to say in reply to the insinuated compliment it was a relief to him that dinner was announced just then and that he had to offer his arm to the countess  as mr bridmain was leading mrs barton to the diningroom he observed the weather is very severe  very indeed said milly  mr bridmain studied conversation as an art to ladies he spoke of the weather and was accustomed to consider it under three points of view as a question of climate in general comparing england with other countries in this respect as a personal question inquiring how it affected his lady interlocutor in particular and as a question of probabilities discussing whether there would be a change or a continuance of the present atmospheric conditions to gentlemen he talked politics and he read two daily papers expressly to qualify himself for this function mr barton thought him a man of considerable political information but not of lively parts  and so you are always to hold your clerical meetings at mr elys said the countess between her spoonfuls of soup the soup was a little overspiced mrs short of camp villa who was in the habit of letting her best apartments gave only moderate wages to her cook  yes said mr barton milby is a central place and there are many conveniences in having only one point of meeting  well continued the countess every one seems to agree in giving the precedence to mr ely for my part i cannot admire him his preaching is too cold for me it has no fervourno heart i often say to my brother it is a great comfort to me that shepperton church is not too far off for us to go to dont i edmund  yes answered mr bridmain they show us into such a bad pew at milbyjust where there is a draught from that door i caught a stiff neck the first time i went there  o it is the cold in the pulpit that affects me not the cold in the pew i was writing to my friend lady porter this morning and telling her all about my feelings she and i think alike on such matters she is most anxious that when sir william has an opportunity of giving away the living at their place dippley they should have a thoroughly zealous clever man there i have been describing a certain friend of mine to her who i think would be just to her mind and there is such a pretty rectory milly shouldnt i like to see you the mistress of it  milly smiled and blushed slightly the rev amos blushed very red and gave a little embarrassed laughhe could rarely keep his muscles within the limits of a smile at this moment john the manservant approached mrs barton with a gravytureen and also with a slight odour of the stable which usually adhered to him through his indoor functions john was rather nervous and the countess happening to speak to him at this inopportune moment the tureen slipped and emptied itself on mrs bartons newlyturned black silk  o horror tell alice to come directly and rub mrs bartons dress said the countess to the trembling john carefully abstaining from approaching the gravysprinkled spot on the floor with her own lilac silk but mr bridmain who had a strictly private interest in silks goodnaturedly jumped up and applied his napkin at once to mrs bartons gown  milly felt a little inward anguish but no illtemper and tried to make light of the matter for the sake of john as well as others the countess felt inwardly thankful that her own delicate silk had escaped but threw out lavish interjections of distress and indignation  dear saint that you are she said when milly laughed and suggested that as her silk was not very glossy to begin with the dim patch would not be much seen you dont mind about these things i know just the same sort of thing happened to me at the princess wengsteins one day on a pink satin i was in an agony but you are so indifferent to dress and well you may be it is you who make dress pretty and not dress that makes you pretty  alice the buxom ladysmaid wearing a much better dress than mrs bartons now appeared to take mr bridmains place in retrieving the mischief and after a great amount of supplementary rubbing composure was restored and the business of dining was continued when john was recounting his accident to the cook in the kitchen he observed mrs bartons a hamable woman id a deal sooner ha throwed the gravy oer the countesss fine gownd but laws what tantrums shed ha been in arter the visitors was gone  youd a deal sooner not ha throwed it down at all i should think responded the unsympathetic cook to whom john did not make love who dyou thinks to mek gravy anuff if youre to baste peoples gownds wi it  well suggested john humbly you should wet the bottom of the duree a bit to hold it from slippin  wet your granny returned the cook a retort which she probably regarded in the light of a reductio ad absurdum and which in fact reduced john to silence  later on in the evening while john was removing the teathings from the drawingroom and brushing the crumbs from the tablecloth with an accompanying hiss such as he was wont to encourage himself with in rubbing down mr bridmains horse the rev amos barton drew from his pocket a thin greencovered pamphlet and presenting it to the countess saidyou were pleased i think with my sermon on christmas day it has been printed in the pulpit and i thought you might like a copy  that indeed i shall i shall quite value the opportunity of reading that sermon there was such depth in itsuch argument it was not a sermon to be heard only once i am delighted that it should become generally known as it will be now it is printed in the pulpit  yes said milly innocently i was so pleased with the editors letter and she drew out her little pocketbook where she carefully treasured the editorial autograph while mr barton laughed and blushed and said nonsense milly  you see she said giving the letter to the countess i am very proud of the praise my husband gets  the sermon in question by the by was an extremely argumentative one on the incarnation which as it was preached to a congregation not one of whom had any doubt of that doctrine and to whom the socinians therein confuted were as unknown as the arimaspians was exceedingly well adapted to trouble and confuse the sheppertonian mind  ah said the countess returning the editors letter he may well say he will be glad of other sermons from the same source but i would rather you should publish your sermons in an independent volume mr barton it would be so desirable to have them in that shape for instance i could send a copy to the dean of radborough and there is lord blarney whom i knew before he was chancellor i was a special favourite of his and you cant think what sweet things he used to say to me i shall not resist the temptation to write to him one of these days sans facon and tell him how he ought to dispose of the next vacant living in his gift  whether jet the spaniel being a much more knowing dog than was suspected wished to express his disapproval of the countesss last speech as not accordant with his ideas of wisdom and veracity i cannot say but at this moment he jumped off her lap and turning his back upon her placed one paw on the fender and held the other up to warm as if affecting to abstract himself from the current of conversation  but now mr bridmain brought out the chessboard and mr barton accepted his challenge to play a game with immense satisfaction the rev amos was very fond of chess as most people are who can continue through many years to create interesting vicissitudes in the game by taking longmeditated moves with their knights and subsequently discovering that they have thereby exposed their queen  chess is a silent game and the countesss chat with milly is in quite an undertoneprobably relating to womens matters that it would be impertinent for us to listen to so we will leave camp villa and proceed to milby vicarage where mr farquhar has sat out two other guests with whom he has been dining at mr elys and is now rather wearying that reverend gentleman by his protracted smalltalk  mr ely was a tall darkhaired distinguishedlooking man of threeandthirty by the laity of milby and its neighbourhood he was regarded as a man of quite remarkable powers and learning who must make a considerable sensation in london pulpits and drawingrooms on his occasional visit to the metropolis and by his brother clergy he was regarded as a discreet and agreeable fellow mr ely never got into a warm discussion he suggested what might be thought but rarely said what he thought himself he never let either men or women see that he was laughing at them and he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at him in one thing only he was injudicious he parted his dark wavy hair down the middle and as his head was rather flat than otherwise that style of coiffure was not advantageous to him  mr farquhar though not a parishioner of mr elys was one of his warmest admirers and thought he would make an unexceptionable soninlaw in spite of his being of no particular family mr farquhar was susceptible on the point of bloodhis own circulating fluid which animated a short and somewhat flabby person being he considered of very superior quality  by the by he said with a certain pomposity counteracted by a lisp what an ath barton makth of himthelf about that bridmain and the counteth ath she callth herthelf after you were gone the other evening mithith farquhar wath telling him the general opinion about them in the neighbourhood and he got quite red and angry bleth your thoul he believth the whole thtory about her polish huthband and hith wonderful ethcapeth and ath for herwhy he thinkth her perfection a woman of motht refined fellingth and no end of thtuff  mr ely smiled some people would say our friend barton was not the best judge of refinement perhaps the lady flatters him a little and we men are susceptible she goes to shepperton church every sundaydrawn there let us suppose by mr bartons eloquence  pshaw said mr farquhar now to my mind you have only to look at that woman to thee what she iththrowing her eyth about when she comth into church and drething in a way to attract attention i should thay sheth tired of her brother bridmain and looking out for another brother with a thtronger family likeneth mithith farquhar ith very fond of mithith barton and ith quite dithtrethed that she should athothiate with thuch a woman tho she attacked him on the thubject purpothly but i tell her itth of no uthe with a pigheaded fellow like him bartonth wellmeaning enough but tho contheited ive left off giving him my advithe  mr ely smiled inwardly and said to himself what a punishment but to mr farquhar he said barton might be more judicious it must be confessed he was getting tired and did not want to develop the subject  why nobody vithitth them but the bartonth continued mr farquhar and why should thuch people come here unleth they had particular reathonth for preferring a neighbourhood where they are not known pooh it lookth bad on the very fathe of it you called on them now how did you find them  omr bridmain strikes me as a common sort of man who is making an effort to seem wise and wellbred he comes down on one tremendously with political information and seems knowing about the king of the french the countess is certainly a handsome woman but she puts on the grand air a little too powerfully woodcock was immensely taken with her and insisted on his wifes calling on her and asking her to dinner but i think mrs woodcock turned restive after the first visit and wouldnt invite her again  ha ha woodcock hath alwayth a thoft place in hith heart for a pretty fathe itth odd how he came to marry that plain woman and no fortune either  mysteries of the tender passion said mr ely i am not initiated yet you know  here mr farquhars carriage was announced and as we have not found his conversation particularly brilliant under the stimulus of mr elys exceptional presence we will not accompany him home to the less exciting atmosphere of domestic life  mr ely threw himself with a sense of relief into his easiest chair set his feet on the hobs and in this attitude of bachelor enjoyment began to read bishop jebbs memoirs     chapter 4   i am by no means sure that if the good people of milby had known the truth about the countess czerlaski they would not have been considerably disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined nice distinctions are troublesome it is so much easier to say that a thing is black than to discriminate the particular shade of brown blue or green to which it really belongs it is so much easier to make up your mind that your neighbour is good for nothing than to enter into all the circumstances that would oblige you to modify that opinion  besides think of all the virtuous declamation all the penetrating observation which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position that the countess was a very objectionable person indeed and which would be utterly overturned and nullified by the destruction of that premiss mrs phipps the bankers wife and mrs landor the attorneys wife had invested part of their reputation for acuteness in the supposition that mr bridmain was not the countesss brother moreover miss phipps was conscious that if the countess was not a disreputable person she miss phipps had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the other ladys manifest superiority in personal charms miss phippss stumpy figure and unsuccessful attire instead of looking down from a mount of virtue with an aureole round its head would then be seen on the same level and in the same light as the countess czerlaskis dianalike form and wellchosen drapery miss phipps for her part didnt like dressing for effectshe had always avoided that style of appearance which was calculated to create a sensation  then what amusing innuendoes of the milby gentlemen over their wine would have been entirely frustrated and reduced to nought if you had told them that the countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanours which demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society that her husband had been the veritable count czerlaski who had had wonderful escapes as she said and who as she did not say but as was said in certain circulars once folded by her fair hands had subsequently given dancing lessons in the metropolis that mr bridmain was neither more nor less than her halfbrother who by unimpeached integrity and industry had won a partnership in a silkmanufactory and thereby a moderate fortune that enabled him to retire as you see to study politics the weather and the art of conversation at his leisure mr bridmain in fact quadragenarian bachelor as he was felt extremely well pleased to receive his sister in her widowhood and to shine in the reflected light of her beauty and title every man who is not a monster a mathematician or a mad philosopher is the slave of some woman or other mr bridmain had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister and though his soul was a very little oneof the smallest description indeedhe would not have ventured to call it his own he might be slightly recalcitrant now and then as is the habit of longeared pachyderms under the thong of the fair countesss tongue but there seemed little probability that he would ever get his neck loose still a bachelors heart is an outlying fortress that some fair enemy may any day take either by storm or stratagem and there was always the possibility that mr bridmains first nuptials might occur before the countess was quite sure of her second as it was however he submitted to all his sisters caprices never grumbled because her dress and her maid formed a considerable item beyond her own little income of sixty pounds per annum and consented to lead with her a migratory life as personages on the debatable ground between aristocracy and commonalty instead of settling in some spot where his five hundred ayear might have won him the definite dignity of a parochial magnate  the countess had her views in choosing a quiet provincial place like milby after three years of widowhood she had brought her feelings to contemplate giving a successor to her lamented czerlaski whose fine whiskers fine air and romantic fortunes had won her heart ten years ago when as pretty caroline bridmain in the full bloom of fiveandtwenty she was governess to lady porters daughters whom he initiated into the mysteries of the pas de bas and the lancers quadrilles she had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with czerlaski who had taken her to paris and germany and introduced her there to many of his old friends with large titles and small fortunes so that the fair caroline had had considerable experience of life and had gathered therefrom not indeed any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom but much external polish and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind one of these conclusions was that there were things more solid in life than fine whiskers and a title and that in accepting a second husband she would regard these items as quite subordinate to a carriage and a settlement now she had ascertained by tentative residences that the kind of bite she was angling for was difficult to be met with at wateringplaces which were already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauties and were chiefly stocked with men whose whiskers might be dyed and whose incomes were still more problematic so she had determined on trying a neighbourhood where people were extremely well acquainted with each others affairs and where the women were mostly illdressed and ugly mr bridmains slow brain had adopted his sisters views and it seemed to him that a woman so handsome and distinguished as the countess must certainly make a match that might lift himself into the region of county celebrities and give him at least a sort of cousinship to the quartersessions  all this which was the simple truth would have seemed extremely flat to the gossips of milby who had made up their minds to something much more exciting there was nothing here so very detestable it is true the countess was a little vain a little ambitious a little selfish a little shallow and frivolous a little given to white liesbut who considers such slight blemishes such moral pimples as these disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society indeed the severest ladies in milby would have been perfectly aware that these characteristics would have created no wide distinction between the countess czerlaski and themselves and since it was clear there was a wide distinctionwhy it must lie in the possession of some vices from which they were undeniably free  hence it came to pass that milby respectability refused to recognize the countess czerlaski in spite of her assiduous churchgoing and the deep disgust she was known to have expressed at the extreme paucity of the congregations on ashwednesdays so she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighbourhood where people are well acquainted with each others private affairs under these circumstances you will imagine how welcome was the perfect credence and admiration she met with from mr and mrs barton she had been especially irritated by mr elys behaviour to her she felt sure that he was not in the least struck with her beauty that he quizzed her conversation and that he spoke of her with a sneer a woman always knows where she is utterly powerless and shuns a coldly satirical eye as she would shun a gorgon and she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship not merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society but because she really cared about religious matters and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that quarter she had serious intentions of becoming quite piouswithout any reserveswhen she had once got her carriage and settlement let us do this one sly trick says ulysses to neoptolemus and we will be perfectly honest ever after       greek all edu gar toi ktema tes uikes labien              tolma dikaioi d authis ekphanoumetha  the countess did not quote sophocles but she said to herself only this little bit of pretence and vanity and then i will be quite good and make myself quite safe for another world  and as she had by no means such fine taste and insight in theological teaching as in costume the rev amos barton seemed to her a man not only of learningthat is always understood with a clergymanbut of much power as a spiritual director as for milly the countess really loved her as well as the preoccupied state of her affections would allow for you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the countess was absorbingly devoted and to whose desires she made everything else subservientnamely caroline czerlaski nee bridmain  thus there was really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and attentions to mr and mrs barton still their friendship by no means adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to milby and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother  the thing we look forward to often comes to pass but never precisely in the way we have imagined to ourselves the countess did actually leave camp villa before many months were past but under circumstances which had not at all entered into her contemplation     chapter 5   the rev amos barton whose sad fortunes i have undertaken to relate was you perceive in no respect an ideal or exceptional character and perhaps i am doing a bold thing to bespeak your sympathy on behalf of a man who was so very far from remarkablea man whose virtues were not heroic and who had no undetected crime within his breast who had not the slightest mystery hanging about him but was palpably and unmistakably commonplace who was not even in love but had had that complaint favourably many years ago an utterly uninteresting character i think i hear a lady reader exclaimmrs farthingale for example who prefers the ideal in fiction to whom tragedy means ermine tippets adultery and murder and comedy the adventures of some personage who is quite a character  but my dear madam it is so very large a majority of your fellowcountrymen that are of this insignificant stamp at least eighty out of a hundred of your adult male fellowbritons returned in the last census are neither extraordinarily silly nor extraordinarily wicked nor extraordinarily wise their eyes are neither deep and liquid with sentiment nor sparkling with suppressed witticisms they have probably had no hairbreadth escapes or thrilling adventures their brains are certainly not pregnant with genius and their passions have not manifested themselves at all after the fashion of a volcano they are simply men of complexions more or less muddy whose conversation is more or less bald and disjointed yet these commonplace peoplemany of thembear a conscience and have felt the sublime prompting to do the painful right they have their unspoken sorrows and their sacred joys their hearts have perhaps gone out towards their firstborn and they have mourned over the irreclaimable dead nay is there not a pathos in their very insignificancein our comparison of their dim and narrow existence with the glorious possibilities of that human nature which they share  depend upon it you would gain unspeakably if you would learn with me to see some of the poetry and the pathos the tragedy and the comedy lying in the experience of a human soul that looks out through dull grey eyes and that speaks in a voice of quite ordinary tones in that case i should have no fear of your not caring to know what farther befell the rev amos barton or of your thinking the homely details i have to tell at all beneath your attention as it is you can if you please decline to pursue my story farther and you will easily find reading more to your taste since i learn from the newspapers that many remarkable novels full of striking situations thrilling incidents and eloquent writing have appeared only within the last season  meanwhile readers who have begun to feel an interest in the rev amos barton and his wife will be glad to learn that mr oldinport lent the twenty pounds but twenty pounds are soon exhausted when twelve are due as back payment to the butcher and when the possession of eight extra sovereigns in february weather is an irresistible temptation to order a new greatcoat and though mr bridmain so far departed from the necessary economy entailed on him by the countesss elegant toilette and expensive maid as to choose a handsome black silk stiff as his experienced eye discerned with the genuine strength of its own texture and not with the factitious strength of gum and present it to mrs barton in retrieval of the accident that had occurred at his table yet dear meas every husband has heardwhat is the present of a gown when you are deficiently furnished with the etceteras of apparel and when moreover there are six children whose wear and tear of clothes is something incredible to the nonmaternal mind  indeed the equation of income and expenditure was offering new and constantly accumulating difficulties to mr and mrs barton for shortly after the birth of little walter millys aunt who had lived with her ever since her marriage had withdrawn herself her furniture and her yearly income to the household of another niece prompted to that step very probably by a slight tiff with the rev amos which occurred while milly was upstairs and proved one too many for the elderly ladys patience and magnanimity mr bartons temper was a little warm but on the other hand elderly maiden ladies are known to be susceptible so we will not suppose that all the blame lay on his sidethe less so as he had every motive for humouring an inmate whose presence kept the wolf from the door it was now nearly a year since miss jacksons departure and to a fine ear the howl of the wolf was audibly approaching  it was a sad thing too that when the last snow had melted when the purple and yellow crocuses were coming up in the garden and the old church was already half pulled down milly had an illness which made her lips look pale and rendered it absolutely necessary that she should not exert herself for some time mr brand the shepperton doctor so obnoxious to mr pilgrim ordered her to drink portwine and it was quite necessary to have a charwoman very often to assist nanny in all the extra work that fell upon her  mrs hackit who hardly ever paid a visit to any one but her oldest and nearest neighbour mrs patten now took the unusual step of calling at the vicarage one morning and the tears came into her unsentimental eyes as she saw milly seated pale and feeble in the parlour unable to persevere in sewing the pinafore that lay on the table beside her little dickey a boisterous boy of five with large pink cheeks and sturdy legs was having his turn to sit with mamma and was squatting quiet as a mouse at her knee holding her soft white hand between his little red blacknailed fists he was a boy whom mrs hackit in a severe mood had pronounced stocky a word that etymologically in all probability conveys some allusion to an instrument of punishment for the refractory but seeing him thus subdued into goodness she smiled at him with her kindest smile and stooping down suggested a kissa favour which dicky resolutely declined  now do you take nourishing things enough was one of mrs hackits first questions and milly endeavoured to make it appear that no woman was ever so much in danger of being overfed and led into selfindulgent habits as herself but mrs hackit gathered one fact from her replies namely that mr brand had ordered portwine  while this conversation was going forward dickey had been furtively stroking and kissing the soft white hand so that at last when a pause came his mother said smilingly why are you kissing my hand dickey  it id to yovely answered dickey who you observe was decidedly backward in his pronunciation  mrs hackit remembered this little scene in after days and thought with peculiar tenderness and pity of the stocky boy  the next day there came a hamper with mrs hackits respects and on being opened it was found to contain halfadozen of portwine and two couples of fowls mrs farquhar too was very kind insisted on mrs bartons rejecting all arrowroot but hers which was genuine indian and carried away sophy and fred to stay with her a fortnight these and other goodnatured attentions made the trouble of millys illness more bearable but they could not prevent it from swelling expenses and mr barton began to have serious thoughts of representing his case to a certain charity for the relief of needy curates  altogether as matters stood in shepperton the parishioners were more likely to have a strong sense that the clergyman needed their material aid than that they needed his spiritual aidnot the best state of things in this age and country where faith in men solely on the ground of their spiritual gifts has considerably diminished and especially unfavourable to the influence of the rev amos whose spiritual gifts would not have had a very commanding power even in an age of faith  but you ask did not the countess czerlaski pay any attention to her friends all this time to be sure she did she was indefatigable in visiting her sweet milly and sitting with her for hours together it may seem remarkable to you that she neither thought of taking away any of the children nor of providing for any of millys probable wants but ladies of rank and of luxurious habits you know cannot be expected to surmise the details of poverty she put a great deal of eaudecologne on mrs bartons pockethandkerchief rearranged her pillow and footstool kissed her cheeks wrapped her in a soft warm shawl from her own shoulders and amused her with stories of the life she had seen abroad when mr barton joined them she talked of tractarianism of her determination not to reenter the vortex of fashionable life and of her anxiety to see him in a sphere large enough for his talents milly thought her sprightliness and affectionate warmth quite charming and was very fond of her while the rev amos had a vague consciousness that he had risen into aristocratic life and only associated with his middleclass parishioners in a pastoral and parenthetic manner  however as the days brightened millys cheeks and lips brightened too and in a few weeks she was almost as active as ever though watchful eyes might have seen that activity was not easy to her mrs hackits eyes were of that kind and one day when mr and mrs barton had been dining with her for the first time since millys illness she observed to her husbandthat poor things dreadful weak an delicate she wont stan havin many more children  mr barton meanwhile had been indefatigable in his vocation he had preached two extemporary sermons every sunday at the workhouse where a room had been fitted up for divine service pending the alterations in the church and had walked the same evening to a cottage at one or other extremity of his parish to deliver another sermon still more extemporary in an atmosphere impregnated with springflowers and perspiration after all these labours you will easily conceive that he was considerably exhausted by halfpast nine oclock in the evening and that a supper at a friendly parishioners with a glass or even two glasses of brandyandwater after it was a welcome reinforcement mr barton was not at all an ascetic he thought the benefits of fasting were entirely confined to the old testament dispensation he was fond of relaxing himself with a little gossip indeed miss bond and other ladies of enthusiastic views sometimes regretted that mr barton did not more uninterruptedly exhibit a superiority to the things of the flesh thin ladies who take little exercise and whose livers are not strong enough to bear stimulants are so extremely critical about ones personal habits and after all the rev amos never came near the borders of a vice his very faults were middlinghe was not very ungrammatical it was not in his nature to be superlative in anything unless indeed he was superlatively middling the quintessential extract of mediocrity if there was any one point on which he showed an inclination to be excessive it was confidence in his own shrewdness and ability in practical matters so that he was very full of plans which were something like his moves in chessadmirably well calculated supposing the state of the case were otherwise for example that notable plan of introducing antidissenting books into his lending library did not in the least appear to have bruised the head of dissent though it had certainly made dissent strongly inclined to bite the rev amoss heel again he vexed the souls of his churchwardens and influential parishioners by his fertile suggestiveness as to what it would be well for them to do in the matter of the church repairs and other ecclesiastical secularities  i never saw the like to parsons mr hackit said one day in conversation with his brother churchwarden mr bond theyre alys for meddling with business an they know no more about it than my black filly  ah said mr bond theyre too high learnt to have much commonsense  well remarked mr hackit in a modest and dubious tone as if throwing out a hypothesis which might be considered bold i should say thats a bad sort of eddication as makes folks onreasonable  so that you perceive mr bartons popularity was in that precarious condition in that toppling and contingent state in which a very slight push from a malignant destiny would utterly upset it that push was not long in being given as you shall hear  one fine may morning when amos was out on his parochial visits and the sunlight was streaming through the bowwindow of the sittingroom where milly was seated at her sewing occasionally looking up to glance at the children playing in the garden there came a loud rap at the door which she at once recognized as the countesss and that welldressed lady presently entered the sittingroom with her veil drawn over her face milly was not at all surprised or sorry to see her but when the countess threw up her veil and showed that her eyes were red and swollen she was both surprised and sorry  what can be the matter dear caroline  caroline threw down jet who gave a little yelp then she threw her arms round millys neck and began to sob then she threw herself on the sofa and begged for a glass of water then she threw off her bonnet and shawl and by the time millys imagination had exhausted itself in conjuring up calamities she saiddear how shall i tell you i am the most wretched woman to be deceived by a brother to whom i have been so devotedto see him degrading himselfgiving himself utterly to the dogs  what can it be said milly who began to picture to herself the sober mr bridmain taking to brandy and betting  he is going to be marriedto marry my own maid that deceitful alice to whom i have been the most indulgent mistress did you ever hear of anything so disgraceful so mortifying so disreputable  and has he only just told you of it said milly who having really heard of worse conduct even in her innocent life avoided a direct answer  told me of it he had not even the grace to do that i went into the diningroom suddenly and found him kissing herdisgusting at his time of life is it notand when i reproved her for allowing such liberties she turned round saucily and said she was engaged to be married to my brother and she saw no shame in allowing him to kiss her edmund is a miserable coward you know and looked frightened but when she asked him to say whether it was not so he tried to summon up courage and say yes i left the room in disgust and this morning i have been questioning edmund and find that he is bent on marrying this woman and that he has been putting off telling mebecause he was ashamed of himself i suppose i couldnt possibly stay in the house after this with my own maid turned mistress and now milly i am come to throw myself on your charity for a week or two will you take me in  that we will said milly if you will only put up with our poor rooms and way of living it will be delightful to have you  it will soothe me to be with you and mr barton a little while i feel quite unable to go among my other friends just at present what those two wretched people will do i dont knowleave the neighbourhood at once i hope i entreated my brother to do so before he disgraced himself  when amos came home he joined his cordial welcome and sympathy to millys byandby the countesss formidable boxes which she had carefully packed before her indignation drove her away from camp villa arrived at the vicarage and were deposited in the spare bedroom and in two closets not spare which milly emptied for their reception a week afterwards the excellent apartments at camp villa comprising dining and drawing rooms three bedrooms and a dressingroom were again to let and mr bridmains sudden departure together with the countess czerlaskis installation as a visitor at shepperton vicarage became a topic of general conversation in the neighbourhood the keensighted virtue of milby and shepperton saw in all this a confirmation of its worst suspicions and pitied the rev amos bartons gullibility  but when week after week and month after month slipped by without witnessing the countesss departurewhen summer and harvest had fled and still left her behind them occupying the spare bedroom and the closets and also a large proportion of mrs bartons time and attention new surmises of a very evil kind were added to the old rumours and began to take the form of settled convictions in the minds even of mr bartons most friendly parishioners  and now here is an opportunity for an accomplished writer to apostrophize calumny to quote virgil and to show that he is acquainted with the most ingenious things which have been said on that subject in polite literature  but what is opportunity to the man who cant use it an undefecundated egg which the waves of time wash away into nonentity so as my memory is illfurnished and my notebook still worse i am unable to show myself either erudite or eloquent apropos of the calumny whereof the rev amos barton was the victim i can only ask my readerdid you ever upset your inkbottle and watch in helpless agony the rapid spread of stygian blackness over your fair manuscript or fairer tablecover with a like inky swiftness did gossip now blacken the reputation of the rev amos barton causing the unfriendly to scorn and even the friendly to stand aloof at a time when difficulties of another kind were fast thickening around him     chapter 6   one november morning at least six months after the countess czerlaski had taken up her residence at the vicarage mrs hackit heard that her neighbour mrs patten had an attack of her old complaint vaguely called the spasms accordingly about eleven oclock she put on her velvet bonnet and cloth cloak with a long boa and muff large enough to stow a prize baby in for mrs hackit regulated her costume by the calendar and brought out her furs on the first of november whatever might be the temperature she was not a woman weakly to accommodate herself to shillyshally proceedings if the season didnt know what it ought to do mrs hackit did in her best days it was always sharp weather at gunpowder plot and she didnt like new fashions  and this morning the weather was very rationally in accordance with her costume for as she made her way through the fields to cross farm the yellow leaves on the hedgegirt elms which showed bright and golden against the longhanging purple clouds were being scattered across the grassy path by the coldest of november winds ah mrs hackit thought to herself i daresay we shall have a sharp pinch this winter and if we do i shouldnt wonder if it takes the old lady off they say a green yule makes a fat churchyard but so does a white yule too for that matter when the stools rotten enough no matter who sits on it  however on her arrival at cross farm the prospect of mrs pattens decease was again thrown into the dim distance in her imagination for miss janet gibbs met her with the news that mrs patten was much better and led her without any preliminary announcement to the old ladys bedroom janet had scarcely reached the end of her circumstantial narrative how the attack came on and what were her aunts sensationsa narrative to which mrs patten in her neatlyplaited nightcap seemed to listen with a contemptuous resignation to her nieces historical inaccuracy contenting herself with occasionally confounding janet by a shake of the headwhen the clatter of a horses hoofs on the yard pavement announced the arrival of mr pilgrim whose large topbooted person presently made its appearance upstairs he found mrs patten going on so well that there was no need to look solemn he might glide from condolence into gossip without offence and the temptation of having mrs hackits ear was irresistible  what a disgraceful business this is turning out of your parsons was the remark with which he made this agreeable transition throwing himself back in the chair from which he had been leaning towards the patient eh dear me said mrs hackit disgraceful enough i stuck to mr barton as long as i could for his wifes sake but i cant countenance such goingson its hateful to see that woman coming with em to service of a sunday and if mr hackit wasnt churchwarden and i didnt think it wrong to forsake ones own parish i should go to knebley church theres a many parishners as do  i used to think barton was only a fool observed mr pilgrim in a tone which implied that he was conscious of having been weakly charitable i thought he was imposed upon and led away by those people when they first came but thats impossible now  o its as plain as the nose in your face said mrs hackit unreflectingly not perceiving the equivoque in her comparisoncomin to milby like a sparrow perchin on a bough as i may say with her brother as she called him and then all on a sudden the brother goes off with himself and she throws herself on the bartons though what could make her take up with a poor notomise of a parson as hasnt got enough to keep wife and children theres one above knowsi dont  mr barton may have attractions we dont know of said mr pilgrim who piqued himself on a talent for sarcasm the countess has no maid now and they say mr barton is handy in assisting at her toilettelaces her boots and so forth  tilette be fiddled said mrs hackit with indignant boldness of metaphor an theres that poor thing asewing her fingers to the bone for them childrenan another comin on what she must have to go through it goes to my heart to turn my back on her but shes i the wrong to let herself be put upon i that manner  ah i was talking to mrs farquhar about that the other day she said i think mrs barton a very weak woman mr pilgrim gave this quotation with slow emphasis as if he thought mrs farquhar had uttered a remarkable sentiment they find it impossible to invite her to their house while she has that equivocal person staying with her  well remarked miss gibbs if i was a wife nothing should induce me to bear what mrs barton does  yes its fine talking said mrs patten from her pillow old maids husbands are alys wellmanaged if you was a wife youd be as foolish as your betters belike  all my wonder is observed mrs hackit how the bartons make both ends meet you may depend on it shes got nothing to give em for i understand as hes been having money from some clergy charity they said at fust as she stuffed mr barton wi notions about her writing to the chancellor an her fine friends to give him a living howiver i dont know whats true an whats false mr barton keeps away from our house now for i gave him a bit o my mind one day maybe hes ashamed of himself he seems to me to look dreadful thin an harassed of a sunday  o he must be aware hes getting into bad odour everywhere the clergy are quite disgusted with his folly they say carpe would be glad to get barton out of the curacy if he could but he cant do that without coming to shepperton himself as bartons a licensed curate and he wouldnt like that i suppose  at this moment mrs patten showed signs of uneasiness which recalled mr pilgrim to professional attentions and mrs hackit observing that it was thursday and she must see after the butter said goodbye promising to look in again soon and bring her knitting  this thursday by the by is the first in the monththe day on which the clerical meeting is held at milby vicarage and as the rev amos barton has reasons for not attending he will very likely be a subject of conversation amongst his clerical brethren suppose we go there and hear whether mr pilgrim has reported their opinion correctly  there is not a numerous party today for it is a season of sore throats and catarrhs so that the exegetical and theological discussions which are the preliminary of dining have not been quite so spirited as usual and although a question relative to the epistle of jude has not been quite cleared up the striking of six by the church clock and the simultaneous announcement of dinner are sounds that no one feels to be importunate  pleasant when one is not in the least bilious to enter a comfortable diningroom where the closelydrawn red curtains glow with the double light of fire and candle where glass and silver are glittering on the pure damask and a souptureen gives a hint of the fragrance that will presently rush out to inundate your hungry senses and prepare them by the delicate visitation of atoms for the keen gusto of ampler contact especially if you have confidence in the dinnergiving capacity of your hostif you know that he is not a man who entertains grovelling views of eating and drinking as a mere satisfaction of hunger and thirst and dead to all the finer influences of the palate expects his guest to be brilliant on illflavoured gravies and the cheapest marsala mr ely was particularly worthy of such confidence and his virtues as an amphitryon had probably contributed quite as much as the central situation of milby to the selection of his house as a clerical rendezvous he looks particularly graceful at the head of his table and indeed on all occasions where he acts as president or moderator he is a man who seems to listen well and is an excellent amalgam of dissimilar ingredients  at the other end of the table as vice sits mr fellowes rector and magistrate a man of imposing appearance with a mellifluous voice and the readiest of tongues mr fellowes once obtained a living by the persuasive charms of his conversation and the fluency with which he interpreted the opinions of an obese and stammering baronet so as to give that elderly gentleman a very pleasing perception of his own wisdom mr fellowes is a very successful man and has the highest character everywhere except in his own parish where doubtless because his parishioners happen to be quarrelsome people he is always at fierce feud with a farmer or two a colliery proprietor a grocer who was once churchwarden and a tailor who formerly officiated as clerk  at mr elys right hand you see a very small man with a sallow and somewhat puffy face whose hair is brushed straight up evidently with the intention of giving him a height somewhat less disproportionate to his sense of his own importance than the measure of five feet three accorded him by an oversight of nature this is rev archibald duke a very dyspeptic and evangelical man who takes the gloomiest view of mankind and their prospects and thinks the immense sale of the pickwick papers recently completed one of the strongest proofs of original sin unfortunately though mr duke was not burdened with a family his yearly expenditure was apt considerably to exceed his income and the unpleasant circumstances resulting from this together with heavy meatbreakfasts may probably have contributed to his desponding views of the world generally  next to him is seated mr furness a tall young man with blond hair and whiskers who was plucked at cambridge entirely owing to his genius at least i know that he soon afterwards published a volume of poems which were considered remarkably beautiful by many young ladies of his acquaintance mr furness preached his own sermons as any one of tolerable critical acumen might have certified by comparing them with his poems in both there was an exuberance of metaphor and simile entirely original and not in the least borrowed from any resemblance in the things compared  on mr furnesss left you see mr pugh another young curate of much less marked characteristics he had not published any poems he had not even been plucked he had neat black whiskers and a pale complexion read prayers and a sermon twice every sunday and might be seen any day sallying forth on his parochial duties in a white tie a wellbrushed hat a perfect suit of black and wellpolished bootsan equipment which he probably supposed hieroglyphically to represent the spirit of christianity to the parishioners of whittlecombe  mr pughs visavis is the rev martin cleves a man about forty middlesized broadshouldered with a negligentlytied cravat large irregular features and a large head thickly covered with lanky brown hair to a superficial glance mr cleves is the plainest and least clericallooking of the party yet strange to say there is the true parish priest the pastor beloved consulted relied on by his flock a clergyman who is not associated with the undertaker but thought of as the surest helper under a difficulty as a monitor who is encouraging rather than severe mr cleves has the wonderful art of preaching sermons which the wheelwright and the blacksmith can understand not because he talks condescending twaddle but because he can call a spade a spade and knows how to disencumber ideas of their wordy frippery look at him more attentively and you will see that his face is a very interesting one that there is a great deal of humour and feeling playing in his grey eyes and about the corners of his roughlycut mouth a man you observe who has most likely sprung from the harderworking section of the middle class and has hereditary sympathies with the checkered life of the people he gets together the working men in his parish on a monday evening and gives them a sort of conversational lecture on useful practical matters telling them stories or reading some select passages from an agreeable book and commenting on them and if you were to ask the first labourer or artisan in tripplegate what sort of man the parson was he would saya uncommon knowin sensable freespoken gentleman very kind an goodnaturd too yet for all this he is perhaps the best grecian of the party if we except mr baird the young man on his left  mr baird has since gained considerable celebrity as an original writer and metropolitan lecturer but at that time he used to preach in a little church something like a barn to a congregation consisting of three rich farmers and their servants about fifteen labourers and the due proportion of women and children the rich farmers understood him to be very high learnt but if you had interrogated them for a more precise description they would have said that he was a thinnishfaced man with a sort o cast in his eye like  seven altogether a delightful number for a dinnerparty supposing the units to be delightful but everything depends on that during dinner mr fellowes took the lead in the conversation which set strongly in the direction of mangoldwurzel and the rotation of crops for mr fellowes and mr cleves cultivated their own glebes mr ely too had some agricultural notions and even the rev archibald duke was made alive to that class of mundane subjects by the possession of some potatoground the two young curates talked a little aside during these discussions which had imperfect interest for their unbeneficed minds and the transcendental and nearsighted mr baird seemed to listen somewhat abstractedly knowing little more of potatoes and mangoldwurzel than that they were some form of the conditioned  what a hobby farming is with lord watling said mr fellowes when the cloth was being drawn i went over his farm at tetterley with him last summer it is really a model farm firstrate dairy grazing and wheat land and such splendid farmbuildings an expensive hobby though he sinks a good deal of money there i fancy he has a great whim for black cattle and he sends that drunken old scotch bailiff of his to scotland every year with hundreds in his pocket to buy these beasts  by the by said mr ely do you know who is the man to whom lord watling has given the bramhill living  a man named sargent i knew him at oxford his brother is a lawyer and was very useful to lord watling in that ugly brounsell affair thats why sargent got the living  sargent said mr ely i know him isnt he a showy talkative fellow has written travels in mesopotamia or something of that sort  thats the man  he was at witherington once as bagshawes curate he got into rather bad odour there through some scandal about a flirtation i think  talking of scandal returned mr fellowes have you heard the last story about barton nisbett was telling me the other day that he dines alone with the countess at six while mrs barton is in the kitchen acting as cook  rather an apocryphal authority nisbett said mr ely  ah said mr cleves with goodnatured humour twinkling in his eyes depend upon it that is a corrupt version the original text is that they all dined together with sixmeaning six childrenand that mrs barton is an excellent cook  i wish dining alone together may be the worst of that sad business said the rev archibald duke in a tone implying that his wish was a strong figure of speech  well said mr fellowes filling his glass and looking jocose barton is certain either the greatest gull in existence or he has some cunning secretsome philtre or other to make himself charming in the eyes of a fair lady it isnt all of us that can make conquests when our ugliness is past its bloom  the lady seemed to have made a conquest of him at the very outset said mr ely i was immensely amused one night at granbys when he was telling us her story about her husbands adventures he said when she told me the tale i felt i dont know howi felt it from the crown of my head to the sole of my feet  mr ely gave these words dramatically imitating the rev amoss fervour and symbolic action and every one laughed except mr duke whose afterdinner view of things was not apt to be jovial he saidi think some of us ought to remonstrate with mr barton on the scandal he is causing he is not only imperilling his own soul but the souls of his flock  depend upon it said mr cleves there is some simple explanation of the whole affair if we only happened to know it barton has always impressed me as a rightminded man who has the knack of doing himself injustice by his manner  now i never liked barton said mr fellowes hes not a gentleman why he used to be on terms of intimacy with that canting prior who died a little while agoa fellow who soaked himself with spirits and talked of the gospel through an inflamed nose  the countess has given him more refined tastes i daresay said mr ely  well observed mr cleves the poor fellow must have a hard pull to get along with his small income and large family let us hope the countess does something towards making the pot boil  not she said mr duke there are greater signs of poverty about them than ever  well come returned mr cleves who could be caustic sometimes and who was not at all fond of his reverend brother mr duke thats something in bartons favour at all events he might be poor without showing signs of poverty  mr duke turned rather yellow which was his way of blushing and mr ely came to his relief by observingtheyre making a very good piece of work of shepperton church dolby the architect who has it in hand is a very clever fellow  its he who has been doing coppleton church said mr furness theyve got it in excellent order for the visitation  this mention of the visitation suggested the bishop and thus opened a wide duct which entirely diverted the stream of animadversion from that small pipethat capillary vessel the rev amos barton  the talk of the clergy about their bishop belongs to the esoteric part of their profession so we will at once quit the diningroom at milby vicarage lest we should happen to overhear remarks unsuited to the lay understanding and perhaps dangerous to our repose of mind     chapter 7   i dare say the long residence of the countess czerlaski at shepperton vicarage is very puzzling to you also dear reader as well as to mr bartons clerical brethren the more so as i hope you are not in the least inclined to put that very evil interpretation on it which evidently found acceptance with the sallow and dyspeptic mr duke and with the florid and highly peptic mr fellowes you have seen enough i trust of the rev amos barton to be convinced that he was more apt to fall into a blunder than into a sinmore apt to be deceived than to incur a necessity for being deceitful and if you have a keen eye for physiognomy you will have detected that the countess czerlaski loved herself far too well to get entangled in an unprofitable vice  how then you will say could this fine lady choose to quarter herself on the establishment of a poor curate where the carpets were probably falling into holes where the attendance was limited to a maid of all work and where six children were running loose from eight oclock in the morning till eight oclock in the evening surely you must be misrepresenting the facts  heaven forbid for not having a lofty imagination as you perceive and being unable to invent thrilling incidents for your amusement my only merit must lie in the truth with which i represent to you the humble experience of an ordinary fellowmortal i wish to stir your sympathy with commonplace troublesto win your tears for real sorrow sorrow such as may live next door to yousuch as walks neither in rags nor in velvet but in very ordinary decent apparel  therefore that you may dismiss your suspicions of my veracity i will beg you to consider that at the time the countess czerlaski left camp villa in dudgeon she had only twenty pounds in her pocket being about onethird of the income she possessed independently of her brother you will then perceive that she was in the extremely inconvenient predicament of having quarrelled not indeed with her bread and cheese but certainly with her chicken and tarta predicament all the more inconvenient to her because the habit of idleness had quite unfitted her for earning those necessary superfluities and because with all her fascinations she had not secured any enthusiastic friends whose houses were open to her and who were dying to see her thus she had completely checkmated herself unless she could resolve on one unpleasant movenamely to humble herself to her brother and recognize his wife this seemed quite impossible to her as long as she entertained the hope that he would make the first advances and in this flattering hope she remained month after month at shepperton vicarage gracefully overlooking the deficiencies of accommodation and feeling that she was really behaving charmingly who indeed she thought to herself could do otherwise with a lovely gentle creature like milly i shall really be sorry to leave the poor thing  so though she lay in bed till ten and came down to a separate breakfast at eleven she kindly consented to dine as early as five when a hot joint was prepared which coldly furnished forth the childrens table the next day she considerately prevented milly from devoting herself too closely to the children by insisting on reading talking and walking with her and she even began to embroider a cap for the next baby which must certainly be a girl and be named caroline  after the first month or two of her residence at the vicarage the rev amos barton became awareas indeed it was unavoidable that he shouldof the strong disapprobation it drew upon him and the change of feeling towards him which it was producing in his kindest parishioners but in the first place he still believed in the countess as a charming and influential woman disposed to befriend him and in any case he could hardly hint departure to a lady guest who had been kind to him and his and who might any day spontaneously announce the termination of her visit in the second place he was conscious of his own innocence and felt some contemptuous indignation towards people who were ready to imagine evil of him and lastly he had as i have already intimated a strong will of his own so that a certain obstinacy and defiance mingled itself with his other feelings on the subject  the one unpleasant consequence which was not to be evaded or counteracted by any mere mental state was the increasing drain on his slender purse for household expenses to meet which the remittance he had received from the clerical charity threatened to be quite inadequate slander may be defeated by equanimity but courageous thoughts will not pay your bakers hill and fortitude is nowhere considered legal tender for beef month after month the financial aspect of the rev amoss affairs became more and more serious to him and month after month too wore away more and more of that armour of indignation and defiance with which he had at first defended himself from the harsh looks of faces that were once the friendliest  but quite the heaviest pressure of the trouble fell on millyon gentle uncomplaining millywhose delicate body was becoming daily less fit for all the many things that had to be done between rising up and lying down at first she thought the countesss visit would not last long and she was quite glad to incur extra exertion for the sake of making her friend comfortable i can hardly bear to think of all the rough work she did with those lovely handsall by the sly without letting her husband know anything about it and husbands are not clairvoyant how she salted bacon ironed shirts and cravats put patches on patches and redarned darns then there was the task of mending and eking out babylinen in prospect and the problem perpetually suggesting itself how she and nanny should manage when there was another baby as there would be before very many months were past  when time glided on and the countesss visit did not end milly was not blind to any phase of their position she knew of the slander she was aware of the keeping aloof of old friends but these she felt almost entirely on her husbands account a loving womans world lies within the four walls of her own home and it is only through her husband that she is in any electric communication with the world beyond mrs simpkins may have looked scornfully at her but baby crows and holds out his little arms none the less blithely mrs tomkins may have left off calling on her but her husband comes home none the less to receive her care and caresses it has been wet and gloomy out of doors today but she has looked well after the shirt buttons has cut out babys pinafores and half finished willys blouse  so it was with milly she was only vexed that her husband should be vexedonly wounded because he was misconceived but the difficulty about ways and means she felt in quite a different manner her rectitude was alarmed lest they should have to make tradesmen wait for their money her motherly love dreaded the diminution of comforts for the children and the sense of her own failing health gave exaggerated force to these fears  milly could no longer shut her eyes to the fact that the countess was inconsiderate if she did not allow herself to entertain severer thoughts and she began to feel that it would soon be a duty to tell her frankly that they really could not afford to have her visit farther prolonged but a process was going forward in two other minds which ultimately saved milly from having to perform this painful task  in the first place the countess was getting weary of sheppertonweary of waiting for her brothers overtures which never came so one fine morning she reflected that forgiveness was a christian duty that a sister should be placable that mr bridmain must feel the need of her advice to which he had been accustomed for three years and that very likely that woman didnt make the poor man happy in this amiable frame of mind she wrote a very affectionate appeal and addressed it to mr bridmain through his banker  another mind that was being wrought up to a climax was nannys the maidofallwork who had a warm heart and a still warmer temper nanny adored her mistress she had been heard to say that she was ready to kiss the ground as the missis trod on and walter she considered was her baby of whom she was as jealous as a lover but she had from the first very slight admiration for the countess czerlaski that lady from nannys point of view was a personage always drawed out i fine clothes the chief result of whose existence was to cause additional bedmaking carrying of hot water laying of tablecloths and cooking of dinners it was a perpetually heightening aggravation to nanny that she and her mistress had to slave more than ever because there was this fine lady in the house  an she pays nothin fort neither observed nanny to mr jacob tomms a young gentleman in the tailoring line who occasionallysimply out of a taste for dialoguelooked into the vicarage kitchen of an evening i know the masters shorter o money than iver an it meks no end o difference i th housekeepinher bein here besides bein obliged to have a charwoman constant  theres fine stories i the village about her said mr tomms they say as muster bartons great wi her or else shed niver stop here  then they say a passill o lies an you ought to be ashamed to go an tell em oer again do you think as the master as has got a wife like the missis ud go running arter a stuckup piece o goods like that countess as isnt fit to black the mississ shoes im none so fond o the master but i know better on him nor that  well i didnt blieve it said mr tomms humbly  blieve it youd ha been a ninny if yer did an shes a nasty stingy thing that countess shes niver giv me a sixpence nor an old rag neither sin heres shes been alyin a bed an acomin down to breakfast when other folks wants their dinner  if such was the state of nannys mind as early as the end of august when this dialogue with mr tomms occurred you may imagine what it must have been by the beginning of november and that at that time a very slight spark might any day cause the longsmouldering anger to flame forth in open indignation  that spark happened to fall the very morning that mrs hackit paid the visit to mrs patten recorded in the last chapter nannys dislike of the countess extended to the innocent dog jet whom she couldnt abear to see made a fuss wi like a christian an the little ouzle must be washed too ivery saturday as if there wasnt children enoo to wash wiout washin dogs  now this particular morning it happened that milly was quite too poorly to get up and mr barton observed to nanny on going out that he would call and tell mr brand to come these circumstances were already enough to make nanny anxious and susceptible but the countess comfortably ignorant of them came down as usual about eleven oclock to her separate breakfast which stood ready for her at that hour in the parlour the kettle singing on the hob that she might make her own tea there was a little jug of cream taken according to custom from last nights milk and specially saved for the countesss breakfast jet always awaited his mistress at her bedroom door and it was her habit to carry him down stairs  now my little jet she said putting him down gently on the hearthrug you shall have a nice nice breakfast  jet indicated that he thought that observation extremely pertinent and welltimed by immediately raising himself on his hindlegs and the countess emptied the creamjug into the saucer now there was usually a small jug of milk standing on the tray by the side of the cream and destined for jets breakfast but this morning nanny being moithered had forgotten that part of the arrangements so that when the countess had made her tea she perceived there was no second jug and rang the bell nanny appeared looking very red and heatedthe fact was she had been doing up the kitchen fire and that is a sort of work which by no means conduces to blandness of temper nanny you have forgotten jets milk will you bring me some more cream please  this was just a little too much for nannys forbearance yes i dare say here am i wi my hands full o the children an the dinner and missis ill abed and mr brand acomin and i must run oer the village to get more cream cause youve give it to that nasty little blackamoor  is mrs barton ill  illyesi should think she is ill an much you care shes likely to be ill moithered as she is from mornin to night wi folks as had better be elsewhere  what do you mean by behaving in this way  mean why i mean as the missis is a slavin her life out an asittin up onights for folks as are better able to wait of her istid o lyin abed an doin nothin all the blessed day but mek work  leave the room and dont be insolent  insolent id better be insolent than like what some folks isalivin on other folks an bringin a bad name on em into the bargain  here nanny flung out of the room leaving the lady to digest this unexpected breakfast at her leisure  the countess was stunned for a few minutes but when she began to recall nannys words there was no possibility of avoiding very unpleasant conclusions from them or of failing to see her position at the vicarage in an entirely new light the interpretation too of nannys allusion to a bad name did not lie out of the reach of the countesss imagination and she saw the necessity of quitting shepperton without delay still she would like to wait for her brothers letternoshe would ask milly to forward it to herstill better she would go at once to london inquire her brothers address at his bankers and go to see him without preliminary  she went up to millys room and after kisses and inquiries saidi find on consideration dear milly from the letter i had yesterday that i must bid you goodbye and go up to london at once but you must not let me leave you ill you naughty thing  oh no said milly who felt as if a load had been taken off her back i shall be very well in an hour or two indeed im much better now you will want me to help you to pack but you wont go for two or three days  yes i must go tomorrow but i shall not let you help me to pack so dont entertain any unreasonable projects but lie still mr brand is coming nanny says  the news was not an unpleasant surprise to mr barton when he came home though he was able to express more regret at the idea of parting than milly could summon to her lips he retained more of his original feeling for the countess than milly did for women never betray themselves to men as they do to each other and the rev amos had not a keen instinct for character but he felt that he was being relieved from a difficulty and in the way that was easiest for him neither he nor milly suspected that it was nanny who had cut the knot for them for the countess took care to give no sign on that subject as for nanny she was perfectly aware of the relation between cause and effect in the affair and secretly chuckled over her outburst of sauce as the best mornings work she had ever done  so on friday morning a fly was seen standing at the vicarage gate with the countesss boxes packed upon it and presently that lady herself was seen getting into the vehicle after a last shake of the hand to mr barton and last kisses to milly and the children the door was closed and as the fly rolled off the little party at the vicarage gate caught a last glimpse of the handsome countess leaning and waving kisses from the carriage window jets little black phiz was also seen and doubtless he had his thoughts and feelings on the occasion but he kept them strictly within his own bosom  the schoolmistress opposite witnessed this departure and lost no time in telling it to the schoolmaster who again communicated the news to the landlord of the jolly colliers at the close of the morning schoolhours nanny poured the joyful tidings into the ear of mr farquhars footman who happened to call with a letter and mr brand carried them to all the patients he visited that morning after calling on mrs barton so that before sunday it was very generally known in shepperton parish that the countess czerlaski had left the vicarage  the countess had left but alas the bills she had contributed to swell still remained so did the exiguity of the childrens clothing which also was partly an indirect consequence of her presence and so too did the coolness and alienation in the parishioners which could not at once vanish before the fact of her departure the rev amos was not exculpatedthe past was not expunged but what was worse than all millys health gave frequent cause for alarm and the prospect of babys birth was overshadowed by more than the usual fears the birth came prematurely about six weeks after the countesss departure but mr brand gave favourable reports to all inquirers on the following day which was saturday on sunday after morning service mrs hackit called at the vicarage to inquire how mrs barton was and was invited upstairs to see her milly lay placid and lovely in her feebleness and held out her hand to mrs hackit with a beaming smile it was very pleasant to her to see her old friend unreserved and cordial once more the seven months baby was very tiny and very red but handsome is that handsome doeshe was pronounced to be doing well and mrs hackit went home gladdened at heart to think that the perilous hour was over     chapter 8   the following wednesday when mr and mrs hackit were seated comfortably by their bright hearth enjoying the long afternoon afforded by an early dinner rachel the housemaid came in and saidif you please m the shepherd says have you heard as mrs bartons wuss and not expected to live  mrs hackit turned pale and hurried out to question the shepherd who she found had heard the sad news at an alehouse in the village mr hackit followed her out and said theedst better have the ponychaise and go directly  yes said mrs hackit too much overcome to utter any exclamations rachel come an help me on wi my things  when her husband was wrapping her cloak round her feet in the ponychaise she saidif i dont come home tonight i shall send back the ponychaise and youll know im wanted there  yes yes  it was a bright frosty day and by the time mrs hackit arrived at the vicarage the sun was near its setting there was a carriage and pair standing at the gate which she recognized as dr madeleys the physician from rotherby she entered at the kitchen door that she might avoid knocking and quietly question nanny no one was in the kitchen but passing on she saw the sittingroom door open and nanny with walter in her arms removing the knives and forks which had been laid for dinner three hours ago  master says he cant eat no dinner was nannys first word hes never tasted nothin sin yesterday mornin but a cup o tea  when was your missis took worse  o monday night they sent for dr madeley i the middle o the day yisterday an hes here again now  is the baby alive  no it died last night the childrens all at mrs bonds she come and took em away last night but the master says they must be fetched soon hes upstairs now wi dr madeley and mr brand  at this moment mrs hackit heard the sound of a heavy slow foot in the passage and presently amos barton entered with dry despairing eyes haggard and unshaven he expected to find the sittingroom as he left it with nothing to meet his eyes but millys workbasket in the corner of the sofa and the childrens toys overturned in the bowwindow but when he saw mrs hackit come towards him with answering sorrow in her face the pentup fountain of tears was opened he threw himself on the sofa hid his face and sobbed aloud  bear up mr barton mrs hackit ventured to say at last bear up for the sake o them dear children  the children said amos starting up they must be sent for some one must fetch them milly will want to   he couldnt finish the sentence but mrs hackit understood him and said ill send the man with the ponycarriage for em  she went out to give the order and encountered dr madeley and mr brand who were just going  mr brand said i am very glad to see you are here mrs hackit no time must be lost in sending for the children mrs barton wants to see them  do you quite give her up then  she can hardly live through the night she begged us to tell her how long she had to live and then asked for the children  the ponycarriage was sent and mrs hackit returning to mr barton said she would like to go upstairs now he went upstairs with her and opened the door the chamber fronted the west the sun was just setting and the red light fell full upon the bed where milly lay with the hand of death visibly upon her the featherbed had been removed and she lay low on a mattress with her head slightly raised by pillows her long fair neck seemed to be struggling with a painful effort her features were pallid and pinched and her eyes were closed there was no one in the room but the nurse and the mistress of the free school who had come to give her help from the beginning of the change  amos and mrs hackit stood beside the bed and milly opened her eyes  my darling mrs hackit is come to see you  milly smiled and looked at her with that strange faroff look which belongs to ebbing life  are the children coming she said painfully  yes they will be here directly  she closed her eyes again  presently the ponycarriage was heard and amos motioning to mrs hackit to follow him left the room on their way downstairs she suggested that the carriage should remain to take them away again afterwards and amos assented  there they stood in the melancholy sittingroomthe five sweet children from patty to chubbyall with their mothers eyesall except patty looking up with a vague fear at their father as he entered patty understood the great sorrow that was come upon them and tried to check her sobs as she heard her papas footsteps  my children said amos taking chubby in his arms god is going to take away your dear mamma from us she wants to see you to say goodbye you must try to be very good and not cry  he could say no more but turned round to see if nanny was there with walter and then led the way upstairs leading dickey with the other hand mrs hackit followed with sophy and patty and then came nanny with walter and fred  it seemed as if milly had heard the little footsteps on the stairs for when amos entered her eyes were wide open eagerly looking towards the door they all stood by the bedsideamos nearest to her holding chubby and dickey but she motioned for patty to come first and clasping the poor pale child by the hand saidpatty im going away from you love your papa comfort him and take care of your little brothers and sisters god will help you  patty stood perfectly quiet and said yes mamma  the mother motioned with her pallid lips for the dear child to lean towards her and kiss her and then pattys great anguish overcame her and she burst into sobs amos drew her towards him and pressed her head gently to him while milly beckoned fred and sophy and said to them more faintlypatty will try to be your mamma when i am gone my darlings you will be good and not vex her  they leaned towards her and she stroked their fair heads and kissed their tearstained cheeks they cried because mamma was ill and papa looked so unhappy but they thought perhaps next week things would be as they used to be again  the little ones were lifted on the bed to kiss her little walter said mamma mamma and stretched out his fat arms and smiled and chubby seemed gravely wondering but dickey who had been looking fixedly at her with lip hanging down ever since he came into the room now seemed suddenly pierced with the idea that mamma was going away somewhere his little heart swelled and he cried aloud  then mrs hackit and nanny took them all away patty at first begged to stay at home and not go to mrs bonds again but when nanny reminded her that she had better go to take care of the younger ones she submitted at once and they were all packed in the ponycarriage once more  milly kept her eyes shut for some time after the children were gone amos had sunk on his knees and was holding her hand while he watched her face byandby she opened her eyes and drawing him close to her whispered slowlymy deardearhusbandyou have beenverygood to me youhavemade meveryhappy  she spoke no more for many hours they watched her breathing becoming more and more difficult until evening deepened into night and until midnight was past about halfpast twelve she seemed to be trying to speak and they leaned to catch her words musicmusicdidnt you hear it  amos knelt by the bed and held her hand in his he did not believe in his sorrow it was a bad dream he did not know when she was gone but mr brand whom mrs hackit had sent for before twelve oclock thinking that mr barton might probably need his help now came up to him and saidshe feels no more pain now come my dear sir come with me  she isnt dead shrieked the poor desolate man struggling to shake off mr brand who had taken him by the arm but his weary weakened frame was not equal to resistance and he was dragged out of the room     chapter 9   they laid her in the gravethe sweet mother with her baby in her armswhile the christmas snow lay thick upon the graves it was mr cleves who buried her on the first news of mr bartons calamity he had ridden over from tripplegate to beg that he might be made of some use and his silent grasp of amoss hand had penetrated like the painful thrill of liferecovering warmth to the poor benumbed heart of the stricken man  the snow lay thick upon the graves and the day was cold and dreary but there was many a sad eye watching that black procession as it passed from the vicarage to the church and from the church to the open grave there were men and women standing in that churchyard who had bandied vulgar jests about their pastor and who had lightly charged him with sin but now when they saw him following the coffin pale and haggard he was consecrated anew by his great sorrow and they looked at him with respectful pity  all the children were there for amos had willed it so thinking that some dim memory of that sacred moment might remain even with little walter and link itself with what he would hear of his sweet mother in after years he himself led patty and dickey then came sophy and fred mr brand had begged to carry chubby and nanny followed with walter they made a circle round the grave while the coffin was being lowered patty alone of all the children felt that mamma was in that coffin and that a new and sadder life had begun for papa and herself she was pale and trembling but she clasped his hand more firmly as the coffin went down and gave no sob fred and sophy though they were only two and three years younger and though they had seen mamma in her coffin seemed to themselves to be looking at some strange show they had not learned to decipher that terrible handwriting of human destiny illness and death dickey had rebelled against his black clothes until he was told that it would be naughty to mamma not to put them on when he at once submitted and now though he had heard nanny say that mamma was in heaven he had a vague notion that she would come home again tomorrow and say he had been a good boy and let him empty her workbox he stood close to his father with great rosy cheeks and wide open blue eyes looking first up at mr cleves and then down at the coffin and thinking he and chubby would play at that when they got home  the burial was over and amos turned with his children to reenter the housethe house where an hour ago millys dear body lay where the windows were half darkened and sorrow seemed to have a hallowed precinct for itself shut out from the world but now she was gone the broad snowreflected daylight was in all the rooms the vicarage again seemed part of the common workingday world and amos for the first time felt that he was alonethat day after day month after month year after year would have to be lived through without millys love spring would come and she would not be there summer and she would not be there and he would never have her again with him by the fireside in the long evenings the seasons all seemed irksome to his thoughts and how dreary the sunshiny days that would be sure to come she was gone from him and he could never show her his love any more never make up for omissions in the past by filling future days with tenderness  o the anguish of that thought that we can never atone to our dead for the stinted affection we gave them for the light answers we returned to their plaints or their pleadings for the little reverence we showed to that sacred human soul that lived so close to us and was the divinest thing god had given us to know  amos barton had been an affectionate husband and while milly was with him he was never visited by the thought that perhaps his sympathy with her was not quick and watchful enough but now he relived all their life together with that terrible keenness of memory and imagination which bereavement gives and he felt as if his very love needed a pardon for its poverty and selfishness  no outward solace could counteract the bitterness of this inward woe but outward solace came cold faces looked kind again and parishioners turned over in their minds what they could best do to help their pastor mr oldinport wrote to express his sympathy and enclosed another twentypound note begging that he might be permitted to contribute in this way to the relief of mr bartons mind from pecuniary anxieties under the pressure of a grief which all his parishioners must share and offering his interest towards placing the two eldest girls in a school expressly founded for clergymens daughters mr cleves succeeded in collecting thirty pounds among his richer clerical brethren and adding ten pounds himself sent the sum to amos with the kindest and most delicate words of christian fellowship and manly friendship miss jackson forgot old grievances and came to stay some months with millys children bringing such material aid as she could spare from her small income these were substantial helps which relieved amos from the pressure of his money difficulties and the friendly attentions the kind pressure of the hand the cordial looks he met with everywhere in his parish made him feel that the fatal frost which had settled on his pastoral duties during the countesss residence at the vicarage was completely thawed and that the hearts of his parishioners were once more open to him no one breathed the countesss name now for millys memory hallowed her husband as of old the place was hallowed on which an angel from god had alighted  when the spring came mrs hackit begged that she might have dickey to stay with her and great was the enlargement of dickeys experience from that visit every morning he was allowedbeing well wrapt up as to his chest by mrs hackits own hands but very bare and red as to his legsto run loose in the cow and poultry yard to persecute the turkeycock by satirical imitations of his gobblegobble and to put difficult questions to the groom as to the reasons why horses had four legs and other transcendental matters then mr hackit would take dickey up on horseback when he rode round his farm and mrs hackit had a large plumcake in cut ready to meet incidental attacks of hunger so that dickey had considerably modified his views as to the desirability of mrs hackits kisses  the misses farquhar made particular pets of fred and sophy to whom they undertook to give lessons twice aweek in writing and geography and mrs farquhar devised many treats for the little ones pattys treat was to stay at home or walk about with her papa and when he sat by the fire in an evening after the other children were gone to bed she would bring a stool and placing it against his feet would sit down upon it and lean her head against his knee then his hand would rest on that fair head and he would feel that millys love was not quite gone out of his life  so the time wore on till it was may again and the church was quite finished and reopened in all its new splendour and mr barton was devoting himself with more vigour than ever to his parochial duties but one morningit was a very bright morning and evil tidings sometimes like to fly in the finest weatherthere came a letter for mr barton addressed in the vicars handwriting amos opened it with some anxietysomehow or other he had a presentiment of evil the letter contained the announcement that mr carpe had resolved on coming to reside at shepperton and that consequently in six months from that time mr bartons duties as curate in that parish would be closed  o it was hard just when shepperton had become the place where he most wished to staywhere he had friends who knew his sorrowswhere he lived close to millys grave to part from that grave seemed like parting with milly a second time for amos was one who clung to all the material links between his mind and the past his imagination was not vivid and required the stimulus of actual perception  it roused some bitter feeling too to think that mr carpes wish to reside at shepperton was merely a pretext for removing mr barton in order that he might ultimately give the curacy of shepperton to his own brotherinlaw who was known to be wanting a new position  still it must be borne and the painful business of seeking another curacy must be set about without loss of time after the lapse of some months amos was obliged to renounce the hope of getting one at all near shepperton and he at length resigned himself to accepting one in a distant county the parish was in a large manufacturing town where his walks would lie among noisy streets and dingy alleys and where the children would have no garden to play in no pleasant farmhouses to visit  it was another blow inflicted on the bruised man     chapter 10   at length the dreaded week was come when amos and his children must leave shepperton there was general regret among the parishioners at his departure not that any one of them thought his spiritual gifts preeminent or was conscious of great edification from his ministry but his recent troubles had called out their better sympathies and that is always a source of love amos failed to touch the spring of goodness by his sermons but he touched it effectually by his sorrows and there was now a real bond between him and his flock  my heart aches for them poor motherless children said mrs hackit to her husband agoing among strangers and into a nasty town where theres no good victuals to be had and you must pay dear to get bad uns  mrs hackit had a vague notion of a town life as a combination of dirty backyards measly pork and dingy linen  the same sort of sympathy was strong among the poorer class of parishioners old stiffjointed mr tozer who was still able to earn a little by gardening jobs stopped mrs cramp the charwoman on her way home from the vicarage where she had been helping nanny to pack up the day before the departure and inquired very particularly into mr bartons prospects  ah poor mon he was heard to say im sorry for un he hednt much here but hell be wuss off theer half a loafs better nor neer un  the sad goodbyes had all been said before that last evening and after all the packing was done and all the arrangements were made amos felt the oppression of that blank interval in which one has nothing left to think of but the dreary futurethe separation from the loved and familiar and the chilling entrance on the new and strange in every parting there is an image of death  soon after ten oclock when he had sent nanny to bed that she might have a good nights rest before the fatigues of the morrow he stole softly out to pay a last visit to millys grave it was a moonless night but the sky was thick with stars and their light was enough to show that the grass had grown long on the grave and that there was a tombstone telling in bright letters on a dark ground that beneath were deposited the remains of amelia the beloved wife of amos barton who died in the thirtyfifth year of her age leaving a husband and six children to lament her loss the final words of the inscription were thy will be done  the husband was now advancing towards the dear mound from which he was so soon to be parted perhaps for ever he stood a few minutes reading over and over again the words on the tombstone as if to assure himself that all the happy and unhappy past was a reality for love is frightened at the intervals of insensibility and callousness that encroach by little and little on the dominion of grief and it makes efforts to recall the keenness of the first anguish  gradually as his eye dwelt on the words amelia the beloved wife the waves of feeling swelled within his soul and he threw himself on the grave clasping it with his arms and kissing the cold turf  milly milly dost thou hear me i didnt love thee enoughi wasnt tender enough to theebut i think of it all now  the sobs came and choked his utterance and the warm tears fell     conclusion   only once again in his life has amos barton visited millys grave it was in the calm and softened light of an autumnal afternoon and he was not alone he held on his arm a young woman with a sweet grave face which strongly recalled the expression of mrs bartons but was less lovely in form and colour she was about thirty but there were some premature lines round her mouth and eyes which told of early anxiety  amos himself was much changed his thin circlet of hair was nearly white and his walk was no longer firm and upright but his glance was calm and even cheerful and his neat linen told of a womans care milly did not take all her love from the earth when she died she had left some of it in pattys heart  all the other children were now grown up and had gone their several ways dickey you will be glad to hear had shown remarkable talents as an engineer his cheeks are still ruddy in spite of mixed mathematics and his eyes are still large and blue but in other respects his person would present no marks of identification for his friend mrs hackit if she were to see him especially now that her eyes must be grown very dim with the wear of more than twenty additional years he is nearly six feet high and has a proportionately broad chest he wears spectacles and rubs his large white hands through a mass of shaggy brown hair but i am sure you have no doubt that mr richard barton is a thoroughly good fellow as well as a man of talent and you will be glad any day to shake hands with him for his own sake as well as his mothers  patty alone remains by her fathers side and makes the evening sunshine of his life     mr gilfils love story     chapter 1   when old mr gilfil died thirty years ago there was general sorrow in shepperton and if black cloth had not been hung round the pulpit and readingdesk by order of his nephew and principal legatee the parishioners would certainly have subscribed the necessary sum out of their own pockets rather than allow such a tribute of respect to be wanting all the farmers wives brought out their black bombasines and mrs jennings at the wharf by appearing the first sunday after mr gilfils death in her salmoncoloured ribbons and green shawl excited the severest remark to be sure mrs jennings was a newcomer and townbred so that she could hardly be expected to have very clear notions of what was proper but as mrs higgins observed in an undertone to mrs parrot when they were coming out of church her husband whod been born i the parish might ha told her better an unreadiness to put on black on all available occasions or too great an alacrity in putting it off argued in mrs higginss opinion a dangerous levity of character and an unnatural insensibility to the essential fitness of things  some folks cant abear to put off their colours she remarked but that was never the way i my family why mrs parrot from the time i was married till mr higgins died nine years ago come candlemas i niver was out o black two year together  ah said mrs parrot who was conscious of inferiority in this respect there isnt many families as have had so many deaths as yours mrs higgins  mrs higgins who was an elderly widow well left reflected with complacency that mrs parrots observation was no more than just and that mrs jennings very likely belonged to a family which had had no funerals to speak of  even dirty dame fripp who was a very rare churchgoer had been to mrs hackit to beg a bit of old crape and with this sign of grief pinned on her little coalscuttle bonnet was seen dropping her curtsy opposite the readingdesk this manifestation of respect towards mr gilfils memory on the part of dame fripp had no theological bearing whatever it was due to an event which had occurred some years back and which i am sorry to say had left that grimy old lady as indifferent to the means of grace as ever dame fripp kept leeches and was understood to have such remarkable influence over those wilful animals in inducing them to bite under the most unpromising circumstances that though her own leeches were usually rejected from a suspicion that they had lost their appetite she herself was constantly called in to apply the more lively individuals furnished from mr pilgrims surgery when as was very often the case one of that clever mans paying patients was attacked with inflammation thus dame fripp in addition to property supposed to yield her no less than halfacrown aweek was in the receipt of professional fees the gross amount of which was vaguely estimated by her neighbours as pouns an pouns moreover she drove a brisk trade in lollipop with epicurean urchins who recklessly purchased that luxury at the rate of two hundred per cent nevertheless with all these notorious sources of income the shameless old woman constantly pleaded poverty and begged for scraps at mrs hackits who though she always said mrs fripp was as false as two folks and no better than a miser and a heathen had yet a leaning towards her as an old neighbour  theres that casehardened old judy acoming after the tealeaves again mrs hackit would say an im fool enough to give em her though sally wants em all the while to sweep the floors with  such was dame fripp whom mr gilfil riding leisurely in topboots and spurs from doing duty at knebley one warm sunday afternoon observed sitting in the dry ditch near her cottage and by her side a large pig who with that ease and confidence belonging to perfect friendship was lying with his head in her lap and making no effort to play the agreeable beyond an occasional grunt  why mrs fripp said the vicar i didnt know you had such a fine pig youll have some rare flitches at christmas  eh god forbid my son gev him me two ear ago an hes been company to me iver sin i couldnt find i my heart to part wim if i niver knowed the taste o baconfat again  why hell eat his head off and yours too how can you go on keeping a pig and making nothing by him  o he picks a bit hisself wi rootin and i dooant mind doing wiout to gi him summat a bit o companys meat an drink too an he follers me about and grunts when i spake tom just like a christian  mr gilfil laughed and i am obliged to admit that he said goodbye to dame fripp without asking her why she had not been to church or making the slightest effort for her spiritual edification but the next day he ordered his man david to take her a great piece of bacon with a message saying the parson wanted to make sure that mrs fripp would know the taste of baconfat again so when mr gilfil died dame fripp manifested her gratitude and reverence in the simply dingy fashion i have mentioned  you already suspect that the vicar did not shine in the more spiritual functions of his office and indeed the utmost i can say for him in this respect is that he performed those functions with undeviating attention to brevity and despatch he had a large heap of short sermons rather yellow and worn at the edges from which he took two every sunday securing perfect impartiality in the selection by taking them as they came without reference to topics and having preached one of these sermons at shepperton in the morning he mounted his horse and rode hastily with the other in his pocket to knebley where he officiated in a wonderful little church with a checkered pavement which had once rung to the iron tread of military monks with coats of arms in clusters on the lofty roof marble warriors and their wives without noses occupying a large proportion of the area and the twelve apostles with their heads very much on one side holding didactic ribbons painted in fresco on the walls here in an absence of mind to which he was prone mr gilfil would sometimes forget to take off his spurs before putting on his surplice and only become aware of the omission by feeling something mysteriously tugging at the skirts of that garment as he stepped into the readingdesk but the knebley farmers would as soon have thought of criticizing the moon as their pastor he belonged to the course of nature like markets and tollgates and dirty banknotes and being a vicar his claim on their veneration had never been counteracted by an exasperating claim on their pockets some of them who did not indulge in the superfluity of a covered cart without springs had dined half an hour earlier than usualthat is to say at twelve oclockin order to have time for their long walk through miry lanes and present themselves duly in their places at two oclock when mr oldinport and lady felicia to whom knebley church was a sort of family temple made their way among the bows and curtsies of their dependants to a carved and canopied pew in the chancel diffusing as they went a delicate odour of indian roses on the unsusceptible nostrils of the congregation  the farmers wives and children sat on the dark oaken benches but the husbands usually chose the distinctive dignity of a stall under one of the twelve apostles where when the alternation of prayers and responses had given place to the agreeable monotony of the sermon paterfamilias might be seen or heard sinking into a pleasant doze from which he infallibly woke up at the sound of the concluding doxology and then they made their way back again through the miry lanes perhaps almost as much the better for this simple weekly tribute to what they knew of good and right as many a more wakeful and critical congregation of the present day  mr gilfil too used to make his way home in the later years of his life for he had given up the habit of dining at knebley abbey on a sunday having i am sorry to say had a very bitter quarrel with mr oldinport the cousin and predecessor of the mr oldinport who flourished in the rev amos bartons time that quarrel was a sad pity for the two had had many a good days hunting together when they were younger and in those friendly times not a few members of the hunt envied mr oldinport the excellent terms he was on with his vicar for as sir jasper sitwell observed next to a mans wife theres nobody can be such an infernal plague to you as a parson always under your nose on your own estate  i fancy the original difference which led to the rupture was very slight but mr gilfil was of an extremely caustic turn his satire having a flavour of originality which was quite wanting in his sermons and as mr oldinports armour of conscious virtue presented some considerable and conspicuous gaps the vicars keenedged retorts probably made a few incisions too deep to be forgiven such at least was the view of the case presented by mr hackit who knew as much of the matter as any third person for the very week after the quarrel when presiding at the annual dinner of the association for the prosecution of felons held at the oldinport arms he contributed an additional zest to the conviviality on that occasion by informing the company that the parson had given the squire a lick with the rough side of his tongue the detection of the person or persons who had driven off mr parrots heifer could hardly have been more welcome news to the shepperton tenantry with whom mr oldinport was in the worst odour as a landlord having kept up his rents in spite of falling prices and not being in the least stung to emulation by paragraphs in the provincial newspapers stating that the honourable augustus purwell or viscount blethers had made a return of ten per cent on their last rentday the fact was mr oldinport had not the slightest intention of standing for parliament whereas he had the strongest intention of adding to his unentailed estate hence to the shepperton farmers it was as good as lemon with their grog to know that the vicar had thrown out sarcasms against the squires charities as little better than those of the man who stole a goose and gave away the giblets in alms for shepperton you observe was in a state of attic culture compared with knebley it had turnpike roads and a public opinion whereas in the boeotian knebley mens minds and waggons alike moved in the deepest of ruts and the landlord was only grumbled at as a necessary and unalterable evil like the weather the weevils and the turnipfly  thus in shepperton this breach with mr oldinport tended only to heighten that good understanding which the vicar had always enjoyed with the rest of his parishioners from the generation whose children he had christened a quarter of a century before down to that hopeful generation represented by little tommy bond who had recently quitted frocks and trousers for the severe simplicity of a tight suit of corduroys relieved by numerous brass buttons tommy was a saucy boy impervious to all impressions of reverence and excessively addicted to hummingtops and marbles with which recreative resources he was in the habit of immoderately distending the pockets of his corduroys one day spinning his top on the gardenwalk and seeing the vicar advance directly towards it at that exciting moment when it was beginning to sleep magnificently he shouted out with all the force of his lungsstop dont knock my top down now from that day little corduroys had been an especial favourite with mr gilfil who delighted to provoke his ready scorn and wonder by putting questions which gave tommy the meanest opinion of his intellect  well little corduroys have they milked the geese today  milked the geese why they dont milk the geese you silly  no dear heart why how do the goslings live then  the nutriment of goslings rather transcending tommys observations in natural history he feigned to understand this question in an exclamatory rather than an interrogatory sense and became absorbed in winding up his top  ah i see you dont know how the goslings live but did you notice how it rained sugarplums yesterday here tommy became attentive why they fell into my pocket as i rode along you look in my pocket and see if they didnt tommy without waiting to discuss the alleged antecedent lost no time in ascertaining the presence of the agreeable consequent for he had a wellfounded belief in the advantages of diving into the vicars pocket mr gilfil called it his wonderful pocket because as he delighted to tell the young shavers and twoshoesso he called all little boys and girlswhenever he put pennies into it they turned into sugarplums or gingerbread or some other nice thing indeed little bessie parrot a flaxenheaded twoshoes very white and fat as to her neck always had the admirable directness and sincerity to salute him with the questionwhat zoo dot in zoo pottet  you can imagine then that the christening dinners were none the less merry for the presence of the parson the farmers relished his society particularly for he could not only smoke his pipe and season the details of parish affairs with abundance of caustic jokes and proverbs but as mr bond often said no man knew more than the vicar about the breed of cows and horses he had grazingland of his own about five miles off which a bailiff ostensibly a tenant farmed under his direction and to ride backwards and forwards and look after the buying and selling of stock was the old gentlemans chief relaxation now his hunting days were over to hear him discussing the respective merits of the devonshire breed and the shorthorns or the last foolish decision of the magistrates about a pauper a superficial observer might have seen little difference beyond his superior shrewdness between the vicar and his bucolic parishioners for it was his habit to approximate his accent and mode of speech to theirs doubtless because he thought it a mere frustration of the purposes of language to talk of shearhogs and ewes to men who habitually said sharrags and yowes nevertheless the farmers themselves were perfectly aware of the distinction between them and the parson and had not at all the less belief in him as a gentleman and a clergyman for his easy speech and familiar manners mrs parrot smoothed her apron and set her cap right with the utmost solicitude when she saw the vicar coming made him her deepest curtsy and every christmas had a fat turkey ready to send him with her duty and in the most gossiping colloquies with mr gilfil you might have observed that both men and women minded their words and never became indifferent to his approbation  the same respect attended him in his strictly clerical functions the benefits of baptism were supposed to be somehow bound up with mr gilfils personality so metaphysical a distinction as that between a man and his office being as yet quite foreign to the mind of a good shepperton churchman savouring he would have thought of dissent on the very face of it miss selina parrot put off her marriage a whole month when mr gilfil had an attack of rheumatism rather than be married in a makeshift manner by the milby curate  weve had a very good sermon this morning was the frequent remark after hearing one of the old yellow series heard with all the more satisfaction because it had been heard for the twentieth time for to minds on the shepperton level it is repetition not novelty that produces the strongest effect and phrases like tunes are a long time making themselves at home in the brain  mr gilfils sermons as you may imagine were not of a highly doctrinal still less of a polemical cast they perhaps did not search the conscience very powerfully for you remember that to mrs patten who had listened to them thirty years the announcement that she was a sinner appeared an uncivil heresy but on the other hand they made no unreasonable demand on the shepperton intellectamounting indeed to little more than an expansion of the concise thesis that those who do wrong will find it the worse for them and those who do well will find it the better for them the nature of wrongdoing being exposed in special sermons against lying backbiting anger slothfulness and the like and welldoing being interpreted as honesty truthfulness charity industry and other common virtues lying quite on the surface of life and having very little to do with deep spiritual doctrine mrs patten understood that if she turned out illcrushed cheeses a just retribution awaited her though i fear she made no particular application of the sermon on backbiting mrs hackit expressed herself greatly edified by the sermon on honesty the allusion to the unjust weight and deceitful balance having a peculiar lucidity for her owing to a recent dispute with her grocer but i am not aware that she ever appeared to be much struck by the sermon on anger  as to any suspicion that mr gilfil did not dispense the pure gospel or any strictures on his doctrine and mode of delivery such thoughts never visited the minds of the shepperton parishionersof those very parishioners who ten or fifteen years later showed themselves extremely critical of mr bartons discourses and demeanour but in the interim they had tasted that dangerous fruit of the tree of knowledgeinnovation which is well known to open the eyes even in an uncomfortable manner at present to find fault with the sermon was regarded as almost equivalent to finding fault with religion itself one sunday mr hackits nephew master tom stokes a flippant town youth greatly scandalized his excellent relatives by declaring that he could write as good a sermon as mr gilfils whereupon mr hackit sought to reduce the presumptuous youth to utter confusion by offering him a sovereign if he would fulfil his vaunt the sermon was written however and though it was not admitted to be anywhere within reach of mr gilfils it was yet so astonishingly like a sermon having a text three divisions and a concluding exhortation beginning and now my brethren that the sovereign though denied formally was bestowed informally and the sermon was pronounced when master stokess back was turned to be an uncommon cliver thing  the rev mr pickard indeed of the independent meeting had stated in a sermon preached at rotheby for the reduction of a debt on new zion built with an exuberance of faith and a deficiency of funds by seceders from the original zion that he lived in a parish where the vicar was very dark and in the prayers he addressed to his own congregation he was in the habit of comprehensively alluding to the parishioners outside the chapel walls as those who galliolike cared for none of these things but i need hardly say that no churchgoer ever came within earshot of mr pickard  it was not to the shepperton farmers only that mr gilfils society was acceptable he was a welcome guest at some of the best houses in that part of the country old sir jasper sitwell would have been glad to see him every week and if you had seen him conducting lady sitwell in to dinner or had heard him talking to her with quaint yet graceful gallantry you would have inferred that the earlier period of his life had been passed in more stately society than could be found in shepperton and that his slipshod chat and homely manners were but like weatherstains on a fine old block of marble allowing you still to see here and there the fineness of the grain and the delicacy of the original tint but in his later years these visits became a little too troublesome to the old gentleman and he was rarely to be found anywhere of an evening beyond the bounds of his own parishmost frequently indeed by the side of his own sittingroom fire smoking his pipe and maintaining the pleasing antithesis of dryness and moisture by an occasional sip of ginandwater  here i am aware that i have run the risk of alienating all my refined ladyreaders and utterly annihilating any curiosity they may have felt to know the details of mr gilfils lovestory ginandwater foh you may as well ask us to interest ourselves in the romance of a tallowchandler who mingles the image of his beloved with short dips and moulds  but in the first place dear ladies allow me to plead that ginandwater like obesity or baldness or the gout does not exclude a vast amount of antecedent romance any more than the neatlyexecuted fronts which you may some day wear will exclude your present possession of less expensive braids alas alas we poor mortals are often little better than woodashesthere is small sign of the sap and the leafy freshness and the bursting buds that were once there but wherever we see woodashes we know that all that early fullness of life must have been i at least hardly ever look at a bent old man or a wizened old woman but i see also with my minds eye that past of which they are the shrunken remnant and the unfinished romance of rosy cheeks and bright eyes seems sometimes of feeble interest and significance compared with that drama of hope and love which has long ago reached its catastrophe and left the poor soul like a dim and dusty stage with all its sweet gardenscenes and fair perspectives overturned and thrust out of sight  in the second place let me assure you that mr gilfils potations of ginandwater were quite moderate his nose was not rubicund on the contrary his white hair hung around a pale and venerable face he drank it chiefly i believe because it was cheap and here i find myself alighting on another of the vicars weaknesses which if i had cared to paint a flattering portrait rather than a faithful one i might have chosen to suppress it is undeniable that as the years advanced mr gilfil became as mr hackit observed more and more closefisted though the growing propensity showed itself rather in the parsimony of his personal habits than in withholding help from the needy he was savingso he represented the matter to himselffor a nephew the only son of a sister who had been the dearest object all but one in his life the lad he thought will have a nice little fortune to begin life with and will bring his pretty young wife some day to see the spot where his old uncle lies it will perhaps be all the better for his hearth that mine was lonely  mr gilfil was a bachelor then  that is the conclusion to which you would probably have come if you had entered his sittingroom where the bare tables the large oldfashioned horsehair chairs and the threadbare turkey carpet perpetually fumigated with tobacco seemed to tell a story of wifeless existence that was contradicted by no portrait no piece of embroidery no faded bit of pretty triviality hinting of taperfingers and small feminine ambitions and it was here that mr gilfil passed his evenings seldom with other society than that of ponto his old brown setter who stretched out at full length on the rug with his nose between his forepaws would wrinkle his brows and lift up his eyelids every now and then to exchange a glance of mutual understanding with his master but there was a chamber in shepperton vicarage which told a different story from that bare and cheerless diningrooma chamber never entered by any one besides mr gilfil and old martha the housekeeper who with david her husband as groom and gardener formed the vicars entire establishment the blinds of this chamber were always down except once aquarter when martha entered that she might air and clean it she always asked mr gilfil for the key which he kept locked up in his bureau and returned it to him when she had finished her task  it was a touching sight that the daylight streamed in upon as martha drew aside the blinds and thick curtains and opened the gothic casement of the oriel window on the little dressingtable there was a dainty lookingglass in a carved and gilt frame bits of waxcandle were still in the branched sockets at the sides and on one of these branches hung a little black lace kerchief a faded satin pincushion with the pins rusted in it a scentbottle and a large green fan lay on the table and on a dressingbox by the side of the glass was a workbasket and an unfinished babycap yellow with age lying in it two gowns of a fashion long forgotten were hanging on nails against the door and a pair of tiny red slippers with a bit of tarnished silver embroidery on them were standing at the foot of the bed two or three watercolour drawings views of naples hung upon the walls and over the mantelpiece above some bits of rare old china two miniatures in oval frames one of these miniatures represented a young man about sevenandtwenty with a sanguine complexion full lips and clear candid grey eyes the other was the likeness of a girl probably not more than eighteen with small features thin cheeks a pale southernlooking complexion and large dark eyes the gentleman wore powder the lady had her dark hair gathered away from her face and a little cap with a cherrycoloured bow set on the top of her heada coquettish headdress but the eyes spoke of sadness rather than of coquetry  such were the things that martha had dusted and let the air upon four times ayear ever since she was a blooming lass of twenty and she was now in this last decade of mr gilfils life unquestionably on the wrong side of fifty such was the lockedup chamber in mr gilfils house a sort of visible symbol of the secret chamber in his heart where he had long turned the key on early hopes and early sorrows shutting up for ever all the passion and the poetry of his life  there were not many people in the parish besides martha who had any very distinct remembrance of mr gilfils wife or indeed who knew anything of her beyond the fact that there was a marble tablet with a latin inscription in memory of her over the vicarage pew the parishioners who were old enough to remember her arrival were not generally gifted with descriptive powers and the utmost you could gather from them was that mrs gilfil looked like a furriner wi such eyes you cant think an a voice as went through you when she sung at church the one exception was mrs patten whose strong memory and taste for personal narrative made her a great source of oral tradition in shepperton mr hackit who had not come into the parish until ten years after mrs gilfils death would often put old questions to mrs patten for the sake of getting the old answers which pleased him in the same way as passages from a favourite book or the scenes of a familiar play please more accomplished people  ah you remember well the sunday as mrs gilfil first come to church eh mrs patten  to be sure i do it was a fine bright sunday as ever was seen just at the beginnin o hay harvest mr tarbett preached that day and mr gilfil sat i the pew with his wife i think i see him now aleading her up the aisle an her head not reachin much above his elber a little pale woman with eyes as black as sloes an yet lookin blanklike as if she seed nothing with em  i warrant she had her weddin clothes on said mr hackit  nothin partikler smartony a white hat tied down under her chin an a white indy muslin gown but you dont know what mr gilfil was in those times he was fine an altered before you come into the parish hed a fresh colour then an a bright look wi his eyes as did your heart good to see he looked rare and happy that sunday but somehow id a feelin as it wouldnt last long ive no opinion o furriners mr hackit for ive travelled i their country with my lady in my time an seen enough o their victuals an their nasty ways  mrs gilfil come from itly didnt she  i reckon she did but i niver could rightly hear about that mr gilfil was niver to be spoke to about her and nobody else hereabout knowed anythin howiver she must ha come over pretty young for she spoke english as well as you an me its them italians as has such fine voices an mrs gilfil sung you never heared the like he brought her here to have tea with me one afternoon and says he in his jovial way now mrs patten i want mrs gilfil to see the neatest house and drink the best cup o tea in all shepperton you must show her your dairy and your cheeseroom and then she shall sing you a song an so she did an her voice seemed sometimes to fill the room an then it went low an soft as if it was whisperin close to your heart like  you never heared her again i reckon  no she was sickly then and she died in a few months after she wasnt in the parish much more nor half a year altogether she didnt seem lively that afternoon an i could see she didnt care about the dairy nor the cheeses ony she pretended to please him as for him i niver seed a man so wrapt up in a woman he looked at her as if he was worshippin her an as if he wanted to lift her off the ground ivery minute to save her the trouble o walkin poor man poor man it had like to ha killed him when she died though he niver gev way but went on ridin about and preachin but he was wore to a shadder an his eyes used to look as deadyou wouldnt ha knowed em  she brought him no fortune  not she all mr gilfils property come by his mothers side there was blood an money too there its a thousand pities as he married i that waya fine man like him as might ha had the pick o the county an had his grandchildren about him now an him so fond o children too  in this manner mrs patten usually wound up her reminiscences of the vicars wife of whom you perceive she knew but little it was clear that the communicative old lady had nothing to tell of mrs gilfils history previous to her arrival in shepperton and that she was unacquainted with mr gilfils lovestory  but i dear reader am quite as communicative as mrs patten and much better informed so that if you care to know more about the vicars courtship and marriage you need only carry your imagination back to the latter end of the last century and your attention forward into the next chapter     chapter 2   it is the evening of the 21st of june 1788 the day has been bright and sultry and the sun will still be more than an hour above the horizon but his rays broken by the leafy fretwork of the elms that border the park no longer prevent two ladies from carrying out their cushions and embroidery and seating themselves to work on the lawn in front of cheverel manor the soft turf gives way even under the fairy tread of the younger lady whose small stature and slim figure rest on the tiniest of fullgrown feet she trips along before the elder carrying the cushions which she places in the favourite spot just on the slope by a clump of laurels where they can see the sunbeams sparkling among the waterlilies and can be themselves seen from the diningroom windows she has deposited the cushions and now turns round so that you may have a full view of her as she stands waiting the slower advance of the elder lady you are at once arrested by her large dark eyes which in their inexpressive unconscious beauty resemble the eyes of a fawn and it is only by an effort of attention that you notice the absence of bloom on her young cheek and the southern yellowish tint of her small neck and face rising above the little black lace kerchief which prevents the too immediate comparison of her skin with her white muslin gown her large eyes seem all the more striking because the dark hair is gathered away from her face under a little cap set at the top of her head with a cherrycoloured bow on one side  the elder lady who is advancing towards the cushions is cast in a very different mould of womanhood she is tall and looks the taller because her powdered hair is turned backward over a toupee and surmounted by lace and ribbons she is nearly fifty but her complexion is still fresh and beautiful with the beauty of an auburn blond her proud pouting lips and her head thrown a little backward as she walks give an expression of hauteur which is not contradicted by the cold grey eye the tuckedin kerchief rising full over the low tight bodice of her blue dress sets off the majestic form of her bust and she treads the lawn as if she were one of sir joshua reynolds stately ladies who had suddenly stepped from her frame to enjoy the evening cool  put the cushions lower caterina that we may not have so much sun upon us she called out in a tone of authority when still at some distance caterina obeyed and they sat down making two bright patches of red and white and blue on the green background of the laurels and the lawn which would look none the less pretty in a picture because one of the womens hearts was rather cold and the other rather sad  and a charming picture cheverel manor would have made that evening if some english watteau had been there to paint it the castellated house of greytinted stone with the flickering sunbeams sending dashes of golden light across the manyshaped panes in the mullioned windows and a great beech leaning athwart one of the flanking towers and breaking with its dark flattened boughs the too formal symmetry of the front the broad gravelwalk winding on the right by a row of tall pines alongside the poolon the left branching out among swelling grassy mounds surmounted by clumps of trees where the red trunk of the scotch fir glows in the descending sunlight against the bright green of limes and acacias the great pool where a pair of swans are swimming lazily with one leg tucked under a wing and where the open waterlilies lie calmly accepting the kisses of the fluttering lightsparkles the lawn with its smooth emerald greenness sloping down to the rougher and browner herbage of the park from which it is invisibly fenced by a little stream that winds away from the pool and disappears under a wooden bridge in the distant pleasureground and on this lawn our two ladies whose part in the landscape the painter standing at a favourable point of view in the park would represent with a few little dabs of red and white and blue  seen from the great gothic windows of the diningroom they had much more definiteness of outline and were distinctly visible to the three gentlemen sipping their claret there as two fair women in whom all three had a personal interest these gentlemen were a group worth considering attentively but any one entering that diningroom for the first time would perhaps have had his attention even more strongly arrested by the room itself which was so bare of furniture that it impressed one with its architectural beauty like a cathedral a piece of matting stretched from door to door a bit of worn carpet under the diningtable and a sideboard in a deep recess did not detain the eye for a moment from the lofty groined ceiling with its richlycarved pendants all of creamy white relieved here and there by touches of gold on one side this lofty ceiling was supported by pillars and arches beyond which a lower ceiling a miniature copy of the higher one covered the square projection which with its three large pointed windows formed the central feature of the building the room looked less like a place to dine in than a piece of space enclosed simply for the sake of beautiful outline and the small diningtable with the party round it seemed an odd and insignificant accident rather than anything connected with the original purpose of the apartment  but examined closely that group was far from insignificant for the eldest who was reading in the newspaper the last portentous proceedings of the french parliaments and turning with occasional comments to his young companions was as fine a specimen of the old english gentleman as could well have been found in those venerable days of cockedhats and pigtails his dark eyes sparkled under projecting brows made more prominent by bushy grizzled eyebrows but any apprehension of severity excited by these penetrating eyes and by a somewhat aquiline nose was allayed by the goodnatured lines about the mouth which retained all its teeth and its vigour of expression in spite of sixty winters the forehead sloped a little from the projecting brows and its peaked outline was made conspicuous by the arrangement of the profuselypowdered hair drawn backward and gathered into a pigtail he sat in a small hard chair which did not admit the slightest approach to a lounge and which showed to advantage the flatness of his back and the breadth of his chest in fact sir christopher cheverel was a splendid old gentleman as any one may see who enters the saloon at cheverel manor where his fulllength portrait taken when he was fifty hangs side by side with that of his wife the stately lady seated on the lawn  looking at sir christopher you would at once have been inclined to hope that he had a fullgrown son and heir but perhaps you would have wished that it might not prove to be the young man on his right hand in whom a certain resemblance to the baronet in the contour of the nose and brow seemed to indicate a family relationship if this young man had been less elegant in his person he would have been remarked for the elegance of his dress but the perfections of his slim wellproportioned figure were so striking that no one but a tailor could notice the perfections of his velvet coat and his small white hands with their blue veins and taper fingers quite eclipsed the beauty of his lace ruffles the face howeverit was difficult to say whywas certainly not pleasing nothing could be more delicate than the blond complexionits bloom set off by the powdered hairthan the veined overhanging eyelids which gave an indolent expression to the hazel eyes nothing more finely cut than the transparent nostril and the short upperlip perhaps the chin and lower jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile but the defect was on the side of that delicacy and finesse which was the distinctive characteristic of the whole person and which was carried out in the clear brown arch of the eyebrows and the marble smoothness of the sloping forehead impossible to say that this face was not eminently handsome yet for the majority both of men and women it was destitute of charm women disliked eyes that seemed to be indolently accepting admiration instead of rendering it and men especially if they had a tendency to clumsiness in the nose and ankles were inclined to think this antinous in a pigtail a confounded puppy i fancy that was frequently the inward interjection of the rev maynard gilfil who was seated on the opposite side of the diningtable though mr gilfils legs and profile were not at all of a kind to make him peculiarly alive to the impertinence and frivolity of personal advantages his healthy open face and robust limbs were after an excellent pattern for everyday wear and in the opinion of mr bates the northcountry gardener would have become regimentals a fain saight better than the peaky features and slight form of captain wybrow notwithstanding that this young gentleman as sir christophers nephew and destined heir had the strongest hereditary claim on the gardeners respect and was undeniably cleanlimbed but alas human longings are perversely obstinate and to the man whose mouth is watering for a peach it is of no use to offer the largest vegetable marrow mr gilfil was not sensitive to mr batess opinion whereas he was sensitive to the opinion of another person who by no means shared mr batess preference  who the other person was it would not have required a very keen observer to guess from a certain eagerness in mr gilfils glance as that little figure in white tripped along the lawn with the cushions captain wybrow too was looking in the same direction but his handsome face remained handsomeand nothing more  ah said sir christopher looking up from his paper theres my lady ring for coffee anthony well go and join her and the little monkey tina shall give us a song  the coffee presently appeared brought not as usual by the footman in scarlet and drab but by the old butler in threadbare but wellbrushed black who as he was placing it on the table saidif you please sir christopher theres the widow hartopp acrying i the still room and begs leave to see your honour  i have given markham full orders about the widow hartopp said sir christopher in a sharp decided tone i have nothing to say to her  your honour pleaded the butler rubbing his hands and putting on an additional coating of humility the poor womans dreadful overcome and says she cant sleep a wink this blessed night without seeing your honour and she begs you to pardon the great freedom shes took to come at this time she cries fit to break her heart  ay ay water pays no tax well show her into the library  coffee despatched the two young men walked out through the open window and joined the ladies on the lawn while sir christopher made his way to the library solemnly followed by rupert his pet bloodhound who in his habitual place at the baronets right hand behaved with great urbanity during dinner but when the cloth was drawn invariably disappeared under the table apparently regarding the claretjug as a mere human weakness which he winked at but refused to sanction  the library lay but three steps from the diningroom on the other side of a cloistered and matted passage the oriel window was overshadowed by the great beech and this with the flat heavilycarved ceiling and the dark hue of the old books that lined the walls made the room look sombre especially on entering it from the diningroom with its aerial curves and creamcoloured fretwork touched with gold as sir christopher opened the door a jet of brighter light fell on a woman in a widows dress who stood in the middle of the room and made the deepest of curtsies as he entered she was a buxom woman approaching forty her eyes red with the tears which had evidently been absorbed by the handkerchief gathered into a damp ball in her right hand  now mrs hartopp said sir christopher taking out his gold snuffbox and tapping the lid what have you to say to me markham has delivered you a notice to quit i suppose  o yis your honour an thats the reason why ive come i hope your honour ll think better on it an not turn me an my poor children out o the farm where my husband alys paid his rent as reglar as the day come  nonsense i should like to know what good it will do you and your children to stay on a farm and lose every farthing your husband has left you instead of selling your stock and going into some little place where you can keep your money together it is very well known to every tenant of mine that i never allow widows to stay on their husbands farms  o sir christifer if you would considerwhen ive sold the hay an corn an all the live things an paid the debts an put the money out to use i shall have hardly enough to keep our souls an bodies together an how can i rear my boys and put em prentice they must go for deylabourers an their father a man wi as good belongings as any on your honours estate an niver threshed his wheat afore it was well i the rick nor sold the straw off his farm nor nothin ask all the farmers round if there was a stiddier soberer man than my husband as attended ripstone market an he says bessie says hethem was his last wordsyoull mek a shift to manage the farm if sir christifer ull let you stay on  pooh pooh said sir christopher mrs hartopps sobs having interrupted her pleadings now listen to me and try to understand a little common sense you are about as able to manage the farm as your best milch cow youll be obliged to have some managing man who will either cheat you out of your money or wheedle you into marrying him  o your honour i was never that sort o woman an nobody has known it on me  very likely not because you were never a widow before a womans always silly enough but shes never quite as great a fool as she can be until she puts on a widows cap now just ask yourself how much the better you will be for staying on your farm at the end of four years when youve got through your money and let your farm run down and are in arrears for half your rent or perhaps have got some great hulky fellow for a husband who swears at you and kicks your children  indeed sir christifer i know a deal o farmin an was brought up i the thick on it as you may say an there was my husbands greataunt managed a farm for twenty year an left legacies to all her nephys an nieces an even to my husband as was then a babe unborn  psha a woman six feet high with a squint and sharp elbows i daresaya man in petticoats not a rosycheeked widow like you mrs hartopp  indeed your honour i never heard of her squintin an they said as she might ha been married oer and oer again to people as had no call to hanker after her money  ay ay thats what you all think every man that looks at you wants to marry you and would like you the better the more children you have and the less money but it is useless to talk and cry i have good reasons for my plans and never alter them what you have to do is to take the best of your stock and to look out for some little place to go to when you leave the hollows now go back to mrs bellamys room and ask her to give you a dish of tea  mrs hartopp understanding from sir christophers tone that he was not to be shaken curtsied low and left the library while the baronet seating himself at his desk in the oriel window wrote the following letter  mr markhamtake no steps about letting crowsfoot cottage as i intend to put in the widow hartopp when she leaves her farm and if you will be here at eleven on saturday morning i will ride round with you and settle about making some repairs and see about adding a bit of land to the take as she will want to keep a cow and some pigsyours faithfully  christopher cheverel  after ringing the bell and ordering this letter to be sent sir christopher walked out to join the party on the lawn but finding the cushions deserted he walked on to the eastern front of the building where by the side of the grand entrance was the large bowwindow of the saloon opening on to the gravelsweep and looking towards a long vista of undulating turf bordered by tall trees which seeming to unite itself with the green of the meadows and a grassy road through a plantation only terminated with the gothic arch of a gateway in the far distance the bowwindow was open and sir christopher stepping in found the group he sought examining the progress of the unfinished ceiling it was in the same style of florid pointed gothic as the diningroom but more elaborate in its tracery which was like petrified lacework picked out with delicate and varied colouring about a fourth of its still remained uncoloured and under this part were scaffolding ladders and tools otherwise the spacious saloon was empty of furniture and seemed to be a grand gothic canopy for the group of five human figures standing in the centre  francesco has been getting on a little better the last day or two said sir christopher as he joined the party hes a sad lazy dog and i fancy he has a knack of sleeping as he stands with his brushes in his hands but i must spur him on or we may not have the scaffolding cleared away before the bride comes if you show dexterous generalship in your wooing eh anthony and take your magdeburg quickly  ah sir a siege is known to be one of the most tedious operations in war said captain wybrow with an easy smile  not when theres a traitor within the walls in the shape of a soft heart and that there will be if beatrice has her mothers tenderness as well as her mothers beauty  what do you think sir christopher said lady cheverel who seemed to wince a little under her husbands reminiscences of hanging guercinos sibyl over that door when we put up the pictures it is rather lost in my sittingroom  very good my love answered sir christopher in a tone of punctiliously polite affection if you like to part with the ornament from your own room it will show admirably here our portraits by sir joshua will hang opposite the window and the transfiguration at that end you see anthony i am leaving no good places on the walls for you and your wife we shall turn you with your faces to the wall in the gallery and you may take your revenge on us byandby  while this conversation was going on mr gilfil turned to caterina and saidi like the view from this window better than any other in the house  she made no answer and he saw that her eyes were filling with tears so he added suppose we walk out a little sir christopher and my lady seem to be occupied  caterina complied silently and they turned down one of the gravel walks that led after many windings under tall trees and among grassy openings to a large enclosed flowergarden their walk was perfectly silent for maynard gilfil knew that caterinas thoughts were not with him and she had been long used to make him endure the weight of those moods which she carefully hid from others they reached the flowergarden and turned mechanically in at the gate that opened through a high thick hedge on an expanse of brilliant colour which after the green shades they had passed through startled the eye like flames the effect was assisted by an undulation of the ground which gradually descended from the entrancegate and then rose again towards the opposite end crowned by an orangery the flowers were glowing with their evening splendours verbenas and heliotropes were sending up their finest incense it seemed a gala where all was happiness and brilliancy and misery could find no sympathy this was the effect it had on caterina as she wound among the beds of gold and blue and pink where the flowers seemed to be looking at her with wondering elflike eyes knowing nothing of sorrow the feeling of isolation in her wretchedness overcame her and the tears which had been before trickling slowly down her pale cheeks now gushed forth accompanied with sobs and yet there was a loving human being close beside her whose heart was aching for hers who was possessed by the feeling that she was miserable and that he was helpless to soothe her but she was too much irritated by the idea that his wishes were different from hers that he rather regretted the folly of her hopes than the probability of their disappointment to take any comfort in his sympathy caterina like the rest of us turned away from sympathy which she suspected to be mingled with criticism as the child turns away from the sweetmeat in which it suspects imperceptible medicine  dear caterina i think i hear voices said mr gilfil they may be coming this way  she checked herself like one accustomed to conceal her emotions and ran rapidly to the other end of the garden where she seemed occupied in selecting a rose presently lady cheverel entered leaning on the arm of captain wybrow and followed by sir christopher the party stopped to admire the tiers of geraniums near the gate and in the mean time caterina tripped back with a moss rosebud in her hand and going up to sir christopher saidthere padroncellothere is a nice rose for your buttonhole  ah you blackeyed monkey he said fondly stroking her cheek so you have been running off with maynard either to torment or coax him an inch or two deeper into love come come i want you to sing us ho perduto before we sit down to picquet anthony goes tomorrow you know you must warble him into the right sentimental lovers mood that he may acquit himself well at bath he put her little arm under his and calling to lady cheverel come henrietta led the way towards the house  the party entered the drawingroom which with its oriel window corresponded to the library in the other wing and had also a flat ceiling heavy with carving and blazonry but the window being unshaded and the walls hung with fulllength portraits of knights and dames in scarlet white and gold it had not the sombre effect of the library here hung the portrait of sir anthony cheverel who in the reign of charles ii was the renovator of the family splendour which had suffered some declension from the early brilliancy of that chevreuil who came over with the conqueror a very imposing personage was this sir anthony standing with one arm akimbo and one fine leg and foot advanced evidently with a view to the gratification of his contemporaries and posterity you might have taken off his splendid peruke and his scarlet cloak which was thrown backward from his shoulders without annihilating the dignity of his appearance and he had known how to choose a wife too for his lady hanging opposite to him with her sunny brown hair drawn away in bands from her mild grave face and falling in two large rich curls on her snowy gentlysloping neck which shamed the harsher hue and outline of her white satin robe was a fit mother of largeacred heirs  in this room tea was served and here every evening as regularly as the great clock in the courtyard with deliberate bass tones struck nine sir christopher and lady cheverel sat down to picquet until halfpast ten when mr gilfil read prayers to the assembled household in the chapel  but now it was not near nine and caterina must sit down to the harpsichord and sing sir christophers favourite airs from glucks orfeo an opera which for the happiness of that generation was then to be heard on the london stage it happened this evening that the sentiment of these airs che faro senza eurydice and ho perduto il bel sembiante in both of which the singer pours out his yearning after his lost love came very close to caterinas own feeling but her emotion instead of being a hindrance to her singing gave her additional power her singing was what she could do best it was her one point of superiority in which it was probable she would excel the highborn beauty whom anthony was to woo and her love her jealousy her pride her rebellion against her destiny made one stream of passion which welled forth in the deep rich tones of her voice she had a rare contralto which lady cheverel who had high musical taste had been careful to preserve her from straining  excellent caterina said lady cheverel as there was a pause after the wonderful linked sweetness of che faro i never heard you sing that so well once more  it was repeated and then came ho perduto which sir christopher encored in spite of the clock just striking nine when the last note was dying out he saidtheres a clever blackeyed monkey now bring out the table for picquet  caterina drew out the table and placed the cards then with her rapid fairy suddenness of motion threw herself on her knees and clasped sir christophers knee he bent down stroked her cheek and smiled  caterina that is foolish said lady cheverel i wish you would leave off those stageplayers antics  she jumped up arranged the music on the harpsichord and then seeing the baronet and his lady seated at picquet quietly glided out of the room  captain wybrow had been leaning near the harpsichord during the singing and the chaplain had thrown himself on a sofa at the end of the room they both now took up a book mr gilfil chose the last number of the gentlemans magazine captain wybrow stretched on an ottoman near the door opened faublas and there was perfect silence in the room which ten minutes before was vibrating to the passionate tones of caterina  she had made her way along the cloistered passages now lighted here and there by a small oillamp to the grandstaircase which led directly to a gallery running along the whole eastern side of the building where it was her habit to walk when she wished to be alone the bright moonlight was streaming through the windows throwing into strange light and shadow the heterogeneous objects that lined the long walls greek statues and busts of roman emperors low cabinets filled with curiosities natural and antiquarian tropical birds and huge horns of beasts hindoo gods and strange shells swords and daggers and bits of chainarmour roman lamps and tiny models of greek temples and above all these queer old family portraitsof little boys and girls once the hope of the cheverels with closeshaven heads imprisoned in stiff ruffsof faded pinkfaced ladies with rudimentary features and highlydeveloped headdressesof gallant gentlemen with high hips high shoulders and red pointed beards  here on rainy days sir christopher and his lady took their promenade and here billiards were played but in the evening it was forsaken by all except caterinaand sometimes one other person  she paced up and down in the moonlight her pale face and thin whiterobed form making her look like the ghost of some former lady cheverel come to revisit the glimpses of the moon  byandby she paused opposite the broad window above the portico and looked out on the long vista of turf and trees now stretching chill and saddened in the moonlight  suddenly a breath of warmth and roses seemed to float towards her and an arm stole gently round her waist while a soft hand took up her tiny fingers caterina felt an electric thrill and was motionless for one long moment then she pushed away the arm and hand and turning round lifted up to the face that hung over her eyes full of tenderness and reproach the fawnlike unconsciousness was gone and in that one look were the ground tones of poor little caterinas natureintense love and fierce jealousy  why do you push me away tina said captain wybrow in a halfwhisper are you angry with me for what a hard fate puts upon me would you have me cross my unclewho has done so much for us bothin his dearest wish you know i have dutieswe both have dutiesbefore which feeling must be sacrificed  yes yes said caterina stamping her foot and turning away her head dont tell me what i know already  there was a voice speaking in caterinas mind to which she had never yet given vent that voice said continually why did he make me love himwhy did he let me know he loved me if he knew all the while that he couldnt brave everything for my sake then love answered he was led on by the feeling of the moment as you have been caterina and now you ought to help him to do what is right then the voice rejoined it was a slight matter to him he doesnt much mind giving you up he will soon love that beautiful woman and forget a poor little pale thing like you  thus love anger and jealousy were struggling in that young soul  besides tina continued captain wybrow in still gentler tones i shall not succeed miss assher very likely prefers some one else and you know i have the best will in the world to fail i shall come back a hapless bachelorperhaps to find you already married to the goodlooking chaplain who is over head and ears in love with you poor sir christopher has made up his mind that youre to have gilfil  why will you speak so you speak from your own want of feeling go away from me  dont let us part in anger tina all this may pass away its as likely as not that i may never marry any one at all these palpitations may carry me off and you may have the satisfaction of knowing that i shall never be anybodys bridegroom who knows what may happen i may be my own master before i get into the bonds of holy matrimony and be able to choose my little singingbird why should we distress ourselves before the time  it is easy to talk so when you are not feeling said caterina the tears flowing fast it is bad to bear now whatever may come after but you dont care about my misery  dont i tina said anthony in his tenderest tones again stealing his arm round her waist and drawing her towards him poor tina was the slave of this voice and touch grief and resentment retrospect and foreboding vanishedall life before and after melted away in the bliss of that moment as anthony pressed his lips to hers  captain wybrow thought poor little tina it would make her very happy to have me but she is a mad little thing  at that moment a loud bell startled caterina from her trance of bliss it was the summons to prayers in the chapel and she hastened away leaving captain wybrow to follow slowly  it was a pretty sight that family assembled to worship in the little chapel where a couple of waxcandles threw a mild faint light on the figures kneeling there in the desk was mr gilfil with his face a shade graver than usual on his right hand kneeling on their red velvet cushions were the master and mistress of the household in their elderly dignified beauty on his left the youthful grace of anthony and caterina in all the striking contrast of their colouringhe with his exquisite outline and rounded fairness like an olympian god she dark and tiny like a gypsy changeling then there were the domestics kneeling on redcovered formsthe women headed by mrs bellamy the natty little old housekeeper in snowy cap and apron and mrs sharp my ladys maid of somewhat vinegar aspect and flaunting attire the men by mr bellamy the butler and mr warren sir christophers venerable valet  a few collects from the evening service was what mr gilfil habitually read ending with the simple petition lighten our darkness  and then they all rose the servants turning to curtsy and bow as they went out the family returned to the drawingroom said goodnight to each other and dispersedall to speedy slumber except two caterina only cried herself to sleep after the clock had struck twelve mr gilfil lay awake still longer thinking that very likely caterina was crying  captain wybrow having dismissed his valet at eleven was soon in a soft slumber his face looking like a fine cameo in high relief on the slightly indented pillow     chapter 3   the last chapter has given the discerning reader sufficient insight into the state of things at cheverel manor in the summer of 1788 in that summer we know the great nation of france was agitated by conflicting thoughts and passions which were but the beginning of sorrows and in our caterinas little breast too there were terrible struggles the poor bird was beginning to flutter and vainly dash its soft breast against the hard iron bars of the inevitable and we see too plainly the danger if that anguish should go on heightening instead of being allayed that the palpitating heart may be fatally bruised  meanwhile if as i hope you feel some interest in caterina and her friends at cheverel manor you are perhaps asking how came she to be there how was it that this tiny darkeyed child of the south whose face was immediately suggestive of olivecovered hills and taperlit shrines came to have her home in that stately english manorhouse by the side of the blonde matron lady cheverelalmost as if a hummingbird were found perched on one of the elmtrees in the park by the side of her ladyships handsomest pouterpigeon speaking good english too and joining in protestant prayers surely she must have been adopted and brought over to england at a very early age she was  during sir christophers last visit to italy with his lady fifteen years before they resided for some time at milan where sir christopher who was an enthusiast for gothic architecture and was then entertaining the project of metamorphosing his plain brick family mansion into the model of a gothic manorhouse was bent on studying the details of that marble miracle the cathedral here lady cheverel as at other italian cities where she made any protracted stay engaged a maestro to give her lessons in singing for she had then not only fine musical taste but a fine soprano voice those were days when very rich people used manuscript music and many a man who resembled jean jacques in nothing else resembled him in getting a livelihood a copier la musique a tant la page lady cheverel having need of this service maestro albani told her he would send her a poveraccio of his acquaintance whose manuscript was the neatest and most correct he knew of unhappily the poveraccio was not always in his best wits and was sometimes rather slow in consequence but it would be a work of christian charity worthy of the beautiful signora to employ poor sarti  the next morning mrs sharp then a blooming abigail of threeandthirty entered her ladys private room and said if you please my lady theres the frowsiest shabbiest man you ever saw outside and hes told mr warren as the singingmaster sent him to see your ladyship but i think youll hardly like him to come in here belike hes only a beggar  o yes show him in immediately  mrs sharp retired muttering something about fleas and worse she had the smallest possible admiration for fair ausonia and its natives and even her profound deference for sir christopher and her lady could not prevent her from expressing her amazement at the infatuation of gentlefolks in choosing to sojourn among papises in countries where there was no getting to air a bit o linen and where the people smelt o garlick fit to knock you down  however she presently reappeared ushering in a small meagre man sallow and dingy with a restless wandering look in his dull eyes and an excessive timidity about his deep reverences which gave him the air of a man who had been long a solitary prisoner yet through all this squalor and wretchedness there were some traces discernible of comparative youth and former good looks lady cheverel though not very tenderhearted still less sentimental was essentially kind and liked to dispense benefits like a goddess who looks down benignly on the halt the maimed and the blind that approach her shrine she was smitten with some compassion at the sight of poor sarti who struck her as the mere battered wreck of a vessel that might have once floated gaily enough on its outward voyage to the sound of pipes and tabors she spoke gently as she pointed out to him the operatic selections she wished him to copy and he seemed to sun himself in her auburn radiant presence so that when he made his exit with the musicbooks under his arm his bow though not less reverent was less timid  it was ten years at least since sarti had seen anything so bright and stately and beautiful as lady cheverel for the time was far off in which he had trod the stage in satin and feathers the primo tenore of one short season he had completely lost his voice in the following winter and had ever since been little better than a cracked fiddle which is good for nothing but firewood for like many italian singers he was too ignorant to teach and if it had not been for his one talent of penmanship he and his young helpless wife might have starved then just after their third child was born fever came swept away the sickly mother and the two eldest children and attacked sarti himself who rose from his sickbed with enfeebled brain and muscle and a tiny baby on his hands scarcely four months old he lodged over a fruitshop kept by a stout virago loud of tongue and irate in temper but who had had children born to her and so had taken care of the tiny yellow blackeyed bambinetto and tended sarti himself through his sickness here he continued to live earning a meagre subsistence for himself and his little one by the work of copying music put into his hands chiefly by maestro albani he seemed to exist for nothing but the child he tended it he dandled it he chatted to it living with it alone in his one room above the fruitshop only asking his landlady to take care of the marmoset during his short absences in fetching and carrying home work customers frequenting that fruitshop might often see the tiny caterina seated on the floor with her legs in a heap of pease which it was her delight to kick about or perhaps deposited like a kitten in a large basket out of harms way  sometimes however sarti left his little one with another kind of protectress he was very regular in his devotions which he paid thrice aweek in the great cathedral carrying caterina with him here when the high morning sun was warming the myriad glittering pinnacles without and struggling against the massive gloom within the shadow of a man with a child on his arm might be seen flitting across the more stationary shadows of pillar and mullion and making its way towards a little tinsel madonna hanging in a retired spot near the choir amid all the sublimities of the mighty cathedral poor sarti had fixed on this tinsel madonna as the symbol of divine mercy and protectionjust as a child in the presence of a great landscape sees none of the glories of wood and sky but sets its heart on a floating feather or insect that happens to be on a level with its eye here then sarti worshipped and prayed setting caterina on the floor by his side and now and then when the cathedral lay near some place where he had to call and did not like to take her he would leave her there in front of the tinsel madonna where she would sit perfectly good amusing herself with low crowing noises and seesawings of her tiny body and when sarti came back he always found that the blessed mother had taken good care of caterina  that was briefly the history of sarti who fulfilled so well the orders lady cheverel gave him that she sent him away again with a stock of new work but this time week after week passed and he neither reappeared nor sent home the music intrusted to him lady cheverel began to be anxious and was thinking of sending warren to inquire at the address sarti had given her when one day as she was equipped for driving out the valet brought in a small piece of paper which he said had been left for her ladyship by a man who was carrying fruit the paper contained only three tremulous lines in italianwill the eccelentissima for the love of god have pity on a dying man and come to him  lady cheverel recognized the handwriting as sartis in spite of its tremulousness and going down to her carriage ordered the milanese coachman to drive to strada quinquagesima numero 10 the coach stopped in a dirty narrow street opposite la pazzinis fruitshop and that large specimen of womanhood immediately presented herself at the door to the extreme disgust of mrs sharp who remarked privately to mr warren that la pazzini was a hijeous porpis the fruitwoman however was all smiles and deep curtsies to the eccelentissima who not very well understanding her milanese dialect abbreviated the conversation by asking to be shown at once to signor sarti la pazzini preceded her up the dark narrow stairs and opened a door through which she begged her ladyship to enter directly opposite the door lay sarti on a low miserable bed his eyes were glazed and no movement indicated that he was conscious of their entrance  on the foot of the bed was seated a tiny child apparently not three years old her head covered by a linen cap her feet clothed with leather boots above which her little yellow legs showed thin and naked a frock made of what had once been a gay flowered silk was her only other garment her large dark eyes shone from out her queer little face like two precious stones in a grotesque image carved in old ivory she held an empty medicinebottle in her hand and was amusing herself with putting the cork in and drawing it out again to hear how it would pop  la pazzini went up to the bed and said ecco la nobilissima donna but directly after screamed out holy mother he is dead  it was so the entreaty had not been sent in time for sarti to carry out his project of asking the great english lady to take care of his caterina that was the thought which haunted his feeble brain as soon as he began to fear that his illness would end in death she had wealthshe was kindshe would surely do something for the poor orphan and so at last he sent that scrap of paper which won the fulfilment of his prayer though he did not live to utter it lady cheverel gave la pazzini money that the last decencies might be paid to the dead man and carried away caterina meaning to consult sir christopher as to what should be done with her even mrs sharp had been so smitten with pity by the scene she had witnessed when she was summoned upstairs to fetch caterina as to shed a small tear though she was not at all subject to that weakness indeed she abstained from it on principle because as she often said it was known to be the worst thing in the world for the eyes  on the way back to her hotel lady cheverel turned over various projects in her mind regarding caterina but at last one gained the preference over all the rest why should they not take the child to england and bring her up there they had been married twelve years yet cheverel manor was cheered by no childrens voices and the old house would be all the better for a little of that music besides it would be a christian work to train this little papist into a good protestant and graft as much english fruit as possible on the italian stem  sir christopher listened to this plan with hearty acquiescence he loved children and took at once to the little blackeyed monkeyhis name for caterina all through her short life but neither he nor lady cheverel had any idea of adopting her as their daughter and giving her their own rank in life they were much too english and aristocratic to think of anything so romantic no the child would be brought up at cheverel manor as a protegee to be ultimately useful perhaps in sorting worsteds keeping accounts reading aloud and otherwise supplying the place of spectacles when her ladyships eyes should wax dim  so mrs sharp had to procure new clothes to replace the linen cap flowered frock and leathern boots and now strange to say little caterina who had suffered many unconscious evils in her existence of thirty moons first began to know conscious troubles ignorance says ajax is a painless evil so i should think is dirt considering the merry faces that go along with it at any rate cleanliness is sometimes a painful good as any one can vouch who has had his face washed the wrong way by a pitiless hand with a gold ring on the third finger if you reader have not known that initiatory anguish it is idle to expect that you will form any approximate conception of what caterina endured under mrs sharps new dispensation of soapandwater happily this purgatory came presently to be associated in her tiny brain with a passage straightway to a seat of blissthe sofa in lady cheverels sittingroom where there were toys to be broken a ride was to be had on sir christophers knee and a spaniel of resigned temper was prepared to undergo small tortures without flinching     chapter 4   in three months from the time of caterinas adoptionnamely in the late autumn of 1773the chimneys of cheverel manor were sending up unwonted smoke and the servants were awaiting in excitement the return of their master and mistress after a two years absence great was the astonishment of mrs bellamy the housekeeper when mr warren lifted a little blackeyed child out of the carriage and great was mrs sharps sense of superior information and experience as she detailed caterinas history interspersed with copious comments to the rest of the upper servants that evening as they were taking a comfortable glass of grog together in the housekeepers room  a pleasant room it was as any party need desire to muster in on a cold november evening the fireplace alone was a picture a wide and deep recess with a low brick altar in the middle where great logs of dry wood sent myriad sparks up the dark chimneythroat and over the front of this recess a large wooden entablature bearing this motto finely carved in old english letters fear god and honour the king and beyond the party who formed a halfmoon with their chairs and wellfurnished table round this bright fireplace what a space of chiaroscuro for the imagination to revel in stretching across the far end of the room what an oak table high enough surely for homers gods standing on four massive legs bossed and bulging like sculptured urns and lining the distant wall what vast cupboards suggestive of inexhaustible apricot jam and promiscuous butlers perquisites a stray picture or two had found their way down there and made agreeable patches of dark brown on the buffcoloured walls high over the loudresounding double door hung one which from some indications of a face looming out of blackness might by a great synthetic effort be pronounced a magdalen considerably lower down hung the similitude of a hat and feathers with portions of a ruff stated by mrs bellamy to represent sir francis bacon who invented gunpowder and in her opinion might ha been better emplyed  but this evening the mind is but slightly arrested by the great verulam and is in the humour to think a dead philosopher less interesting than a living gardener who sits conspicuous in the halfcircle round the fireplace mr bates is habitually a guest in the housekeepers room of an evening preferring the social pleasures therethe feast of gossip and the flow of grogto a bachelors chair in his charming thatched cottage on a little island where every sound is remote but the cawing of rooks and the screaming of wild geese poetic sounds doubtless but humanly speaking not convivial  mr bates was by no means an average person to be passed without special notice he was a sturdy yorkshireman approaching forty whose face nature seemed to have coloured when she was in a hurry and had no time to attend to nuances for every inch of him visible above his neckcloth was of one impartial redness so that when he was at some distance your imagination was at liberty to place his lips anywhere between his nose and chin seen closer his lips were discerned to be of a peculiar cut and i fancy this had something to do with the peculiarity of his dialect which as we shall see was individual rather than provincial mr bates was further distinguished from the common herd by a perpetual blinking of the eyes and this together with the redrose tint of his complexion and a way he had of hanging his head forward and rolling it from side to side as he walked gave him the air of a bacchus in a blue apron who in the present reduced circumstances of olympus had taken to the management of his own vines yet as gluttons are often thin so sober men are often rubicund and mr bates was sober with that manly british churchmanlike sobriety which can carry a few glasses of grog without any perceptible clarification of ideas  dang my boottons observed mr bates who at the conclusion of mrs sharps narrative felt himself urged to his strongest interjection its what i shouldnt ha looked for from sir cristhifer an my ledy to bring a furrin child into the coonthry an depend ont whether you an me lives to seet or noo itll coom to soom harm the first sitiation iver i heldit was a

last wi th mississ jewlbox theyre all alaike them furriners it roons i th blood  well said mrs sharp with the air of a person who held liberal views but knew where to draw the line im not agoing to defend the furriners for ive as good reason to know what they are as most folks an nobodyll ever hear me say but what theyre next door to heathens and the hile they eat wi their victuals is enough to turn any christians stomach but for all thatan for all as the trouble in respect o washin and managin has fell upo me through the journeyi cant say but what i think as my lady an sir cristifers done a right thing by a hinnicent child as doesnt know its right hand from its left i bringing it where itll learn to speak summat better nor gibberish and be brought up i the true religion for as for them furrin churches as sir cristifer is so unaccountable mad after wi pictures o men an women ashowing themselves just for all the world as god made em i think for my part as its welly a sin to go into em  youre likely to have more foreigners however said mr warren who liked to provoke the gardener for sir christopher has engaged some italian workmen to help in the alterations in the house  olterations exclaimed mrs bellamy in alarm what olterations  why answered mr warren sir christopher as i understand is going to make a new thing of the old manorhouse both inside and out and hes got portfolios full of plans and pictures coming it is to be cased with stone in the gothic stylepretty near like the churches you know as far as i can make out and the ceilings are to be beyond anything thats been seen in the country sir christophers been giving a deal of study to it  dear heart alive said mrs bellamy we shall be pisoned wi lime an plaster an hev the house full o workmen colloguing wi the maids an makin no end o mischief  that ye may ley your life on mrs bellamy said mr bates howiver ill noot denay that the goothic stayles prithy anoof an its woonderful how near them stooncarvers cuts oot the shapes o the pine apples an shamrucks an rooses i dare sey sir cristhiferll meck a naice thing o the manor an there woont be many gentlemens houses i the coonthry asll coom up tot wi sich a garden an pleasuregroons an wallfruit as king george maight be prood on  well i cant think as the house can be better nor it is gothic or no gothic said mrs bellamy an ive done the picklin and preservin in it fourteen year michaelmas was a three weeks but what does my lady say tot  my lady knows better than cross sir cristifer in what hes set his mind on said mr bellamy who objected to the critical tone of the conversation sir cristiferll hev his own way that you may tek your oath an i the right ont too hes a gentleman born ans got the money but come mester bates fill your glass an well drink health an happiness to his honour an my lady and then you shall give us a song sir cristifer doesnt come hum from italy ivery night  this demonstrable position was accepted without hesitation as ground for a toast but mr bates apparently thinking that his song was not an equally reasonable sequence ignored the second part of mr bellamys proposal so mrs sharp who had been heard to say that she had no thoughts at all of marrying mr bates though he was a sensable freshcoloured man as many a woman ud snap at for a husband enforced mr bellamys appeal  come mr bates let us hear roys wife id rether hear a good old song like that nor all the fine italian toodlin  mr bates urged thus flatteringly stuck his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat threw himself back in his chair with his head in that position in which he could look directly towards the zenith and struck up a remarkably staccato rendering of roys wife of aldivalloch this melody may certainly be taxed with excessive iteration but that was precisely its highest recommendation to the present audience who found it all the easier to swell the chorus nor did it at all diminish their pleasure that the only particular concerning roys wife which mr batess enunciation allowed them to gather was that she chated himwhether in the matter of garden stuff or of some other commodity or why her name should in consequence be repeatedly reiterated with exultation remaining an agreeable mystery  mr batess song formed the climax of the evenings goodfellowship and the party soon after dispersedmrs bellamy perhaps to dream of quicklime flying among her preservingpans or of lovesick housemaids reckless of unswept cornersand mrs sharp to sink into pleasant visions of independent housekeeping in mr batess cottage with no bells to answer and with fruit and vegetables ad libitum  caterina soon conquered all prejudices against her foreign blood for what prejudices will hold out against helplessness and broken prattle she became the pet of the household thrusting sir christophers favourite bloodhound of that day mrs bellamys two canaries and mr batess largest dorking hen into a merely secondary position the consequence was that in the space of a summers day she went through a great cycle of experiences commencing with the somewhat acidulated goodwill of mrs sharps nursery discipline then came the grave luxury of her ladyships sittingroom and perhaps the dignity of a ride on sir christophers knee sometimes followed by a visit with him to the stables where caterina soon learned to hear without crying the baying of the chained bloodhounds and say with ostentatious bravery clinging to sir christophers leg all the while dey not hurt tina then mrs bellamy would perhaps be going out to gather the roseleaves and lavender and tina was made proud and happy by being allowed to carry a handful in her pinafore happier still when they were spread out on sheets to dry so that she could sit down like a frog among them and have them poured over her in fragrant showers another frequent pleasure was to take a journey with mr bates through the kitchengardens and the hothouses where the rich bunches of green and purple grapes hung from the roof far out of reach of the tiny yellow hand that could not help stretching itself out towards them though the hand was sure at last to be satisfied with some delicateflavoured fruit or sweetscented flower indeed in the long monotonous leisure of that great countryhouse you may be sure there was always some one who had nothing better to do than to play with tina so that the little southern bird had its northern nest lined with tenderness and caresses and pretty things a loving sensitive nature was too likely under such nurture to have its susceptibility heightened into unfitness for an encounter with any harder experience all the more because there were gleams of fierce resistance to any discipline that had a harsh or unloving aspect for the only thing in which caterina showed any precocity was a certain ingenuity in vindictiveness when she was five years old she had revenged herself for an unpleasant prohibition by pouring the ink into mrs sharps workbasket and once when lady cheverel took her doll from her because she was affectionately licking the paint off its face the little minx straightway climbed on a chair and threw down a flowervase that stood on a bracket this was almost the only instance in which her anger overcame her awe of lady cheverel who had the ascendancy always belonging to kindness that never melts into caresses and is severely but uniformly beneficent  byandby the happy monotony of cheverel manor was broken in upon in the way mr warren had announced the roads through the park were cut up by waggons carrying loads of stone from a neighbouring quarry the green courtyard became dusty with lime and the peaceful house rang with the sound of tools for the next ten years sir christopher was occupied with the architectural metamorphosis of his old family mansion thus anticipating through the prompting of his individual taste that general reaction from the insipid imitation of the palladian style towards a restoration of the gothic which marked the close of the eighteenth century this was the object he had set his heart on with a singleness of determination which was regarded with not a little contempt by his foxhunting neighbours who wondered greatly that a man with some of the best blood in england in his veins should be mean enough to economize in his cellar and reduce his stud to two old coachhorses and a hack for the sake of riding a hobby and playing the architect their wives did not see so much to blame in the matter of the cellar and stables but they were eloquent in pity for poor lady cheverel who had to live in no more than three rooms at once and who must be distracted with noises and have her constitution undermined by unhealthy smells it was as bad as having a husband with an asthma why did not sir christopher take a house for her at bath or at least if he must spend his time in overlooking workmen somewhere in the neighbourhood of the manor this pity was quite gratuitous as the most plentiful pity always is for though lady cheverel did not share her husbands architectural enthusiasm she had too rigorous a view of a wifes duties and too profound a deference for sir christopher to regard submission as a grievance as for sir christopher he was perfectly indifferent to criticism an obstinate crotchety man said his neighbours but i who have seen cheverel manor as he bequeathed it to his heirs rather attribute that unswerving architectural purpose of his conceived and carried out through long years of systematic personal exertion to something of the fervour of genius as well as inflexibility of will and in walking through those rooms with their splendid ceilings and their meagre furniture which tell how all the spare money had been absorbed before personal comfort was thought of i have felt that there dwelt in this old english baronet some of that sublime spirit which distinguishes art from luxury and worships beauty apart from selfindulgence  while cheverel manor was growing from ugliness into beauty caterina too was growing from a little yellow bantling into a whiter maiden with no positive beauty indeed but with a certain light airy grace which with her large appealing dark eyes and a voice that in its lowtoned tenderness recalled the lovenotes of the stockdove gave her a more than usual charm unlike the building however caterinas development was the result of no systematic or careful appliances she grew up very much like the primroses which the gardener is not sorry to see within his enclosure but takes no pains to cultivate lady cheverel taught her to read and write and say her catechism mr warren being a good accountant gave her lessons in arithmetic by her ladyships desire and mrs sharp initiated her in all the mysteries of the needle but for a long time there was no thought of giving her any more elaborate education it is very likely that to her dying day caterina thought the earth stood still and that the sun and stars moved round it but so for the matter of that did helen and dido and desdemona and juliet whence i hope you will not think my caterina less worthy to be a heroine on that account the truth is that with one exception her only talent lay in loving and there it is probable the most astronomical of women could not have surpassed her orphan and protegee though she was this supreme talent of hers found plenty of exercise at cheverel manor and caterina had more people to love than many a small lady and gentleman affluent in silver mugs and blood relations i think the first place in her childish heart was given to sir christopher for little girls are apt to attach themselves to the finestlooking gentleman at hand especially as he seldom has anything to do with discipline next to the baronet came dorcas the merry rosycheeked damsel who was mrs sharps lieutenant in the nursery and thus played the part of the raisins in a dose of senna it was a black day for caterina when dorcas married the coachman and went with a great sense of elevation in the world to preside over a public in the noisy town of sloppeter a little chinabox bearing the motto though lost to sight to memory dear which dorcas sent her as a remembrance was among caterinas treasures ten years after  the one other exceptional talent you already guess was music when the fact that caterina had a remarkable ear for music and a still more remarkable voice attracted lady cheverels notice the discovery was very welcome both to her and sir christopher her musical education became at once an object of interest lady cheverel devoted much time to it and the rapidity of tinas progress surpassing all hopes an italian singingmaster was engaged for several years to spend some months together at cheverel manor this unexpected gift made a great alteration in caterinas position after those first years in which little girls are petted like puppies and kittens there comes a time when it seems less obvious what they can be good for especially when like caterina they give no particular promise of cleverness or beauty and it is not surprising that in that uninteresting period there was no particular plan formed as to her future position she could always help mrs sharp supposing she were fit for nothing else as she grew up but now this rare gift of song endeared her to lady cheverel who loved music above all things and it associated her at once with the pleasures of the drawingroom insensibly she came to be regarded as one of the family and the servants began to understand that miss sarti was to be a lady after all  and the raight ont too said mr bates for she hasnt the cut of a gell as must work for her bread shes as nesh an dilicate as a paichblossomwelly laike a linnet wi ony joost body anoof to hold her voice  but long before tina had reached this stage of her history a new era had begun for her in the arrival of a younger companion than any she had hitherto known when she was no more than seven a ward of sir christophersa lad of fifteen maynard gilfil by namebegan to spend his vacations at cheverel manor and found there no playfellow so much to his mind as caterina maynard was an affectionate lad who retained a propensity to white rabbits pet squirrels and guineapigs perhaps a little beyond the age at which young gentlemen usually look down on such pleasures as puerile he was also much given to fishing and to carpentry considered as a fine art without any base view to utility and in all these pleasures it was his delight to have caterina as his companion to call her little pet names answer her wondering questions and have her toddling after him as you may have seen a blenheim spaniel trotting after a large setter whenever maynard went back to school there was a little scene of parting  you wont forget me tina before i come back again i shall leave you all the whipcord weve made and dont you let guinea die come give me a kiss and promise not to forget me  as the years wore on and maynard passed from school to college and from a slim lad to a stalwart young man their companionship in the vacations necessarily took a different form but it retained a brotherly and sisterly familiarity with maynard the boyish affection had insensibly grown into ardent love among all the many kinds of first love that which begins in childish companionship is the strongest and most enduring when passion comes to unite its force to long affection love is at its springtide and maynard gilfils love was of a kind to make him prefer being tormented by caterina to any pleasure apart from her which the most benevolent magician could have devised for him it is the way with those tall largelimbed men from samson downwards as for tina the little minx was perfectly well aware that maynard was her slave he was the one person in the world whom she did as she pleased with and i need not tell you that this was a symptom of her being perfectly heartwhole so far as he was concerned for a passionate womans love is always overshadowed by fear  maynard gilfil did not deceive himself in his interpretation of caterinas feelings but he nursed the hope that some time or other she would at least care enough for him to accept his love so he waited patiently for the day when he might venture to say caterina i love you you see he would have been content with very little being one of those men who pass through life without making the least clamour about themselves thinking neither the cut of his coat nor the flavour of his soup nor the precise depth of a servants bow at all momentous he thoughtfoolishly enough as lovers will thinkthat it was a good augury for him when he came to be domesticated at cheverel manor in the quality of chaplain there and curate of a neighbouring parish judging falsely from his own case that habit and affection were the likeliest avenues to love sir christopher satisfied several feelings in installing maynard as chaplain in his house he liked the oldfashioned dignity of that domestic appendage he liked his wards companionship and as maynard had some private fortune he might take life easily in that agreeable home keeping his hunter and observing a mild regimen of clerical duty until the cumbermoor living should fall in when he might be settled for life in the neighbourhood of the manor with caterina for a wife too sir christopher soon began to think for though the good baronet was not at all quick to suspect what was unpleasant and opposed to his views of fitness he was quick to see what would dovetail with his own plans and he had first guessed and then ascertained by direct inquiry the state of maynards feelings he at once leaped to the conclusion that caterina was of the same mind or at least would be when she was old enough but these were too early days for anything definite to be said or done  meanwhile new circumstances were arising which though they made no change in sir christophers plans and prospects converted mr gilfils hopes into anxieties and made it clear to him not only that caterinas heart was never likely to be his but that it was given entirely to another  once or twice in caterinas childhood there had been another boyvisitor at the manor younger than maynard gilfila beautiful boy with brown curls and splendid clothes on whom caterina had looked with shy admiration this was anthony wybrow the son of sir christophers youngest sister and chosen heir of cheverel manor the baronet had sacrificed a large sum and even straitened the resources by which he was to carry out his architectural schemes for the sake of removing the entail from his estate and making this boy his heirmoved to the step i am sorry to say by an implacable quarrel with his elder sister for a power of forgiveness was not among sir christophers virtues at length on the death of anthonys mother when he was no longer a curlyheaded boy but a tall young man with a captains commission cheverel manor became his home too whenever he was absent from his regiment caterina was then a little woman between sixteen and seventeen and i need not spend many words in explaining what you perceive to be the most natural thing in the world  there was little company kept at the manor and captain wybrow would have been much duller if caterina had not been there it was pleasant to pay her attentionsto speak to her in gentle tones to see her little flutter of pleasure the blush that just lit up her pale cheek and the momentary timid glance of her dark eyes when he praised her singing leaning at her side over the piano pleasant too to cut out that chaplain with his large calves what idle man can withstand the temptation of a woman to fascinate and another man to eclipseespecially when it is quite clear to himself that he means no mischief and shall leave everything to come right again byandby at the end of eighteen months however during which captain wybrow had spent much of his time at the manor he found that matters had reached a point which he had not at all contemplated gentle tones had led to tender words and tender words had called forth a response of looks which made it impossible not to carry on the crescendo of lovemaking to find ones self adored by a little graceful darkeyed sweetsinging woman whom no one need despise is an agreeable sensation comparable to smoking the finest latakia and also imposes some return of tenderness as a duty  perhaps you think that captain wybrow who knew that it would be ridiculous to dream of his marrying caterina must have been a reckless libertine to win her affections in this manner not at all he was a young man of calm passions who was rarely led into any conduct of which he could not give a plausible account to himself and the tiny fragile caterina was a woman who touched the imagination and the affections rather than the senses he really felt very kindly towards her and would very likely have loved herif he had been able to love any one but nature had not endowed him with that capability she had given him an admirable figure the whitest of hands the most delicate of nostrils and a large amount of serene selfsatisfaction but as if to save such a delicate piece of work from any risk of being shattered she had guarded him from the liability to a strong emotion there was no list of youthful misdemeanours on record against him and sir christopher and lady cheverel thought him the best of nephews the most satisfactory of heirs full of grateful deference to themselves and above all things guided by a sense of duty captain wybrow always did the thing easiest and most agreeable to him from a sense of duty he dressed expensively because it was a duty he owed to his position from a sense of duty he adapted himself to sir christophers inflexible will which it would have been troublesome as well as useless to resist and being of a delicate constitution he took care of his health from a sense of duty his health was the only point on which he gave anxiety to his friends and it was owing to this that sir christopher wished to see his nephew early married the more so as a match after the baronets own heart appeared immediately attainable anthony had seen and admired miss assher the only child of a lady who had been sir christophers earliest love but who as things will happen in this world had married another baronet instead of him miss asshers father was now dead and she was in possession of a pretty estate if as was probable she should prove susceptible to the merits of anthonys person and character nothing could make sir christopher so happy as to see a marriage which might be expected to secure the inheritance of cheverel manor from getting into the wrong hands anthony had already been kindly received by lady assher as the nephew of her early friend why should he not go to bath where she and her daughter were then residing follow up the acquaintance and win a handsome wellborn and sufficiently wealthy bride  sir christophers wishes were communicated to his nephew who at once intimated his willingness to comply with themfrom a sense of duty caterina was tenderly informed by her lover of the sacrifice demanded from them both and three days afterwards occurred the parting scene you have witnessed in the gallery on the eve of captain wybrows departure for bath     chapter 5   the inexorable ticking of the clock is like the throb of pain to sensations made keen by a sickening fear and so it is with the great clockwork of nature daisies and buttercups give way to the brown waving grasses tinged with the warm red sorrel the waving grasses are swept away and the meadows lie like emeralds set in the bushy hedgerows the tawnytipped corn begins to bow with the weight of the full ear the reapers are bending amongst it and it soon stands in sheaves then presently the patches of yellow stubble lie side by side with streaks of darkred earth which the plough is turning up in preparation for the newthrashed seed and this passage from beauty to beauty which to the happy is like the flow of a melody measures for many a human heart the approach of foreseen anguishseems hurrying on the moment when the shadow of dread will be followed up by the reality of despair  how cruelly hasty that summer of 1788 seemed to caterina surely the roses vanished earlier and the berries on the mountainash were more impatient to redden and bring on the autumn when she would be face to face with her misery and witness anthony giving all his gentle tones tender words and soft looks to another  before the end of july captain wybrow had written word that lady assher and her daughter were about to fly from the heat and gaiety of bath to the shady quiet of their place at farleigh and that he was invited to join the party there his letters implied that he was on an excellent footing with both the ladies and gave no hint of a rival so that sir christopher was more than usually bright and cheerful after reading them at length towards the close of august came the announcement that captain wybrow was an accepted lover and after much complimentary and congratulatory correspondence between the two families it was understood that in september lady assher and her daughter would pay a visit to cheverel manor when beatrice would make the acquaintance of her future relatives and all needful arrangements could be discussed captain wybrow would remain at farleigh till then and accompany the ladies on their journey  in the interval every one at cheverel manor had something to do by way of preparing for the visitors sir christopher was occupied in consultations with his steward and lawyer and in giving orders to every one else especially in spurring on francesco to finish the saloon mr gilfil had the responsibility of procuring a ladys horse miss assher being a great rider lady cheverel had unwonted calls to make and invitations to deliver mr batess turf and gravel and flowerbeds were always at such a point of neatness and finish that nothing extraordinary could be done in the garden except a little extraordinary scolding of the undergardener and this addition mr bates did not neglect  happily for caterina she too had her task to fill up the long dreary daytime it was to finish a chaircushion which would complete the set of embroidered covers for the drawingroom lady cheverels yearlong work and the only noteworthy bit of furniture in the manor over this embroidery she sat with cold lips and a palpitating heart thankful that this miserable sensation throughout the daytime seemed to counteract the tendency to tears which returned with night and solitude she was most frightened when sir christopher approached her the baronets eye was brighter and his step more elastic than ever and it seemed to him that only the most leaden or churlish souls could be otherwise than brisk and exulting in a world where everything went so well dear old gentleman he had gone through life a little flushed with the power of his will and now his latest plan was succeeding and cheverel manor would be inherited by a grandnephew whom he might even yet live to see a fine young fellow with at least the down on his chin why not one is still young at sixty  sir christopher had always something playful to say to caterina  now little monkey you must be in your best voice youre the minstrel of the manor you know and be sure you have a pretty gown and a new ribbon you must not be dressed in russet though you are a singingbird or perhaps it is your turn to be courted next tina but dont you learn any naughty proud airs i must have maynard let off easily  caterinas affection for the old baronet helped her to summon up a smile as he stroked her cheek and looked at her kindly but that was the moment at which she felt it most difficult not to burst out crying lady cheverels conversation and presence were less trying for her ladyship felt no more than calm satisfaction in this family event and besides she was further sobered by a little jealousy at sir christophers anticipation of pleasure in seeing lady assher enshrined in his memory as a mildeyed beauty of sixteen with whom he had exchanged locks before he went on his first travels lady cheverel would have died rather than confess it but she couldnt help hoping that he would be disappointed in lady assher and rather ashamed of having called her so charming  mr gilfil watched caterina through these days with mixed feelings her suffering went to his heart but even for her sake he was glad that a love which could never come to good should be no longer fed by false hopes and how could he help saying to himself perhaps after a while caterina will be tired of fretting about that coldhearted puppy and then     at length the muchexpected day arrived and the brightest of september suns was lighting up the yellowing limetrees as about five oclock lady asshers carriage drove under the portico caterina seated at work in her own room heard the rolling of the wheels followed presently by the opening and shutting of doors and the sound of voices in the corridors remembering that the dinnerhour was six and that lady cheverel had desired her to be in the drawingroom early she started up to dress and was delighted to find herself feeling suddenly brave and strong curiosity to see miss assherthe thought that anthony was in the housethe wish not to look unattractive were feelings that brought some colour to her lips and made it easy to attend to her toilette they would ask her to sing this evening and she would sing well miss assher should not think her utterly insignificant so she put on her grey silk gown and her cherry coloured ribbon with as much care as if she had been herself the betrothed not forgetting the pair of round pearl earrings which sir christopher had told lady cheverel to give her because tinas little ears were so pretty  quick as she had been she found sir christopher and lady cheverel in the drawingroom chatting with mr gilfil and telling him how handsome miss assher was but how entirely unlike her motherapparently resembling her father only  aha said sir christopher as he turned to look at caterina what do you think of this maynard did you ever see tina look so pretty before why that little grey gown has been made out of a bit of my ladys hasnt it it doesnt take anything much larger than a pockethandkerchief to dress the little monkey  lady cheverel too serenely radiant in the assurance a single glance had given her of lady asshers inferiority smiled approval and caterina was in one of those moods of self possession and indifference which come as the ebbtide between the struggles of passion she retired to the piano and busied herself with arranging her music not at all insensible to the pleasure of being looked at with admiration the while and thinking that the next time the door opened captain wybrow would enter and she would speak to him quite cheerfully but when she heard him come in and the scent of roses floated towards her her heart gave one great leap she knew nothing till he was pressing her hand and saying in the old easy way well caterina how do you do you look quite blooming  she felt her cheeks reddening with anger that he could speak and look with such perfect nonchalance ah he was too deeply in love with some one else to remember anything he had felt for her but the next moment she was conscious of her follyas if he could show any feeling then this conflict of emotions stretched into a long interval the few moments that elapsed before the door opened again and her own attention as well as that of all the rest was absorbed by the entrance of the two ladies  the daughter was the more striking from the contrast she presented to her mother a roundshouldered middlesized woman who had once had the transient pinkandwhite beauty of a blonde with illdefined features and early embonpoint miss assher was tall and gracefully though substantially formed carrying herself with an air of mingled graciousness and selfconfidence her darkbrown hair untouched by powder hanging in bushy curls round her face and falling in long thick ringlets nearly to her waist the brilliant carmine tint of her wellrounded cheeks and the finelycut outline of her straight nose produced an impression of splendid beauty in spite of commonplace brown eyes a narrow forehead and thin lips she was in mourning and the dead black of her crape dress relieved here and there by jet ornaments gave the fullest effect to her complexion and to the rounded whiteness of her arms bare from the elbow the first coup doeil was dazzling and as she stood looking down with a gracious smile on caterina whom lady cheverel was presenting to her the poor little thing seemed to herself to feel for the first time all the folly of her former dream  we are enchanted with your place sir christopher said lady assher with a feeble kind of pompousness which she seemed to be copying from some one else im sure your nephew must have thought farleigh wretchedly out of order poor sir john was so very careless about keeping up the house and grounds i often talked to him about it but he said pooh pooh as long as my friends find a good dinner and a good bottle of wine they wont care about my ceilings being rather smoky he was so very hospitable was sir john  i think the view of the house from the park just after we passed the bridge particularly fine said miss assher interposing rather eagerly as if she feared her mother might be making infelicitous speeches and the pleasure of the first glimpse was all the greater because anthony would describe nothing to us beforehand he would not spoil our first impressions by raising false ideas i long to go over the house sir christopher and learn the history of all your architectural designs which anthony says have cost you so much time and study  take care how you set an old man talking about the past my dear said the baronet i hope we shall find something pleasanter for you to do than turning over my old plans and pictures our friend mr gilfil here has found a beautiful mare for you and you can scour the country to your hearts content anthony has sent us word what a horsewoman you are  miss assher turned to mr gilfil with her most beaming smile and expressed her thanks with the elaborate graciousness of a person who means to be thought charming and is sure of success  pray do not thank me said mr gilfil till you have tried the mare she has been ridden by lady sara linter for the last two years but one ladys taste may not be like anothers in horses any more than in other matters  while this conversation was passing captain wybrow was leaning against the mantelpiece contenting himself with responding from under his indolent eyelids to the glances miss assher was constantly directing towards him as she spoke she is very much in love with him thought caterina but she was relieved that anthony remained passive in his attentions she thought too that he was looking paler and more languid than usual if he didnt love her very muchif he sometimes thought of the past with regret i think i could bear it all and be glad to see sir christopher made happy  during dinner there was a little incident which confirmed these thoughts when the sweets were on the table there was a mould of jelly just opposite captain wybrow and being inclined to take some himself he first invited miss assher who coloured and said in rather a sharper key than usual have you not learned by this time that i never take jelly  dont you said captain wybrow whose perceptions were not acute enough for him to notice the difference of a semitone i should have thought you were fond of it there was always some on the table at farleigh i think  you dont seem to take much interest in my likes and dislikes  im too much possessed by the happy thought that you like me was the ex officio reply in silvery tones  this little episode was unnoticed by every one but caterina sir christopher was listening with polite attention to lady asshers history of her last mancook who was firstrate at gravies and for that reason pleased sir johnhe was so particular about his gravies was sir john and so they kept the man six years in spite of his bad pastry lady cheverel and mr gilfil were smiling at rupert the bloodhound who had pushed his great head under his masters arm and was taking a survey of the dishes after snuffing at the contents of the baronets plate  when the ladies were in the drawingroom again lady assher was soon deep in a statement to lady cheverel of her views about burying people in woollen  to be sure you must have a woollen dress because its the law you know but that need hinder no one from putting linen underneath i always used to say if sir john died tomorrow i would bury him in his shirt and i did and let me advise you to do so by sir christopher you never saw sir john lady cheverel he was a large tall man with a nose just like beatrice and so very particular about his shirts  miss assher meanwhile had seated herself by caterina and with that smiling affability which seems to say i am really not at all proud though you might expect it of me saidanthony tells me you sing so very beautifully i hope we shall hear you this evening  o yes said caterina quietly without smiling i always sing when i am wanted to sing  i envy you such a charming talent do you know i have no ear i cannot hum the smallest tune and i delight in music so is it not unfortunate but i shall have quite a treat while i am here captain wybrow says you will give us some music every day  i should have thought you wouldnt care about music if you had no ear said caterina becoming epigrammatic by force of grave simplicity  o i assure you i doat on it and anthony is so fond of it it would be so delightful if i could play and sing to him though he says he likes me best not to sing because it doesnt belong to his idea of me what style of music do you like best  i dont know i like all beautiful music  and are you as fond of riding as of music  no i never ride i think i should be very frightened  o no indeed you would not after a little practice i have never been in the least timid i think anthony is more afraid for me than i am for myself and since i have been riding with him i have been obliged to be more careful because he is so nervous about me  caterina made no reply but she said to herself i wish she would go away and not talk to me she only wants me to admire her goodnature and to talk about anthony  miss assher was thinking at the same time this miss sarti seems a stupid little thing those musical people often are but she is prettier than i expected anthony said she was not pretty  happily at this moment lady assher called her daughters attention to the embroidered cushions and miss assher walking to the opposite sofa was soon in conversation with lady cheverel about tapestry and embroidery in general while her mother feeling herself superseded there came and placed herself beside caterina  i hear you are the most beautiful singer was of course the opening remark all italians sing so beautifully i travelled in italy with sir john when we were first married and we went to venice where they go about in gondolas you know you dont wear powder i see no more will beatrice though many people think her curls would look all the better for powder she has so much hair hasnt she our last maid dressed it much better than this but do you know she wore beatrices stockings before they went to the wash and we couldnt keep her after that could we  caterina accepting the question as a mere bit of rhetorical effect thought it superfluous to reply till lady assher repeated could we now as if tinas sanction were essential to her repose of mind after a faint no she went on  maids are so very troublesome and beatrice is so particular you cant imagine i often say to her my dear you cant have perfection that very gown she has onto be sure it fits her beautifully nowbut it has been unmade and made up again twice but she is like poor sir johnhe was so very particular about his own things was sir john is lady cheverel particular  rather but mrs sharp has been her maid twenty years  i wish there was any chance of our keeping griffin twenty years but i am afraid we shall have to part with her because her health is so delicate and she is so obstinate she will not take bitters as i want her you look delicate now let me recommend you to take camomile tea in a morning fasting beatrice is so strong and healthy she never takes any medicine but if i had had twenty girls and they had been delicate i should have given them all camomile tea it strengthens the constitution beyond anything now will you promise me to take camomile tea  thank you im not at all ill said caterina ive always been pale and thin  lady assher was sure camomile tea would make all the difference in the worldcaterina must see if it wouldntand then went dribbling on like a leaky showerbath until the early entrance of the gentlemen created a diversion and she fastened on sir christopher who probably began to think that for poetical purposes it would be better not to meet ones first love again after a lapse of forty years  captain wybrow of course joined his aunt and miss assher and mr gilfil tried to relieve caterina from the awkwardness of sitting aloof and dumb by telling her how a friend of his had broken his arm and staked his horse that morning not at all appearing to heed that she hardly listened and was looking towards the other side of the room one of the tortures of jealousy is that it can never turn its eyes away from the thing that pains it  byandby every one felt the need of a relief from chitchatsir christopher perhaps the most of alland it was he who made the acceptable proposition  come tina are we to have no music tonight before we sit down to cards your ladyship plays at cards i think he added recollecting himself and turning to lady assher  o yes poor dear sir john would have a whisttable every night  caterina sat down to the harpsichord at once and had no sooner begun to sing than she perceived with delight that captain wybrow was gliding towards the harpsichord and soon standing in the old place this consciousness gave fresh strength to her voice and when she noticed that miss assher presently followed him with that air of ostentatious admiration which belongs to the absence of real enjoyment her closing bravura was none the worse for being animated by a little triumphant contempt  why you are in better voice than ever caterina said captain wybrow when she had ended this is rather different from miss hibberts small piping that we used to be glad of at farleigh is it not beatrice  indeed it is you are a most enviable creature miss sarticaterinamay i not call you caterina for i have heard anthony speak of you so often i seem to know you quite well you will let me call you caterina  o yes every one calls me caterina only when they call me tina  come come more singing more singing little monkey sir christopher called out from the other side of the room we have not had half enough yet  caterina was ready enough to obey for while she was singing she was queen of the room and miss assher was reduced to grimacing admiration alas you see what jealousy was doing in this poor young soul caterina who had passed her life as a little unobtrusive singingbird nestling so fondly under the wings that were outstretched for her her heart beating only to the peaceful rhythm of love or fluttering with some easily stifled fear had begun to know the fierce palpitations of triumph and hatred  when the singing was over sir christopher and lady cheverel sat down to whist with lady assher and mr gilfil and caterina placed herself at the baronets elbow as if to watch the game that she might not appear to thrust herself on the pair of lovers at first she was glowing with her little triumph and felt the strength of pride but her eye would steal to the opposite side of the fireplace where captain wybrow had seated himself close to miss assher and was leaning with his arm over the back of the chair in the most loverlike position caterina began to feel a choking sensation she could see almost without looking that he was taking up her arm to examine her bracelet their heads were bending close together her curls touching his cheeknow he was putting his lips to her hand caterina felt her cheeks burnshe could sit no longer she got up pretended to be gliding about in search of something and at length slipped out of the room  outside she took a candle and hurrying along the passages and up the stairs to her own room locked the door  o i cannot bear it i cannot bear it the poor thing burst out aloud clasping her little fingers and pressing them back against her forehead as if she wanted to break them  then she walked hurriedly up and down the room  and this must go on for days and days and i must see it  she looked about nervously for something to clutch there was a muslin kerchief lying on the table she took it up and tore it into shreds as she walked up and down and then pressed it into hard balls in her hand  and anthony she thought he can do this without caring for what i feel o he can forget everything how he used to say he loved mehow he used to take my hand in his as we walkedhow he used to stand near me in the evenings for the sake of looking into my eyes  oh it is cruel it is cruel she burst out again aloud as all those lovemoments in the past returned upon her then the tears gushed forth she threw herself on her knees by the bed and sobbed bitterly  she did not know how long she had been there till she was startled by the prayerbell when thinking lady cheverel might perhaps send some one to inquire after her she rose and began hastily to undress that there might be no possibility of her going down again she had hardly unfastened her hair and thrown a loose gown about her before there was a knock at the door and mrs sharps voice saidmiss tina my lady wants to know if youre ill  caterina opened the door and said thank you dear mrs sharp i have a bad headache please tell my lady i felt it come on after singing then goodness me why arnt you in bed istid o standing shivering there fit to catch your death come let me fasten up your hair and tuck you up warm  o no thank you i shall really be in bed very soon goodnight dear sharpy dont scold i will be good and get into bed  caterina kissed her old friend coaxingly but mrs sharp was not to be come over in that way and insisted on seeing her former charge in bed taking away the candle which the poor child had wanted to keep as a companion but it was impossible to lie there long with that beating heart and the little white figure was soon out of bed again seeking relief in the very sense of chill and uncomfort it was light enough for her to see about her room for the moon nearly at full was riding high in the heavens among scattered hurrying clouds caterina drew aside the windowcurtain and sitting with her forehead pressed against the cold pane looked out on the wide stretch of park and lawn  how dreary the moonlight is robbed of all its tenderness and repose by the hard driving wind the trees are harassed by that tossing motion when they would like to be at rest the shivering grass makes her quake with sympathetic cold and the willows by the pool bent low and white under that invisible harshness seem agitated and helpless like herself but she loves the scene the better for its sadness there is some pity in it it is not like that hard unfeeling happiness of lovers flaunting in the eyes of misery  she set her teeth tight against the windowframe and the tears fell thick and fast she was so thankful she could cry for the mad passion she had felt when her eyes were dry frightened her if that dreadful feeling were to come on when lady cheverel was present she should never be able to contain herself  then there was sir christopherso good to herso happy about anthonys marriage and all the while she had these wicked feelings  o i cannot help it i cannot help it she said in a loud whisper between her sobs o god have pity upon me  in this way tina wore out the long hours of the windy moonlight till at last with weary aching limbs she lay down in bed again and slept from mere exhaustion  while this poor little heart was being bruised with a weight too heavy for it nature was holding on her calm inexorable way in unmoved and terrible beauty the stars were rushing in their eternal courses the tides swelled to the level of the last expectant weed the sun was making brilliant day to busy nations on the other side of the swift earth the stream of human thought and deed was hurrying and broadening onward the astronomer was at his telescope the great ships were labouring over the waves the toiling eagerness of commerce the fierce spirit of revolution were only ebbing in brief rest and sleepless statesmen were dreading the possible crisis of the morrow what were our little tina and her trouble in this mighty torrent rushing from one awful unknown to another lighter than the smallest centre of quivering life in the waterdrop hidden and uncared for as the pulse of anguish in the breast of the tiniest bird that has fluttered down to its nest with the longsought food and has found the nest torn and empty     chapter 6   the next morning when caterina was waked from her heavy sleep by martha bringing in the warm water the sun was shining the wind had abated and those hours of suffering in the night seemed unreal and dreamlike in spite of weary limbs and aching eyes she got up and began to dress with a strange feeling of insensibility as if nothing could make her cry again and she even felt a sort of longing to be downstairs in the midst of company that she might get rid of this benumbed condition by contact  there are few of us that are not rather ashamed of our sins and follies as we look out on the blessed morning sunlight which comes to us like a brightwinged angel beckoning us to quit the old path of vanity that stretches its dreary length behind us and tina little as she knew about doctrines and theories seemed to herself to have been both foolish and wicked yesterday today she would try to be good and when she knelt down to say her short prayerthe very form she had learned by heart when she was ten years oldshe added o god help me to bear it  that day the prayer seemed to be answered for after some remarks on her pale looks at breakfast caterina passed the morning quietly miss assher and captain wybrow being out on a riding excursion in the evening there was a dinnerparty and after caterina had sung a little lady cheverel remembering that she was ailing sent her to bed where she soon sank into a deep sleep body and mind must renew their force to suffer as well as to enjoy  on the morrow however it was rainy and every one must stay indoors so it was resolved that the guests should be taken over the house by sir christopher to hear the story of the architectural alterations the family portraits and the family relics all the party except mr gilfil were in the drawingroom when the proposition was made and when miss assher rose to go she looked towards captain wybrow expecting to see him rise too but he kept his seat near the fire turning his eyes towards the newspaper which he had been holding unread in his hand  are you not coming anthony said lady cheverel noticing miss asshers look of expectation  i think not if youll excuse me he answered rising and opening the door i feel a little chilled this morning and i am afraid of the cold rooms and draughts  miss assher reddened but said nothing and passed on lady cheverel accompanying her  caterina was seated at work in the oriel window it was the first time she and anthony had been alone together and she had thought before that he wished to avoid her but now surely he wanted to speak to herhe wanted to say something kind presently he rose from his seat near the fire and placed himself on the ottoman opposite to her  well tina and how have you been all this long time both the tone and the words were an offence to her the tone was so different from the old one the words were so cold and unmeaning she answered with a little bitternessi think you neednt ask it doesnt make much difference to you  is that the kindest thing you have to say to me after my long absence  i dont know why you should expect me to say kind things  captain wybrow was silent he wished very much to avoid allusions to the past or comments on the present and yet he wished to be well with caterina he would have liked to caress her make her presents and have her think him very kind to her but these women are plaguy perverse theres no bringing them to look rationally at anything at last he said i hoped you would think all the better of me tina for doing as i have done instead of bearing malice towards me i hoped you would see that it is the best thing for every onethe best for your happiness too  o pray dont make love to miss assher for the sake of my happiness answered tina  at this moment the door opened and miss assher entered to fetch her reticule which lay on the harpsichord she gave a keen glance at caterina whose face was flushed and saying to captain wybrow with a slight sneer since you are so chill i wonder you like to sit in the window left the room again immediately  the lover did not appear much discomposed but sat quiet a little longer and then seating himself on the musicstool drew it near to caterina and taking her hand said come tina look kindly at me and let us be friends i shall always be your friend  thank you said caterina drawing away her hand you are very generous but pray move away miss assher may come in again  miss assher be hanged said anthony feeling the fascination of old habit returning on him in his proximity to caterina he put his arm round her waist and leaned his cheek down to hers the lips couldnt help meeting after that but the next moment with heart swelling and tears rising caterina burst away from him and rushed out of the room     chapter 7   caterina tore herself from anthony with the desperate effort of one who has just selfrecollection enough left to be conscious that the fumes of charcoal will master his senses unless he bursts a way for himself to the fresh air but when she reached her own room she was still too intoxicated with that momentary revival of old emotions too much agitated by the sudden return of tenderness in her lover to know whether pain or pleasure predominated it was as if a miracle had happened in her little world of feeling and made the future all vaguea dim morning haze of possibilities instead of the sombre wintry daylight and clear rigid outline of painful certainty  she felt the need of rapid movement she must walk out in spite of the rain happily there was a thin place in the curtain of clouds which seemed to promise that now about noon the day had a mind to clear up caterina thought to herself i will walk to the mosslands and carry mr bates the comforter i have made for him and then lady cheverel will not wonder so much at my going out at the hall door she found rupert the old bloodhound stationed on the mat with the determination that the first person who was sensible enough to take a walk that morning should have the honour of his approbation and society as he thrust his great black and tawny head under her hand and wagged his tail with vigorous eloquence and reached the climax of his welcome by jumping up to lick her face which was at a convenient licking height for him caterina felt quite grateful to the old dog for his friendliness animals are such agreeable friendsthey ask no questions they pass no criticisms  the mosslands was a remote part of the grounds encircled by the little stream issuing from the pool and certainly for a wet day caterina could hardly have chosen a less suitable walk for though the rain was abating and presently ceased altogether there was still a smart shower falling from the trees which arched over the greater part of her way but she found just the desired relief from her feverish excitement in labouring along the wet paths with an umbrella that made her arm ache this amount of exertion was to her tiny body what a days hunting often was to mr gilfil who at times had his fits of jealousy and sadness to get rid of and wisely had recourse to natures innocent opiumfatigue  when caterina reached the pretty arched wooden bridge which formed the only entrance to the mosslands for any but webbed feet the sun had mastered the clouds and was shining through the boughs of the tall elms that made a deep nest for the gardeners cottageturning the raindrops into diamonds and inviting the nasturtium flowers creeping over the porch and lowthatched roof to lift up their flamecoloured heads once more the rooks were cawing with manyvoiced monotony apparentlyby a remarkable approximation to human intelligencefinding great conversational resources in the change of weather the mossy turf studded with the broad blades of marshloving plants told that mr batess nest was rather damp in the best of weather but he was of opinion that a little external moisture would hurt no man who was not perversely neglectful of that obvious and providential antidote rumandwater  caterina loved this nest every object in it every sound that haunted it had been familiar to her from the days when she had been carried thither on mr batess arm making little cawing noises to imitate the rooks clapping her hands at the green frogs leaping in the moist grass and fixing grave eyes on the gardeners fowls cluckclucking under their pens and now the spot looked prettier to her than ever it was so out of the way of miss assher with her brilliant beauty and personal claims and small civil remarks she thought mr bates would not be come into his dinner yet so she would sit down and wait for him  but she was mistaken mr bates was seated in his armchair with his pockethandkerchief thrown over his face as the most eligible mode of passing away those superfluous hours between meals when the weather drives a man indoors roused by the furious barking of his chained bulldog he descried his little favourite approaching and forthwith presented himself at the doorway looking disproportionately tall compared with the height of his cottage the bulldog meanwhile unbent from the severity of his official demeanour and commenced a friendly interchange of ideas with rupert  mr batess hair was now grey but his frame was none the less stalwart and his face looked all the redder making an artistic contrast with the deep blue of his cotton neckerchief and of his linen apron twisted into a girdle round his waist  why dang my boottons miss tiny he exclaimed hoo coom ye to coom

small sittingroom and shaking the patchwork cushion in his armchair moved it to within a good roasting distance of the blazing fire  thank you uncle bates caterina kept up her childish epithets for

calling rupert while the good gardener his hands thrust deep in his pockets stood looking after her and shaking his head with rather a melancholy air  she gets moor nesh and dillicat than iver he said half to himself and half to hester i shouldnt woonder if she fades away laike them cyclamens as i transplanted she puts me i maind on em somehow hangin on their little thin stalks so whaite an tinder  the poor little thing made her way back no longer hungering for the cold moist air as a counteractive of inward excitement but with a chill at her heart which made the outward chill only depressing the golden sunlight beamed through the dripping boughs like a shechinah or visible divine presence and the birds were chirping and trilling their new autumnal songs so sweetly it seemed as if their throats as well as the air were all the clearer for the rain but caterina moved through all this joy and beauty like a poor wounded leveret painfully dragging its little body through the sweet clovertuftsfor it sweet in vain mr batess words about sir christophers joy miss asshers beauty and the nearness of the wedding had come upon her like the pressure of a cold hand rousing her from confused dozing to a perception of hard familiar realities it is so with emotional natures whose thoughts are no more than the fleeting shadows cast by feeling to them words are facts and even when known to be false have a mastery over their smiles and tears caterina entered her own room again with no other change from her former state of despondency and wretchedness than an additional sense of injury from anthony his behaviour towards her in the morning was a new wrong to snatch a caress when she justly claimed an expression of penitence of regret of sympathy was to make more light of her than ever     chapter 8   that evening miss assher seemed to carry herself with unusual haughtiness and was coldly observant of caterina there was unmistakably thunder in the air captain wybrow appeared to take the matter very easily and was inclined to brave it out by paying more than ordinary attention to caterina mr gilfil had induced her to play a game at draughts with him lady assher being seated at picquet with sir christopher and miss assher in determined conversation with lady cheverel anthony thus left as an odd unit sauntered up to caterinas chair and leaned behind her watching the game tina with all the remembrances of the morning thick upon her felt her cheeks becoming more and more crimson and at last said impatiently i wish you would go away  this happened directly under the view of miss assher who saw caterinas reddening cheeks saw that she said something impatiently and that captain wybrow moved away in consequence there was another person too who had noticed this incident with strong interest and who was moreover aware that miss assher not only saw but keenly observed what was passing that other person was mr gilfil and he drew some painful conclusions which heightened his anxiety for caterina  the next morning in spite of the fine weather miss assher declined riding and lady cheverel perceiving that there was something wrong between the lovers took care that they should be left together in the drawingroom miss assher seated on the sofa near the fire was busy with some fancywork in which she seemed bent on making great progress this morning captain wybrow sat opposite with a newspaper in his hand from which he obligingly read extracts with an elaborately easy air wilfully unconscious of the contemptuous silence with which she pursued her filigree work at length he put down the paper which he could no longer pretend not to have exhausted and miss assher then saidyou seem to be on very intimate terms with miss sarti  with tina oh yes she has always been the pet of the house you know we have been quite brother and sister together  sisters dont generally colour so very deeply when their brothers approach them  does she colour i never noticed it but shes a timid little thing  it would be much better if you would not be so hypocritical captain wybrow i am confident there has been some flirtation between you miss sarti in her position would never speak to you with the petulance she did last night if you had not given her some kind of claim on you  my dear beatrice now do be reasonable do ask yourself what earthly probability there is that i should think of flirting with poor little tina is there anything about her to attract that sort of attention she is more child than woman one thinks of her as a little girl to be petted and played with  pray what were you playing at with her yesterday morning when i came in unexpectedly and her cheeks were flushed and her hands trembling  yesterday morningo i remember you know i always tease her about gilfil who is over head and ears in love with her and she is angry at thatperhaps because she likes him they were old playfellows years before i came here and sir christopher has set his heart on their marrying  captain wybrow you are very false it had nothing to do with mr gilfil that she coloured last night when you leaned over her chair you might just as well be candid if your own mind is not made up pray do no violence to yourself i am quite ready to give way to miss sartis superior attractions understand that so far as i am concerned you are perfectly at liberty i decline any share in the affection of a man who forfeits my respect by duplicity  in saying this miss assher rose and was sweeping haughtily out of the room when captain wybrow placed himself before her and took her hand dear dear beatrice be patient do not judge me so rashly sit down again sweet he added in a pleading voice pressing both her hands between his and leading her back to the sofa where he sat down beside her miss assher was not unwilling to be led back or to listen but she retained her cold and haughty expression  can you not trust me beatrice can you not believe me although there may be things i am unable to explain  why should there be anything you are unable to explain an honourable man will not be placed in circumstances which he cannot explain to the woman he seeks to make his wife he will not ask her to believe that he acts properly he will let her know that he does so let me go sir  she attempted to rise but he passed his hand round her waist and detained her  now beatrice dear he said imploringly can you not understand that there are things a man doesnt like to talk aboutsecrets that he must keep for the sake of others and not for his own sake everything that relates to myself you may ask me but do not ask me to tell other peoples secrets dont you understand me  o yes said miss assher scornfully i understand whenever you make love to a womanthat is her secret which you are bound to keep for her but it is folly to be talking in this way captain wybrow it is very plain that there is some relation more than friendship between you and miss sarti since you cannot explain that relation there is no more to be said between us  confound it beatrice youll drive me mad can a fellow help a girls falling in love with him such things are always happening but men dont talk of them these fancies will spring up without the slightest foundation especially when a woman sees few people they die out again when there is no encouragement if you could like me you ought not to be surprised that other people can you ought to think the better of them for it  you mean to say then that miss sarti is in love with you without your ever having made love to her  do not press me to say such things dearest it is enough that you know i love youthat i am devoted to you you naughty queen you you know there is no chance for any one else where you are you are only tormenting me to prove your power over me but dont be too cruel for you know they say i have another heartdisease besides love and these scenes bring on terrible palpitations  but i must have an answer to this one question said miss assher a little softened has there been or is there any love on your side towards miss sarti i have nothing to do with her feelings but i have a right to know yours  i like tina very much who would not like such a little simple thing you would not wish me not to like her but lovethat is a very different affair one has a brotherly affection for such a woman as tina but it is another sort of woman that one loves  these last words were made doubly significant by a look of tenderness and a kiss imprinted on the hand captain wybrow held in his miss assher was conquered it was so far from probable that anthony should love that pale insignificant little thingso highly probable that he should adore the beautiful miss assher on the whole it was rather gratifying that other women should be languishing for her handsome lover he really was an exquisite creature poor miss sarti well she would get over it  captain wybrow saw his advantage come sweet love he continued let us talk no more about unpleasant things you will keep tinas secret and be very kind to herwont youfor my sake but you will ride out now see what a glorious day it is for riding let me order the horses im terribly in want of the air come give me one forgiving kiss and say you will go  miss assher complied with the double request and then went to equip herself for the ride while her lover walked to the stables     chapter 9   meanwhile mr gilfil who had a heavy weight on his mind had watched for the moment when the two elder ladies having driven out caterina would probably be alone in lady cheverels sittingroom he went up and knocked at the door  come in said the sweet mellow voice always thrilling to him as the sound of rippling water to the thirsty  he entered and found caterina standing in some confusion as if she had been startled from a reverie she felt relieved when she saw it was maynard but the next moment felt a little pettish that he should have come to interrupt and frighten her  oh it is you maynard do you want lady cheverel  no caterina he answered gravely i want you i have something very particular to say to you will you let me sit down with you for half an hour  yes dear old preacher said caterina sitting down with an air of weariness what is it  mr gilfil placed himself opposite to her and said i hope you will not be hurt caterina by what i am going to say to you i do not speak from any other feelings than real affection and anxiety for you i put everything else out of the question you know you are more to me than all the world but i will not thrust before you a feeling which you are unable to return i speak to you as a brotherthe old maynard that used to scold you for getting your fishingline tangled ten years ago you will not believe that i have any mean selfish motive in mentioning things that are painful to you  no i know you are very good said caterina abstractedly  from what i saw yesterday evening mr gilfil went on hesitating and colouring slightly i am led to fearpray forgive me if i am wrong caterinathat youthat captain wybrow is base enough still to trifle with your feelings that he still allows himself to behave to you as no man ought who is the declared lover of another woman  what do you mean maynard said caterina with anger flashing from her eyes do you mean that i let him make love to me what right have you to think that of me what do you mean that you saw yesterday evening  do not be angry caterina i dont suspect you of doing wrong i only suspect that heartless puppy of behaving so as to keep awake feelings in you that not only destroy your own peace of mind but may lead to very bad consequences with regard to others i want to warn you that miss assher has her eyes open on what passes between you and captain wybrow and i feel sure she is getting jealous of you pray be very careful caterina and try to behave with politeness and indifference to him you must see by this time that he is not worth the feeling you have given him hes more disturbed at his pulse beating one too many in a minute than at all the misery he has caused you by his foolish tritling  you ought not to speak so of him maynard said caterina passionately he is not what you think he did care for me he did love me only he wanted to do what his uncle wished  o to be sure i know it is only from the most virtuous motives that he does what is convenient to himself  mr gilfil paused he felt that he was getting irritated and defeating his own object presently he continued in a calm and affectionate tone  i will say no more about what i think of him caterina but whether he loved you or not his position now with miss assher is such that any love you may cherish for him can bring nothing but misery god knows i dont expect you to leave off loving him at a moments notice time and absence and trying to do what is right are the only cures if it were not that sir christopher and lady cheverel would be displeased and puzzled at your wishing to leave home just now i would beg you to pay a visit to my sister she and her husband are good creatures and would make their house a home to you but i could not urge the thing just now without giving a special reason and what is most of all to be dreaded is the raising of any suspicion in sir christophers mind of what has happened in the past or of your present feelings you think so too dont you tina  mr gilfil paused again but caterina said nothing she was looking away from him out of the window and her eyes were filling with tears he rose and advancing a little towards her held out his hand and said forgive me caterina for intruding on your feelings in this way i was so afraid you might not be aware how miss assher watched you remember i entreat you that the peace of the whole family depends on your power of governing yourself only say you forgive me before i go  dear good maynard she said stretching out her little hand and taking two of his large fingers in her grasp while her tears flowed fast i am very cross to you but my heart is breaking i dont know what i do goodbye  he stooped down kissed the little hand and then left the room  the cursed scoundrel he muttered between his teeth as he closed the door behind him if it were not for sir christopher i should like to pound him into paste to poison puppies like himself     chapter 10   that evening captain wybrow returning from a long ride with miss assher went up to his dressingroom and seated himself with an air of considerable lassitude before his mirror the reflection there presented of his exquisite self was certainly paler and more worn than usual and might excuse the anxiety with which he first felt his pulse and then laid his hand on his heart  its a devil of a position this for a man to be in was the train of his thought as he kept his eyes fixed on the glass while he leaned back in his chair and crossed his hands behind his head between two jealous women and both of them as ready to take fire as tinder and in my state of health too i should be glad enough to run away from the whole affair and go off to some lotoseating place or other where there are no women or only women who are too sleepy to be jealous here am i doing nothing to please myself trying to do the best thing for everybody else and all the comfort i get is to have fire shot at me from womens eyes and venom spirted at me from womens tongues if beatrice takes another jealous fit into her headand its likely enough tina is so unmanageablei dont know what storm she may raise and any hitch in this marriage especially of that sort might be a fatal business for the old gentleman i wouldnt have such a blow fall upon him for a great deal besides a man must be married some time in his life and i could hardly do better than marry beatrice shes an uncommonly fine woman and im really very fond of her and as i shall let her have her own way her temper wont signify much i wish the wedding was over and done with for this fuss doesnt suit me at all i havent been half so well lately that scene about tina this morning quite upset me poor little tina what a little simpleton it was to set her heart on me in that way but she ought to see how impossible it is that things should be different if she would but understand how kindly i feel towards her and make up her mind to look on me as a friendbut that it what one never can get a woman to do beatrice is very goodnatured im sure she would be kind to the little thing it would be a great comfort if tina would take to gilfil if it were only in anger against me hed make her a capital husband and i should like to see the little grasshopper happy if i had been in a different position i would certainly have married her myself hut that was out of the question with my responsibilities to sir christopher i think a little persuasion from my uncle would bring her to accept gilfil i know she would never be able to oppose my uncles wishes and if they were once married shes such a loving little thing she would soon be billing and cooing with him as if she had never known me it would certainly be the best thing for her happiness if that marriage were hastened heigho those are lucky fellows that have no women falling in love with them its a confounded responsibility  at this point in his meditations he turned his head a little so as to get a threequarter view of his face clearly it was the dono infelice della bellezza that laid these onerous duties upon himan idea which naturally suggested that he should ring for his valet  for the next few days however there was such a cessation of threatening symptoms as to allay the anxiety both of captain wybrow and mr gilfil all earthly things have their lull even on nights when the most unappeasable wind is raging there will be a moment of stillness before it crashes among the boughs again and storms against the windows and howls like a thousand lost demons through the keyholes  miss assher appeared to be in the highest goodhumour captain wybrow was more assiduous than usual and was very circumspect in his behaviour to caterina on whom miss assher bestowed unwonted attentions the weather was brilliant there were riding excursions in the mornings and dinnerparties in the evenings consultations in the library between sir christopher and lady assher seemed to be leading to a satisfactory result and it was understood that this visit at cheverel manor would terminate in another fortnight when the preparations for the wedding would be carried forward with all despatch at farleigh the baronet seemed every day more radiant accustomed to view people who entered into his plans by the pleasant light which his own strong will and bright hopefulness were always casting on the future he saw nothing hut personal charms and promising domestic qualities in miss assher whose quickness of eye and taste in externals formed a real ground of sympathy between her and sir christopher lady cheverels enthusiasm never rose above the temperate mark of calm satisfaction and having quite her share of the critical acumen which characterizes the mutual estimates of the fair sex she had a more moderate opinion of miss asshers qualities she suspected that the fair beatrice had a sharp and imperious temper and being herself on principle and by habitual selfcommand the most deferential of wives she noticed with disapproval miss asshers occasional air of authority towards captain wybrow a proud woman who has learned to submit carries all her pride to the reinforcement of her submission and looks down with severe superiority on all feminine assumption as unbecoming lady cheverel however confined her criticisms to the privacy of her own thoughts and with a reticence which i fear may seem incredible did not use them as a means of disturbing her husbands complacency  and caterina how did she pass these sunny autumn days in which the skies seemed to be smiling on the family gladness to her the change in miss asshers manner was unaccountable those compassionate attentions those smiling condescensions were torture to caterina who was constantly tempted to repulse them with anger she thought perhaps anthony has told her to be kind to poor tina this was an insult he ought to have known that the mere presence of miss assher was painful to her that miss asshers smiles scorched her that miss asshers kind words were like poison stings inflaming her to madness and heanthony he was evidently repenting of the tenderness he had been betrayed into that morning in the drawingroom he was cold and distant and civil to her to ward off beatrices suspicions and beatrice could be so gracious now because she was sure of anthonys entire devotion well and so it ought to beand she ought not to wish it otherwise and yetoh he was cruel to her she could never have behaved so to him to make her love him soto speak such tender wordsto give her such caresses and then to behave as if such things had never been he had given her the poison that seemed so sweet while she was drinking it and now it was in her blood and she was helpless  with this tempest pent up in her bosom the poor child went up to her room every night and there it all burst forth there with loud whispers and sobs restlessly pacing up and down lying on the hard floor courting cold and weariness she told to the pitiful listening night the anguish which she could pour into no mortal ear but always sleep came at last and always in the morning the reactive calm that enabled her to live through the day  it is amazing how long a young frame will go on battling with this sort of secret wretchedness and yet show no traces of the conflict for any but sympathetic eyes the very delicacy of caterinas usual appearance her natural paleness and habitually quiet mouselike ways made any symptoms of fatigue and suffering less noticeable and her singingthe one thing in which she ceased to be passive and became prominentlost none of its energy she herself sometimes wondered how it was that whether she felt sad or angry crushed with the sense of anthonys indifference or burning with impatience under miss asshers attentions it was always a relief to her to sing those full deep notes she sent forth seemed to be lifting the pain from her heartseemed to be carrying away the madness from her brain  thus lady cheverel noticed no change in caterina and it was only mr gilfil who discerned with anxiety the feverish spot that sometimes rose on her cheek the deepening violet tint under her eyes and the strange absent glance the unhealthy glitter of the beautiful eyes themselves but those agitated nights were producing a more fatal effect than was represented by these slight outward changes     chapter 11   the following sunday the morning being rainy it was determined that the family should not go to cumbermoor church as usual but that mr gilfil who had only an afternoon service at his curacy should conduct the morning service in the chapel  just before the appointed hour of eleven caterina came down into the drawingroom looking so unusually ill as to call forth an anxious inquiry from lady cheverel who on learning that she had a severe headache insisted that she should not attend service and at once packed her up comfortably on a sofa near the fire putting a volume of tillotsons sermons into her handsas appropriate reading if caterina should feel equal to that means of edification  excellent medicine for the mind are the good archbishops sermons but a medicine unhappily not suited to tinas case she sat with the book open on her knees her dark eyes fixed vacantly on the portrait of that handsome lady cheverel wife of the notable sir anthony she gazed at the picture without thinking of it and the fair blonde dame seemed to look down on her with that benignant unconcern that mild wonder with which happy selfpossessed women are apt to look down on their agitated and weaker sisters  caterina was thinking of the near futureof the wedding that was so soon to comeof all she would have to live through in the next months  i wish i could be very ill and die before then she thought when people get very ill they dont mind about things poor patty richards looked so happy when she was in a decline she didnt seem to care any more about her lover that she was engaged to be married to and she liked the smell of the flowers so that i used to take her o if i could but like anythingif i could but think about anything else if these dreadful feelings would go away i wouldnt mind about not being happy i wouldnt want anythingand i could do what would please sir christopher and lady cheverel but when that rage and anger comes into me i dont know what to do i dont feel the ground under me i only feel my head and heart beating and it seems as if i must do something dreadful o i wonder if any one ever felt like me before i must be very wicked but god will have pity on me he knows all i have to bear  in this way the time wore on till tina heard the sound of voices along the passage and became conscious that the volume of tillotson had slipped on the floor she had only just picked it up and seen with alarm that the pages were bent when lady assher beatrice and captain wybrow entered all with that brisk and cheerful air which a sermon is often observed to produce when it is quite finished  lady assher at once came and seated herself by caterina her ladyship had been considerably refreshed by a doze and was in great force for monologue  well my dear miss sarti and how do you feel nowa little better i see i thought you would be sitting quietly here these headaches now are all from weakness you must not overexert yourself and you must take bitters i used to have just the same sort of headaches when i was your age and old dr samson used to say to my mother madam what your daughter suffers from is weakness he was such a curious old man was dr samson but i wish you could have heard the sermon this morning such an excellent sermon it was about the ten virgins five of them were foolish and five were clever you know and mr gilfil explained all that what a very pleasant young man he is so very quiet and agreeable and such a good hand at whist i wish we had him at farleigh sir john would have liked him beyond anything he is so goodtempered at cards and he was such a man for cards was sir john and our rector is a very irritable man he cant bear to lose his money at cards i dont think a clergyman ought to mind about losing his money do youdo you now  o pray lady assher interposed beatrice in her usual tone of superiority do not weary poor caterina with such uninteresting questions your head seems very bad still dear she continued in a condoling tone to caterina do take my vinaigrette and keep it in your pocket it will perhaps refresh you now and then  no thank you answered caterina i will not take it away from you  indeed dear i never use it you must take it miss assher persisted holding it close to tinas hand tina coloured deeply pushed the vinaigrette away with some impatience and said thank you i never use those things i dont like vinaigrettes  miss assher returned the vinaigrette to her pocket in surprise and haughty silence and captain wybrow who had looked on in some alarm said hastily see it is quite bright out of doors now there is time for a walk before luncheon come beatrice put on your hat and cloak and let us have half an hours walk on the gravel  yes do my dear said lady assher and i will go and see if sir christopher is having his walk in the gallery  as soon as the door had closed behind the two ladies captain wybrow standing with his back to the fire turned towards caterina and said in a tone of earnest remonstrance my dear caterina let me beg of you to exercise more control over your feelings you are really rude to miss assher and i can see that she is quite hurt consider how strange your behaviour must appear to her she will wonder what can be the cause of it come dear tina he added approaching her and attempting to take her hand for your own sake let me entreat you to receive her attentions politely she really feels very kindly towards you and i should be so happy to see you friends  caterina was already in such a state of diseased susceptibility that the most innocent words from captain wybrow would have been irritating to her as the whirr of the most delicate wing will afflict a nervous patient but this tone of benevolent remonstrance was intolerable he had inflicted a great and unrepented injury on her and now he assumed an air of benevolence towards her this was a new outrage his profession of goodwill was insolence  caterina snatched away her hand and said indignantly leave me to myself captain wybrow i do not disturb you  caterina why will you be so violentso unjust to me it is for you that i feel anxious miss assher has already noticed how strange your behaviour is both to her and me and it puts me into a very difficult position what can i say to her  say caterina burst forth with intense bitterness rising and moving towards the door say that i am a poor silly girl and have fallen in love with you and am jealous of her but that you have never had any feeling but pity for meyou have never behaved with anything more than friendliness to me tell her that and she will think all the better of you  tina uttered this as the bitterest sarcasm her ideas would furnish her with not having the faintest suspicion that the sarcasm derived any of its bitterness from truth underneath all her sense of wrong which was rather instinctive than reflectiveunderneath all the madness of her jealousy and her ungovernable impulses of resentment and vindictivenessunderneath all this scorching passion there were still left some hidden crystal dews of trust of selfreproof of belief that anthony was trying to do the right love had not all gone to feed the fires of hatred tina still trusted that anthony felt more for her than he seemed to feel she was still far from suspecting him of a wrong which a woman resents even more than inconstancy and she threw out this taunt simply as the most intense expression she could find for the anger of the moment  as she stood nearly in the middle of the room her little body trembling under the shock of passions too strong for it her very lips pale and her eyes gleaming the door opened and miss assher appeared tall blooming and splendid in her walking costume as she entered her face wore the smile appropriate to the exits and entrances of a young lady who feels that her presence is an interesting fact but the next moment she looked at caterina with grave surprise and then threw a glance of angry suspicion at captain wybrow who wore an air of weariness and vexation  perhaps you are too much engaged to walk out captain wybrow i will go alone  no no i am coming he answered hurrying towards her and leading her out of the room leaving poor caterina to feel all the reaction of shame and selfreproach after her outburst of passion     chapter 12   pray what is likely to be the next scene in the drama between you and miss sarti said miss assher to captain wybrow as soon as they were out on the gravel it would be agreeable to have some idea of what is coming  captain wybrow was silent he felt out of humour wearied annoyed there come moments when one almost determines never again to oppose anything but dead silence to an angry woman now then confound it he said to himself im going to be battered on the other flank he looked resolutely at the horizon with something more like a frown on his face than beatrice had ever seen there  after a pause of two or three minutes she continued in a still haughtier tone i suppose you are aware captain wybrow that i expect an explanation of what i have just seen  i have no explanation my dear beatrice he answered at last making a strong effort over himself except what i have already given you i hoped you would never recur to the subject  your explanation however is very far from satisfactory i can only say that the airs miss sarti thinks herself entitled to put on towards you are quite incompatible with your position as regards me and her behaviour to me is most insulting i shall certainly not stay in the house under such circumstances and mamma must state the reasons to sir christopher  beatrice said captain wybrow his irritation giving way to alarm i beseech you to be patient and exercise your good feelings in this affair it is very painful i know but i am sure you would be grieved to injure poor caterinato bring down my uncles anger upon her consider what a poor little dependent thing she is  it is very adroit of you to make these evasions but do not suppose that they deceive me miss sarti would never dare to behave to you as she does if you had not flirted with her or made love to her i suppose she considers your engagement to me a breach of faith to her i am much obliged to you certainly for making me miss sartis rival you have told me a falsehood captain wybrow  beatrice i solemnly declare to you that caterina is nothing more to me than a girl i naturally feel kindly toas a favourite of my uncles and a nice little thing enough i should be glad to see her married to gilfil tomorrow thats a good proof that im not in love with her i should think as to the past i may have shown her little attentions which she has exaggerated and misinterpreted what man is not liable to that sort of thing  but what can she found her behaviour on what had she been saying to you this morning to make her tremble and turn pale in that way  o i dont know i just said something about her behaving peevishly with that italian blood of hers theres no knowing how she may take what one says shes a fierce little thing though she seems so quiet generally  but she ought to be made to know how unbecoming and indelicate her conduct is for my part i wonder lady cheverel has not noticed her short answers and the airs she puts on  let me beg of you beatrice not to hint anything of the kind to lady cheverel you must have observed how strict my aunt is it never enters her head that a girl can be in love with a man who has not made her an offer  well i shall let miss sarti know myself that i have observed her conduct it will be only a charity to her  nay dear that will be doing nothing but harm caterinas temper is peculiar the best thing you can do will be to leave her to herself as much as possible it will all wear off ive no doubt shell be married to gilfil before long girls fancies are easily diverted from one object to another by jove what a rate my heart is galloping at these confounded palpitations get worse instead of better  thus ended the conversation so far as it concerned caterina not without leaving a distinct resolution in captain wybrows minda resolution carried into effect the next day when he was in the library with sir christopher for the purpose of discussing some arrangements about the approaching marriage  by the by he said carelessly when the business came to a pause and he was sauntering round the room with his hands in his coatpockets surveying the backs of the books that lined the walls when is the wedding between gilfil and caterina to come off sir ive a fellowfeeling for a poor devil so many fathoms deep in love as maynard why shouldnt their marriage happen as soon as ours i suppose he has come to an understanding with tina  why said sir christopher i did think of letting the thing be until old crichley died he cant hold out very long poor fellow and then maynard might have entered into matrimony and the rectory both at once but after all that really is no good reason for waiting there is no need for them to leave the manor when they are married the little monkey is quite old enough it would be pretty to see her a matron with a baby about the size of a kitten in her arms  i think that system of waiting is always bad and if i can further any settlement you would like to make on caterina i shall be delighted to carry out your wishes  my dear boy thats very good of you but maynard will have enough and from what i know of himand i know him welli think he would rather provide for caterina himself however now you have put this matter into my head i begin to blame myself for not having thought of it before ive been so wrapt up in beatrice and you you rascal that i had really forgotten poor maynard and hes older than youits high time he was settled in life as a family man  sir christopher paused took snuff in a meditative manner and presently said more to himself than to anthony who was humming a tune at the far end of the room yes yes it will be a capital plan to finish off all our family business at once  riding out with miss assher the same morning captain wybrow mentioned to her incidentally that sir christopher was anxious to bring about the wedding between gilfil and caterina as soon as possible and that he for his part should do all he could to further the affair it would be the best thing in the world for tina in whose welfare he was really interested  with sir christopher there was never any long interval between purpose and execution he made up his mind promptly and he acted promptly on rising from luncheon he said to mr gilfil come with me into the library maynard i want to have a word with you  maynard my boy he began as soon as they were seated tapping his snuffbox and looking radiant at the idea of the unexpected pleasure he was about to give why shouldnt we have two happy couples instead of one before the autumn is over eh  eh he repeated after a moments pause lengthening out the monosyllable taking a slow pinch and looking up at maynard with a sly smile  im not quite sure that i understand you sir answered mr gilfil who felt annoyed at the consciousness that he was turning pale  not understand me you rogue you know very well whose happiness lies nearest to my heart after anthonys you know you let me into your secrets long ago so theres no confession to make tinas quite old enough to be a grave little wife now and though the rectorys not ready for you thats no matter my lady and i shall feel all the more comfortable for having you with us we should miss our little singingbird if we lost her all at once  mr gilfil felt himself in a painfully difficult position he dreaded that sir christopher should surmise or discover the true state of caterinas feelings and yet he was obliged to make those feelings the ground of his reply  my dear sir he at last said with some effort you will not suppose that i am not alive to your goodnessthat i am not grateful for your fatherly interest in my happiness but i fear that caterinas feelings towards me are not such as to warrant the hope that she would accept a proposal of marriage from me  have you ever asked her  no sir but we often know these things too well without asking  pooh pooh the little monkey must love you why you were her first playfellow and i remember she used to cry if you cut your finger besides she has always silently admitted that you were her lover you know i have always spoken of you to her in that light i took it for granted you had settled the business between yourselves so did anthony anthony thinks shes in love with you and he has young eyes which are apt enough to see clearly in these matters he was talking to me about it this morning and pleased me very much by the friendly interest he showed in you and tina  the bloodmore than was wantedrushed back to mr gilfils face he set his teeth and clenched his hands in the effort to repress a burst of indignation sir christopher noticed the flush but thought it indicated the fluctuation of hope and fear about caterina he went onyoure too modest by half maynard a fellow who can take a fivebarred gate as you can ought not to be so fainthearted if you cant speak to her yourself leave me to talk to her  sir christopher said poor maynard earnestly i shall really feel it the greatest kindness you can possibly show me not to mention this subject to caterina at present i think such a proposal made prematurely might only alienate her from me  sir christopher was getting a little displeased at this contradiction his tone became a little sharper as he said have you any grounds to state for this opinion beyond your general notion that tina is not enough in love with you  i can state none beyond my own very strong impression that she does not love me well enough to marry me  then i think that ground is worth nothing at all i am tolerably correct in my judgement of people and if i am not very much deceived in tina she looks forward to nothing else but to your being her husband leave me to manage the matter as i think best you may rely on me that i shall do no harm to your cause maynard  mr gilfil afraid to say more yet wretched in the prospect of what might result from sir christophers determination quitted the library in a state of mingled indignation against captain wybrow and distress for himself and caterina what would she think of him she might suppose that he had instigated or sanctioned sir christophers proceeding he should perhaps not have an opportunity of speaking to her on the subject in time he would write her a note and carry it up to her room after the dressingbell had rung no that would agitate her and unfit her for appearing at dinner and passing the evening calmly he would defer it till bedtime after prayers he contrived to lead her back to the drawingroom and to put a letter in her hand she carried it up to her own room wondering and there read  dear caterina do not suspect for a moment that anything sir christopher may say to you about our marriage has been prompted by me i have done all i dare do to dissuade him from urging the subject and have only been prevented from speaking more strongly by the dread of provoking questions which i could not answer without causing you fresh misery i write this both to prepare you for anything sir christopher may say and to assure youbut i hope you already believe itthat your feelings are sacred to me i would rather part with the dearest hope of my life than be the means of adding to your trouble  it is captain wybrow who has prompted sir christopher to take up the subject at this moment i tell you this to save you from hearing it suddenly when you are with sir christopher you see now what sort of stuff that dastards heart is made of trust in me always dearest caterina aswhatever may comeyour faithful friend and brother  maynard gilfil  caterina was at first too terribly stung by the words about captain wybrow to think of the difficulty which threatened herto think either of what sir christopher would say to her or of what she could say in reply bitter sense of injury fierce resentment left no room for fear with the poisoned garment upon him the victim writhes under the torturehe has no thought of the coming death  anthony could do thisof this there could be no explanation but the coolest contempt for her feelings the basest sacrifice of all the consideration and tenderness he owed her to the ease of his position with miss assher no it was worse than that it was deliberate gratuitous cruelty he wanted to show her how he despised her he wanted to make her feel her folly in having ever believed that he loved her  the last crystal drops of trust and tenderness she thought were dried up all was parched fiery hatred now she need no longer check her resentment by the fear of doing him an injustice he had trifled with her as maynard had said he had been reckless of her and now he was base and cruel she had cause enough for her bitterness and anger they were not so wicked as they had seemed to her  as these thoughts were hurrying after each other like so many sharp throbs of fevered pain she shed no tear she paced restlessly to and fro as her habit washer hands clenched her eyes gleaming fiercely and wandering uneasily as if in search of something on which she might throw herself like a tigress  if i could speak to him she whispered and tell him i hate him i despise him i loathe him  suddenly as if a new thought had struck her she drew a key from her pocket and unlocking an inlaid desk where she stored up her keepsakes took from it a small miniature it was in a very slight gold frame with a ring to it as if intended to be worn on a chain and under the glass at the back were two locks of hair one dark and the other auburn arranged in a fantastic knot it was anthonys secret present to her a year ago a copy he had had made specially for her for the last month she had not taken it from its hidingplace there was no need to heighten the vividness of the past but now she clutched it fiercely and dashed it across the room against the bare hearthstone  will she crush it under her feet and grind it under her highheeled shoe till every trace of those false cruel features is gone ah no she rushed across the room but when she saw the little treasure she had cherished so fondly so often smothered with kisses so often laid under her pillow and remembered with the first return of consciousness in the morningwhen she saw this one visible relic of the too happy past lying with the glass shivered the hair fallen out the thin ivory cracked there was a revulsion of the overstrained feeling relenting came and she burst into tears  look at her stooping down to gather up her treasure searching for the hair and replacing it and then mournfully examining the crack that disfigures the onceloved image alas there is no glass now to guard either the hair or the portrait but see how carefully she wraps delicate paper round it and locks it up again in its old place poor child god send the relenting may always come before the worst irrevocable deed  this action had quieted her and she sat down to read maynards letter again she read it two or three times without seeming to take in the sense her apprehension was dulled by the passion of the last hour and she found it difficult to call up the ideas suggested by the words at last she began to have a distinct conception of the impending interview with sir christopher the idea of displeasing the baronet of whom every one at the manor stood in awe frightened her so much that she thought it would be impossible to resist his wish he believed that she loved maynard he had always spoken as if he were quite sure of it how could she tell him he was deceivedand what if he were to ask her whether she loved anybody else to have sir christopher looking angrily at her was more than she could bear even in imagination he had always been so good to her then she began to think of the pain she might give him and the more selfish distress of fear gave way to the distress of affection unselfish tears began to flow and sorrowful gratitude to sir christopher helped to awaken her sensibility to mr gilfils tenderness and generosity  dear good maynardwhat a poor return i make him if i could but have loved him insteadbut i can never love or care for anything again my heart is broken     chapter 13   the next morning the dreaded moment came caterina stupified by the suffering of the previous night with that dull mental aching which follows on acute anguish was in lady cheverels sittingroom copying out some charity lists when her ladyship came in and saidtina sir christopher wants you go down into the library  she went down trembling as soon as she entered sir christopher who was seated near his writingtable said now little monkey come and sit down by me i have something to tell you  caterina took a footstool and seated herself on it at the baronets feet it was her habit to sit on these low stools and in this way she could hide her face better she put her little arm round his leg and leaned her cheek against his knee  why you seem out of spirits this morning tina whats the matter eh  nothing padroncello only my head is bad  poor monkey well now wouldnt it do the head good if i were to promise you a good husband and smart little weddinggowns and byandby a house of your own where you would be a little mistress and padroncello would come and see you sometimes  o no no i shouldnt like ever to be married let me always stay with you  pooh pooh little simpleton i shall get old and tiresome and there will be anthonys children putting your nose out of joint you will want some one to love you best of all and you must have children of your own to love i cant have you withering away into an old maid i hate old maids they make me dismal to look at them i never see sharp without shuddering my little blackeyed monkey was never meant for anything so ugly and theres maynard gilfil the best man in the county worth his weight in gold heavy as he is he loves you better than his eyes and you love him too you silly monkey whatever you may say about not being married  no no dear padroncello do not say so i could not marry him  why not you foolish child you dont know your own mind why it is plain to everybody that you love him my lady has all along said she was sure you loved himshe has seen what little princess airs you put on to him and anthony too he thinks you are in love with gilfil come what has made you take it into your head that you wouldnt like to marry him  caterina was now sobbing too deeply to make any answer sir christopher patted her on the back and said come come why tina you are not well this morning go and rest little one you will see things in quite another light when you are well think over what i have said and remember there is nothing after anthonys marriage that i have set my heart on so much as seeing you and maynard settled for life i must have no whims and folliesno nonsense this was said with a slight severity but he presently added in a soothing tone there there stop crying and be a good little monkey go and lie down and get to sleep  caterina slipped from the stool on to her knees took the old baronets hand covered it with tears and kisses and then ran out of the room  before the evening captain wybrow had heard from his uncle the result of the interview with caterina he thought if i could have a long quiet talk with her i could perhaps persuade her to look more reasonably at things but theres no speaking to her in the house without being interrupted and i can hardly see her anywhere else without beatrices finding it out at last he determined to make it a matter of confidence with miss assherto tell her that he wished to talk to caterina quietly for the sake of bringing her to a calmer state of mind and persuade her to listen to gilfils affection he was very much pleased with this judicious and candid plan and in the course of the evening he had arranged with himself the time and place of meeting and had communicated his purpose to miss assher who gave her entire approval anthony she thought would do well to speak plainly and seriously to miss sarti he was really very patient and kind to her considering how she behaved  tina had kept her room all that day and had been carefully tended as an invalid sir christopher having told her ladyship how matters stood this tendance was so irksome to caterina she felt so uneasy under attentions and kindness that were based on a misconception that she exerted herself to appear at breakfast the next morning and declared herself well though head and heart were throbbing to be confined in her own room was intolerable it was wretched enough to be looked at and spoken to but it was more wretched to be left alone she was frightened at her own sensations she was frightened at the imperious vividness with which pictures of the past and future thrust themselves on her imagination and there was another feeling too which made her want to be downstairs and moving about perhaps she might have an opportunity of speaking to captain wybrow aloneof speaking those words of hatred and scorn that burned on her tongue that opportunity offered itself in a very unexpected manner  lady cheverel having sent caterina out of the drawingroom to fetch some patterns of embroidery from her sittingroom captain wybrow presently walked out after her and met her as she was returning down stairs  caterina he said laying his hand on her arm as she was hurrying on without looking at him will you meet me in the rookery at twelve oclock i must speak to you and we shall be in privacy there i cannot speak to you in the house  to his surprise there was a flash of pleasure across her face she answered shortly and decidedly yes then snatched her arm away from him and passed down stairs  miss assher was this morning busy winding silks being bent on emulating lady cheverels embroidery and lady assher chose the passive amusement of holding the skeins lady cheverel had now all her working apparatus about her and caterina thinking she was not wanted went away and sat down to the harpsichord in the sittingroom it seemed as if playing massive chordsbringing out volumes of sound would be the easiest way of passing the long feverish moments before twelve oclock handels messiah stood open on the desk at the chorus all we like sheep and caterina threw herself at once into the impetuous intricacies of that magnificent fugue in her happiest moments she could never have played it so well for now all the passion that made her misery was hurled by a convulsive effort into her music just as pain gives new force to the clutch of the sinking wrestler and as terror gives farsounding intensity to the shriek of the feeble  but at halfpast eleven she was interrupted by lady cheverel who said tina go down will you and hold miss asshers silks for her lady assher and i have decided on having our drive before luncheon  caterina went down wondering how she should escape from the drawingroom in time to be in the rookery at twelve nothing should prevent her from going nothing should rob her of this one precious momentperhaps the lastwhen she could speak out the thoughts that were in her after that she would be passive she would bear anything  but she had scarcely sat down with a skein of yellow silk on her hands when miss assher said graciouslyi know you have an engagement with captain wybrow this morning you must not let me detain you beyond the time  so he has been talking to her about me thought caterina her hands began to tremble as she held the skein  miss assher continued in the same gracious tone it is tedious work holding these skeins i am sure i am very much obliged to you  no you are not obliged to me said caterina completely mastered by her irritation i have only done it because lady cheverel told me  the moment was come when miss assher could no longer suppress her long latent desire to let miss sarti know the impropriety of her conduct with the malicious anger that assumes the tone of compassion she said miss sarti i am really sorry for you that you are not able to control yourself better this giving way to unwarrantable feelings is lowering youit is indeed  what unwarrantable feelings said caterina letting her hands fall and fixing her great dark eyes steadily on miss assher it is quite unnecessary for me to say more you must be conscious what i mean only summon a sense of duty to your aid you are paining captain wybrow extremely by your want of selfcontrol  did he tell you i pained him  yes indeed he did he is very much hurt that you should behave to me as if you had a sort of enmity towards me he would like you to make a friend of me i assure you we both feel very kindly towards you and are sorry you should cherish such feelings  he is very good said caterina bitterly what feelings did he say i cherished  this bitter tone increased miss asshers irritation there was still a lurking suspicion in her mind though she would not admit it to herself that captain wybrow had told her a falsehood about his conduct and feelings towards caterina it was this suspicion more even than the anger of the moment which urged her to say something that would test the truth of his statement that she would be humiliating caterina at the same time was only an additional temptation  these are things i do not like to talk of miss sarti i cannot even understand how a woman can indulge a passion for a man who has never given her the least ground for it as captain wybrow assures me is the case  he told you that did he said caterina in clear low tones her lips turning white as she rose from her chair  yes indeed he did he was bound to tell it me after your strange behaviour  caterina said nothing but turned round suddenly and left the room  see how she rushes noiselessly like a pale meteor along the passages and up the gallery stairs those gleaming eyes those bloodless lips that swift silent tread make her look like the incarnation of a fierce purpose rather than a woman the midday sun is shining on the armour in the gallery making mimic suns on bossed swordhilts and the angles of polished breastplates yes there are sharp weapons in the gallery there is a dagger in that cabinet she knows it well and as a dragonfly wheels in its flight to alight for an instant on a leaf she darts to the cabinet takes out the dagger and thrusts it into her pocket in three minutes more she is out in hat and cloak on the gravelwalk hurrying along towards the thick shades of the distant rookery she threads the windings of the plantations not feeling the golden leaves that rain upon her not feeling the earth beneath her feet her hand is in her pocket clenching the handle of the dagger which she holds half out of its sheath  she has reached the rookery and is under the gloom of the interlacing boughs her heart throbs as if it would burst her bosomas if every next leap must be its last wait wait o hearttill she has done this one deed he will be therehe will be before her in a moment he will come towards her with that false smile thinking she does not know his basenessshe will plunge that dagger into his heart  poor child poor child she who used to cry to have the fish put back into the waterwho never willingly killed the smallest living thingdreams now in the madness of her passion that she can kill the man whose very voice unnerves her  but what is that lying among the dank leaves on the path three yards before her  good god it is helying motionlesshis hat fallen off he is ill thenhe has fainted her hand lets go the dagger and she rushes towards him his eyes are fixed he does not see her she sinks down on her knees takes the dear head in her arms and kisses the cold forehead  anthony anthony speak to meit is tinaspeak to me o god he is dead     chapter 14   yes maynard said sir christopher chatting with mr gilfil in the library it really is a remarkable thing that i never in my life laid a plan and failed to carry it out i lay my plans well and i never swerve from themthats it a strong will is the only magic and next to striking out ones plans the pleasantest thing in the world is to see them well accomplished this year now will be the happiest of my life all but the year 53 when i came into possession of the manor and married henrietta the last touch is given to the old house anthonys marriagethe thing i had nearest my heartis settled to my entire satisfaction and byandby you will be buying a little weddingring for tinas finger dont shake your head in that forlorn waywhen i make prophecies they generally come to pass but theres a quarter after twelve striking i must be riding to the high ash to meet markham about felling some timber my old oaks will have to groan for this wedding but  the door burst open and caterina ghastly and panting her eyes distended with terror rushed in threw her arms round sir christophers neck and gasping outanthony  the rookery  dead  in the rookery fell fainting on the floor  in a moment sir christopher was out of the room and mr gilfil was bending to raise caterina in his arms as he lifted her from the ground he felt something hard and heavy in her pocket what could it be the weight of it would be enough to hurt her as she lay he carried her to the sofa put his hand in her pocket and drew forth the dagger  maynard shuddered did she mean to kill herself then or  or  a horrible suspicion forced itself upon him deadin the rookery he hated himself for the thought that prompted him to draw the dagger from its sheath no there was no trace of blood and he was ready to kiss the good steel for its innocence he thrust the weapon into his own pocket he would restore it as soon as possible to its wellknown place in the gallery yet why had caterina taken this dagger what was it that had happened in the rookery was it only a delirious vision of hers  he was afraid to ringafraid to summon any one to caterinas assistance what might she not say when she awoke from this fainting fit she might be raving he could not leave her and yet he felt as if he were guilty for not following sir christopher to see what was the truth it took but a moment to think and feel all this but that moment seemed such a long agony to him that he began to reproach himself for letting it pass without seeking some means of reviving caterina happily the decanter of water on sir christophers table was untouched he would at least try the effect of throwing that water over her she might revive without his needing to call any one else meanwhile sir christopher was hurrying at his utmost speed towards the rookery his face so lately bright and confident now agitated by a vague dread the deep alarmed bark of rupert who ran by his side had struck the ear of mr bates then on his way homeward as something unwonted and hastening in the direction of the sound he met the baronet just as he was approaching the entrance of the rookery sir christophers look was enough mr bates said nothing but hurried along by his side while rupert dashed forward among the dead leaves with his nose to the ground they had scarcely lost sight of him a minute when a change in the tone of his bark told them that he had found something and in another instant he was leaping back over one of the large planted mounds they turned aside to ascend the mound rupert leading them the tumultuous cawing of the rooks the very rustling of the leaves as their feet plunged among them falling like an evil omen on the baronets ear  they had reached the summit of the mound and had begun to descend sir christopher saw something purple down on the path below among the yellow leaves rupert was already beside it but sir christopher could not move faster a tremor had taken hold of the firm limbs rupert came back and licked the trembling hand as if to say courage and then was down again snuffing the body yes it was a body  anthonys body there was the white hand with its diamondring clutching the dark leaves his eyes were half open but did not heed the gleam of sunlight that darted itself directly on them from between the boughs  still he might only have fainted it might only be a fit sir christopher knelt down unfastened the cravat unfastened the waistcoat and laid his hand on the heart it might be syncope it might notit could not be death no that thought must be kept far off  go bates get help well carry him to your cottage send some one to the house to tell mr gilfil and warren bid them send off for doctor hart and break it to my lady and miss assher that anthony is ill  mr bates hastened away and the baronet was left alone kneeling beside the body the young and supple limbs the rounded cheeks the delicate ripe lips the smooth white hands were lying cold and rigid and the aged face was bending over them in silent anguish the aged deepveined hands were seeking with tremulous inquiring touches for some symptom that life was not irrevocably gone  rupert was there too waiting and watching licking first the dead and then the living hands then running off on mr batess track as if he would follow and hasten his return but in a moment turning back again unable to quit the scene of his masters sorrow     chapter 15   it is a wonderful moment the first time we stand by one who has fainted and witness the fresh birth of consciousness spreading itself over the blank features like the rising sunlight on the alpine summits that lay ghastly and dead under the leaden twilight a slight shudder and the frostbound eyes recover their liquid light for an instant they show the inward semiconsciousness of an infants then with a little start they open wider and begin to look the present is visible but only as a strange writing and the interpreter memory is not yet there  mr gilfil felt a trembling joy as this change passed over caterinas face he bent over her rubbing her chill hands and looking at her with tender pity as her dark eyes opened on him wonderingly he thought there might be some wine in the diningroom close by he left the room and caterinas eyes turned towards the windowtowards sir christophers chair there was the link at which the chain of consciousness had snapped and the events of the morning were beginning to recur dimly like a halfremembered dream when maynard returned with some wine he raised her and she drank it but still she was silent seeming lost in the attempt to recover the past when the door opened and mr warren appeared with looks that announced terrible tidings mr gilfil dreading lest he should tell them in caterinas presence hurried towards him with his finger on his lips and drew him away into the diningroom on the opposite side of the passage  caterina revived by the stimulant was now recovering the full consciousness of the scene in the rookery anthony was lying there dead she had left him to tell sir christopher she must go and see what they were doing with him perhaps he was not really deadonly in a trance people did fall into trances sometimes while mr gilfil was telling warren how it would be best to break the news to lady cheverel and miss assher anxious himself to return to caterina the poor child had made her way feebly to the great entrancedoor which stood open her strength increased as she moved and breathed the fresh air and with every increase of strength came increased vividness of emotion increased yearning to be where her thought wasin the rookery with anthony she walked more and more swiftly and at last gathering the artificial strength of passionate excitement began to run  but now she heard the tread of heavy steps and under the yellow shade near the wooden bridge she saw men slowly carrying something soon she was face to face with them anthony was no longer in the rookery they were carrying him stretched on a door and there behind him was sir christopher with the firmlyset mouth the deathly paleness and the concentrated expression of suffering in the eye which mark the suppressed grief of the strong man the sight of this face on which caterina had never before beheld the signs of anguish caused a rush of new feeling which for the moment submerged all the rest she went gently up to him put her little hand in his and walked in silence by his side sir christopher could not tell her to leave him and so she went on with that sad procession to mr batess cottage in the mosslands and sat there in silence waiting and watching to know if anthony were really dead she had not yet missed the dagger from her pocket she had not yet even thought of it at the sight of anthony lying dead her nature had rebounded from its new bias of resentment and hatred to the old sweet habit of love the earliest and the longest has still the mastery over us and the only past that linked itself with those glazed unconscious eyes was the past when they beamed on her with tenderness she forgot the interval of wrong and jealousy and hatredall his cruelty and all her thoughts of revengeas the exile forgets the stormy passage that lay between home and happiness and the dreary land in which he finds himself desolate     chapter 16   before night all hope was gone dr hart had said it was death anthonys body had been carried to the house and every one there knew the calamity that had fallen on them  caterina had been questioned by dr hart and had answered briefly that she found anthony lying in the rookery that she should have been walking there just at that time was not a coincidence to raise conjectures in any one besides mr gilfil except in answering this question she had not broken her silence she sat mute in a corner of the gardeners kitchen shaking her head when maynard entreated her to return with him and apparently unable to think of anything but the possibility that anthony might revive until she saw them carrying away the body to the house then she followed by sir christophers side again so quietly that even dr hart did not object to her presence  it was decided to lay the body in the library until after the coroners inquest tomorrow and when caterina saw the door finally closed she turned up the gallery stairs on her way to her own room the place where she felt at home with her sorrows it was the first time she had been in the gallery since that terrible moment in the morning and now the spot and the objects around began to reawaken her halfstunned memory the armour was no longer glittering in the sunlight but there it hung dead and sombre above the cabinet from which she had taken the dagger yes now it all came back to herall the wretchedness and all the sin but where was the dagger now she felt in her pocket it was not there could it have been her fancyall that about the dagger she looked in the cabinet it was not there alas no it could not have been her fancy and she was guilty of that wickedness but where could the dagger be now could it have fallen out of her pocket she heard steps ascending the stairs and hurried on to her room where kneeling by the bed and burying her face to shut out the hateful light she tried to recall every feeling and incident of the morning  it all came back everything anthony had done and everything she had felt for the last monthfor many monthsever since that june evening when he had last spoken to her in the gallery she looked back on her storms of passion her jealousy and hatred of miss assher her thoughts of revenge on anthony o how wicked she had been it was she who had been sinning it was she who had driven him to do and say those things that had made her so angry and if he had wronged her what had she been on the verge of doing to him she was too wicked ever to be pardoned she would like to confess how wicked she had been that they might punish her she would like to humble herself to the dust before every onebefore miss assher even sir christopher would send her awaywould never see her again if he knew all and she would be happier to be punished and frowned on than to be treated tenderly while she had that guilty secret in her breast but then if sir christopher were to know all it would add to his sorrow and make him more wretched than ever no she could not confess itshe should have to tell about anthony but she could not stay at the manor she must go away she could not bear sir christophers eye could not bear the sight of all these things that reminded her of anthony and of her sin perhaps she should die soon she felt very feeble there could not be much life in her she would go away and live humbly and pray to god to pardon her and let her die  the poor child never thought of suicide no sooner was the storm of anger passed than the tenderness and timidity of her nature returned and she could do nothing but love and mourn her inexperience prevented her from imagining the consequences of her disappearance from the manor she foresaw none of the terrible details of alarm and distress and search that must ensue they will think i am dead she said to herself and byandby they will forget me and maynard will get happy again and love some one else  she was roused from her absorption by a knock at the door mrs bellamy was there she had come by mr gilfils request to see how miss sarti was and to bring her some food and wine  you look sadly my dear said the old housekeeper an youre all of a quake wi cold get you to bed now do martha shall come an warm it an light your fire see now heres some nice arrowroot wi a drop o wine in it take that an itll warm you i must go down again for i cant awhile to stay theres so many things to see to an miss asshers in hysterics constant an her maids ill i beda poor creachy thingan mrs sharps wanted every minute but ill send martha up an do you get ready to go to bed theres a dear child an take care o yourself  thank you dear mammy said tina kissing the little old womans wrinkled cheek i shall eat the arrowroot and dont trouble about me any more tonight i shall do very well when martha has lighted my fire tell mr gilfil im better i shall go to bed byandby so dont you come up again because you may only disturb me  well well take care o yourself theres a good child an god send you may sleep  caterina took the arrowroot quite eagerly while martha was lighting her fire she wanted to get strength for her journey and she kept the plate of biscuits by her that she might put some in her pocket her whole mind was now bent on going away from the manor and she was thinking of all the ways and means her little lifes experience could suggest  it was dusk now she must wait till early dawn for she was too timid to go away in the dark but she must make her escape before any one was up in the house there would be people watching anthony in the library but she could make her way out of a small door leading into the garden against the drawingroom on the other side of the house  she laid her cloak bonnet and veil ready then she lighted a candle opened her desk and took out the broken portrait wrapped in paper she folded it again in two little notes of anthonys written in pencil and placed it in her bosom there was the little china box toodorcass present the pearl earrings and a silk purse with fifteen sevenshilling pieces in it the presents sir christopher had made her on her birthday ever since she had been at the manor should she take the earrings and the sevenshilling pieces she could not bear to part with them it seemed as if they had some of sir christophers love in them she would like them to be buried with her she fastened the little round earrings in her ears and put the purse with dorcass box in her pocket she had another purse there and she took it out to count her money for she would never spend her sevenshilling pieces she had a guinea and eight shillings that would be plenty  so now she sat down to wait for the morning afraid to lay herself on the bed lest she should sleep too long if she could but see anthony once more and kiss his cold forehead but that could not be she did not deserve it she must go away from him away from sir christopher and lady cheverel and maynard and everybody who had been kind to her and thought her good while she was so wicked     chapter 17   some of mrs sharps earliest thoughts the next morning were given to caterina whom she had not been able to visit the evening before and whom from a nearly equal mixture of affection and selfimportance she did not at all like resigning to mrs bellamys care at halfpast eight oclock she went up to tinas room bent on benevolent dictation as to doses and diet and lying in bed but on opening the door she found the bed smooth and empty evidently it had not been slept in what could this mean had she sat up all night and was she gone out to walk the poor things head might be touched by what had happened yesterday it was such a shockfinding captain wybrow in that way she was perhaps gone out of her mind mrs sharp looked anxiously in the place where tina kept her hat and cloak they were not there so that she had had at least the presence of mind to put them on still the good woman felt greatly alarmed and hastened away to tell mr gilfil who she knew was in his study  mr gilfil she said as soon as she had closed the door behind her my mind misgives me dreadful about miss sarti  what is it said poor maynard with a horrible fear that caterina had betrayed something about the dagger  shes not in her room an her beds not been slept in this night an her hat an cloaks gone  for a minute or two mr gilfil was unable to speak he felt sure the worst had come caterina had destroyed herself the strong man suddenly looked so ill and helpless that mrs sharp began to be frightened at the effect of her abruptness  o sir im grieved to my heart to shock you so but i didnt know who else to go to  no no you were quite right  he gathered some strength from his very despair it was all over and he had nothing now to do but to suffer and to help the suffering he went on in a firmer voicebe sure not to breathe a word about it to any one we must not alarm lady cheverel and sir christopher miss sarti may be only walking in the garden she was terribly excited by what she saw yesterday and perhaps was unable to lie down from restlessness just go quietly through the empty rooms and see whether she is in the house i will go and look for her in the grounds  he went down and to avoid giving any alarm in the house walked at once towards the mosslands in search of mr bates whom he met returning from his breakfast to the gardener he confided his fear about caterina assigning as a reason for this fear the probability that the shock she had undergone yesterday had unhinged her mind and begging him to send men in search of her through the gardens and park and inquire if she had been seen at the lodges and if she were not found or heard of in this way to lose no time in dragging the waters round the manor  god forbid it should be so bates but we shall be the easier for having searched everywhere  troost to mae troost to mae mr gilfil eh but id ha worked for daywage all the rest o my life rether than anythin should ha happened to her  the good gardener in deep distress strode away to the stables that he might send the grooms on horseback through the park  mr gilfils next thought was to search the rookery she might be haunting the scene of captain wybrows death he went hastily over every mound looked round every large tree and followed every winding of the walks in reality he had little hope of finding her there but the bare possibility fenced off for a time the fatal conviction that caterinas body would be found in the water when the rookery had been searched in vain he walked fast to the border of the little stream that bounded one side of the grounds the stream was almost everywhere hidden among trees and there was one place where it was broader and deeper than elsewhereshe would be more likely to come to that spot than to the pool he hurried along with strained eyes his imagination continually creating what he dreaded to see  there is something white behind that overhanging bough his knees tremble under him he seems to see part of her dress caught on a branch and her dear dead face upturned o god give strength to thy creature on whom thou hast laid this great agony he is nearly up to the bough and the white object is moving it is a waterfowl that spreads its wings and flies away screaming he hardly knows whether it is a relief or a disappointment that she is not there the conviction that she is dead presses its cold weight upon him none the less heavily  as he reached the great pool in front of the manor he saw mr bates with a group of men already there preparing for the dreadful search which could only displace his vague despair by a definite horror for the gardener in his restless anxiety had been unable to defer this until other means of search had proved vain the pool was not now laughing with sparkles among the waterlilies it looked black and cruel under the sombre sky as if its cold depths held relentlessly all the murdered hope and joy of maynard gilfils life  thoughts of the sad consequences for others as well as himself were crowding on his mind the blinds and shutters were all closed in front of the manor and it was not likely that sir christopher would be aware of anything that was passing outside but mr gilfil felt that caterinas disappearance could not long be concealed from him the coroners inquest would be held shortly she would be inquired for and then it would be inevitable that the baronet should know all     chapter 18   at twelve oclock when all search and inquiry had been in vain and the coroner was expected every moment mr gilfil could no longer defer the hard duty of revealing this fresh calamity to sir christopher who must otherwise have it discovered to him abruptly  the baronet was seated in his dressingroom where the dark windowcurtains were drawn so as to admit only a sombre light it was the first time mr gilfil had had an interview with him this morning and he was struck to see how a single day and night of grief had aged the fine old man the lines in his brow and about his mouth were deepened his complexion looked dull and withered there was a swollen ridge under his eyes and the eyes themselves which used to cast so keen a glance on the present had the vacant expression which tells that vision is no longer a sense but a memory  he held out his hand to maynard who pressed it and sat down beside him in silence sir christophers heart began to swell at this unspoken sympathy the tears would rise would roll in great drops down his cheeks the first tears he had shed since boyhood were for anthony  maynard felt as if his tongue were glued to the roof of his mouth he could not speak first he must wait until sir christopher said something which might lead on to the cruel words that must be spoken  at last the baronet mastered himself enough to say im very weak maynardgod help me i didnt think anything would unman me in this way but id built everything on that lad perhaps ive been wrong in not forgiving my sister she lost one of her sons a little while ago ive been too proud and obstinate  we can hardly learn humility and tenderness enough except by suffering said maynard and god sees we are in need of suffering for it is falling more and more heavily on us we have a new trouble this morning  tina said sir christopher looking up anxiouslyis tina ill  i am in dreadful uncertainty about her she was very much agitated yesterdayand with her delicate healthi am afraid to think what turn the agitation may have taken  is she delirious poor dear little one  god only knows how she is we are unable to find her when mrs sharp went up to her room this morning it was empty she had not been in bed her hat and cloak were gone i have had search made for her everywherein the house and garden in the park andin the water no one has seen her since martha went up to light her fire at seven oclock in the evening  while mr gilfil was speaking sir christophers eyes which were eagerly turned on him recovered some of their old keenness and some sudden painful emotion as at a new thought flitted rapidly across his already agitated face like the shadow of a dark cloud over the waves when the pause came he laid his hand on mr gilfils arm and said in a lower voicemaynard did that poor thing love anthony  she did  maynard hesitated after these words struggling between his reluctance to inflict a yet deeper wound on sir christopher and his determination that no injustice should be done to caterina sir christophers eyes were still fixed on him in solemn inquiry and his own sunk towards the ground while he tried to find the words that would tell the truth least cruelly  you must not have any wrong thoughts about tina he said at length i must tell you now for her sake what nothing but this should ever have caused to pass my lips captain wybrow won her affections by attentions which in his position he was bound not to show her before his marriage was talked of he had behaved to her like a lover  sir christopher relaxed his hold of maynards arm and looked away from him he was silent for some minutes evidently attempting to master himself so as to be able to speak calmly  i must see henrietta immediately he said at last with something of his old sharp decision she must know all but we must keep it from every one else as far as possible my dear boy he continued in a kinder tone the heaviest burthen has fallen on you but we may find her yet we must not despair there has not been time enough for us to be certain poor dear little one god help me i thought i saw everything and was stoneblind all the while     chapter 19   the sad slow week was gone by at last at the coroners inquest a verdict of sudden death had been pronounced dr hart acquainted with captain wybrows previous state of health had given his opinion that death had been imminent from longestablished disease of the heart though it had probably been accelerated by some unusual emotion miss assher was the only person who positively knew the motive that had led captain wybrow to the rookery but she had not mentioned caterinas name and all painful details or inquiries were studiously kept from her mr gilfil and sir christopher however knew enough to conjecture that the fatal agitation was due to an appointed meeting with caterina  all search and inquiry after her had been fruitless and were the more likely to be so because they were carried on under the prepossession that she had committed suicide no one noticed the absence of the trifles she had taken from her desk no one knew of the likeness or that she had hoarded her sevenshilling pieces and it was not remarkable that she should have happened to be wearing the pearl earrings she had left the house they thought taking nothing with her it seemed impossible she could have gone far and she must have been in a state of mental excitement that made it too probable she had only gone to seek relief in death the same places within three or four miles of the manor were searched again and againevery pond every ditch in the neighbourhood was examined  sometimes maynard thought that death might have come on unsought from cold and exhaustion and not a day passed but he wandered through the neighbouring woods turning up the heaps of dead leaves as if it were possible her dear body could be hidden there then another horrible thought recurred and before each night came he had been again through all the uninhabited rooms of the house to satisfy himself once more that she was not hidden behind some cabinet or door or curtainthat he should not find her there with madness in her eyes looking and looking and yet not seeing him  but at last those five long days and nights were at an end the funeral was over and the carriages were returning through the park when they had set out a heavy rain was falling but now the clouds were breaking up and a gleam of sunshine was sparkling among the dripping boughs under which they were passing this gleam fell upon a man on horseback who was jogging slowly along and whom mr gilfil recognized in spite of diminished rotundity as daniel knott the coachman who had married the rosycheeked dorcas ten years before  every new incident suggested the same thought to mr gilfil and his eye no sooner fell on knott than he said to himself can he be come to tell us anything about caterina then he remembered that caterina had been very fond of dorcas and that she always had some present ready to send her when knott paid an occasional visit to the manor could tina have gone to dorcas but his heart sank again as he thought very likely knott had only come because he had heard of captain wybrows death and wanted to know how his old master had borne the blow  as soon as the carriage reached the house he went up to his study and walked about nervously longing but afraid to go down and speak to knott lest his faint hope should be dissipated any one looking at that face usually so full of calm goodwill would have seen that the last weeks suffering had left deep traces by day he had been riding or wandering incessantly either searching for caterina himself or directing inquiries to be made by others by night he had not known sleeponly intermittent dozing in which he seemed to be finding caterina dead and woke up with a start from this unreal agony to the real anguish of believing that he should see her no more the clear grey eyes looked sunken and restless the full careless lips had a strange tension about them and the brow formerly so smooth and open was contracted as if with pain he had not lost the object of a few months passion he had lost the being who was bound up with his power of loving as the brook we played by or the flowers we gathered in childhood are bound up with our sense of beauty love meant nothing for him but to love caterina for years the thought of her had been present in everything like the air and the light and now she was gone it seemed as if all pleasure had lost its vehicle the sky the earth the daily ride the daily talk might be there but the loveliness and the joy that were in them had gone for ever  presently as he still paced backwards and forwards he heard steps along the corridor and there was a knock at his door his voice trembled as he said come in and the rush of renewed hope was hardly distinguishable from pain when he saw warren enter with daniel knott behind him  knott is come sir with news of miss sarti i thought it best to bring him to you first  mr gilfil could not help going up to the old coachman and wringing his hand but he was unable to speak and only motioned to him to take a chair while warren left the room he hung upon daniels moonface and listened to his small piping voice with the same solemn yearning expectation with which he would have given ear to the most awful messenger from the land of shades  it war dorkis sir would hev me come but we knowed nothin o whats happened at the manor shes frightened out on her wits about miss sarti an she would hev me saddle blackbird this mornin an leave the ploughin to come an let sir christifer an my lady know praps youve heared sir we dont keep the cross keys at sloppeter now a uncle o mine died three ear ago an left me a leggicy he was bailiff to squire ramble as hed them there

here tonight and byandby i shall come to you to learn the nearest way to your house i shall get ready to ride there immediately when i have spoken to sir christopher  in an hour from that time mr gilfil was galloping on a stout mare towards the little muddy village of callam five miles beyond sloppeter once more he saw some gladness in the afternoon sunlight once more it was a pleasure to see the hedgerow trees flying past him and to be conscious of a good seat while his black kitty bounded beneath him and the air whistled to the rhythm of her pace caterina was not dead he had found her his love and tenderness and longsuffering seemed so strong they must recall her to life and happiness  after that week of despair the rebound was so violent that it carried his hopes at once as far as the utmost mark they had ever reached caterina would come to love him at last she would be his they had been carried through all that dark and weary way that she might know the depth of his love how he would cherish herhis little bird with the timid bright eye and the sweet throat that trembled with love and music she would nestle against him and the poor little breast which had been so ruffled and bruised should be safe for evermore in the love of a brave and faithful man there is always a strain of maternal tenderness he gives out again those beams of protecting fondness which were shed on him as he lay on his mothers knee it was twilight as he entered the village of callam and asking a homewardbound labourer the way to daniel knotts learned that it was by the church which showed its stumpy ivyclad spire on a slight elevation of ground a useful addition to the means of identifying that desirable homestead afforded by daniels descriptionthe prittiest place iver you seethough a small cowyard full of excellent manure and leading right up to the door without any frivolous interruption from garden or railing might perhaps have been enough to make that description unmistakably specific  mr gilfil had no sooner reached the gate leading into the cowyard than he was descried by a flaxenhaired lad of nine prematurely invested with the toga virilis or smockfrock who ran forward to let in the unusual visitor in a moment dorcas was at the door the roses on her cheeks apparently all the redder for the three pair of cheeks which formed a group round her and for the very fat baby who stared in her arms and sucked a long crust with calm relish  is it mr gilfil sir said dorcas curtsying low as he made his way through the damp straw after tying up his horse  yes dorcas im grown out of your knowledge how is miss sarti  just for all the world the same sir as i suppose dannels told you for i reckon youve come from the manor though youre come uncommon quick to be sure  yes he got to the manor about one oclock and i set off as soon as i could shes not worse is she  no change sir for better or wuss will you please to walk in sir she lies there takin no notice o nothin no more nor a baby as is ony a week old an looks at me as blank as if she didnt know me o what can it be mr gilfil how come she to leave the manor hows his honour an my lady  in great trouble dorcas captain wybrow sir christophers nephew you know has died suddenly miss sarti found him lying dead and i think the shock has affected her mind  eh dear that fine young gentlemen as was to be th heir as dannel told me about i remember seein him when he was a little un avisitin at the manor welladay what a grief to his honour and my lady but that poor miss tinaan she found him alyin dead o dear o dear  dorcas had led the way into the best kitchen as charming a room as best kitchens used to be in farmhouses which had no parloursthe fire reflected in a bright row of pewter plates and dishes the sandscoured deal tables so clean you longed to stroke them the saltcoffer in one chimneycorner and a threecornered chair in the other the walls behind handsomely tapestried with flitches of bacon and the ceiling ornamented with pendent hams  sit ye down sirdo said dorcas moving the threecornered chair an let me get you somethin after your long journey here becky come an tek the baby  becky a redarmed damsel emerged from the adjoining backkitchen and possessed herself of baby whose feelings or fat made him conveniently apathetic under the transference  whatll you please to tek sir as i can give you ill get you a rasher o bacon i no time an ive got some tea or belike youd tek a glass o rumanwater i know weve got nothin as youre used t eat and drink but such as i hev sir i shall be proud to give you  thank you dorcas i cant eat or drink anything im not hungry or tired let us talk about tina has she spoken at all  niver since the fust words dear dorkis says she tek me in an then went off into a faint an not a word has she spoken since i get her t eat little bits an sups o things but she teks no notice o nothin ive took up bessie wi me now an thenhere dorcas lifted to her lap a curlyheaded little girl of three who was twisting a corner of her mothers apron and opening round eyes at the gentlemanfolksll tek notice o children sometimes when they wont o nothin else an we gathered the autumn crocuses out o th orchard and bessie carried em up in her hand an put em on the bed i knowed how fond miss tina was o flowers an them things when she was a little un but she looked at bessie an the flowers just the same as if she didnt see em it cuts me to th heart to look at them eyes o hers i think theyre bigger nor iver an they look like my poor babys as died when it got so thino dear its little hands you could see thro em but ive great hopes if she was to see you sir as come from the manor it might bring back her mind like  maynard had that hope too but he felt cold mists of fear gathering round him after the few bright warm hours of joyful confidence which had passed since he first heard that caterina was alive the thought would urge itself upon him that her mind and body might never recover the strain that had been put upon themthat her delicate thread of life had already nearly spun itself out  go now dorcas and see how she is but dont say anything about my being here perhaps it would be better for me to wait till daylight before i see her and yet it would be very hard to pass another night in this way  dorcas set down little bessie and went away the three other children including young daniel in his smockfrock were standing opposite to mr gilfil watching him still more shyly now they were without their mothers countenance he drew little bessie towards him and set her on his knee she shook her yellow curls out of her eyes and looked up at him as she saidzoo tome to tee ze yady zoo mek her peak what zoo do to her tiss her  do you like to be kissed bessie  det said bessie immediately ducking down her head very low in resistance to the expected rejoinder  weve got two pups said young daniel emboldened by observing the gentlemans amenities towards bessie shall i show em yer ones got white spots  yes let me see them  daniel ran out and presently reappeared with two blind puppies eagerly followed by the mother affectionate though mongrel and an exciting scene was beginning when dorcas returned and saidtheres niver any difference in her hardly i think you neednt wait sir she lies very still as she alys does ive put two candle i the room so as she may see you well youll please t excuse the room sir an the cap as she has on its one o mine  mr gilfil nodded silently and rose to follow her upstairs they turned in at the first door their footsteps making little noise on the plaster floor the redcheckered linen curtains were drawn at the head of the bed and dorcas had placed the candles on this side of the room so that the light might not fall oppressively on caterinas eyes when she had opened the door dorcas whispered id better leave you sir i think  mr gilfil motioned assent and advanced beyond the curtain caterina lay with her eyes turned the other way and seemed unconscious that any one had entered her eyes as dorcas had said looked larger than ever perhaps because her face was thinner and paler and her hair quite gathered away under one of dorcass thick caps the small hands too that lay listlessly on the outside of the bedclothes were thinner than ever she looked younger than she really was and any one seeing the tiny face and hands for the first time might have thought they belonged to a little girl of twelve who was being taken away from coming instead of past sorrow  when mr gilfil advanced and stood opposite to her the light fell full upon his face a slight startled expression came over caterinas eyes she looked at him earnestly for a few moments then lifted up her hand as if to beckon him to stoop down towards her and whispered maynard  he seated himself on the bed and stooped down towards her she whispered againmaynard did you see the dagger  he followed his first impulse in answering her and it was a wise one  yes he whispered i found it in your pocket and put it back again in the cabinet  he took her hand in his and held it gently awaiting what she would say next his heart swelled so with thankfulness that she had recognized him he could hardly repress a sob gradually her eyes became softer and less intense in their gaze the tears were slowly gathering and presently some large hot drops rolled down her cheek then the floodgates were opened and the hearteasing stream gushed forth deep sobs came and for nearly an hour she lay without speaking while the heavy icy pressure that withheld her misery from utterance was thus melting away how precious these tears were to maynard who day after day had been shuddering at the continually recurring image of tina with the dry scorching stare of insanity  by degrees the sobs subsided she began to breathe calmly and lay quiet with her eyes shut patiently maynard sat not heeding the flight of the hours not heeding the old clock that ticked loudly on the landing but when it was nearly ten dorcas impatiently anxious to know the result of mr gilfils appearance could not help stepping in on tiptoe without moving he whispered in her ear to supply him with candles see that the cowboy had shaken down his mare and go to bedhe would watch with caterinaa great change had come over her  before long tinas lips began to move maynard she whispered again he leaned towards her and she went on  you know how wicked i am then you know what i meant to do with the dagger  did you mean to kill yourself tina  she shook her head slowly and then was silent for a long while at last looking at him with solemn eyes she whispered to kill him  tina my loved one you would never have done it god saw your whole heart he knows you would never harm a living thing he watches over his children and will not let them do things they would pray with their whole hearts not to do it was the angry thought of a moment and he forgives you  she sank into silence again till it was nearly midnight the weary enfeebled spirit seemed to be making its slow way with difficulty through the windings of thought and when she began to whisper again it was in reply to maynards words  but i had had such wicked feelings for a long while i was so angry and i hated miss assher so and i didnt care what came to anybody because i was so miserable myself i was full of bad passions no one else was ever so wicked  yes tina many are just as wicked i often have very wicked feelings and am tempted to do wrong things but then my body is stronger than yours and i can hide my feelings and resist them better they do not master me so you have seen the little birds when they are very young and just begin to fly how all their feathers are ruffled when they are frightened or angry they have no power over themselves left and might fall into a pit from mere fright you were like one of those little birds your sorrow and suffering had taken such hold of you you hardly knew what you did  he would not speak long lest he should tire her and oppress her with too many thoughts long pauses seemed needful for her before she could concentrate her feelings in short words  but when i meant to do it was the next thing she whispered it was as bad as if i had done it  no my tina answered maynard slowly waiting a little between each sentence we mean to do wicked things that we never could do just as we mean to do good or clever things that we never could do our thoughts are often worse than we are just as they are often better than we are and god sees us as we are altogether not in separate feelings or actions as our fellowmen see us we are always doing each other injustice and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve because we only hear and see separate words and actions we dont see each others whole nature but god sees that you could not have committed that crime  caterina shook her head slowly and was silent after a whilei dont know she said i seemed to see him coming towards me just as he would really have looked and i meanti meant to do it  but when you saw himtell me how it was tina  i saw him lying on the ground and thought he was ill i dont know how it was then i forgot everything i knelt down and spoke to him andand he took no notice of me and his eyes were fixed and i began to think he was dead  and you have never felt angry since  o no no it is i who have been more wicked than any one it is i who have been wrong all through  no tina the fault has not all been yours he was wrong he gave you provocation and wrong makes wrong when people use us ill we can hardly help having ill feeling towards them but that second wrong is more excusable i am more sinful than you tina i have often had very bad feelings towards captain wybrow and if he had provoked me as he did you i should perhaps have done something more wicked  o it was not so wrong in him he didnt know how he hurt me how was it likely he could love me as i loved him and how could he marry a poor little thing like me  maynard made no reply to this and there was again silence till tina said then i was so deceitful they didnt know how wicked i was padroncello didnt know his good little monkey he used to call me and if he had known o how naughty he would have thought me  my tina we have all our secret sins and if we knew ourselves we should not judge each other harshly sir christopher himself has felt since this trouble came upon him that he has been too severe and obstinate  in this wayin these broken confessions and answering words of comfortthe hours wore on from the deep black night to the chill early twilight and from early twilight to the first yellow streak of morning parting the purple cloud mr gilfil felt as if in the long hours of that night the bond that united his love for ever and alone to caterina had acquired fresh strength and sanctity it is so with the human relations that rest on the deep emotional sympathy of affection every new day and night of joy or sorrow is a new ground a new consecration for the love that is nourished by memories as well as hopesthe love to which perpetual repetition is not a weariness but a want and to which a separated joy is the beginning of pain  the cocks began to crow the gate swung there was a tramp of footsteps in the yard and mr gilfil heard dorcas stirring these sounds seemed to affect caterina for she looked anxiously at him and said maynard are you going away  no i shall stay here at callam until you are better and then you will go away too  never to the manor again o no i shall live poorly and get my own bread  well dearest you shall do what you would like best but i wish you could go to sleep now try to rest quietly and byandby you will perhaps sit up a little god has kept you in life in spite of all this sorrow it will be sinful not to try and make the best of his gift dear tina you will tryand little bessie brought you some crocuses once you didnt notice the poor little thing but you will notice her when she comes again will you not  i will try whispered tina humbly and then closed her eyes  by the time the sun was above the horizon scattering the clouds and shining with pleasant morning warmth through the little leaded window caterina was asleep maynard gently loosed the tiny hand cheered dorcas with the good news and made his way to the village inn with a thankful heart that tina had been so far herself again evidently the sight of him had blended naturally with the memories in which her mind was absorbed and she had been led on to an unburthening of herself that might be the beginning of a complete restoration but her body was so enfeebledher soul so bruisedthat the utmost tenderness and care would be necessary the next thing to be done was to send tidings to sir christopher and lady cheverel then to write and summon his sister under whose care he had determined to place caterina the manor even if she had been wishing to return thither would he knew be the most undesirable home for her at present every scene every object there was associated with still unallayed anguish if she were domesticated for a time with his mild gentle sister who had a peaceful home and a prattling little boy tina might attach herself anew to life and recover partly at least the shock that had been given to her constitution when he had written his letters and taken a hasty breakfast he was soon in his saddle again on his way to sloppeter where he would post them and seek out a medical man to whom he might confide the moral causes of caterinas enfeebled condition     chapter 20   in less than a week from that time caterina was persuaded to travel in a comfortable carriage under the care of mr gilfil and his sister mrs heron whose soft blue eyes and mild manners were very soothing to the poor bruised childthe more so as they had an air of sisterly equality which was quite new to her under lady cheverels uncaressing authoritative goodwill tina had always retained a certain constraint and awe and there was a sweetness before unknown in having a young and gentle woman like an elder sister bending over her caressingly and speaking in low loving tones  maynard was almost angry with himself for feeling happy while tinas mind and body were still trembling on the verge of irrecoverable decline but the new delight of acting as her guardian angel of being with her every hour of the day of devising everything for her comfort of watching for a ray of returning interest in her eyes was too absorbing to leave room for alarm or regret  on the third day the carriage drove up to the door of foxholm parsonage where the rev arthur heron presented himself on the doorstep eager to greet his returning lucy and holding by the hand a broadchested tawnyhaired boy of five who was smacking a miniature huntingwhip with great vigour  nowhere was there a lawn more smoothshaven walks better swept or a porch more prettily festooned with creepers than at foxholm parsonage standing snugly sheltered by beeches and chestnuts halfway down the pretty green hill which was surmounted by the church and overlooking a village that straggled at its ease among pastures and meadows surrounded by wild hedgerows and broad shadowing trees as yet unthreatened by improved methods of farming  brightly the fire shone in the great parlour and brightly in the little pink bedroom which was to be caterinas because it looked away from the churchyard and on to a farm homestead with its little cluster of beehive ricks and placid groups of cows and cheerful matin sounds of healthy labour mrs heron with the instinct of a delicate impressible woman had written to her husband to have this room prepared for caterina contented speckled hens industriously scratching for the rarelyfound corn may sometimes do more for a sick heart than a grove of nightingales there is something irresistibly calming in the unsentimental cheeriness of topknotted pullets unpetted sheepdogs and patient carthorses enjoying a drink of muddy water  in such a home as this parsonage a nest of comfort without any of the stateliness that would carry a suggestion of cheverel manor mr gilfil was not unreasonable in hoping that caterina might gradually shake off the haunting vision of the past and recover from the languor and feebleness which were the physical sign of that visions blighting presence the next thing to be done was to arrange an exchange of duties with mr herons curate that maynard might be constantly near caterina and watch over her progress she seemed to like him to be with her to look uneasily for his return and though she seldom spoke to him she was most contented when he sat by her and held her tiny hand in his large protecting grasp but oswald alias ozzy the broadchested boy was perhaps her most beneficial companion with something of his uncles person he had inherited also his uncles early taste for a domestic menagerie and was very imperative in demanding tinas sympathy in the welfare of his guineapigs squirrels and dormice with him she seemed now and then to have gleams of her childhood coming athwart the leaden clouds and many hours of winter went by the more easily for being spent in ozzys nursery  mrs heron was not musical and had no instrument but one of mr gilfils cares was to procure a harpsichord and have it placed in the drawingroom always open in the hope that some day the spirit of music would be reawakened in caterina and she would be attracted towards the instrument but the winter was almost gone by and he had waited in vain the utmost improvement in tina had not gone beyond passiveness and acquiescencea quiet grateful smile compliance with oswalds whims and an increasing consciousness of what was being said and done around her sometimes she would take up a bit of womans work but she seemed too languid to persevere in it her fingers soon dropped and she relapsed into motionless reverie  at lastit was one of those bright days in the end of february when the sun is shining with a promise of approaching spring maynard had been walking with her and oswald round the garden to look at the snowdrops and she was resting on the sofa after the walk ozzy roaming about the room in quest of a forbidden pleasure came to the harpsichord and struck the handle of his whip on a deep bass note  the vibration rushed through caterina like an electric shock it seemed as if at that instant a new soul were entering into her and filling her with a deeper more significant life she looked round rose from the sofa and walked to the harpsichord in a moment her fingers were wandering with their old sweet method among the keys and her soul was floating in its true familiar element of delicious sound as the waterplant that lies withered and shrunken on the ground expands into freedom and beauty when once more bathed in its native flood  maynard thanked god an active power was reawakened and must make a new epoch in caterinas recovery  presently there were low liquid notes blending themselves with the harder tones of the instrument and gradually the pure voice swelled into predominance little ozzy stood in the middle of the room with his mouth open and his legs very wide apart struck with something like awe at this new power in tintin as he called her whom he had been accustomed to think of as a playfellow not at all clever and very much in need of his instruction on many subjects a genie soaring with broad wings out of his milkjug would not have been more astonishing  caterina was singing the very air from the orfeo which we heard her singing so many months ago at the beginning of her sorrows it was ho perduto sir christophers favourite and its notes seemed to carry on their wings all the tenderest memories of her life when cheverel manor was still an untroubled home the long happy days of childhood and girlhood recovered all their rightful predominance over the short interval of sin and sorrow  she paused and burst into tearsthe first tears she had shed since she had been at foxholm maynard could not help hurrying towards her putting his arm round her and leaning down to kiss her hair she nestled to him and put up her little mouth to be kissed  the delicatetendrilled plant must have something to cling to the soul that was born anew to music was born anew to love     chapter 21   on the 30th of may 1790 a very pretty sight was seen by the villagers assembled near the door of foxholm church the sun was bright upon the dewy grass the air was alive with the murmur of bees and the trilling of birds the bushy blossoming chestnuts and the foamy flowering hedgerows seemed to be crowding round to learn why the churchbells were ringing so merrily as maynard gilfil his face bright with happiness walked out of the old gothic doorway with tina on his arm the little face was still pale and there was a subdued melancholy in it as of one who sups with friends for the last time and has his ear open for the signal that will call him away but the tiny hand rested with the pressure of contented affection on maynards arm and the dark eyes met his downward glance with timid answering love  there was no train of bridesmaids only pretty mrs heron leaning on the arm of a darkhaired young man hitherto unknown in foxholm and holding by the other hand little ozzy who exulted less in his new velvet cap and tunic than in the notion that he was bridesman to tintin  last of all came a couple whom the villagers eyed yet more eagerly than the bride and bridegroom a fine old gentleman who looked round with keen glances that cowed the conscious scapegraces among them and a stately lady in blueandwhite silk robes who must surely be like queen charlotte  well that theers whut i coal a pictur said old mester ford a true staffordshire patriarch who leaned on a stick and held his head very much on one side with the air of a man who had little hope of the present generation but would at all events give it the benefit of his criticism th yoong

th perch istid  at the church gate mr bates was standing in a new suit ready to speak words of good omen as the bride and bridegroom approached he had come all the way from cheverel manor on purpose to see miss tina happy once more and would have been in a state of unmixed joy but for the inferiority of the wedding nosegays to what he could have furnished from the garden at the manor  god amaighty bless ye both an send ye long laife an happiness were the good gardeners rather tremulous words  thank you uncle bates always remember tina said the sweet low voice which fell on mr batess ear for the last time  the wedding journey was to be a circuitous route to shepperton where mr gilfil had been for several months inducted as vicar this small living had been given him through the interest of an old friend who had some claim on the gratitude of the oldinport family and it was a satisfaction both to maynard and sir christopher that a home to which he might take caterina had thus readily presented itself at a distance from cheverel manor for it had never yet been thought safe that she should revisit the scene of her sufferings her health continuing too delicate to encourage the slightest risk of painful excitement in a year or two perhaps by the time old mr crichley the rector of cumbermoor should have left a world of gout and when caterina would very likely be a happy mother maynard might safely take up his abode at cumbermoor and tina would feel nothing but content at seeing a new little blackeyed monkey running up and down the gallery and gardens of the manor a mother dreads no memoriesthose shadows have all melted away in the dawn of babys smile  in these hopes and in the enjoyment of tinas nestling affection mr gilfil tasted a few months of perfect happiness she had come to lean entirely on his love and to find life sweet for his sake her continual languor and want of active interest was a natural consequence of bodily feebleness and the prospect of her becoming a mother was a new ground for hoping the best but the delicate plant had been too deeply bruised and in the struggle to put forth a blossom it died  tina died and maynard gilfils love went with her into deep silence for evermore     epilogue   this was mr gilfils lovestory which lay far back from the time when he sat worn and grey by his lonely fireside in shepperton vicarage rich brown locks passionate love and deep early sorrow strangely different as they seem from the scanty white hairs the apathetic content and the unexpectant quiescence of old age are but part of the same lifes journey as the bright italian plains with the sweet addio of their beckoning maidens are part of the same days travel that brings us to the other side of the mountain between the sombre rocky walls and among the guttural voices of the valais  to those who were familiar only with the greyhaired vicar jogging leisurely along on his old chestnut cob it would perhaps have been hard to believe that he had ever been the maynard gilfil who with a heart full of passion and tenderness had urged his black kitty to her swiftest gallop on the way to callam or that the old gentleman of caustic tongue and bucolic tastes and sparing habits had known all the deep secrets of devoted love had struggled through its days and nights of anguish and trembled under its unspeakable joys  and indeed the mr gilfil of those late shepperton days had more of the knots and ruggedness of poor human nature than there lay any clear hint of in the openeyed loving maynard but it is with men as with trees if you lop off their finest branches into which they were pouring their young lifejuice the wounds will be healed over with some rough boss some odd excrescence and what might have been a grand tree expanding into liberal shade is but a whimsical misshapen trunk many an irritating fault many an unlovely oddity has come of a hard sorrow which has crushed and maimed the nature just when it was expanding into plenteous beauty and the trivial erring life which we visit with our harsh blame may be but as the unsteady motion of a man whose best limb is withered  and so the dear old vicar though he had something of the knotted whimsical character of the poor lopped oak had yet been sketched out by nature as a noble tree the heart of him was sound the grain was of the finest and in the greyhaired man who filled his pocket with sugarplums for the little children whose most biting words were directed against the evil doing of the rich man and who with all his social pipes and slipshod talk never sank below the highest level of his parishioners respect there was the main trunk of the same brave faithful tender nature that had poured out the finest freshest forces of its lifecurrent in a first and only lovethe love of tina     janets repentance     chapter 1   no said lawyer dempster in a loud rasping oratorical tone struggling against chronic huskiness as long as my maker grants me power of voice and power of intellect i will take every legal means to resist the introduction of demoralizing methodistical doctrine into this parish i will not supinely suffer an insult to be inflicted on our venerable pastor who has given us sound instruction for half a century  it was very warm everywhere that evening but especially in the bar of the red lion at milby where mr dempster was seated mixing his third glass of brandyandwater he was a tall and rather massive man and the front half of his large surface was so well dredged with snuff that the cat having inadvertently come near him had been seized with a severe fit of sneezingan accident which being cruelly misunderstood had caused her to be driven contumeliously from the bar mr dempster habitually held his chin tucked in and his head hanging forward weighed down perhaps by a preponderant occiput and a bulging forehead between which his closelyclipped coronal surface lay like a flat and newmown tableland the only other observable features were puffy cheeks and a protruding yet lipless mouth of his nose i can only say that it was snuffy and as mr dempster was never caught in the act of looking at anything in particular it would have been difficult to swear to the colour of his eyes  well ill not stick at giving myself trouble to put down such hypocritical cant said mr tomlinson the rich miller i know well enough what your sunday evening lectures are good forfor wenches to meet their sweethearts and brew mischief theres work enough with the servantmaids as it issuch as i never heard the like of in my mothers time and its all along o your schooling and newfangled plans give me a servant as can nayther read nor write i say and doesnt know the year o the lord as she was born in i should like to know what good those sunday schools have done now why the boys used to go a birdsnesting of a sunday morning and a capital thing tooask any farmer and very pretty it was to see the strings o heggs hanging up in poor peoples houses youll not see em nowhere now  pooh said mr luke byles who piqued himself on his reading and was in the habit of asking casual acquaintances if they knew anything of hobbes it is right enough that the lower orders should be instructed but this sectarianism within the church ought to be put down in point of fact these evangelicals are not churchmen at all theyre no better than presbyterians  presbyterians what are they inquired mr tomlinson who often said his father had given him no eddication and he didnt care who knowed it he could buy up most o th eddicated men hed ever come across  the presbyterians said mr dempster in rather a louder tone than before holding that every appeal for information must naturally be addressed to him are a sect founded in the reign of charles i by a man named john presbyter who hatched all the brood of dissenting vermin that crawl about in dirty alleys and circumvent the lord of the manor in order to get a few yards of ground for their pigeonhouse conventicles  no no dempster said mr luke byles youre out there presbyterianism is derived from the word presbyter meaning an elder  dont contradict me sir stormed dempster i say the word presbyterian is derived from john presbyter a miserable fanatic who wore a suit of leather and went about from town to village and from village to hamlet inoculating the vulgar with the asinine virus of dissent  come byles that seems a deal more likely said mr tomlinson in a conciliatory tone apparently of opinion that history was a process of ingenious guessing  its not a question of likelihood its a known fact i could fetch you my encyclopaedia and show it you this moment  i dont care a straw sir either for you or your encyclopaedia said mr dempster a farrago of false information of which you picked up an imperfect copy in a cargo of waste paper will you tell me sir that i dont know the origin of presbyterianism i sir a man known through the county intrusted with the affairs of half a score parishes while you sir are ignored by the very fleas that infest the miserable alley in which you were bred  a loud and general laugh with youd better let him alone byles youll not get the better of dempster in a hurry drowned the retort of the too wellinformed mr byles who white with rage rose and walked out of the bar  a meddlesome upstart jacobinical fellow gentlemen continued mr dempster i was determined to be rid of him what does he mean by thrusting himself into our company a man with about as much principle as he has property which to my knowledge is considerably less than none an insolvent atheist gentlemen a deistical prater fit to sit in the chimneycorner of a pothouse and make blasphemous comments on the one greasy newspaper fingered by beerswilling tinkers i will not suffer in my company a man who speaks lightly of religion the signature of a fellow like byles would be a blot on our protest  and how do you get on with your signatures said mr pilgrim the doctor who had presented his large topbooted person within the bar while mr dempster was speaking mr pilgrim had just returned from one of his long days rounds among the farmhouses in the course of which he had sat down to two hearty meals that might have been mistaken for dinners if he had not declared them to be snaps and as each snap had been followed by a few glasses of mixture containing a less liberal proportion of water than the articles he himself labelled with that broadly generic name he was in that condition which his groom indicated with poetic ambiguity by saying that master had been in the sunshine under these circumstances after a hard day in which he had really had no regular meal it seemed a natural relaxation to step into the bar of the red lion where as it was saturday evening he should be sure to find dempster and hear the latest news about the protest against the evening lecture  have you hooked ben landor yet he continued as he took two chairs one for his body and the other for his right leg  no said mr budd the churchwarden shaking his head ben landor has a way of keeping himself neutral in everything and he doesnt like to oppose his father old landor is a regular tryanite but we havent got your name yet pilgrim  tut tut budd said mr dempster sarcastically you dont expect pilgrim to sign hes got a dozen tryanite livers under his treatment nothing like cant and methodism for producing a superfluity of bile  o i thought as pratt had declared himself a tryanite we should be sure to get pilgrim on our side  mr pilgrim was not a man to sit quiet under a sarcasm nature having endowed him with a considerable share of selfdefensive wit in his most sober moments he had an impediment in his speech and as copious ginandwater stimulated not the speech but the impediment he had time to make his retort sufficiently bitter  why to tell you the truth budd he spluttered theres a report all over the town that deb traunter swears you shall take her with you as one of the delegates and they say theres to be a fine crowd at your door the morning you start to see the row knowing your tenderness for that member of the fair sex i thought you might find it impossible to deny her i hang back a little from signing on that account as prendergast might not take the protest well if deb traunter went with you  mr budd was a small sleekheaded bachelor of fiveandforty whose scandalous life had long furnished his more moral neighbours with an afterdinner joke he had no other striking characteristic except that he was a currier of choleric temperament so that you might wonder why he had been chosen as clergymans churchwarden if i did not tell you that he had recently been elected through mr dempsters exertions in order that his zeal against the threatened evening lecture might be backed by the dignity of office  come come pilgrim said mr tomlinson covering mr budds retreat you know you like to wear the criers coat green o one side and red o the other youve been to hear tryan preach at paddiford commonyou know you have  to be sure i have and a capital sermon too its a pity you were not there it was addressed to those void of understanding  no no youll never catch me there returned mr tomlinson not in the least stung he preaches without book they say just like a dissenter it must be a rambling sort of a concern  thats not the worst said mr dempster he preaches against good works says good works are not necessary to salvationa sectarian antinomian anabaptist doctrine tell a man he is not to be saved by his works and you open the floodgates of all immorality you see it in all these canting innovators theyre all bad ones by the sly smoothfaced drawling hypocritical fellows who pretend ginger isnt hot in their mouths and cry down all innocent pleasures their hearts are all the blacker for their sanctimonious outsides havent we been warned against those who make clean the outside of the cup and the platter theres this tryan now he goes about praying with old women and singing with charity children but what has he really got his eye on all the while a domineering ambitious jesuit gentlemen all he wants is to get his foot far enough into the parish to step into crewes shoes when the old gentleman dies depend upon it whenever you see a man pretending to be better than his neighbours that man has either some cunning end to serve or his heart is rotten with spiritual pride  as if to guarantee himself against this awful sin mr dempster seized his glass of brandyandwater and tossed off the contents with even greater rapidity than usual  have you fixed on your third delegate yet said mr pilgrim whose taste was for detail rather than for dissertation  thats the man answered dempster pointing to mr tomlinson we start for elmstoke rectory on tuesday morning so if you mean to give us your signature you must make up your mind pretty quickly pilgrim  mr pilgrim did not in the least mean it so he only said i shouldnt wonder if tryan turns out too many for you after all hes got a welloiled tongue of his own and has perhaps talked over prendergast into a determination to stand by him  very little fear of that said dempster in a confident tone ill soon bring him round tryan has got his match ive plenty of rods in pickle for tryan  at this moment boots entered the bar and put a letter into the lawyers hands saying theres trowers man just come into the yard wi a gig sir an hes brought this here letter  mr dempster read the letter and said tell him to turn the gigill be with him in a minute here run to grubys and get this snuffbox filled quick  trowers worse i suppose eh dempster wants you to alter his will eh said mr pilgrim  businessbusinessbusinessi dont know exactly what answered the cautious dempster rising deliberately from his chair thrusting on his lowcrowned hat and walking with a slow but not unsteady step out of the bar  i never see dempsters equal if i did ill be shot said mr tomlinson looking after the lawyer admiringly why hes drunk the best part of a bottle o brandy since here weve been sitting and ill bet a guinea when hes got to trowers his headll be as clear as mine he knows more about law when hes drunk than all the rest on em when theyre sober  ay and other things too besides law said mr budd did you notice how he took up byles about the presbyterians bless your heart he knows everything dempster does he studied very hard when he was a young man     chapter 2   the conversation just recorded is not i am aware remarkably refined or witty but if it had been it could hardly have taken place in milby when mr dempster flourished there and old mr crewe the curate was yet alive  more than a quarter of a century has slipped by since then and in the interval milby has advanced at as rapid a pace as other markettowns in her majestys dominions by this time it has a handsome railway station where the drowsy london traveller may look out by the brilliant gaslight and see perfectly sober papas and husbands alighting with their leatherbags after transacting their days business at the county town there is a resident rector who appeals to the consciences of his hearers with all the immense advantages of a divine who keeps his own carriage the church is enlarged by at least five hundred sittings and the grammar school conducted on reformed principles has its upper forms crowded with the genteel youth of milby the gentlemen there fall into no other excess at dinnerparties than the perfectly wellbred and virtuous excess of stupidity and though the ladies are still said sometimes to take too much upon themselves they are never known to take too much in any other way the conversation is sometimes quite literary for there is a flourishing bookclub and many of the younger ladies have carried their studies so far as to have forgotten a little german in short milby is now a refined moral and enlightened town no more resembling the milby of former days than the huge longskirted drab greatcoat that embarrassed the ankles of our grandfathers resembled the light paletot in which we tread jauntily through the muddiest streets or than the bottlenosed britons rejoicing over a tankard in the old sign of the two travellers at milby resembled the severelooking gentleman in straps and high collars whom a modern artist has represented as sipping the imaginary port of that wellknown commercial house  but pray reader dismiss from your mind all the refined and fashionable ideas associated with this advanced state of things and transport your imagination to a time when milby had no gaslights when the mail drove up dusty or bespattered to the door of the red lion when old mr crewe the curate in a brown brutus wig delivered inaudible sermons on a sunday and on a weekday imparted the education of a gentlemanthat is to say an arduous inacquaintance with latin through the medium of the eton grammarto three pupils in the upper grammarschool  if you had passed through milby on the coach at that time you would have had no idea what important people lived there and how very high a sense of rank was prevalent among them it was a dingylooking town with a strong smell of tanning up one street and a great shaking of handlooms up another and even in that focus of aristocracy friars gate the houses would not have seemed very imposing to the hasty and superficial glance of a passenger you might still less have suspected that the figure in light fustian and large grey whiskers leaning against the grocers doorpost in high street was no less a person than mr lowme one of the most aristocratic men in milby said to have been brought up a gentleman and to have had the gay habits accordant with that station keeping his harriers and other expensive animals he was now quite an elderly lothario reduced to the most economical sins the prominent form of his gaiety being this of lounging at mr grubys door embarrassing the servantmaids who came for grocery and talking scandal with the rare passersby still it was generally understood that mr lowme belonged to the highest circle of milby society his sons and daughters held up their heads very high indeed and in spite of his condescending way of chatting and drinking with inferior people he would himself have scorned any closer identification with them it must be admitted that he was of some service to the town in this station at mr grubys door for he and mr landors newfoundland dog who stretched himself and gaped on the opposite causeway took something from the lifeless air that belonged to the high street on every day except saturday  certainly in spite of three assemblies and a charity ball in the winter the occasional advent of a ventriloquist or a company of itinerant players some of whom were very highly thought of in london and the annual threedays fair in june milby might be considered dull by people of a hypochondriacal temperament and perhaps this was one reason why many of the middleaged inhabitants male and female often found it impossible to keep up their spirits without a very abundant supply of stimulants it is true there were several substantial men who had a reputation for exceptional sobriety so that milby habits were really not as bad as possible and no one is warranted in saying that old mr crewes flock could not have been worse without any clergyman at all  the welldressed parishioners generally were very regular churchgoers and to the younger ladies and gentlemen i am inclined to think that the sunday morning service was the most exciting event of the week for few places could present a more brilliant show of outdoor toilettes than might be seen issuing from milby church at one oclock there were the four tall miss pittmans old lawyer pittmans daughters with cannon curls surmounted by large hats and long drooping ostrich feathers of parrot green there was miss phipps with a crimson bonnet very much tilted up behind and a cockade of stiff feathers on the summit there was miss landor the belle of milby clad regally in purple and ermine with a plume of feathers neither drooping nor erect but maintaining a discreet medium there were the three miss tomlinsons who imitated miss landor and also wore ermine and feathers but their beauty was considered of a coarse order and their square forms were quite unsuited to the round tippet which fell with such remarkable grace on miss landors sloping shoulders looking at this plumed procession of ladies you would have formed rather a high idea of milby wealth yet there was only one close carriage in the place and that was old mr landors the banker who i think never drove more than one horse these sumptuouslyattired ladies flashed past the vulgar eye in onehorse chaises by no means of a superior build  the young gentlemen too were not without their little sunday displays of costume of a limited masculine kind mr eustace landor being nearly of age had recently acquired a diamond ring together with the habit of rubbing his hand through his hair he was tall and dark and thus had an advantage which mr alfred phipps who like his sister was blond and stumpy found it difficult to overtake even by the severest attention to shirtstuds and the particular shade of brown that was best relieved by gilt buttons  the respect for the sabbath manifested in this attention to costume was unhappily counterbalanced by considerable levity of behaviour during the prayers and sermon for the young ladies and gentlemen of milby were of a very satirical turn miss landor especially being considered remarkably clever and a terrible quiz and the large congregation necessarily containing many persons inferior in dress and demeanour to the distinguished aristocratic minority divine service offered irresistible temptations to joking through the medium of telegraphic communications from the galleries to the aisles and back again i remember blushing very much and thinking miss landor was laughing at me because i was appearing in coattails for the first time when i saw her look down slyly towards where i sat and then turn with a titter to handsome mr bob lowme who had such beautiful whiskers meeting under his chin but perhaps she was not thinking of me after all for our pew was near the pulpit and there was almost always something funny about old mr crewe his brown wig was hardly ever put on quite right and he had a way of raising his voice for three or four words and lowering it again to a mumble so that we could scarcely make out a word he said though as my mother observed that was of no consequence in the prayers since every one had a prayerbook and as for the sermon she continued with some causticity we all of us heard more of it than we could remember when we got home  this youthful generation was not particularly literary the young ladies who frizzed their hair and gathered it all into large barricades in front of their heads leaving their occipital region exposed without ornament as if that being a back view was of no consequence dreamed as little that their daughters would read a selection of german poetry and be able to express an admiration for schiller as that they would turn all their hair the other waythat instead of threatening us with barricades in front they would be most killing in retreat       and like the parthian wound us as they fly  those charming wellfrizzed ladies spoke french indeed with considerable facility unshackled by any timid regard to idiom and were in the habit of conducting conversations in that language in the presence of their less instructed elders for according to the standard of those backward days their education had been very lavish such young ladies as miss landor miss phipps and the miss pittmans having been finished at distant and expensive schools  old lawyer pittman had once been a very important person indeed having in his earlier days managed the affairs of several gentlemen in those parts who had subsequently been obliged to sell everything and leave the country in which crisis mr pittman accommodatingly stepped in as a purchaser of their estates taking on himself the risk and trouble of a more leisurely sale which however happened to turn out very much to his advantage such opportunities occur quite unexpectedly in the way of business but i think mr pittman must have been unlucky in his later speculations for now in his old age he had not the reputation of being very rich and though he rode slowly to his office in milby every morning on an old white hackney he had to resign the chief profits as well as the active business of the firm to his younger partner dempster no one in milby considered old pittman a virtuous man and the elder townspeople were not at all backward in narrating the least advantageous portions of his biography in a very round unvarnished manner yet i could never observe that they trusted him any the less or liked him any the worse indeed pittman and dempster were the popular lawyers of milby and its neighbourhood and mr benjamin landor whom no one had anything particular to say against had a very meagre business in comparison hardly a landholder hardly a farmer hardly a parish within ten miles of milby whose affairs were not under the legal guardianship of pittman and dempster and i think the clients were proud of their lawyers unscrupulousness as the patrons of the fancys are proud of their champions condition it was not to be sure the thing for ordinary life but it was the thing to be bet on in a lawyer dempsters talent in bringing through a client was a very common topic of conversation with the farmers over an incidental glass of grog at the red lion hes a longheaded feller dempster why it shows yer what a headpiece dempster has as he can drink a bottle o brandy at a sittin an yit see further through a stone wall when hes done than other folks ll see through a glass winder even mr jerome chief member of the congregation at salem chapel an elderly man of very strict life was one of dempsters clients and had quite an exceptional indulgence for his attorneys foibles perhaps attributing them to the inevitable incompatibility of law and gospel  the standard of morality at milby you perceive was not inconveniently high in those good old times and an ingenuous vice or two was what every man expected of his neighbour old mr crewe the curate for example was allowed to enjoy his avarice in comfort without fear of sarcastic parish demagogues and his flock liked him all the better for having scraped together a large fortune out of his school and curacy and the proceeds of the three thousand pounds he had with his little deaf wife it was clear he must be a learned man for he had once had a large private school in connection with the grammar school and had even numbered a young nobleman or two among his pupils the fact that he read nothing at all now and that his mind seemed absorbed in the commonest matters was doubtless due to his having exhausted the resources of erudition earlier in life it is true he was not spoken of in terms of high respect and old crewes stingy housekeeping was a frequent subject of jesting but this was a good oldfashioned characteristic in a parson who had been part of milby life for half a century it was like the dents and disfigurements in an old family tankard which no one would like to part with for a smart new piece of plate fresh from birmingham the parishioners saw no reason at all why it should be desirable to venerate the parson or any one else they were much more comfortable to look down a little on their fellowcreatures  even the dissent in milby was then of a lax and indifferent kind the doctrine of adult baptism struggling under a heavy load of debt had let off half its chapel area as a ribbonshop and methodism was only to be detected as you detect curious larvae by diligent search in dirty corners the independents were the only dissenters of whose existence milby gentility was at all conscious and it had a vague idea that the salient points of their creed were prayer without book red brick and hypocrisy the independent chapel known as salem stood red and conspicuous in a broad street more than one pewholder kept a brassbound gig and mr jerome a retired cornfactor and the most eminent member of the congregation was one of the richest men in the parish but in spite of this apparent prosperity together with the usual amount of extemporaneous preaching mitigated by furtive notes salem belied its name and was not always the abode of peace for some reason or other it was unfortunate in the choice of its ministers the rev mr horner elected with brilliant hopes was discovered to be given to tippling and quarrelling with his wife the rev mr roses doctrine was a little too high verging on antinomianism the rev mr stickneys gift as a preacher was found to be less striking on a more extended acquaintance and the rev mr smith a distinguished minister much sought after in the iron districts with a talent for poetry became objectionable from an inclination to exchange verses with the young ladies of his congregation it was reasonably argued that such verses as mr smiths must take a long time for their composition and the habit alluded to might intrench seriously on his pastoral duties these reverend gentlemen one and all gave it as their opinion that the salem church members were among the least enlightened of the lords people and that milby was a low place where they would have found it a severe lot to have their lines fall for any long period though to see the smart and crowded congregation assembled on occasion of the annual charity sermon any one might have supposed that the minister of salem had rather a brilliant position in the ranks of dissent several church families used to attend on that occasion for milby in those uninstructed days had not yet heard that the schismatic ministers of salem were obviously typified by korah dathan and abiram and many church people there were of opinion that dissent might be a weakness but after all had no great harm in it these lax episcopalians were i believe chiefly tradespeople who held that inasmuch as congregationalism consumed candles it ought to be supported and accordingly made a point of presenting themselves at salem for the afternoon charity sermon with the expectation of being asked to hold a plate mr pilgrim too was always there with his halfsovereign for as there was no dissenting doctor in milby mr pilgrim looked with great tolerance on all shades of religious opinion that did not include a belief in cures by miracle  on this point he had the concurrence of mr pratt the only other medical man of the same standing in milby otherwise it was remarkable how strongly these two clever men were contrasted pratt was middlesized insinuating and silveryvoiced pilgrim was tall heavy roughmannered and spluttering both were considered to have great powers of conversation but pratts anecdotes were of the fine old crusted quality to be procured only of joe miller pilgrims had the full fruity flavour of the most recent scandal pratt elegantly referred all diseases to debility and with a proper contempt for symptomatic treatment went to the root of the matter with port wine and bark pilgrim was persuaded that the evil principle in the human system was plethora and he made war against it with cupping blistering and cathartics they had both been long established in milby and as each had a sufficient practice there was no very malignant rivalry between them on the contrary they had that sort of friendly contempt for each other which is always conducive to a good understanding between professional men and when any new surgeon attempted in an illadvised hour to settle himself in the town it was strikingly demonstrated how slight and trivial are theoretic differences compared with the broad basis of common human feeling there was the most perfect unanimity between pratt and pilgrim in the determination to drive away the obnoxious and too probably unqualified intruder as soon as possible whether the first wonderful cure he effected was on a patient of pratts or of pilgrims one was as ready as the other to pull the interloper by the nose and both alike directed their remarkable powers of conversation towards making the town too hot for him but by their respective patients these two distinguished men were pitted against each other with great virulence mrs lowme could not conceal her amazement that mrs phipps should trust her life in the hands of pratt who let her feed herself up to that degree it was really shocking to hear how short her breath was and mrs phipps had no patience with mrs lowme living as she did on tea and broth and looking as yellow as any crowflower and yet letting pilgrim bleed and blister her and give her lowering medicine till her clothes hung on her like a scarecrows on the whole perhaps mr pilgrims reputation was at the higher pitch and when any lady under mr pratts care was doing ill she was half disposed to think that a little more active treatment might suit her better but without very definite provocation no one would take so serious a step as to part with the family doctor for in those remote days there were few varieties of human hatred more formidable than the medical the doctors estimate even of a confiding patient was apt to rise and fall with the entries in the daybook and i have known mr pilgrim discover the most unexpected virtues in a patient seized with a promising illness at such times you might have been glad to perceive that there were some of mr pilgrims fellowcreatures of whom he entertained a high opinion and that he was liable to the amiable weakness of a too admiring estimate a good inflammation fired his enthusiasm and a lingering dropsy dissolved him into charity doubtless this crescendo of benevolence was partly due to feelings not at all represented by the entries in the daybook for in mr pilgrims heart too there was a latent store of tenderness and pity which flowed forth at the sight of suffering gradually however as his patients became convalescent his view of their characters became more dispassionate when they could relish muttonchops he began to admit that they had foibles and by the time they had swallowed their last dose of tonic he was alive to their most inexcusable faults after this the thermometer of his regard rested at the moderate point of friendly backbiting which sufficed to make him agreeable in his morning visits to the amiable and worthy persons who were yet far from convalescent  pratts patients were profoundly uninteresting to pilgrim their very diseases were despicable and he would hardly have thought their bodies worth dissecting but of all pratts patients mr jerome was the one on whom mr pilgrim heaped the most unmitigated contempt in spite of the surgeons wise tolerance dissent became odious to him in the person of mr jerome perhaps it was because that old gentleman being rich and having very large yearly bills for medical attendance on himself and his wife nevertheless employed prattneglected all the advantages of active treatment and paid away his money without getting his system lowered on any other ground it is hard to explain a feeling of hostility to mr jerome who was an excellent old gentleman expressing a great deal of goodwill towards his neighbours not only in imperfect english but in loans of money to the ostensibly rich and in sacks of potatoes to the obviously poor  assuredly milby had that salt of goodness which keeps the world together in greater abundance than was visible on the surface innocent babes were born there sweetening their parents hearts with simple joys men and women withering in disappointed worldliness or bloated with sensual ease had better moments in which they pressed the hand of suffering with sympathy and were moved to deeds of neighbourly kindness in church and in chapel there were honesthearted worshippers who strove to keep a conscience void of offence and even up the dimmest alleys you might have found here and there a wesleyan to whom methodism was the vehicle of peace on earth and goodwill to men to a superficial glance milby was nothing but dreary prose a dingy town surrounded by flat fields lopped elms and sprawling manufacturing villages which crept on and on with their weavingshops till they threatened to graft themselves on the town but the sweet spring came to milby notwithstanding the elmtops were red with buds the churchyard was starred with daisies the lark showered his lovemusic on the flat fields the rainbows hung over the dingy town clothing the very roofs and chimneys in a strange transfiguring beauty and so it was with the human life there which at first seemed a dismal mixture of griping worldliness vanity ostrich feathers and the fumes of brandy looking closer you found some purity gentleness and unselfishness as you may have observed a scented geranium giving forth its wholesome odours amidst blasphemy and gin in a noisy pothouse little deaf mrs crewe would often carry half her own spare dinner to the sick and hungry miss phipps with her cockade of red feathers had a filial heart and lighted her fathers pipe with a pleasant smile and there were greyhaired men in drab gaiters not at all noticeable as you passed them in the street whose integrity had been the basis of their rich neighbours wealth  such as the place was the people there were entirely contented with it they fancied life must be but a dull affair for that large portion of mankind who were necessarily shut out from an acquaintance with milby families and that it must be an advantage to london and liverpool that milby gentlemen occasionally visited those places on business but the inhabitants became more intensely conscious of the value they set upon all their advantages when innovation made its appearance in the person of the rev mr tryan the new curate at the chapelofease on paddiford common it was soon notorious in milby that mr tryan held peculiar opinions that he preached extempore that he was founding a religious lending library in his remote corner of the parish that he expounded the scriptures in cottages and that his preaching was attracting the dissenters and filling the very aisles of his church the rumour sprang up that evangelicalism had invaded milby parisha murrain or blight all the more terrible because its nature was but dimly conjectured perhaps milby was one of the last spots to be reached by the wave of a new movement and it was only now when the tide was just on the turn that the limpets there got a sprinkling mr tryan was the first evangelical clergyman who had risen above the milby horizon hitherto that obnoxious adjective had been unknown to the townspeople of any gentility and there were even many dissenters who considered evangelical simply a sort of baptismal name to the magazine which circulated among the congregation of salem chapel but now at length the disease had been imported when the parishioners were expecting it as little as the innocent red indians expected smallpox as long as mr tryans hearers were confined to paddiford commonwhich by the by was hardly recognizable as a common at all but was a dismal district where you heard the rattle of the handloom and breathed the smoke of coalpitsthe canting parson could be treated as a joke not so when a number of single ladies in the town appeared to be infected and even one or two men of substantial property with old mr landor the banker at their head seemed to be giving in to the new movementwhen mr tryan was known to be well received in several good houses where he was in the habit of finishing the evening with exhortation and prayer evangelicalism was no longer a nuisance existing merely in bycorners which any wellclad person could avoid it was invading the very drawingrooms mingling itself with the comfortable fumes of portwine and brandy threatening to deaden with its murky breath all the splendour of the ostrich feathers and to stifle milby ingenuousness not pretending to be better than its neighbours with a cloud of cant and lugubrious hypocrisy the alarm reached its climax when it was reported that mr tryan was endeavouring to obtain authority from mr prendergast the nonresident rector to establish a sunday evening lecture in the parish church on the ground that old mr crewe did not preach the gospel  it now first appeared how surprisingly high a value milby in general set on the ministrations of mr crewe how convinced it was that mr crewe was the model of a parish priest and his sermons the soundest and most edifying that had ever remained unheard by a churchgoing population all allusions to his brown wig were suppressed and by a rhetorical figure his name was associated with venerable grey hairs the attempted intrusion of mr tryan was an insult to a man deep in years and learning moreover it was an insolent effort to thrust himself forward in a parish where he was clearly distasteful to the superior portion of its inhabitants the town was divided into two zealous parties the tryanites and antitryanites and by the exertions of the eloquent dempster the antitryanite virulence was soon developed into an organized opposition a protest against the meditated evening lecture was framed by that orthodox attorney and after being numerously signed was to be carried to mr prendergast by three delegates representing the intellect morality and wealth of milby the intellect you perceive was to be personified in mr dempster the morality in mr budd and the wealth in mr tomlinson and the distinguished triad was to set out on its great mission as we have seen on the third day from that warm saturday evening when the conversation recorded in the previous chapter took place in the bar of the red lion     chapter 3   it was quite as warm on the following thursday evening when mr dempster and his colleagues were to return from their mission to elmstoke rectory but it was much pleasanter in mrs linnets parlour than in the bar of the red lion through the open window came the scent of mignonette and honeysuckle the grassplot in front of the house was shaded by a little plantation of gueldres roses syringas and laburnums the noise of looms and carts and unmelodious voices reached the ear simply as an agreeable murmur for mrs linnets house was situated quite on the outskirts of paddiford common and the only sound likely to disturb the serenity of the feminine party assembled there was the occasional buzz of intrusive wasps apparently mistaking each ladys head for a sugarbasin no sugarbasin was visible in mrs linnets parlour for the time of tea was not yet and the round table was littered with books which the ladies were covering with black canvass as a reinforcement of the new paddiford lending library miss linnet whose manuscript was the neatest type of zigzag was seated at a small table apart writing on green paper tickets which were to be pasted on the covers miss linnet had other accomplishments besides that of a neat manuscript and an index to some of them might be found in the ornaments of the room she had always combined a love of serious and poetical reading with her skill in fancywork and the neatlybound copies of drydens virgil hannah mores sacred dramas falconers shipwreck mason on selfknowledge rasselas and burke on the sublime and beautiful which were the chief ornaments of the bookcase were all inscribed with her name and had been bought with her pocketmoney when she was in her teens it must have been at least fifteen years since the latest of those purchases but miss linnets skill in fancywork appeared to have gone through more numerous phases than her literary taste for the japanned boxes the alum and sealingwax baskets the fandolls the transferred landscapes on the firescreens and the recent bouquets of waxflowers showed a disparity in freshness which made them referable to widely different periods waxflowers presuppose delicate fingers and robust patience but there are still many points of mind and person which they leave vague and problematic so i must tell you that miss linnet had dark ringlets a sallow complexion and an amiable disposition as to her features there was not much to criticize in them for she had little nose less lip and no eyebrow and as to her intellect her friend mrs pettifer often said she didnt know a more sensible person to talk to than mary linnet there was no one she liked better to come and take a quiet cup of tea with her and read a little of klopstocks messiah mary linnet had often told her a great deal of her mind when they were sitting together she said there were many things to bear in every condition of life and nothing should induce her to marry without a prospect of happiness once when mrs pettifer admired her waxflowers she said ah mrs pettifer think of the beauties of nature she always spoke very prettily did mary linnet very different indeed from rebecca  miss rebecca linnet indeed was not a general favourite while most people thought it a pity that a sensible woman like mary had not found a good husbandand even her female friends said nothing more illnatured of her than that her face was like a piece of putty with two scotch pebbles stuck in itrebecca was always spoken of sarcastically and it was a customary kind of banter with young ladies to recommend her as a wife to any gentleman they happened to be flirting withher fat her finery and her thick ankles sufficing to give piquancy to the joke notwithstanding the absence of novelty miss rebecca however possessed the accomplishment of music and her singing of oh no we never mention her and the soldiers tear was so desirable an accession to the pleasures of a teaparty that no one cared to offend her especially as rebecca had a high spirit of her own and in spite of her expansively rounded contour had a particularly sharp tongue her reading had been more extensive than her sisters embracing most of the fiction in mr procters circulating library and nothing but an acquaintance with the course of her studies could afford a clue to the rapid transitions in her dress which were suggested by the style of beauty whether sentimental sprightly or severe possessed by the heroine of the three volumes actually in perusal a piece of lace which drooped round the edge of her white bonnet one week had been rejected by the next and her cheeks which on whitsunday loomed through a turnerian haze of network were on trinity sunday seen reposing in distinct red outline on her shelving bust like the sun on a fogbank the black velvet meeting with a crystal clasp which one evening encircled her head had on another descended to her neck and on a third to her waist suggesting to an active imagination either a magical contraction of the ornament or a fearful ratio of expansion in miss rebeccas person with this constant application of art to dress she could have had little time for fancywork even if she had not been destitute of her sisters taste for that delightful and truly feminine occupation and here at least you perceive the justice of the milby opinion as to the relative suitability of the two miss linnets for matrimony when a man is happy enough to win the affections of a sweet girl who can soothe his cares with crochet and respond to all his most cherished ideas with beaded urnrugs and chaircovers in german wool he has at least a guarantee of domestic comfort whatever trials may await him out of doors what a resource it is under fatigue and irritation to have your drawingroom well supplied with small mats which would always be ready if you ever wanted to set anything on them and what styptic for a bleeding heart can equal copious squares of crochet which are useful for slipping down the moment you touch them how our fathers managed without crochet is the wonder but i believe some small and feeble substitute existed in their time under the name of tatting rebecca linnet however had neglected tatting as well as other forms of fancywork at school to be sure she had spent a great deal of time in acquiring flowerpainting according to the ingenious method then fashionable of applying the shapes of leaves and flowers cut out in cardboard and scrubbing a brush over the surface thus conveniently marked out but even the spillcases and handscreens which were her last halfyears performances in that way were not considered eminently successful and had long been consigned to the retirement of the best bedroom thus there was a good deal of family unlikeness between rebecca and her sister and i am afraid there was also a little family dislike but marys disapproval had usually been kept imprisoned behind her thin lips for rebecca was not only of a headstrong disposition but was her mothers pet the old lady being herself stout and preferring a more showy style of cap than she could prevail on her daughter mary to make up for her  but i have been describing miss rebecca as she was in former days only for her appearance this evening as she sits pasting on the green tickets is in striking contrast with what it was three or four months ago her plain grey gingham dress and plain white collar could never have belonged to her wardrobe before that date and though she is not reduced in size and her brown hair will do nothing but hang in crisp ringlets down her large cheeks there is a change in her air and expression which seems to shed a softened light over her person and make her look like a peony in the shade instead of the same flower flaunting in a parterre in the hot sunlight  no one could deny that evangelicalism had wrought a change for the better in rebecca linnets personnot even miss pratt the thin stiff lady in spectacles seated opposite to her who always had a peculiar repulsion for females with a gross habit of body miss pratt was an old maid but that is a no more definite description than if i had said she was in the autumn of life was it autumn when the orchards are fragrant with apples or autumn when the oaks are brown or autumn when the last yellow leaves are fluttering in the chill breeze the young ladies in milby would have told you that the miss linnets were old maids but the miss linnets were to miss pratt what the applescented september is to the bare nipping days of late november the miss linnets were in that temperate zone of oldmaidism when a woman will not say but that if a man of suitable years and character were to offer himself she might be induced to tread the remainder of lifes vale in company with him miss pratt was in that arctic region where a woman is confident that at no time of life would she have consented to give up her liberty and that she has never seen the man whom she would engage to honour and obey if the miss linnets were old maids they were old maids with natural ringlets and embonpoint not to say obesity miss pratt was an old maid with a cap a braided front a backbone and appendages miss pratt was the one bluestocking of milby possessing she said no less than five hundred volumes competent as her brother the doctor often observed to conduct a conversation on any topic whatever and occasionally dabbling a little in authorship though it was understood that she had never put forth the full powers of her mind in print her letters to a young man on his entrance into life and de courcy or the rash promise a tale for youth were mere trifles which she had been induced to publish because they were calculated for popular utility but they were nothing to what she had for years had by her in manuscript her latest production had been six stanzas addressed to the rev edgar tryan printed on glazed paper with a neat border and beginning forward young wrestler for the truth  miss pratt having kept her brothers house during his long widowhood his daughter miss eliza had had the advantage of being educated by her aunt and thus of imbibing a very strong antipathy to all that remarkable womans tastes and opinions the silent handsome girl of twoandtwenty who is covering the memoirs of felix neff is miss eliza pratt and the small elderly lady in dowdy clothing who is also working diligently is mrs pettifer a superiorminded widow much valued in milby being such a very respectable person to have in the house in case of illness and of quite too good a family to receive any moneypaymentyou could always send her gardenstuff that would make her ample amends miss pratt has enough to do in commenting on the heap of volumes before her feeling it a responsibility entailed on her by her great powers of mind to leave nothing without the advantage of her opinion whatever was good must be sprinkled with the chrism of her approval whatever was evil must be blighted by her condemnation  upon my word she said in a deliberate high voice as if she were dictating to an amanuensis it is a most admirable selection of works for popular reading this that our excellent mr tryan has made i do not know whether if the task had been confided to me i could have made a selection combining in a higher degree religious instruction and edification with a due admixture of the purer species of amusement this story of father clement is a library in itself on the errors of romanism i have ever considered fiction a suitable form for conveying moral and religious instruction as i have shown in my little work de courcy which as a very clever writer in the crompton argus said at the time of its appearance is the light vehicle of a weighty moral  one ud think said mrs linnet who also had her spectacles on but chiefly for the purpose of seeing what the others were doing there didnt want much to drive people away from a religion as makes em walk barefoot over stone floors like that girl in father clementsending the blood up to the head frightful anybody might see that was an unnatral creed  yes said miss pratt but asceticism is not the root of the error as mr tryan was telling us the other eveningit is the denial of the great doctrine of justification by faith much as i had reflected on all subjects in the course of my life i am indebted to mr tryan for opening my eyes to the full importance of that cardinal doctrine of the reformation from a child i had a deep sense of religion but in my early days the gospel light was obscured in the english church notwithstanding the possession of our incomparable liturgy than which i know no human composition more faultless and sublime as i tell eliza i was not blest as she is at the age of twoandtwenty in knowing a clergyman who unites all that is great and admirable in intellect with the highest spiritual gifts i am no contemptible judge of a mans acquirements and i assure you i have tested mr tryans by questions which are a pretty severe touchstone it is true i sometimes carry him a little beyond the depth of the other listeners profound learning continued miss pratt shutting her spectacles and tapping them on the book before her has not many to estimate it in milby  miss pratt said rebecca will you please give me scotts force of truth therethat small book lying against the life of legh richmond  thats a book im very fond ofthe life of legh richmond said mrs linnet he found out all about that woman at tutbury as pretended to live without eating stuff and nonsense  mrs linnet had become a reader of religious books since mr tryans advent and as she was in the habit of confining her perusal to the purely secular portions which bore a very small proportion to the whole she could make rapid progress through a large number of volumes on taking up the biography of a celebrated preacher she immediately turned to the end to see what disease he died of and if his legs swelled as her own occasionally did she felt a stronger interest in ascertaining any earlier facts in the history of the dropsical divinewhether he had ever fallen off a stage coach whether he had married more than one wife and in general any adventures or repartees recorded of him previous to the epoch of his conversion she then glanced over the letters and diary and wherever there was a predominance of zion the river of life and notes of exclamation she turned over to the next page but any passage in which she saw such promising nouns as smallpox pony or boots and shoes at once arrested her  it is halfpast six now said miss linnet looking at her watch as the servant appeared with the teatray i suppose the delegates are come back by this time if mr tryan had not so kindly promised to call and let us know i should hardly rest without walking to milby myself to know what answer they have brought back it is a great privilege for us mr tryan living at mrs wagstaffs for he is often able to take us on his way backwards and forwards into the town  i wonder if theres another man in the world who has been brought up as mr tryan has that would choose to live in those small close rooms on the common among heaps of dirty cottages for the sake of being near the poor people said mrs pettifer im afraid he hurts his health by it he looks to me far from strong  ah said miss pratt i understand he is of a highly respectable family indeed in huntingdonshire i heard him myself speak of his fathers carriagequite incidentally you knowand eliza tells me what very fine cambric handkerchiefs he uses my eyes are not good enough to see such things but i know what breeding is as well as most people and it is easy to see that mr tryan is quite comme il faw to use a french expression  i should like to tell him better nor use fine cambric i this place where theres such washing its a shame to be seen said mrs linnet hell get em tore to pieces good lawn ud be far better i saw what a colour his linen looked at the sacrament last sunday marys making him a black silk case to hold his bands but i told her shed more need wash em for him  o mother said rebecca with solemn severity pray dont think of pockethandkerchiefs and linen when we are talking of such a man and at this moment too when he is perhaps having to bear a heavy blow we have more need to help him by prayer as aaron and hur held up the hands of moses we dont know but wickedness may have triumphed and mr prendergast may have consented to forbid the lecture there have been dispensations quite as mysterious and satan is evidently putting forth all his strength to resist the entrance of the gospel into milby church  you niver spoke a truer word than that my dear said mrs linnet who accepted all religious phrases but was extremely rationalistic in her interpretation for if iver old harry appeared in a human form its that dempster it was all through him as we got cheated out o pyes croft making out as the title wasnt good such lawyers villany as if paying good money wasnt title enough to anything if your father as is dead and gone had been worthy to know it but hell have a fall some day dempster will mark my words  ah out of his carriage you mean said miss pratt who in the movement occasioned by the clearing of the table had lost the first part of mrs linnets speech it certainly is alarming to see him driving home from rotherby flogging his galloping horse like a madman my brother has often said he expected every thursday evening to be called in to set some of dempsters bones but i suppose he may drop that expectation now for we are given to understand from good authority that he has forbidden his wife to call my brother in again either to herself or her mother he swears no tryanite doctor shall attend his family i have reason to believe that pilgrim was called in to mrs dempsters mother the other day  poor mrs raynor shes glad to do anything for the sake of peace and quietness said mrs pettifer but its no trifle at her time of life to part with a doctor who knows her constitution  what trouble that poor woman has to bear in her old age said mary linnet to see her daughter leading such a lifean only daughter too that she doats on  yes indeed said miss pratt we of course know more about it than most people my brother having attended the family so many years for my part i never thought well of the marriage and i endeavoured to dissuade my brother when mrs raynor asked him to give janet away at the wedding if you will take my advice richard i said you will have nothing to do with that marriage and he has seen the justice of my opinion since mrs raynor herself was against the connection at first but she always spoiled janet and i fear too she was won over by a foolish pride in having her daughter marry a professional man i fear it was so no one but myself i think foresaw the extent of the evil  well said mrs pettifer janet had nothing to look forward to but being a governess and it was hard for mrs raynor to have to work at millineringa woman well brought up and her husband a man who held his head as high as any man in thurston and it isnt everybody that sees everything fifteen years beforehand robert dempster was the cleverest man in milby and there werent many young men fit to talk to janet  it is a thousand pities said miss pratt choosing to ignore mrs pettifers slight sarcasm for i certainly did consider janet raynor the most promising young woman of my acquaintancea little too much lifted up perhaps by her superior education and too much given to satire but able to express herself very well indeed about any book i recommended to her perusal there is no young woman in milby now who can be compared with what janet was when she was married either in mind or person i consider miss landor far far below her indeed i cannot say much for the mental superiority of the young ladies in our first families they are superficialvery superficial  she made the handsomest bride that ever came out of milby church too said mrs pettifer such a very fine figure and it showed off her white poplin so well and what a pretty smile janet always had poor thing she keeps that now for all her old friends i never see her but she has something pretty to say to meliving in the same street you know i cant help seeing her often though ive never been to the house since dempster broke out on me in one of his drunken fits she comes to me sometimes poor thing looking so strange anybody passing her in the street may see plain enough whats the matter but shes always got some little goodnatured plan in her head for all that only last night i met her i saw five yards off she wasnt fit to be out but she had a basin in her hand full of something she was carrying to sally martin the deformed girl thats in a consumption  but she is just as bitter against mr tryan as her husband is i understand said rebecca her heart is very much set against the truth for i understand she bought mr tryans sermons on purpose to ridicule them to mrs crewe  well poor thing said mrs pettifer you know she stands up for everything her husband says and does she never will admit to anybody that he is not a good husband  that is her pride said miss pratt she married him in opposition to the advice of her best friends and now she is not willing to admit that she was wrong why even to my brotherand a medical attendant you know can hardly fail to be acquainted with family secretsshe has always pretended to have the highest respect for her husbands qualities poor mrs raynor however is very well aware that every one knows the real state of things latterly she has not even avoided the subject with me the very last time i called on her she said have you been to see my poor daughter and burst into tears  pride or no pride said mrs pettifer i shall always stand up for janet dempster she sat up with me night after night when i had that attack of rheumatic fever six years ago theres great excuses for her when a woman cant think of her husband coming home without trembling its enough to make her drink something to blunt her feelingsand no children either to keep her from it you and me might do the same if we were in her place  speak for yourself mrs pettifer said miss pratt under no circumstances can i imagine myself resorting to a practice so degrading a woman should find support in her own strength of mind  i think said rebecca who considered miss pratt still very blind in spiritual things notwithstanding her assumption of enlightenment she will find poor support if she trusts only to her own strength she must seek aid elsewhere than in herself  happily the removal of the teathings just then created a little confusion which aided miss pratt to repress her resentment at rebeccas presumption in correcting hera person like rebecca linnet who six months ago was as flighty and vain a woman as miss pratt had ever known so very unconscious of her unfortunate person  the ladies had scarcely been seated at their work another hour when the sun was sinking and the clouds that flecked the sky to the very zenith were every moment taking on a brighter gold the gate of the little garden opened and miss linnet seated at her small table near the window saw mr tryan enter  there is mr tryan she said and her pale cheek was lighted up with a little blush that would have made her look more attractive to almost any one except miss eliza pratt whose fine grey eyes allowed few things to escape her silent observation mary linnet gets more and more in love with mr tryan thought miss eliza it is really pitiable to see such feelings in a woman of her age with those oldmaidish little ringlets i daresay she flatters herself mr tryan may fall in love with her because he makes her useful among the poor at the same time miss eliza as she bent her handsome head and large cannon curls with apparent calmness over her work felt a considerable internal flutter when she heard the knock at the door rebecca had less selfcommand she felt too much agitated to go on with her pasting and clutched the leg of the table to counteract the trembling in her hands  poor womens hearts heaven forbid that i should laugh at you and make cheap jests on your susceptibility towards the clerical sex as if it had nothing deeper or more lovely in it than the mere vulgar angling for a husband even in these enlightened days many a curate who considered abstractedly is nothing more than a sleek bimanous animal in a white neckcloth with views more or less anglican and furtively addicted to the flute is adored by a girl who has coarse brothers or by a solitary woman who would like to be a helpmate in good works beyond her own means simply because he seems to them the model of refinement and of public usefulness what wonder then that in milby society such as i have told you it was a very long while ago a zealous evangelical clergyman aged thirtythree called forth all the little agitations that belong to the divine necessity of loving implanted in the miss linnets with their seven or eight lustrums and their unfashionable ringlets no less than in miss eliza pratt with her youthful bloom and her ample cannon curls  but mr tryan has entered the room and the strange light from the golden sky falling on his lightbrown hair which is brushed high up round his head makes it look almost like an aureole his grey eyes too shine with unwonted brilliancy this evening they were not remarkable eyes but they accorded completely in their changing light with the changing expression of his person which indicated the paradoxical character often observable in a largelimbed sanguine blond at once mild and irritable gentle and overbearing indolent and resolute selfconscious and dreamy except that the wellfilled lips had something of the artificially compressed look which is often the sign of a struggle to keep the dragon undermost and that the complexion was rather pallid giving the idea of imperfect health mr tryans face in repose was that of an ordinary whiskerless blond and it seemed difficult to refer a certain air of distinction about him to anything in particular unless it were his delicate hands and wellshapen feet  it was a great anomaly to the milby mind that a canting evangelical parson who would take tea with tradespeople and make friends of vulgar women like the linnets should have so much the air of a gentleman and be so little like the splayfooted mr stickney of salem to whom he approximated so closely in doctrine and this want of correspondence between the physique and the creed had excited no less surprise in the larger town of laxeter where mr tryan had formerly held a curacy for of the two other low church clergymen in the neighbourhood one was a welshman of globose figure and unctuous complexion and the other a man of atrabiliar aspect with lank black hair and a redundance of limp cravatin fact the sort of thing you might expect in men who distributed the publications of the religious tract society and introduced dissenting hymns into the church  mr tryan shook hands with mrs linnet bowed with rather a preoccupied air to the other ladies and seated himself in the large horsehair easychair which had been drawn forward for him while the ladies ceased from their work and fixed their eyes on him awaiting the news he had to tell them  it seems he began in a low and silvery tone i need a lesson of patience there has been something wrong in my thought or action about this evening lecture i have been too much bent on doing good to milby after my own plantoo reliant on my own wisdom  mr tryan paused he was struggling against inward irritation  the delegates are come back then has mr prendergast given way has dempster succeededwere the eager questions of three ladies at once  yes the town is in an uproar as we were sitting in mr landors drawingroom we heard a loud cheering and presently mr thrupp the clerk at the bank who had been waiting at the red lion to hear the result came to let us know he said dempster had been making a speech to the mob out the window they were distributing drink to the people and hoisting placards in great lettersdown with the tryanites down with cant they had a hideous caricature of me being trippedup and pitched headforemost out of the pulpit good old mr landor would insist on sending me round in the carriage he thought i should not be safe from the mob but i got down at the crossways the row was evidently preconcerted by dempster before he set out he made sure of succeeding  mr tryans utterance had been getting rather louder and more rapid in the course of this speech and he now added in the energetic chestvoice which both in and out of the pulpit alternated continually with his more silvery notesbut his triumph will be a short one if he thinks he can intimidate me by obloquy or threats he has mistaken the man he has to deal with mr dempster and his colleagues will find themselves checkmated after all mr prendergast has been false to his own conscience in this business he knows as well as i do that he is throwing away the souls of the people by leaving things as they are in the parish but i shall appeal to the bishopi am confident of his sympathy  the bishop will be coming shortly i suppose said miss pratt to hold a confirmation  yes but i shall write to him at once and lay the case before him indeed i must hurry away now for i have many matters to attend to you ladies have been kindly helping me with your labours i see continued mr tryan politely glancing at the canvasscovered books as he rose from his seat then turning to mary linnet our library is really getting on i think you and your sister have quite a heavy task of distribution now  poor rebecca felt it very hard to bear that mr tryan did not turn towards her too if he knew how much she entered into his feelings about the lecture and the interest she took in the library well perhaps it was her lot to be overlookedand it might be a token of mercy even a good man might not always know the heart that was most with him but the next moment poor mary had a pang when mr tryan turned to miss eliza pratt and the preoccupied expression of his face melted into that beaming timidity with which a man almost always addresses a pretty woman  i have to thank you too miss eliza for seconding me so well in your visits to joseph mercer the old man tells me how precious he finds your reading to him now he is no longer able to go to church  miss eliza only answered by a blush which made her look all the handsomer but her aunt saidyes mr tryan i have ever inculcated on my dear eliza the importance of spending her leisure in being useful to her fellowcreatures your example and instruction have been quite in the spirit of the system which i have always pursued though we are indebted to you for a clearer view of the motives that should actuate us in our pursuit of good works not that i can accuse myself of having ever had a selfrighteous spirit but my humility was rather instinctive than based on a firm ground of doctrinal knowledge such as you so admirably impart to us  mrs linnets usual entreaty that mr tryan would have somethingsome wine and water and a biscuit was just here a welcome relief from the necessity of answering miss pratts oration  not anything my dear mrs linnet thank you you forget what a rechabite i am by the by when i went this morning to see a poor girl in butchers lane whom i had heard of as being in a consumption i found mrs dempster there i had often met her in the street but did not know it was mrs dempster it seems she goes among the poor a good deal she is really an interestinglooking woman i was quite surprised for i have heard the worst account of her habitsthat she is almost as bad as her husband she went out hastily as soon as i entered but apologetically i am keeping you all standing and i must really hurry away mrs pettifer i have not had the pleasure of calling on you for some time i shall take an early opportunity of going your way good evening good evening     chapter 4   mr tryan was right in saying that the row in milby had been preconcerted by dempster the placards and the caricature were prepared before the departure of the delegates and it had been settled that mat paine dempsters clerk should ride out on thursday morning to meet them at whitlow the last place where they would change horses that he might gallop back and prepare an ovation for the triumvirate in case of their success dempster had determined to dine at whitlow so that mat paine was in milby again two hours before the entrance of the delegates and had time to send a whisper up the back streets that there was promise of a spree in the bridge way as well as to assemble two knots of picked menone to feed the flame of orthodox zeal with ginandwater at the green man near high street the other to solidify their church principles with heady beer at the bear and ragged staff in the bridge way  the bridge way was an irregular straggling street where the town fringed off raggedly into the whitlow road rows of new redbrick houses in which ribbonlooms were rattling behind long lines of window alternating with old halfthatched halftiled cottagesone of those dismal wide streets where dirt and misery have no long shadows thrown on them to soften their ugliness here about halfpast five oclock silly caleb an idiot well known in dog lane but more of a stranger in the bridge way was seen slouching along with a string of boys hooting at his heels presently another group for the most part out at elbows came briskly in the same direction looking round them with an air of expectation and at no long interval deb traunter in a pink flounced gown and floating ribbons was observed talking with great affability to two men in sealskin caps and fustian who formed her cortege the bridge way began to have a presentiment of something in the wind phib cook left her evening washtub and appeared at her door in soapsuds a bonnetpoke and general dampness three narrowchested ribbonweavers in rusty black streaked with shreds of manycoloured silk sauntered out with their hands in their pockets and molly beale a brawny old virago descrying wiry dame ricketts peeping out from her entry seized the opportunity of renewing the mornings skirmish in short the bridge way was in that state of excitement which is understood to announce a demonstration on the part of the british public and the afflux of remote townsmen increasing there was soon so large a crowd that it was time for bill powers a plethoric goliath who presided over the knot of beerdrinkers at the bear and ragged staff to issue forth with his companions and like the enunciator of the ancient myth make the assemblage distinctly conscious of the common sentiment that had drawn them together the expectation of the delegates chaise added to the fight between molly beale and dame ricketts and the illadvised appearance of a lean bullterrier were a sufficient safetyvalve to the popular excitement during the remaining quarter of an hour at the end of which the chaise was seen approaching along the whitlow road with oak boughs ornamenting the horses heads and to quote the account of this interesting scene which was sent to the rotherby guardian loud cheers immediately testified to the sympathy of the honest fellows collected there with the publicspirited exertions of their fellowtownsmen bill powers whose bloodshot eyes bent hat and protuberant altitude marked him out as the natural leader of the assemblage undertook to interpret the common sentiment by stopping the chaise advancing to the door with raised hat and begging to know of mr dempster whether the rector had forbidden the canting lecture  yes yes said mr dempster keep up a jolly good hurray  no public duty could have been more easy and agreeable to mr powers and his associates and the chorus swelled all the way to the high street where by a mysterious coincidence often observable in these spontaneous demonstrations large placards on long poles were observed to shoot upwards from among the crowd principally in the direction of tuckers lane where the green man was situated one bore down with the tryanites another no cant another long live our venerable curate and one in still larger letters sound church principles and no hypocrisy but a still more remarkable impromptu was a huge caricature of mr tryan in gown and band with an enormous aureole of yellow hair and upturned eyes standing on the pulpit stairs and trying to pull down old mr crewe groans yells and hisseshisses yells and groansonly stemmed by the appearance of another caricature representing mr tryan being pitched headforemost from the pulpit stairs by a hand which the artist either from subtilty of intention or want of space had left unindicated in the midst of the tremendous cheering that saluted this piece of symbolical art the chaise had reached the door of the red lion and loud cries of dempster for ever with a feebler cheer now and then for tomlinson and budd were presently responded to by the appearance of the publicspirited attorney at the large upper window where also were visible a little in the background the small sleek head of mr budd and the blinking countenance of mr tomlinson  mr dempster held his hat in his hand and poked his head forward with a butting motion by way of bow a storm of cheers subsided at last into dropping sounds of silence hear him go it dempster and the lawyers rasping voice became distinctly audible  fellowtownsmen it gives us the sincerest pleasurei speak for my respected colleagues as well as myselfto witness these strong proofs of your attachment to the principles of our excellent church and your zeal for the honour of our venerable pastor but it is no more than i expected of you i know you well ive known you for the last twenty years to be as honest and respectable a set of ratepayers as any in this county your hearts are sound to the core no man had better try to thrust his cant and hypocrisy down your throats youre used to wash them with liquor of a better flavour this is the proudest moment in my own life and i think i may say in that of my colleagues in which i have to tell you that our exertions in the cause of sound religion and manly morality have been crowned with success yes my fellowtownsmen i have the gratification of announcing to you thus formally what you have already learned indirectly the pulpit from which our venerable pastor has fed us with sound doctrine for half a century is not to be invaded by a fanatical sectarian doublefaced jesuitical interloper we are not to have our young people demoralized and corrupted by the temptations to vice notoriously connected with sunday evening lectures we are not to have a preacher obtruding himself upon us who decries good works and sneaks into our homes perverting the faith of our wives and daughters we are not to be poisoned with doctrines which damp every innocent enjoyment and pick a poor mans pocket of the sixpence with which he might buy himself a cheerful glass after a hard days work under pretence of paying for bibles to send to the chicktaws  but im not going to waste your valuable time with unnecessary words i am a man of deeds ay damn you that you are and you charge well for em too said a voice from the crowd probably that of a gentleman who was immediately afterwards observed with his hat crushed over his head i shall always be at the service of my fellowtownsmen and whoever dares to hector over you or interfere with your innocent pleasures shall have an account to settle with robert dempster  now my boys you cant do better than disperse and carry the good news to all your fellowtownsmen whose hearts are as sound as your own let some of you go one way and some another that every man woman and child in milby may know what you know yourselves but before we part let us have three cheers for true religion and down with cant  when the last cheer was dying mr dempster closed the window and the judiciouslyinstructed placards and caricatures moved off in divers directions followed by larger or smaller divisions of the crowd the greatest attraction apparently lay in the direction of dog lane the outlet towards paddiford common whither the caricatures were moving and you foresee of course that those works of symbolical art were consumed with a liberal expenditure of dry gorsebushes and vague shouting  after these great public exertions it was natural that mr dempster and his colleagues should feel more in need than usual of a little social relaxation and a party of their friends was already beginning to assemble in the large parlour of the red lion convened partly by their own curiosity and partly by the invaluable mat paine the most capacious punchbowl was put in requisition and that born gentleman mr lowme seated opposite mr dempster as vice undertook to brew the punch defying the criticisms of the envious men out of office who with the readiness of irresponsibility ignorantly suggested more lemons the social festivities were continued till long past midnight when several friends of sound religion were conveyed home with some difficulty one of them showing a dogged determination to seat himself in the gutter  mr dempster had done as much justice to the punch as any of the party and his friend boots though aware that the lawyer could carry his liquor like old nick with whose social demeanour boots seemed to be particularly well acquainted nevertheless thought it might be as well to see so good a customer in safety to his own door and walked quietly behind his elbow out of the innyard dempster however soon became aware of him stopped short and turning slowly round upon him recognized the wellknown drab waistcoat sleeves conspicuous enough in the starlight  you twopenny scoundrel what do you mean by dogging a professional mans footsteps in this way ill break every bone in your skin if you attempt to track me like a beastly cur sniffing at ones pocket do you think a gentleman will make his way home any the better for having the scent of your blackingbottle thrust up his nostrils  boots slunk back in more amusement than illhumour thinking the lawyers rum talk was doubtless part and parcel of his professional ability and mr dempster pursued his slow way alone  his house lay in orchard street which opened on the prettiest outskirt of the townthe church the parsonage and a long stretch of green fields it was an oldfashioned house with an overhanging upper storey outside it had a face of rough stucco and casement windows with green frames and shutters inside it was full of long passages and rooms with low ceilings there was a large heavy knocker on the green door and though mr dempster carried a latchkey he sometimes chose to use the knocker he chose to do so now the thunder resounded through orchard street and after a single minute there was a second clap louder than the first another minute and still the door was not opened whereupon mr dempster muttering took out his latchkey and with less difficulty than might have been expected thrust it into the door when he opened the door the passage was dark  janet in the loudest rasping tone was the next sound that rang through the house  janet againbefore a slow step was heard on the stairs and a distant light began to flicker on the wall of the passage  curse you you creeping idiot come faster cant you  yet a few seconds and the figure of a tall woman holding aslant a heavyplated drawingroom candlestick appeared at the turning of the passage that led to the broader entrance  she had on a light dress which sat loosely about her figure but did not disguise its liberal graceful outline a heavy mass of straight jetblack hair had escaped from its fastening and hung over her shoulders her grandlycut features pale with the natural paleness of a brunette had premature lines about them telling that the years had been lengthened by sorrow and the delicatelycurved nostril which seemed made to quiver with the proud consciousness of power and beauty must have quivered to the heartpiercing griefs which had given that worn look to the corners of the mouth her wide open black eyes had a strangely fixed sightless gaze as she paused at the turning and stood silent before her husband  ill teach you to keep me waiting in the dark you pale staring fool he said advancing with his slow drunken step what youve been drinking again have you ill beat you into your senses  he laid his hand with a firm grip on her shoulder turned her round and pushed her slowly before him along the passage and through the diningroom door which stood open on their left hand  there was a portrait of janets mother a greyhaired darkeyed old woman in a neatly fluted cap hanging over the mantelpiece surely the aged eyes take on a look of anguish as they see janetnot trembling no it would be better if she trembledstanding stupidly unmoved in her great beauty while the heavy arm is lifted to strike her the blow falls anotherand another surely the mother hears that cryo robert pity pity  poor greyhaired woman was it for this you suffered a mothers pangs in your lone widowhood fiveandthirty years ago was it for this you kept the little worn morocco shoes janet had first run in and kissed them day by day when she was away from you a tall girl at school was it for this you looked proudly at her when she came back to you in her rich pale beauty like a tall white arum that has just unfolded its grand pure curves to the sun  the mother lies sleepless and praying in her lonely house weeping the difficult tears of age because she dreads this may be a cruel night for her child  she too has a picture over her mantelpiece drawn in chalk by janet long years ago she looked at it before she went to bed it is a head bowed beneath a cross and wearing a crown of thorns     chapter 5   it was halfpast nine oclock in the morning the midsummer sun was already warm on the roofs and weathercocks of milby the churchbells were ringing and many families were conscious of sunday sensations chiefly referable to the fact that the daughters had come down to breakfast in their best frocks and with their hair particularly well dressed for it was not sunday but wednesday and though the bishop was going to hold a confirmation and to decide whether or not there should be a sunday evening lecture in milby the sunbeams had the usual workingday look to the haymakers already long out in the fields and to laggard weavers just setting up their weeks piece the notion of its being sunday was the strongest in young ladies like miss phipps who was going to accompany her younger sister to the confirmation and to wear a sweetly pretty transparent bonnet with marabout feathers on the interesting occasion thus throwing into relief the suitable simplicity of her sisters attire who was of course to appear in a new white frock or in the pupils at miss townleys who were absolved from all lessons and were going to church to see the bishop and to hear the honourable and reverend mr prendergast the rector read prayersa high intellectual treat as miss townley assured them it seemed only natural that a rector who was honourable should read better than old mr crewe who was only a curate and not honourable and when little clara robins wondered why some clergymen were rectors and others not ellen marriott assured her with great confidence that it was only the clever men who were made rectors ellen marriott was going to be confirmed she was a short fair plump girl with blue eyes and sandy hair which was this morning arranged in taller cannon curls than usual for the reception of the episcopal benediction and some of the young ladies thought her the prettiest girl in the school but others gave the preference to her rival maria gardner who was much taller and had a lovely crop of darkbrown ringlets and who being also about to take upon herself the vows made in her name at her baptism had oiled and twisted her ringlets with especial care as she seated herself at the breakfasttable before miss townleys entrance to dispense the weak coffee her crop excited so strong a sensation that ellen marriott was at length impelled to look at it and to say with suppressed but bitter sarcasm is that miss gardners head yes said maria amiable and stuttering and no match for ellen in retort thththis is my head then i dont admire it at all was the crushing rejoinder of ellen followed by a murmur of approval among her friends young ladies i suppose exhaust their sac of venom in this way at school that is the reason why they have such a harmless tooth for each other in after life  the only other candidate for confirmation at miss townleys was mary dunn a drapers daughter in milby and a distant relation of the miss linnets her pale lanky hair could never be coaxed into permanent curl and this morning the heat had brought it down to its natural condition of lankiness earlier than usual but that was not what made her sit melancholy and apart at the lower end of the form her parents were admirers of mr tryan and had been persuaded by the miss linnets influence to insist that their daughter should be prepared for confirmation by him over and above the preparation given to miss townleys pupils by mr crewe poor mary dunn i am afraid she thought it too heavy a price to pay for these spiritual advantages to be excluded from every game at ball to be obliged to walk with none but little girlsin fact to be the object of an aversion that nothing short of an incessant supply of plumcakes would have neutralized and mrs dunn was of opinion that plumcake was unwholesome the antitryanite spirit you perceive was very strong at miss townleys imported probably by day scholars as well as encouraged by the fact that that clever woman was herself strongly opposed to innovation and remarked every sunday that mr crewe had preached an excellent discourse poor mary dunn dreaded the moment when schoolhours would be over for then she was sure to be the butt of those very explicit remarks which in young ladies as well as young gentlemens seminaries constitute the most subtle and delicate form of the innuendo id never be a tryanite would you o here comes the lady that knows so much more about religion than we do some people think themselves so very pious  it is really surprising that young ladies should not be thought competent to the same curriculum as young gentlemen i observe that their powers of sarcasm are quite equal and if there had been a genteel academy for young gentlemen at milby i am inclined to think that notwithstanding euclid and the classics the party spirit there would not have exhibited itself in more pungent irony or more incisive satire than was heard in miss townleys seminary but there was no such academy the existence of the grammarschool under mr crewes superintendence probably discouraging speculations of that kind and the genteel youths of milby were chiefly come home for the midsummer holidays from distant schools several of us had just assumed coattails and the assumption of new responsibilities apparently following as a matter of course we were among the candidates for confirmation i wish i could say that the solemnity of our feelings was on a level with the solemnity of the occasion but unimaginative boys find it difficult to recognize apostolical institutions in their developed form and i fear our chief emotion concerning the ceremony was a sense of sheepishness and our chief opinion the speculative and heretical position that it ought to be confined to the girls it was a pity you will say but it is the way with us men in other crises that come a long while after confirmation the golden moments in the stream of life rush past us and we see nothing but sand the angels come to visit us and we only know them when they are gone  but as i said the morning was sunny the bells were ringing the ladies of milby were dressed in their sunday garments  and who is this brightlooking woman walking with hasty step along orchard street so early with a large nosegay in her hand can it be janet dempster on whom we looked with such deep pity one sad midnight hardly a fortnight ago yes no other woman in milby has those searching black eyes that tall graceful unconstrained figure set off by her simple muslin dress and black lace shawl that massy black hair now so neatly braided in glossy contrast with the white satin ribbons of her modest cap and bonnet no other woman has that sweet speaking smile with which she nods to jonathan lamb the old parish clerk and ahnow she comes nearerthere are those sad lines about the mouth and eyes on which that sweet smile plays like sunbeams on the stormbeaten beauty of the full and ripened corn  she is turning out of orchard street and making her way as fast as she can to her mothers house a pleasant cottage facing a roadside meadow from which the hay is being carried mrs raynor has had her breakfast and is seated in her armchair reading when janet opens the door saying in her most playful voiceplease mother im come to show myself to you before i go to the parsonage have i put on my pretty cap and bonnet to satisfy you  mrs raynor looked over her spectacles and met her daughters glance with eyes as dark and loving as her own she was a much smaller woman than janet both in figure and feature the chief resemblance lying in the eyes and the clear brunette complexion the mothers hair had long been grey and was gathered under the neatest of caps made by her own clever fingers as all janets caps and bonnets were too they were wellpractised fingers for mrs raynor had supported herself in her widowhood by keeping a millinery establishment and in this way had earned money enough to give her daughter what was then thought a firstrate education as well as to save a sum which eked out by her soninlaw sufficed to support her in her solitary old age always the same clean neat old lady dressed in black silk was mrs raynor a patient brave woman who bowed with resignation under the burden of remembered sorrow and bore with meek fortitude the new load that the new days brought with them  your bonnet wants pulling a trifle forwarder my child she said smiling and taking off her spectacles while janet at once knelt down before her and waited to be set to rights as she would have done when she was a child youre going straight to mrs crewes i suppose are those flowers to garnish the dishes  no indeed mother this is a nosegay for the middle of the table ive sent up the dinnerservice and the ham we had cooked at our house yesterday and betty is coming directly with the garnish and the plate we shall get our good mrs crewe through her troubles famously dear tiny woman you should have seen her lift up her hands yesterday and pray heaven to take her before ever she should have another collation to get ready for the bishop she said its bad enough to have the archdeacon though he doesnt want half so many jellyglasses i wouldnt mind janet if it was to feed all the old hungry cripples in milby but so much trouble and expense for people who eat too much every day of their lives we had such a cleaning and furbishingup of the sittingroom yesterday nothing will ever do away with the smell of mr crewes pipes you know but we have thrown it into the background with yellow soap and dry lavender and now i must run away you will come to church mother  yes my dear i wouldnt lose such a pretty sight it does my old eyes good to see so many fresh young faces is your husband going  yes robert will be there ive made him as neat as a new pin this morning and he says the bishop will think him too buckish by half i took him into mammy dempsters room to show himself we hear tryan is making sure of the bishops support but we shall see i would give my crooked guinea and all the luck it will ever bring me to have him beaten for i cant endure the sight of the man coming to harass dear old mr and mrs crewe in their last days preaching the gospel indeed that is the best gospel that makes everybody happy and comfortable isnt it mother  ah child im afraid theres no gospel will do that here below  well i can do something to comfort mrs crewe at least so give me a kiss and goodbye till churchtime  the mother leaned back in her chair when janet was gone and sank into a painful reverie when our life is a continuous trial the moments of respite seem only to substitute the heaviness of dread for the heaviness of actual suffering the curtain of cloud seems parted an instant only that we may measure all its horror as it hangs low black and imminent in contrast with the transient brightness the water drops that visit the parched lips in the desert bear with them only the keen imagination of thirst janet looked glad and tender nowbut what scene of misery was coming next she was too like the cistus flowers in the little garden before the window that with the shades of evening might lie with the delicate white and glossy dark of their petals trampled in the roadside dust when the sun had sunk and the twilight was deepening janet might be sitting there heated maddened sobbing out her griefs with selfish passion and wildly wishing herself dead  mrs raynor had been reading about the lost sheep and the joy there is in heaven over the sinner that repenteth surely the eternal love she believed in through all the sadness of her lot would not leave her child to wander farther and farther into the wilderness till here was no turningthe child so lovely so pitiful to others so good till she was goaded into sin by womans bitterest sorrows mrs raynor had her faith and her spiritual comforts though she was not in the least evangelical and knew nothing of doctrinal zeal i fear most of mr tryans hearers would have considered her destitute of saving knowledge and i am quite sure she had no welldefined views on justification nevertheless she read her bible a great deal and thought she found divine lessons therehow to bear the cross meekly and be merciful let us hope that there is a saving ignorance and that mrs raynor was justified without knowing exactly how  she tried to have hope and trust though it was hard to believe that the future would be anything else than the harvest of the seed that was being sown before her eyes but always there is seed being sown silently and unseen and everywhere there come sweet flowers without our foresight or labour we reap what we sow but nature has love over and above that justice and gives us shadow and blossom and fruit that spring from no planting of ours     chapter 6   most people must have agreed with mrs raynor that the confirmation that day was a pretty sight at least when those slight girlish forms and fair young faces moved in a white rivulet along the aisles and flowed into kneeling semicircles under the light of the great chancel window softened by patches of dark old painted glass and one would think that to look on while a pair of venerable hands pressed such young heads and a venerable face looked upward for a blessing on them would be very likely to make the heart swell gently and to moisten the eyes yet i remember the eyes seemed very dry in milby church that day notwithstanding that the bishop was an old man and probably venerable for though he was not an eminent grecian he was the brother of a whig lord and i think the eyes must have remained dry because he had small delicate womanish hands adorned with ruffles and instead of laying them on the girls heads just let them hover over each in quick succession as if it were not etiquette to touch them and as if the laying on of hands were like the theatrical embracepart of the play and not to be really believed in to be sure there were a great many heads and the bishops time was limited moreover a wig can under no circumstances be affecting except in rare cases of illusion and copious lawnsleeves cannot be expected to go directly to any heart except a washerwomans  i know ned phipps who knelt against me and i am sure made me behave much worse than i should have done without him whispered that he thought the bishop was a guy and i certainly remember thinking that mr prendergast looked much more dignified with his plain white surplice and black hair he was a tall commanding man and read the liturgy in a strikingly sonorous and uniform voice which i tried to imitate the next sunday at home until my little sister began to cry and said i was yoaring at her  mr tryan sat in a pew near the pulpit with several other clergymen he looked pale and rubbed his hand over his face and pushed back his hair oftener than usual standing in the aisle close to him and repeating the responses with edifying loudness was mr budd churchwarden and delegate with a white staff in his hand and a backward bend of his small head and person such as i suppose he considered suitable to a friend of sound religion conspicuous in the gallery too was the tall figure of mr dempster whose professional avocations rarely allowed him to occupy his place at church  theres dempster said mrs linnet to her daughter mary looking more respectable than usual i declare hes got a fine speech by heart to make to the bishop ill answer for it but hell be pretty well sprinkled with snuff before service is over and the bishop wont be able to listen to him for sneezing thats one comfort  at length the last stage in the long ceremony was over the large assembly streamed warm and weary into the open afternoon sunshine and the bishop retired to the parsonage where after honouring mrs crewes collation he was to give audience to the delegates and mr tryan on the great question of the evening lecture  between five and six oclock the parsonage was once more as quiet as usual under the shadow of its tall elms and the only traces of the bishops recent presence there were the wheel marks on the gravel and the long table with its garnished dishes awry its damask sprinkled with crumbs and its decanters without their stoppers mr crewe was already calmly smoking his pipe in the opposite sittingroom and janet was agreeing with mrs crewe that some of the blancmange would be a nice thing to take to sally martin while the little old lady herself had a spoon in her hand ready to gather the crumbs into a plate that she might scatter them on the gravel for the little birds  before that time the bishops carriage had been seen driving through the high street on its way to lord truffords where he was to dine the question of the lecture was decided then  the nature of the decision may be gathered from the following conversation which took place in the bar of the red lion that evening  so youre done eh dempster was mr pilgrims observation uttered with some gusto he was not glad mr tryan had gained his point but he was not sorry dempster was disappointed  done sir not at all it is what i anticipated i knew we had nothing else to expect in these days when the church is infested by a set of men who are only fit to give out hymns from an empty cask to tunes set by a journeyman cobbler but i was not the less to exert myself in the cause of sound churchmanship for the good of the town any coward can fight a battle when hes sure of winning but give me the man who has pluck to fight when hes sure of losing thats my way sir and there are many victories worse than a defeat as mr tryan shall learn to his cost  he must be a poor shuperannyated sort of a bishop thats my opinion said mr tomlinson to go along with a sneaking methodist like tryan and for my part i think we should be as well wiout bishops if theyre no wiser than that wheres the use o havin thousands ayear an livin in a pallis if they dont stick to the church  no there youre going out of your depth tomlinson said mr dempster no one shall hear me say a word against episcopacyit is a safeguard of the church we must have ranks and dignities there as well as everywhere else no sir episcopacy is a good thing but it may happen that a bishop is not a good thing just as brandy is a good thing though this particular brandy is british and tastes like sugared rainwater caught down the chimney here ratcliffe let me have something to drink a little less like a decoction of sugar and soot  i said nothing again episcopacy returned mr tomlinson i only said i thought we should do as well wiout bishops an ill say it again for the matter o that bishops never brought any grist to my mill  do you know when the lectures are to begin said mr pilgrim  they are to begin on sunday next said mr dempster in a significant tone but i think it will not take a longsighted prophet to foresee the end of them it strikes me mr tryan will be looking out for another curacy shortly  hell not get many milby people to go and hear his lectures after a while ill bet a guinea observed mr budd i know ill not keep a single workman on my ground who either goes to the lecture himself or lets anybody belonging to him go  nor me nayther said mr tomlinson no tryanite shall touch a sack or drive a waggon o mine that you may depend on an i know more besides me as are o the same mind  tryan has a good many friends in the town though and friends that are likely to stand by him too said mr pilgrim i should say it would be as well to let him and his lectures alone if he goes on preaching as he does with such a constitution as his hell get a relaxed throat byandby and youll be rid of him without any trouble  well not allow him to do himself that injury said mr dempster since his health is not good well persuade him to try change of air depend upon it hell find the climate of milby too hot for him     chapter 7   mr dempster did not stay long at the red lion that evening he was summoned home to meet mr armstrong a wealthy client and as he was kept in consultation till a late hour it happened that this was one of the nights on which mr dempster went to bed tolerably sober thus the day which had been one of janets happiest because it had been spent by her in helping her dear old friend mrs crewe ended for her with unusual quietude and as a bright sunset promises a fair morning so a calm lying down is a good augury for a calm waking mr dempster on the thursday morning was in one of his best humours and though perhaps some of the goodhumour might result from the prospect of a lucrative and exciting bit of business in mr armstrongs probable lawsuit the greater part of it was doubtless due to those stirrings of the more kindly healthy sap of human feeling by which goodness tries to get the upper hand in us whenever it seems to have the slightest chanceon sunday mornings perhaps when we are set free from the grinding hurry of the week and take the little threeyear old on our knee at breakfast to share our egg and muffin in moments of trouble when death visits our roof or illness makes us dependent on the tending hand of a slighted wife in quiet talks with an aged mother of the days when we stood at her knee with our first picturebook or wrote her loving letters from school in the man whose childhood has known caresses there is always a fibre of memory that can be touched to gentle issues and mr dempster whom you have hitherto seen only as the orator of the red lion and the drunken tyrant of a dreary midnight home was the firstborn darling son of a fair little mother that mother was living still and her own large black easychair where she sat knitting through the livelong day was now set ready for her at the breakfasttable by her sons side a sleek tortoiseshell cat acting as provisional incumbent  good morning mamsey why youre looking as fresh as a daisy this morning youre getting young again said mr dempster looking up from his newspaper when the little old lady entered a very little old lady she was with a pale scarcely wrinkled face hair of that peculiar white which tells that the locks have once been blond a natty pure white cap on her head and a white shawl pinned over her shoulders you saw at a glance that she had been a mignonne blonde strangely unlike her tall ugly dingycomplexioned son unlike her daughterinlaw too whose largefeatured brunette beauty seemed always thrown into higher relief by the white presence of little mamsey the unlikeness between janet and her motherinlaw went deeper than outline and complexion and indeed there was little sympathy between them for old mrs dempster had not yet learned to believe that her son robert would have gone wrong if he had married the right womana meek woman like herself who would have borne him children and been a deft orderly housekeeper in spite of janets tenderness and attention to her she had had little love for her daughterinlaw from the first and had witnessed the sad growth of homemisery through long years always with a disposition to lay the blame on the wife rather than on the husband and to reproach mrs raynor for encouraging her daughters faults by a too exclusive sympathy but old mrs dempster had that rare gift of silence and passivity which often supplies the absence of mental strength and whatever were her thoughts she said no word to aggravate the domestic discord patient and mute she sat at her knitting through many a scene of quarrel and anguish resolutely she appeared unconscious of the sounds that reached her ears and the facts she divined after she had retired to her bed mutely she witnessed poor janets faults only registering them as a balance of excuse on the side of her son the hard astute domineering attorney was still that little old womans pet as he had been when she watched with triumphant pride his first tumbling effort to march alone across the nursery floor see what a good son he is to me she often thought never gave me a harsh word and so he might have been a good husband  o it is piteousthat sorrow of aged women in early youth perhaps they said to themselves i shall be happy when i have a husband to love me best of all then when the husband was too careless my child will comfort me then through the mothers watching and toil my child will repay me all when it grows up and at last after the long journey of years has been wearily travelled through the mothers heart is weighed down by a heavier burthen and no hope remains but the grave  but this morning old mrs dempster sat down in her easychair without any painful suppressed remembrance of the preceding night  i declare mammy looks younger than mrs crewe who is only sixtyfive said janet mrs crewe will come to see you today mammy and tell you all about her troubles with the bishop and the collation shell bring her knitting and youll have a regular gossip together  the gossip will be all on one side then for mrs crewe gets so very deaf i cant make her hear a word and if i motion to her she always understands me wrong  o she will have so much to tell you today you will not want to speak yourself you who have patience to knit those wonderful counterpanes mammy must not be impatient with dear mrs crewe good old lady i cant bear her to think shes ever tiresome to people and you know shes very ready to fancy herself in the way i think she would like to shrink up to the size of a mouse that she might run about and do people good without their noticing her  it isnt patience i want god knows its lungs to speak loud enough but youll be at home yourself i suppose this morning and you can talk to her for me  no mammy i promised poor mrs lowme to go and sit with her shes confined to her room and both the miss lowmes are out so im going to read the newspaper to her and amuse her  couldnt you go another morning as mr armstrong and that other gentleman are coming to dinner i should think it would be better to stay at home can you trust betty to see to everything shes new to the place  o i couldnt disappoint mrs lowme i promised her betty will do very well no fear  old mrs dempster was silent after this and began to sip her tea the breakfast went on without further conversation for some time mr dempster being absorbed in the papers at length when he was running over the advertisements his eye seemed to be caught by something that suggested a new thought to him he presently thumped the table with an air of exultation and said turning to janetive a capital idea gypsy that was his name for his darkeyed wife when he was in an extraordinarily good humour and you shall help me its just what youre up to  what is it said janet her face beaming at the sound of the pet name now heard so seldom anything to do with conveyancing  its a bit of fun worth a dozen feesa plan for raising a laugh against tryan and his gang of hypocrites  what is it nothing that wants a needle and thread hope else i must go and tease mother  no nothing sharper than your witexcept mine ill tell you what it is well get up a programme of the sunday evening lecture like a playbill you knowgrand performance of the celebrated mountebank and so on well bring in the tryanitesold landor and the restin appropriate characters proctor shall print it and well circulate it in the town it will be a capital hit  bravo said janet clapping her hands she would just then have pretended to like almost anything in her pleasure at being appealed to by her husband and she really did like to laugh at the tryanites well set about it directly and sketch it out before you go to the office ive got tryans sermons upstairs but i dont think theres anything in them we can use ive only just looked into them theyre not at all what i expecteddull stupid thingsnothing of the roaring fireandbrimstone sort that i expected  roaring no tryans as soft as a sucking doveone of your honeymouthed hypocrites plenty of devil and malice in him though i could see that while he was talking to the bishop but as smooth as a snake outside hes beginning a singlehanded fight with me i can seepersuading my clients away from me we shall see who will be the first to cry peccavi milby will do better without mr tryan than without robert dempster i fancy and milby shall never be flooded with cant as long as i can raise a breakwater against it but now get the breakfast things cleared away and let us set about the playbill come mamsey come and have a walk with me round the garden and let us see how the cucumbers are getting on ive never taken you round the garden for an age come you dont want a bonnet its like walking in a greenhouse this morning  but she will want a parasol said janet theres one on the stand against the gardendoor robert  the little old lady took her sons arm with placid pleasure she could barely reach it so as to rest upon it but he inclined a little towards her and accommodated his heavy longlimbed steps to her feeble pace the cat chose to sun herself too and walked close beside them with tail erect rubbing her sleek sides against their legstoo well fed to be excited by the twittering birds the garden was of the grassy shady kind often seen attached to old houses in provincial towns the appletrees had had time to spread their branches very wide the shrubs and hardy perennial plants had grown into a luxuriance that required constant trimming to prevent them from intruding on the space for walking but the farther end which united with green fields was open and sunny  it was rather sad and yet pretty to see that little group passing out of the shadow into the sunshine and out of the sunshine into the shadow again sad because this tenderness of the son for the mother was hardly more than a nucleus of healthy life in an organ hardening by disease because the man who was linked in this way with an innocent past had become callous in worldliness fevered by sensuality enslaved by chance impulses pretty because it showed how hard it is to kill the deepdown fibrous roots of human love and goodnesshow the man from whom we make it our pride to shrink has yet a close brotherhood with us through some of our most sacred feelings  as they were returning to the house janet met them and said now robert the writing things are ready i shall be clerk and mat paine can copy it out after  mammy once more deposited in her armchair with her knitting in her hand and the cat purring at her elbow janet seated herself at the table while mr dempster placed himself near her took out his snuffbox and plentifully suffusing himself with the inspiring powder began to dictate  what he dictated we shall see byandby    chapter 8   the next day friday at five oclock by the sundial the large bowwindow of mrs jeromes parlour was open and that lady herself was seated within its ample semicircle having a table before her on which her best teatray her best china and her best urnrug had already been standing in readiness for half an hour mrs jeromes best teaservice was of delicate white fluted china with gold sprigs upon itas pretty a teaservice as you need wish to see and quite good enough for chimney ornaments indeed as the cups were without handles most visitors who had the distinction of taking tea out of them wished that such charming china had already been promoted to that honorary position mrs jerome was like her china handsome and oldfashioned she was a buxom lady of sixty in an elaborate lace cap fastened by a frill under her chin a dark wellcurled front concealing her forehead a snowy neckerchief exhibiting its ample folds as far as her waist and a stiff grey silk gown she had a clean damask napkin pinned before her to guard her dress during the process of teamaking her favourite geraniums in the bowwindow were looking as healthy as she could desire her own handsome portrait painted when she was twenty years younger was smiling down on her with agreeable flattery and altogether she seemed to be in as peaceful and pleasant a position as a buxom welldrest elderly lady need desire but as in so many other cases appearances were deceptive her mind was greatly perturbed and her temper ruffled by the fact that it was more than a quarter past five even by the losing timepiece that it was halfpast by her large gold watch which she held in her hand as if she were counting the pulse of the afternoon and that by the kitchen clock which she felt sure was not an hour too fast it had already struck six the lapse of time was rendered the more unendurable to mrs jerome by her wonder that mr jerome could stay out in the garden with lizzie in that thoughtless way taking it so easily that teatime was long past and that after all the trouble of getting down the best teathings mr tryan would not come  this honour had been shown to mr tryan not at all because mrs jerome had any high appreciation of his doctrine or of his exemplary activity as a pastor but simply because he was a church clergyman and as such was regarded by her with the same sort of exceptional respect that a white woman who had married a native of the society islands might be supposed to feel towards a whiteskinned visitor from the land of her youth for mrs jerome had been reared a churchwoman and having attained the age of thirty before she was married had felt the greatest repugnance in the first instance to renouncing the religious forms in which she had been brought up you know she said in confidence to her church acquaintances i wouldnt give no ear at all to mr jerome at fust but after all i begun to think as there was a maeny things worse nor goin to chapel an youd better do that nor not pay your way mr jerome had a very pleasant manner with him an there was niver another as kept a gig an ud make a settlement on me like him chapel or no chapel it seemed very odd to me for a long while the preachin without book an the stannin up to one long prayer istid o changin your postur but la theres nothin as you maynt get used to i time you can alys sit down you know before the prayers done the ministers say pretty nigh the same things as the church parsons by what i could iver make out an were out o chapel i the mornin a deal sooner nor theyre out o church an as for pews ourns is a deal comfortabler nor aeny i milby church  mrs jerome you perceive had not a keen susceptibility to shades of doctrine and it is probable that after listening to dissenting eloquence for thirty years she might safely have reentered the establishment without performing any spiritual quarantine her mind apparently was of that nonporous flinty character which is not in the least danger from surrounding damp but on the question of getting start of the sun on the days business and clearing her conscience of the necessary sum of meals and the consequent washing up as soon as possible so that the family might be well in bed at nine mrs jerome was susceptible and the present lingering pace of things united with mr jeromes unaccountable obliviousness was not to be borne any longer so she rang the bell for sally  goodness me sally go into the garden an see after your master tell him its goin on for six an mr tryan ull niver think o comin now an its time we got tea over an hes lettin lizzie stain her frock i expect among them strawberry beds mek her come in this minute  no wonder mr jerome was tempted to linger in the garden for though the house was pretty and well deserved its namethe white house the tall damask roses that clustered over the porch being thrown into relief by rough stucco of the most brilliant white yet the garden and orchards were mr jeromes glory as well they might be and there was nothing in which he had a more innocent pridepeace to a good mans memory all his pride was innocentthan in conducting a hitherto uninitiated visitor over his grounds and making him in some degree aware of the incomparable advantages possessed by the inhabitants of the white house in the matter of redstreaked apples russets northern greens excellent for baking swanegg pears and early vegetables to say nothing of flowering srubs pink hawthorns lavender bushes more than ever mrs jerome could use and in short a superabundance of everything that a person retired from business could desire to possess himself or to share with his friends the garden was one of those oldfashioned paradises which hardly exist any longer except as memories of our childhood no finical separation between flower and kitchen garden there no monotony of enjoyment for one sense to the exclusion of another but a charming paradisiacal mingling of all that was pleasant to the eyes and good for food the rich flowerborder running along every walk with its endless succession of spring flowers anemones auriculas wallflowers sweetwilliams campanulas snapdragons and tigerlilies had its taller beauties such as moss and provence roses varied with espalier appletrees the crimson of a carnation was carried out in the lurking crimson of the neighbouring strawberrybeds you gathered a mossrose one moment and a bunch of currants the next you were in a delicious fluctuation between the scent of jasmine and the juice of gooseberries then what a high wall at one end flanked by a summerhouse so lofty that after ascending its long flight of steps you could see perfectly well there was no view worth looking at what alcoves and gardenseats in all directions and along one side what a hedge tall and firm and unbroken like a green wall  it was near this hedge that mr jerome was standing when sally found him he had set down the basket of strawberries on the gravel and had lifted up little lizzie in his arms to look at a birds nest lizzie peeped and then looked at her grandpa with round blue eyes and then peeped again  dye see it lizzie he whispered  yes she whispered in return putting her lips very near grandpas face at this moment sally appeared  eh eh sally whats the matter is mr tryan come  no sir an missis says shes sure he wont come now an she wants you to come in an hev tea dear heart miss lizzie youve stained your pinafore an i shouldnt wonder if its gone through to your frock therell be fine work come alonk wi me do  nay nay nay weve done no harm weve done no harm hev we lizzie the washtubll make all right again  sally regarding the washtub from a different point of view looked sourly serious and hurried away with lizzie who trotted submissively along her little head in eclipse under a large nankin bonnet while mr jerome followed leisurely with his full broad shoulders in rather a stooping posture and his large goodnatured features and white locks shaded by a broadbrimmed hat  mr jerome i wonder at you said mrs jerome in a tone of indignant remonstrance evidently sustained by a deep sense of injury as her husband opened the parlour door when will you leave off invitin people to meals an not lettin em know the time ill answer fort you niver said a word to mr tryan as we should take tea at five oclock its just like you  nay nay susan answered the husband in a soothing tone theres nothin amiss i told mr tryan as we took tea at five punctial mayhap summats a detainin on him hes a deal to do an to think on remember  why its struck six i the kitchen aready its nonsense to look for him comin now so you mays well ring for th urn now sallys got th heater in the fire we mays well hev th urn in though he doesnt come i niver seed the like o you mr jerome for axin people an givin me the trouble o gettin things down an hevin crumpets made an after all they dont come i shall hev to wash every one o these teathings myself for theres no trustin sallyshed break a fortin i crockery i no time  but why will you give yourself sich trouble susan our everyday teathings would ha done as well for mr tryan an theyre a deal convenenter to hold  yes thats just your way mr jerome youre alys afindin faut wi my chany because i bought it myself afore i was married but let me tell you i knowed how to choose chany if i didnt know how to choose a husband an wheres lizzie youve niver left her i the garden by herself with her white frock on an clean stockins  be easy my dear susan be easy lizzies come in wi sally shes hevin her pinafore took off ill be bound ah theres mr tryan acomin through the gate  mrs jerome began hastily to adjust her damask napkin and the expression of her countenance for the reception of the clergyman and mr jerome went out to meet his guest whom he greeted outside the door  mr tryan how do you do mr tryan welcome to the white house im glad to see you sirim glad to see you  if you had heard the tone of mingled goodwill veneration and condolence in which this greeting was uttered even without seeing the face that completely harmonized with it you would have no difficulty in inferring the groundnotes of mr jeromes character to a fine ear that tone said as plainly as possiblewhatever recommends itself to me thomas jerome as piety and goodness shall have my love and honour ah friends this pleasant world is a sad one too isnt it let us help one another let us help one another and it was entirely owing to this basis of character not at all from any clear and precise doctrinal discrimination that mr jerome had very early in life become a dissenter in his boyish days he had been thrown where dissent seemed to have the balance of piety purity and good works on its side and to become a dissenter seemed to him identical with choosing god instead of mammon that race of dissenters is extinct in these days when opinion has got far ahead of feeling and every chapelgoing youth can fill our ears with the advantages of the voluntary system the corruptions of a state church and the scriptural evidence that the first christians were congregationalists mr jerome knew nothing of this theoretic basis for dissent and in the utmost extent of his polemical discussion he had not gone further than to question whether a christian man was bound in conscience to distinguish christmas and easter by any peculiar observance beyond the eating of mincepies and cheesecakes it seemed to him that all seasons were alike good for thanking god departing from evil and doing well whereas it might be desirable to restrict the period for indulging in unwholesome forms of pastry mr jeromes dissent being of this simple nonpolemical kind it is easy to understand that the report he heard of mr tryan as a good man and a powerful preacher who was stirring the hearts of the people had been enough to attract him to the paddiford church and that having felt himself more edified there than he had of late been under mr stickneys discourses at salem he had driven thither repeatedly in the sunday afternoons and had sought an opportunity of making mr tryans acquaintance the evening lecture was a subject of warm interest with him and the opposition mr tryan met with gave that interest a strong tinge of partisanship for there was a store of irascibility in mr jeromes nature which must find a vent somewhere and in so kindly and upright a man could only find it in indignation against those whom he held to be enemies of truth and goodness mr tryan had not hitherto been to the white house but yesterday meeting mr jerome in the street he had at once accepted the invitation to tea saying there was something he wished to talk about he appeared worn and fatigued now and after shaking hands with mrs jerome threw himself into a chair and looked out on the pretty garden with an air of relief  what a nice place you have here mr jerome ive not seen anything so quiet and pretty since i came to milby on paddiford common where i live you know the bushes are all sprinkled with soot and theres never any quiet except in the dead of night  dear heart dear heart thats very badand for you too as hev to study wouldnt it be better for you to be somewhere more out i the country like  o no i should lose so much time in going to and fro and besides i like to be among the people ive no face to go and preach resignation to those poor things in their smoky air and comfortless homes when i come straight from every luxury myself there are many things quite lawful for other men which a clergyman must forego if he would do any good in a manufacturing population like this  here the preparations for tea were crowned by the simultaneous appearance of lizzie and the crumpet it is a pretty surprise when one visits an elderly couple to see a little figure enter in a white frock with a blond head as smooth as satin round blue eyes and a cheek like an apple blossom a toddling little girl is a centre of common feeling which makes the most dissimilar people understand each other and mr tryan looked at lizzie with that quiet pleasure which is always genuine  here we are here we are said proud grandpapa you didnt think wed got such a little gell as this did you mr tryan why it seems but th other day since her mother was just such another this is our little lizzie this is come an shake hands wi mr tryan lizzie come  lizzie advanced without hesitation and put out one hand while she fingered her coral necklace with the other and looked up into mr tryans face with a reconnoitring gaze he stroked the satin head and said in his gentlest voice how do you do lizzie will you give me a kiss she put up her little bud of a mouth and then retreating a little and glancing down at her frock saiddit id my noo fock i put it on tod you wad toming tally taid you wouldnt ook at it  hush hush lizzie little gells must be seen and not heard said mrs jerome while grandpapa winking significantly and looking radiant with delight at lizzies extraordinary promise of cleverness set her up on her high canechair by the side of grandma who lost no time in shielding the beauties of the new frock with a napkin  well now mr tryan said mr jerome in a very serious tone when tea had been distributed let me hear how youre agoin on about the lectur when i was i the town yisterday i heared as there was pessecutin schemes abein laid again you i fear me those raskills ll mek things very onpleasant to you  ive no doubt they will attempt it indeed i quite expect there will be a regular mob got up on sunday evening as there was when the delegates returned on purpose to annoy me and the congregation on our way to church  ah theyre capible o anything such men as dempster an budd an tomlinson backs em wi money though he cant wi brains howiver dempsters lost one client by his wicked doins an im deceived if he wont lose more nor one i little thought mr tryan when i put my affairs into his hands twenty ear ago this michaelmas as he was to turn out a pessecutor o religion i niver lighted on a cliverer promisiner young man nor he was then they talked of his bein fond of a extry glass now an then but niver nothin like what hes come to since an its headpiece you must look for in a lawyer mr tryan its headpiece his wife too was alys an uncommon favourite o minepoor thing i hear sad stories about her now but shes druv to it shes druv to it mr tryan a tenderhearted woman to the poor she is as iver lived an as prettyspoken a woman as you need wish to talk to yes id alys a likin for dempster an his wife spite o iverything but as soon as iver i heared o that dilegate business i says says i that man shall hev no more to do wi my affairs it may put me t inconvenience but ill encourage no man as pessecutes religion  he is evidently the brain and hand of the persecution said mr tryan there may be a strong feeling against me in a large number of the inhabitantsit must be so from the great ignorance of spiritual things in this place but i fancy there would have been no formal opposition to the lecture if dempster had not planned it i am not myself the least alarmed at anything he can do he will find i am not to be cowed or driven away by insult or personal danger god has sent me to this place and by his blessing ill not shrink from anything i may have to encounter in doing his work among the people but i feel it right to call on all those who know the value of the gospel to stand by me publicly i thinkand mr landor agrees with methat it will be well for my friends to proceed with me in a body to the church on sunday evening dempster you know has pretended that almost all the respectable inhabitants are opposed to the lecture now i wish that falsehood to be visibly contradicted what do you think of the plan i have today been to see several of my friends who will make a point of being there to accompany me and will communicate with others on the subject  ill mek one mr tryan ill mek one you shall not be wantin in any support as i can give before you come to it sir milby was a dead an dark place you are the fust man i the church to my knowledge as has brought the word o god home to the people an ill stan by you sir ill stan by you im a dissenter mr tryan ive been a dissenter ever sin i was fifteen ear old but show me good i the church an im a churchman too when i was a boy i lived at tilston you maynt know the place the best part o the land there belonged to squire sandeman hed a clubfoot had squire sandemanlost a deal o money by canal shares well sir as i was sayin i lived at tilston an the rector there was a terrible drinkin foxhuntin man you niver seed such a parish i your time for wickedness milbys nothin to it well sir my father was a workin man an couldnt afford to gi me ony eddication so i went to a nightschool as was kep by a dissenter one jacob wright an it was from that man sir as i got my little schoolin an my knowledge o religion i went to chapel wi jacobhe was a good man was jacoban to chapel ive been iver since but im no enemy o the church sir when the church brings light to the ignorant and the sinful an thats what youre adoin mr tryan yes sir ill stan by you ill go to church wi you o sunday evenin  youd far better stay at home mr jerome if i may give my opinion interposed mrs jerome its not as i hevnt ivery respect for you mr tryan but mr jerome ull do you no good by his interferin dissenters are not at all looked on i milby an hes as nervous as iver he can be hell come back as ill as ill an niver let me hev a wink o sleep all night  mrs jerome had been frightened at the mention of a mob and her retrospective regard for the religious communion of her youth by no means inspired her with the temper of a martyr her husband looked at her with an expression of tender and grieved remonstrance which might have been that of the patient patriarch on the memorable occasion when he rebuked his wife  susan susan let me beg on you not to oppose me and put stumblinblocks i the way o doing whats right i cant give up my conscience let me give up what else i may  perhaps said mr tryan feeling slightly uncomfortable since you are not very strong my dear sir it will be well as mrs jerome suggests that you should not run the risk of any excitement  say no more mr tryan ill stan by you sir its my duty its the cause o god sir its the cause o god  mr tryan obeyed his impulse of admiration and gratitude and put out his hand to the whitehaired old man saying thank you mr jerome thank you  mr jerome grasped the proffered hand in silence and then threw himself back in his chair casting a regretful look at his wife which seemed to say why dont you feel with me susan  the sympathy of this simpleminded old man was more precious to mr tryan than any mere onlooker could have imagined to persons possessing a great deal of that facile psychology which prejudges individuals by means of formulae and casts them without further trouble into duly lettered pigeonholes the evangelical curate might seem to be doing simply what all other men like to docarrying out objects which were identified not only with his theory which is but a kind of secondary egoism but also with the primary egoism of his feelings opposition may become sweet to a man when he has christened it persecution a selfobtrusive overhasty reformer complacently disclaiming all merit while his friends call him a martyr has not in reality a career the most arduous to the fleshly mind but mr tryan was not cast in the mould of the gratuitous martyr with a power of persistence which had been often blamed as obstinacy he had an acute sensibility to the very hatred or ridicule he did not flinch from provoking every form of disapproval jarred him painfully and though he fronted his opponents manfully and often with considerable warmth of temper he had no pugnacious pleasure in the contest it was one of the weaknesses of his nature to be too keenly alive to every harsh wind of opinion to wince under the frowns of the foolish to be irritated by the injustice of those who could not possibly have the elements indispensable for judging him rightly and with all this acute sensibility to blame this dependence on sympathy he had for years been constrained into a position of antagonism no wonder then that good old mr jeromes cordial words were balm to him he had often been thankful to an old woman for saying god bless you to a little child for smiling at him to a dog for submitting to be patted by him  tea being over by this time mr tryan proposed a walk in the garden as a means of dissipating all recollection of the recent conjugal dissidence little lizzies appeal me go gandpa could not be rejected so she was duly bonneted and pinafored and then they turned out into the evening sunshine not mrs jerome however she had a deeplymeditated plan of retiring ad interim to the kitchen and washing up the best teathings as a mode of getting forward with the sadlyretarded business of the day  this way mr tryan this way said the old gentleman i must take you to my pastur fust an show you our cowthe best milker i the county an see here at these backbuildins how convenent the dairy is i planned it ivery bit myself an here ive got my little carpenters shop an my blacksmiths shop i do no end o jobs here myself i niver could bear to be idle mr tryan i must alys be at somethin or other it was time for me to lay by business an mek room for younger folks id got money enough wi only one daughter to leave it to an i says to myself says i its time to leave off moitherin myself wi this world so much an give more time to thinkin of another but theres a many hours atween getting up an lyin down an thoughts are no cumber you can move about wi a good many on em in your head see heres the pastur  a very pretty pasture it was where the largespotted shorthorned cow quietly chewed the cud as she lay and looked sleepily at her admirersa daintilytrimmed hedge all round dotted here and there with a mountainash or a cherrytree  ive a good bit more land besides this worth your while to look at but mayhap its further nor youd like to walk now bless you ive welly an acre o potatoground yonders ive a good big family to supply you know here mr jerome winked and smiled significantly an that puts me i mind mr tryan o summat i wanted to say to you clergymen like you i know see a deal more poverty an that than other folks an hev a many claims on em more nor they can well meet an if youll mek use o my purse any time or let me know where i can be o any help ill tek it very kind on you  thank you mr jerome i will do so i promise you i saw a sad case yesterday a colliera fine broadchested fellow about thirtywas killed by the falling of a wall in the paddiford colliery i was in one of the cottages near when they brought him home on a door and the shriek of the wife has been ringing in my ears ever since there are three little children happily the woman has her loom so she will be able to keep out of the workhouse but she looks very delicate  give me her name mr tryan said mr jerome drawing out his pocketbook ill call an see her  deep was the fountain of pity in the good old mans heart he often ate his dinner stintingly oppressed by the thought that there were men women and children with no dinner to sit down to and would relieve his mind by going out in the afternoon to look for some need that he could supply some honest struggle in which he could lend a helping hand that any living being should want was his chief sorrow that any rational being should waste was the next sally indeed having been scolded by master for a too lavish use of sticks in lighting the kitchen fire and various instances of recklessness with regard to candle ends considered him as mean as aenythink but he had as kindly a warmth as the morning sunlight and like the sunlight his goodness shone on all that came in his way from the saucy rosycheeked lad whom he delighted to make happy with a christmas box to the pallid sufferers up dim entries languishing under the tardy death of want and misery  it was very pleasant to mr tryan to listen to the simple chat of the old manto walk in the shade of the incomparable orchard and hear the story of the crops yielded by the redstreaked appletree and the quite embarrassing plentifulness of the summerpearsto drinkin the sweet evening breath of the garden as they sat in the alcoveand so for a short interval to feel the strain of his pastoral task relaxed  perhaps he felt the return to that task through the dusty roads all the more painfully perhaps something in that quiet shady home had reminded him of the time before he had taken on him the yoke of selfdenial the strongest heart will faint sometimes under the feeling that enemies are bitter and that friends only know half its sorrows the most resolute soul will now and then cast back a yearning look in treading the rough mountainpath away from the greensward and laughing voices of the valley however it was in the nine oclock twilight that evening when mr tryan had entered his small study and turned the key in the door he threw himself into the chair before his writingtable and heedless of the papers there leaned his face low on his hand and moaned heavily  it is apt to be so in this life i think while we are coldly discussing a mans career sneering at his mistakes blaming his rashness and labelling his opinionshe is evangelical and narrow or latitudinarian and pantheistic or anglican and superciliousthat man in his solitude is perhaps shedding hot tears because his sacrifice is a hard one because strength and patience are failing him to speak the difficult word and do the difficult deed     chapter 9   mr tryan showed no such symptoms of weakness on the critical sunday he unhesitatingly rejected the suggestion that he should be taken to church in mr landors carriagea proposition which that gentleman made as an amendment on the original plan when the rumours of meditated insult became alarming mr tryan declared he would have no precautions taken but would simply trust in god and his good cause some of his more timid friends thought this conduct rather defiant than wise and reflecting that a mob has great talents for impromptu and that legal redress is imperfect satisfaction for having ones head broken with a brickbat were beginning to question their consciences very closely as to whether it was not a duty they owed to their families to stay at home on sunday evening these timorous persons however were in a small minority and the generality of mr tryans friends and hearers rather exulted in an opportunity of braving insult for the sake of a preacher to whom they were attached on personal as well as doctrinal grounds miss pratt spoke of cranmer ridley and latimer and observed that the present crisis afforded an occasion for emulating their heroism even in these degenerate times while less highly instructed persons whose memories were not well stored with precedents simply expressed their determination as mr jerome had done to stan by the preacher and his cause believing it to be the cause of god  on sunday evening then at a quarter past six mr tryan setting out from mr landors with a party of his friends who had assembled there was soon joined by two other groups from mr pratts and mr dunns and stray persons on their way to church naturally falling into rank behind this leading file by the time they reached the entrance of orchard street mr tryans friends formed a considerable procession walking three or four abreast it was in orchard street and towards the church gates that the chief crowd was collected and at mr dempsters drawingroom window on the upper floor a more select assembly of antitryanites were gathered to witness the entertaining spectacle of the tryanites walking to church amidst the jeers and hootings of the crowd  to prompt the popular wit with appropriate sobriquets numerous copies of mr dempsters playbill were posted on the walls in suitably large and emphatic type as it is possible that the most industrious collector of mural literature may not have been fortunate enough to possess himself of this production which ought by all means to be preserved amongst the materials of our provincial religious history i subjoin a faithful copy                        grand entertainment            to be given at milby on sunday evening next by the                   famous comedian tryiton            and his firstrate company including not only an                  unparalleled cast for comedy       but a large collection of reclaimed and converted animals                      among the rest                a bear who used to dance               a parrot once given to swearing                      a polygamous pig                            and         a monkey who used to catch fleas on a sunday                         together with a                  pair of regenerated linnets              with an entirely new song and plumage                         mr tryiton     will first pass through the streets in procession with his    unrivalled company warranted to have their eyes turned up higher    and the corners of their mouths turned down lower than any other    company of mountebanks in this circuit                         after which     the theatre will be opened and the entertainment will                 commence at halfpast six                    when will be presented       a piece never before performed on any stage entitled                  the wolf in sheeps clothing                                or                  the

commencing with                 the lamentations of jeromiah                       in nasal recitative                        to be followed by                the favourite cackling quartette

                     grand chorus by the              entire orchestra of converted animals  but owing to the unavoidable absence from illness of the bulldog who has left off fighting mr tonic has kindly undertaken at a moments notice to supply the bark                    the whole to conclude with a                      screaming farce of                      the pulpit snatcher     mr saintly

satire though it presents the keenest edge of milby wit does not strike you as lacerating i imagine but hatred is like fireit makes even light rubbish deadly and mr dempsters sarcasms were not merely visible on the walls they were reflected in the derisive glances and audible in the jeering voices of the crowd through this pelting shower of nicknames and bad puns with an ad libitum accompaniment of groans howls hisses and heehaws but of no heavier missiles mr tryan walked pale and composed giving his arm to old mr landor whose step was feeble on the other side of him was mr jerome who still walked firmly though his shoulders were slightly bowed  outwardly mr tryan was composed but inwardly he was suffering acutely from these tones of hatred and scorn however strong his consciousness of right he found it no stronger armour against such weapons as derisive glances and virulent words than against stones and clubs his conscience was in repose but his sensibility was bruised  once more only did the evangelical curate pass up orchard street followed by a train of friends once more only was there a crowd assembled to witness his entrance through the church gates but that second time no voice was heard above a whisper and the whispers were words of sorrow and blessing that second time janet dempster was not looking on in scorn and merriment her eyes were worn with grief and watching and she was following her beloved friend and pastor to the grave     chapter 10   history we know is apt to repeat herself and to foist very old incidents upon us with only a slight change of costume from the time of xerxes downwards we have seen generals playing the braggadocio at the outset of their campaigns and conquering the enemy with the greatest ease in afterdinner speeches but events are apt to be in disgusting discrepancy with the anticipations of the most ingenious tacticians the difficulties of the expedition are ridiculously at variance with able calculations the enemy has the impudence not to fall into confusion as had been reasonably expected of him the mind of the gallant general begins to be distracted by news of intrigues against him at home and notwithstanding the handsome compliments he paid to providence as his undoubted patron before setting out there seems every probability that the te deums will be all on the other side  so it fell out with mr dempster in his memorable campaign against the tryanites after all the premature triumph of the return from elmstoke the battle of the evening lecture had been lost the enemy was in possession of the field and the utmost hope remaining was that by a harassing guerilla warfare he might be driven to evacuate the country  for some time this sort of warfare was kept up with considerable spirit the shafts of milby ridicule were made more formidable by being poisoned with calumny and very ugly stories narrated with circumstantial minuteness were soon in circulation concerning mr tryan and his hearers from which stories it was plainly deducible that evangelicalism led by a necessary consequence to hypocritical indulgence in vice some old friendships were broken asunder and there were near relations who felt that religious differences unmitigated by any prospect of a legacy were a sufficient ground for exhibiting their family antipathy mr budd harangued his workmen and threatened them with dismissal if they or their families were known to attend the evening lecture and mr tomlinson on discovering that his foreman was a rank tryanite blustered to a great extent and would have cashiered that valuable functionary on the spot if such a retributive procedure had not been inconvenient  on the whole however at the end of a few months the balance of substantial loss was on the side of the antitryanites mr pratt indeed had lost a patient or two besides mr dempsters family but as it was evident that evangelicalism had not dried up the stream of his anecdote or in the least altered his view of any ladys constitution it is probable that a change accompanied by so few outward and visible signs was rather the pretext than the ground of his dismissal in those additional cases mr dunn was threatened with the loss of several good customers mrs phipps and mrs lowme having set the example of ordering him to send in his bill and the draper began to look forward to his next stocktaking with an anxiety which was but slightly mitigated by the parallel his wife suggested between his own case and that of shadrach meshech and abednego who were thrust into a burning fiery furnace for as he observed to her the next morning with that perspicacity which belongs to the period of shaving whereas their deliverance consisted in the fact that their linen and woollen goods were not consumed his own deliverance lay in precisely the opposite result but convenience that admirable branch system from the main line of selfinterest makes us all fellowhelpers in spite of adverse resolutions it is probable that no speculative or theological hatred would be ultimately strong enough to resist the persuasive power of convenience that a latitudinarian baker whose bread was honourably free from alum would command the custom of any dyspeptic puseyite that an arminian with the toothache would prefer a skilful calvinistic dentist to a bungler stanch against the doctrines of election and final perseverance who would be likely to break the tooth in his head and that a plymouth brother who had a well furnished grocery shop in a favourable vicinage would occasionally have the pleasure of furnishing sugar or vinegar to orthodox families that found themselves unexpectedly out of those indispensable commodities in this persuasive power of convenience lay mr dunns ultimate security from martyrdom his drapery was the best in milby the comfortable use and wont of procuring satisfactory articles at a moments notice proved too strong for antitryanite zeal and the draper could soon look forward to his next stocktaking without the support of a scriptural parallel  on the other hand mr dempster had lost his excellent client mr jeromea loss which galled him out of proportion to the mere monetary deficit it represented the attorney loved money but he loved power still better he had always been proud of having early won the confidence of a conventiclegoer and of being able to turn the prop of salem round his thumb like most other men too he had a certain kindness towards those who had employed him when he was only starting in life and just as we do not like to part with an old weatherglass from our study or a twofeet ruler that we have carried in our pocket ever since we began business so mr dempster did not like having to erase his old clients name from the accustomed drawer in the bureau our habitual life is like a wall hung with pictures which has been shone on by the suns of many years take one of the pictures away and it leaves a definite blank space to which our eyes can never turn without a sensation of discomfort nay the involuntary loss of any familiar object almost always brings a chill as from an evil omen it seems to be the first fingershadow of advancing death  from all these causes combined mr dempster could never think of his lost client without strong irritation and the very sight of mr jerome passing in the street was wormwood to him  one day when the old gentleman was coming up orchard street on his roan mare shaking the bridle and tickling her flank with the whip as usual though there was a perfect mutual understanding that she was not to quicken her pace janet happened to be on her own doorstep and he could not resist the temptation of stopping to speak to that nice little woman as he always called her though she was taller than all the rest of his feminine acquaintances janet in spite of her disposition to take her husbands part in all public matters could bear no malice against her old friend so they shook hands  well mrs dempster im sorry to my heart not to see you sometimes that i am said mr jerome in a plaintive tone but if youve got any poor people as wants help and you knows deservin send em to me send em to me just the same  thank you mr jerome that i will goodbye  janet made the interview as short as she could but it was not short enough to escape the observation of her husband who as she feared was on his midday return from his office at the other end of the street and this offence of hers in speaking to mr jerome was the frequently recurring theme of mr dempsters objurgatory domestic eloquence  associating the loss of his old client with mr tryans influence dempster began to know more distinctly why he hated the obnoxious curate but a passionate hate as well as a passionate love demands some leisure and mental freedom persecution and revenge like courtship and toadyism will not prosper without a considerable expenditure of time and ingenuity and these are not to spare with a man whose lawbusiness and liver are both beginning to show unpleasant symptoms such was the disagreeable turn affairs were taking with mr dempster and like the general distracted by home intrigues he was too much harassed himself to lay ingenious plans for harassing the enemy  meanwhile the evening lecture drew larger and larger congregations not perhaps attracting many from that select aristocratic circle in which the lowmes and pittmans were predominant but winning the larger proportion of mr crewes morning and afternoon hearers and thinning mr stickneys evening audiences at salem evangelicalism was making its way in milby and gradually diffusing its subtle odour into chambers that were bolted and barred against it the movement like all other religious revivals had a mixed effect religious ideas have the fate of melodies which once set afloat in the world are taken up by all sorts of instruments some of them woefully coarse feeble or out of tune until people are in danger of crying out that the melody itself is detestable it may be that some of mr tryans hearers had gained a religious vocabulary rather than religious experience that here and there a weavers wife who a few months before had been simply a silly slattern was converted into that more complex nuisance a silly and sanctimonious slattern that the old adam with the pertinacity of middle age continued to tell fibs behind the counter notwithstanding the new adams addiction to biblereading and family prayer that the children in the paddiford sunday school had their memories crammed with phrases about the blood of cleansing imputed righteousness and justification by faith alone which an experience lying principally in chuckfarthing hopscotch parental slappings and longings after unattainable lollypop served rather to darken than to illustrate and that at milby in those distant days as in all other times and places where the mental atmosphere is changing and men are inhaling the stimulus of new ideas folly often mistook itself for wisdom ignorance gave itself airs of knowledge and selfishness turning its eyes upward called itself religion  nevertheless evangelicalism had brought into palpable existence and operation in milby society that idea of duty that recognition of something to be lived for beyond the mere satisfaction of self which is to the moral life what the addition of a great central ganglion is to animal life no man can begin to mould himself on a faith or an idea without rising to a higher order of experience a principle of subordination of selfmastery has been introduced into his nature he is no longer a mere bundle of impressions desires and impulses whatever might be the weaknesses of the ladies who pruned the luxuriance of their lace and ribbons cut out garments for the poor distributed tracts quoted scripture and defined the true gospel they had learned thisthat there was a divine work to be done in life a rule of goodness higher than the opinion of their neighbours and if the notion of a heaven in reserve for themselves was a little too prominent yet the theory of fitness for that heaven consisted in purity of heart in christlike compassion in the subduing of selfish desires they might give the name of piety to much that was only puritanic egoism they might call many things sin that were not sin but they had at least the feeling that sin was to be avoided and resisted and colourblindness which may mistake drab for scarlet is better than total blindness which sees no distinction of colour at all miss rebecca linnet in quiet attire with a somewhat excessive solemnity of countenance teaching at the sunday school visiting the poor and striving after a standard of purity and goodness had surely more moral loveliness than in those flaunting peonydays when she had no other model than the costumes of the heroines in the circulating library miss eliza pratt listening in rapt attention to mr tryans evening lecture no doubt found evangelical channels for vanity and egoism but she was clearly in moral advance of miss phipps giggling under her feathers at old mr crewes peculiarities of enunciation and even elderly fathers and mothers with minds like mrs linnets too tough to imbibe much doctrine were the better for having their hearts inclined towards the new preacher as a messenger from god they became ashamed perhaps of their evil tempers ashamed of their worldliness ashamed of their trivial futile past the first condition of human goodness is something to love the second something to reverence and this latter precious gift was brought to milby by mr tryan and evangelicalism  yes the movement was good though it had that mixture of folly and evil which often makes what is good an offence to feeble and fastidious minds who want human actions and characters riddled through the sieve of their own ideas before they can accord their sympathy or admiration such minds i daresay would have found mr tryans character very much in need of that riddling process the blessed work of helping the world forward happily does not wait to be done by perfect men and i should imagine that neither luther nor john bunyan for example would have satisfied the modern demand for an ideal hero who believes nothing but what is true feels nothing but what is exalted and does nothing but what is graceful the real heroes of gods making are quite different they have their natural heritage of love and conscience which they drew in with their mothers milk they know one or two of those deep spiritual truths which are only to be won by long wrestling with their own sins and their own sorrows they have earned faith and strength so far as they have done genuine work but the rest is dry barren theory blank prejudice vague hearsay their insight is blended with mere opinion their sympathy is perhaps confined in narrow conduits of doctrine instead of flowing forth with the freedom of a stream that blesses every weed in its course obstinacy or selfassertion will often interfuse itself with their grandest impulses and their very deeds of selfsacrifice are sometimes only the rebound of a passionate egoism so it was with mr tryan and any one looking at him with the birdseye glance of a critic might perhaps say that he made the mistake of identifying christianity with a too narrow doctrinal system that he saw gods work too exclusively in antagonism to the world the flesh and the devil that his intellectual culture was too limitedand so on making mr tryan the text for a wise discourse on the characteristics of the evangelical school in his day  but i am not poised at that lofty height i am on the level and in the press with him as he struggles his way along the stony road through the crowd of unloving fellowmen he is stumbling perhaps his heart now beats fast with dread now heavily with anguish his eyes are sometimes dim with tears which he makes haste to dash away he pushes manfully on with fluctuating faith and courage with a sensitive failing body at last he falls the struggle is ended and the crowd closes over the space he has left  one of the evangelical clergy a disciple of venn says the critic from his birdseye station not a remarkable specimen the anatomy and habits of his species have been determined long ago  yet surely surely the only true knowledge of our fellowman is that which enables us to feel with himwhich gives us a fine ear for the heartpulses that are beating under the mere clothes of circumstance and opinion our subtlest analysis of schools and sects must miss the essential truth unless it be lit up by the love that sees in all forms of human thought and work the life and death struggles of separate human beings     chapter 11   mr tryans most unfriendly observers were obliged to admit that he gave himself no rest three sermons on sunday a nightschool for young men on tuesday a cottagelecture on thursday addresses to schoolteachers and catechizing of schoolchildren with pastoral visits multiplying as his influence extended beyond his own district of paddiford common would have been enough to tax severely the powers of a much stronger man mr pratt remonstrated with him on his imprudence but could not prevail on him so far to economize time and strength as to keep a horse on some ground or other which his friends found difficult to explain to themselves mr tryan seemed bent on wearing himself out his enemies were at no loss to account for such a course the evangelical curates selfishness was clearly of too bad a kind to exhibit itself after the ordinary manner of a sound respectable selfishness he wants to get the reputation of a saint said one hes eaten up with spiritual pride said another hes got his eye on some fine living and wants to creep up the bishops sleeve said a third  mr stickney of salem who considered all voluntary discomfort as a remnant of the legal spirit pronounced a severe condemnation on this selfneglect and expressed his fear that mr tryan was still far from having attained true christian liberty good mr jerome eagerly seized this doctrinal view of the subject as a means of enforcing the suggestions of his own benevolence and one cloudy afternoon in the end of november he mounted his roan mare with the determination of riding to paddiford and arguying the point with mr tryan  the old gentlemans face looked very mournful as he rode along the dismal paddiford lanes between rows of grimy houses darkened with handlooms while the black dust was whirled about him by the cold november wind he was thinking of the object which had brought him on this afternoon ride and his thoughts according to his habit when alone found vent every now and then in audible speech it seemed to him as his eyes rested on this scene of mr tryans labours that he could understand the clergymans selfprivation without resorting to mr stickneys theory of defective spiritual enlightenment do not philosophic doctors tell us that we are unable to discern so much as a tree except by an unconscious cunning which combines many past and separate sensations that no one sense is independent of another so that in the dark we can hardly taste a fricassee or tell whether our pipe is alight or not and the most intelligent boy if accommodated with claws or hoofs instead of fingers would be likely to remain on the lowest form if so it is easy to understand that our discernment of mens motives must depend on the completeness of the elements we can bring from our own susceptibility and our own experience see to it friend before you pronounce a too hasty judgement that your own moral sensibilities are not of a hoofed or clawed character the keenest eye will not serve unless you have the delicate fingers with their subtle nerve filaments which elude scientific lenses and lose themselves in the invisible world of human sensations  as for mr jerome he drew the elements of his moral vision from the depths of his veneration and pity if he himself felt so much for these poor things to whom life was so dim and meagre what must the clergyman feel who had undertaken before god to be their shepherd  ah he whispered interruptedly its too big a load for his conscience poor man he wants to mek himself their brother like cant abide to preach to the fastin on a full stomach ah hes better nor we are thats ithes a deal better nor we are  here mr jerome shook his bridle violently and looked up with an air of moral courage as if mr stickney had been present and liable to take offence at this conclusion a few minutes more brought him in front of mrs wagstaffs where mr tryan lodged he had often been here before so that the contrast between this ugly square brick house with its shabby bit of grassplot stared at all round by cottage windows and his own pretty white home set in a paradise of orchard and garden and pasture was not new to him but he felt it with fresh force today as he slowly fastened his roan by the bridle to the wooden paling and knocked at the door mr tryan was at home and sent to request that mr jerome would walk up into his study as the fire was out in the parlour below  at the mention of a clergymans study perhaps your too active imagination conjures up a perfect snuggery where the general air of comfort is rescued from a secular character by strong ecclesiastical suggestions in the shape of the furniture the pattern of the carpet and the prints on the wall where if a nap is taken it is an easychair with a gothic back and the very feet rest on a warm and velvety simulation of church windows where the pure art of rigorous english protestantism smiles above the mantelpiece in the portrait of an eminent bishop or a refined anglican taste is indicated by a german print from overbeck where the walls are lined with choice divinity in sombre binding and the light is softened by a screen of boughs with a grey church in the background  but i must beg you to dismiss all such scenic prettiness suitable as they may be to a clergymans character and complexion for i have to confess that mr tryans study was a very ugly little room indeed with an ugly slapdash pattern on the walls an ugly carpet on the floor and an ugly view of cottage roofs and cabbagegardens from the window his own person his writingtable and his bookcase were the only objects in the room that had the slightest air of refinement and the sole provision for comfort was a clumsy straightbacked armchair covered with faded chintz the man who could live in such a room unconstrained by poverty must either have his vision fed from within by an intense passion or he must have chosen that least attractive form of selfmortification which wears no haircloth and has no meagre days but accepts the vulgar the commonplace and the ugly whenever the highest duty seems to lie among them  mr tryan i hope youll excuse me disturbin on you said mr jerome but id summat partickler to say  you dont disturb me at all mr jerome im very glad to have a visit from you said mr tryan shaking him heartily by the hand and offering him the chintzcovered easy chair it is some time since ive had an opportunity of seeing you except on a sunday  ah sir your times so taken up im well aware o that its not only what you hev to do but its goin about from place to place an you dont keep a hoss mr tryan you dont take care enough o yourselfyou dont indeed an thats what i come to talk to y about  thats very good of you mr jerome but i assure you i think walking does me no harm it is rather a relief to me after speaking or writing you know i have no great circuit to make the farthest distance i have to walk is to milby church and if ever i want a horse on a sunday i hire radleys who lives not many hundred yards from me  well but now the winters comin on an youll get wet i your feet an pratt tells me as your constitutions dillicate as anybody may see for the matter o that wiout bein a doctor an this is the light i look at it in mr tryan whos to fill up your place if you was to be disabled as i may say consider what a valyable life yours is youve begun a great work i milby and so you might carry it on if youd your health and strength the more care you take o yourself the longer youll live belike god willing to do good to your fellowcreaturs  why my dear mr jerome i think i should not be a longlived man in any case and if i were to take care of myself under the pretext of doing more good i should very likely die and leave nothing done after all  well but keepin a hoss wouldnt hinder you from workin it ud help you to do more though pratt says as its usin your voice so constant as does you the most harm now isnt itim no scholard mr tryan an im not agoin to dictate to youbut isnt it amost akillin o yourself to go on a that way beyond your strength we mustnt fling ower lives away  no not fling them away lightly but we are permitted to lay down our lives in a right cause there are many duties as you know mr jerome which stand before taking care of our own lives  ah i cant arguy wi you mr tryan but what i wanted to says thistheres my little chacenut hoss i should take it quite a kindness if youd hev him through the winter an ride him ive thought o sellin him a many times for mrs jerome cant abide him and what do i want wi two nags but im fond o the little chacenut an i shouldnt like to sell him so if youll only ride him for me youll do me a kindnessyou will indeed mr tryan  thank you mr jerome i promise you to ask for him when i feel that i want a nag there is no man i would more gladly be indebted to than you but at present i would rather not have a horse i should ride him very little and it would be an inconvenience to me to keep him rather than otherwise  mr jerome looked troubled and hesitating as if he had something on his mind that would not readily shape itself into words at last he said youll excuse me mr tryan i wouldnt be takin a liberty but i know what great claims you hev on you as a clergyman is it th expense mr tryan is it the money  no my dear sir i have much more than a single man needs my way of living is quite of my own choosing and i am doing nothing but what i feel bound to do quite apart from money considerations we cannot judge for one another you know we have each our peculiar weaknesses and temptations i quite admit that it might be right for another man to allow himself more luxuries and i assure you i think it no superiority in myself to do without them on the contrary if my heart were less rebellious and if i were less liable to temptation i should not need that sort of selfdenial but added mr tryan holding out his hand to mr jerome i understand your kindness and bless you for it if i want a horse i shall ask for the chesnut  mr jerome was obliged to rest contented with this promise and rode home sorrowfully reproaching himself with not having said one thing he meant to say when setting out and with having clean forgot the arguments he had intended to quote from mr stickney  mr jeromes was not the only mind that was seriously disturbed by the idea that the curate was overworking himself there were tender womens hearts in which anxiety about the state of his affections was beginning to be merged in anxiety about the state of his health miss eliza pratt had at one time passed through much sleepless cogitation on the possibility of mr tryans being attached to some lady at a distanceat laxeter perhaps where he had formerly held a curacy and her fine eyes kept close watch lest any symptom of engaged affections on his part should escape her it seemed an alarming fact that his handkerchiefs were beautifully marked with hair until she reflected that he had an unmarried sister of whom he spoke with much affection as his fathers companion and comforter besides mr tryan had never paid any distant visit except one for a few days to his father and no hint escaped him of his intending to take a house or change his mode of living no he could not be engaged though he might have been disappointed but this latter misfortune is one from which a devoted clergyman has been known to recover by the aid of a fine pair of grey eyes that beam on him with affectionate reverence before christmas however her cogitations began to take another turn she heard her father say very confidently that tryan was consumptive and if he didnt take more care of himself his life would not be worth a years purchase and shame at having speculated on suppositions that were likely to prove so false sent poor miss elizas feelings with all the stronger impetus into the one channel of sorrowful alarm at the prospect of losing the pastor who had opened to her a new life of piety and selfsubjection it is a sad weakness in us after all that the thought of a mans death hallows him anew to us as if life were not sacred tooas if it were comparatively a light thing to fail in love and reverence to the brother who has to climb the whole toilsome steep with us and all our tears and tenderness were due to the one who is spared that hard journey  the miss linnets too were beginning to take a new view of the future entirely uncoloured by jealousy of miss eliza pratt  did you notice said mary one afternoon when mrs pettifer was taking tea with themdid you notice that short dry cough of mr tryans yesterday i think he looks worse and worse every week and i only wish i knew his sister i would write to her about him im sure something should be done to make him give up part of his work and he will listen to no one here  ah said mrs pettifer its a thousand pities his father and sister cant come and live with him if he isnt to marry but i wish with all my heart he could have taken to some nice woman as would have made a comfortable home for him i used to think he might take to eliza pratt shes a good girl and very pretty but i see no likelihood of it now  no indeed said rebecca with some emphasis mr tryans heart is not for any woman to win it is all given to his work and i could never wish to see him with a young inexperienced wife who would be a drag on him instead of a helpmate  hed need have somebody young or old observed mrs linnet to see as he wears a flannel wescoat an changes his stockins when he comes in its my opinion hes got that cough wi sittin i wet shoes and stockins an that mrs wagstaffs a poor addleheaded thing she doesnt half tek care on him  o mother said rebecca shes a very pious woman and im sure she thinks it too great a privilege to have mr tryan with her not to do the best she can to make him comfortable she cant help her rooms being shabby  ive nothing to say again her piety my dear but i know very well i shouldnt like her to cook my victual when a man comes in hungry an tired piety wont feed him i reckon hard carrots ull lie heavy on his stomach piety or no piety i called in one day when she was dishin up mr tryans dinner an i could see the potatoes was as watery as watery its right enough to be speritialim no enemy to that but i like my potatoes mealy i dont see as anybody ull go to heaven the sooner for not digestin their dinnerprovidin they dont die sooner as mayhap mr tryan will poor dear man  it will be a heavy day for us all when that comes to pass said mrs pettifer we shall never get anybody to fill up that gap theres the new clergyman thats just come to sheppertonmr parry i saw him the other day at mrs bonds he may be a very good man and a fine preacher they say he is but i thought to myself what a difference between him and mr tryan hes a sharpsortoflooking man and hasnt that feeling way with him that mr tryan has what is so wonderful to me in mr tryan is the way he puts himself on a level with one and talks to one like a brother im never afraid of telling him anything he never seems to look down on anybody he knows how to lift up those that are cast down if ever man did  yes said mary and when i see all the faces turned up to him in paddiford church i often think how hard it would be for any clergyman who had to come after him he has made the people love him so     chapter 12   in her occasional visits to her near neighbour mrs pettifer too old a friend to be shunned because she was a tryanite janet was obliged sometimes to hear allusions to mr tryan and even to listen to his praises which she usually met with playful incredulity  ah well she answered one day i like dear old mr crewe and his pipes a great deal better than your mr tryan and his gospel when i was a little toddle mr and mrs crewe used to let me play about in their garden and have a swing between the great elmtrees because mother had no garden i like people who are kind kindness is my religion and thats the reason i like you dear mrs pettifer though you are a tryanite  but thats mr tryans religion tooat least partly theres nobody can give himself up more to doing good amongst the poor and he thinks of their bodies too as well as their souls  o yes yes but then he talks about faith and grace and all that making people believe they are better than others and that god loves them more than he does the rest of the world i know he has put a great deal of that into sally martins head and it has done her no good at all she was as nice honest patient a girl as need be before and now she fancies she has new light and new wisdom i dont like those notions  you mistake him indeed you do my dear mrs dempster i wish youd go and hear him preach  hear him preach why you wicked woman you would persuade me to disobey my husband would you o shocking i shall run away from you goodbye  a few days after this conversation however janet went to sally martins about three oclock in the afternoon the pudding that had been sent in for herself and mammy struck her as just the sort of delicate morsel the poor consumptive girl would be likely to fancy and in her usual impulsive way she had started up from the dinner table at once put on her bonnet and set off with a covered plateful to the neighbouring street when she entered the house there was no one to be seen but in the little sideroom where sally lay janet heard a voice it was one she had not heard before but she immediately guessed it to be mr tryans her first impulse was to set down her plate and go away but mrs martin might not be in and then there would be no one to give sally that delicious bit of pudding so she stood still and was obliged to hear what mr tryan was saying he was interrupted by one of the invalids violent fits of coughing  it is very hard to bear is it not he said when she was still again yet god seems to support you under it wonderfully pray for me sally that i may have strength too when the hour of great suffering comes it is one of my worst weaknesses to shrink from bodily pain and i think the time is perhaps not far off when i shall have to bear what you are bearing but now i have tired you we have talked enough goodbye  janet was surprised and forgot her wish not to encounter mr tryan the tone and the words were so unlike what she had expected to hear there was none of the selfsatisfied unction of the teacher quoting or exhorting or expounding for the benefit of the hearer but a simple appeal for help a confession of weakness mr tryan had his deeplyfelt troubles then mr tryan too like herself knew what it was to tremble at a foreseen trialto shudder at an impending burthen heavier than he felt able to bear  the most brilliant deed of virtue could not have inclined janets goodwill towards mr tryan so much as this fellowship in suffering and the softening thought was in her eyes when he appeared in the doorway pale weary and depressed the sight of janet standing there with the entire absence of selfconsciousness which belongs to a new and vivid impression made him start and pause a little their eyes met and they looked at each other gravely for a few moments then they bowed and mr tryan passed out  there is a power in the direct glance of a sincere and loving human soul which will do more to dissipate prejudice and kindle charity than the most elaborate arguments the fullest exposition of mr tryans doctrine might not have sufficed to convince janet that he had not an odious selfcomplacency in believing himself a peculiar child of god but one direct pathetic look of his had dissociated him with that conception for ever  this happened late in the autumn not long before sally martin died janet mentioned her new impression to no one for she was afraid of arriving at a still more complete contradiction of her former ideas we have all of us considerable regard for our past self and are not fond of casting reflections on that respected individual by a total negation of his opinions janet could no longer think of mr tryan without sympathy but she still shrank from the idea of becoming his hearer and admirer that was a reversal of the past which was as little accordant with her inclination as her circumstances  and indeed this interview with mr tryan was soon thrust into the background of poor janets memory by the daily thickening miseries of her life     chapter 13   the loss of mr jerome as a client proved only the beginning of annoyances to dempster that old gentleman had in him the vigorous remnant of an energy and perseverance which had created his own fortune and being as i have hinted given to chewing the cud of a righteous indignation with considerable relish he was determined to carry on his retributive war against the persecuting attorney having some influence with mr pryme who was one of the most substantial ratepayers in the neighbouring parish of dingley and who had himself a complex and longstanding private account with dempster mr jerome stirred up this gentleman to an investigation of some suspicious points in the attorneys conduct of the parish affairs the natural consequence was a personal quarrel between dempster and mr pryme the client demanded his account and then followed the old story of an exorbitant lawyers bill with the unpleasant anticlimax of taxing  these disagreeables extending over many months ran along side by side with the pressing business of mr armstrongs lawsuit which was threatening to take a turn rather depreciatory of dempsters professional prevision and it is not surprising that being thus kept in a constant state of irritated excitement about his own affairs he had little time for the further exhibition of his public spirit or for rallying the forlorn hope of sound churchmanship against cant and hypocrisy not a few persons who had a grudge against him began to remark with satisfaction that dempsters luck was forsaking him particularly mrs linnet who thought she saw distinctly the gradual ripening of a providential scheme whereby a just retribution would be wrought on the man who had deprived her of pyes croft on the other hand dempsters wellsatisfied clients who were of opinion that the punishment of his wickedness might conveniently be deferred to another world noticed with some concern that he was drinking more than ever and that both his temper and his driving were becoming more furious unhappily those additional glasses of brandy that exasperation of loudtongued abuse had other effects than any that entered into the contemplation of anxious clients they were the little superadded symbols that were perpetually raising the sum of home misery  poor janet how heavily the months rolled on for her laden with fresh sorrows as the summer passed into autumn the autumn into winter and the winter into spring again every feverish morning with its blank listlessness and despair seemed more hateful than the last every coming night more impossible to brave without arming herself in leaden stupor the morning light brought no gladness to her it seemed only to throw its glare on what had happened in the dim candlelighton the cruel man seated immovable in drunken obstinacy by the dead fire and dying lights in the diningroom rating her in harsh tones reiterating old reproachesor on a hideous blank of something unremembered something that must have made that dark bruise on her shoulder which aches as she dressed herself  do you wonder how it was that things had come to this passwhat offence janet had committed in the early years of marriage to rouse the brutal hatred of this man the seeds of things are very small the hours that lie between sunrise and the gloom of midnight are travelled through by tiniest markings of the clock and janet looking back along the fifteen years of her married life hardly knew how or where this total misery began hardly knew when the sweet wedded love and hope that had set for ever had ceased to make a twilight of memory and relenting before the oncoming of the utter dark  old mrs dempster thought she saw the true beginning of it all in janets want of housekeeping skill and exactness janet she said to herself was always running about doing things for other people and neglecting her own house that provokes a man what use is it for a woman to be loving and making a fuss with her husband if she doesnt take care and keep his home just as he likes it if she isnt at hand when he wants anything done if she doesnt attend to all his wishes let them be as small as they may that was what i did when i was a wife though i didnt make half so much fuss about loving my husband then janet had no children  ah there mammy dempster had touched a true spring not perhaps of her sons cruelty but of half janets misery if she had had babes to rock to sleeplittle ones to kneel in their nightdress and say their prayers at her kneessweet boys and girls to put their young arms round her neck and kiss away her tears her poor hungry heart would have been fed with strong love and might never have needed that fiery poison to still its cravings mighty is the force of motherhood says the great tragic poet to us across the ages finding as usual the simplest words for the sublimest factgreek deinon to tiktein estin it transforms all things by its vital heat it turns timidity into fierce courage and dreadless defiance into tremulous submission it turns thoughtlessness into foresight and yet stills all anxiety into calm content it makes selfishness become selfdenial and gives even to hard vanity the glance of admiring love yes if janet had been a mother she might have been saved from much sin and therefore from much of her sorrow  but do not believe that it was anything either present or wanting in poor janet that formed the motive of her husbands cruelty cruelty like every other vice requires no motive outside itselfit only requires opportunity you do not suppose dempster had any motive for drinking beyond the craving for drink the presence of brandy was the only necessary condition and an unloving tyrannous brutal man needs no motive to prompt his cruelty he needs only the perpetual presence of a woman he can call his own a whole park full of tame or timideyed animals to torment at his will would not serve him so well to glut his lust of torture they could not feel as one woman does they could not throw out the keen retort which whets the edge of hatred  janets bitterness would overflow in ready words she was not to be made meek by cruelty she would repent of nothing in the face of injustice though she was subdued in a moment by a word or a look that recalled the old days of fondness and in times of comparative calm would often recover her sweet womans habit of caressing playful affection but such days were become rare and poor janets soul was kept like a vexed sea tossed by a new storm before the old waves have fallen proud angry resistance and sullen endurance were now almost the only alternations she knew she would bear it all proudly to the world but proudly towards him too her womans weakness might shriek a cry for pity under a heavy blow but voluntarily she would do nothing to mollify him unless he first relented what had she ever done to him but love him too wellbut believe in him too foolishly he had no pity on her tender flesh he could strike the soft neck he had once asked to kiss yet she would not admit her wretchedness she had married him blindly and she would bear it out to the terrible end whatever that might be better this misery than the blank that lay for her outside her married home  but there was one person who heard all the plaints and all the outbursts of bitterness and despair which janet was never tempted to pour into any other ear and alas in her worst moments janet would throw out wild reproaches against that patient listener for the wrong that rouses our angry passions finds only a medium in us it passes through us like a vibration and we inflict what we have suffered  mrs raynor saw too clearly all through the winter that things were getting worse in orchard street she had evidence enough of it in janets visits to her and though her own visits to her daughter were so timed that she saw little of dempster personally she noticed many indications not only that he was drinking to greater excess but that he was beginning to lose that physical power of supporting excess which had long been the admiration of such fine spirits as mr tomlinson it seemed as if dempster had some consciousness of thissome new distrust of himself for before winter was over it was observed that he had renounced his habit of driving out alone and was never seen in his gig without a servant by his side  nemesis is lame but she is of colossal stature like the gods and sometimes while her sword is not yet unsheathed she stretches out her huge left arm and grasps her victim the mighty hand is invisible but the victim totters under the dire clutch  the various symptoms that things were getting worse with the dempsters afforded milby gossip something new to say on an old subject mrs dempster every one remarked looked more miserable than ever though she kept up the old pretence of being happy and satisfied she was scarcely ever seen as she used to be going about on her goodnatured errands and even old mrs crewe who had always been wilfully blind to anything wrong in her favourite janet was obliged to admit that she had not seemed like herself lately the poor things out of health said the kind little old lady in answer to all gossip about janet her headaches always were bad and i know what headaches are why they make one quite delirious sometimes mrs phipps for her part declared she would never accept an invitation to dempsters again it was getting so very disagreeable to go there mrs dempster was often so strange to be sure there were dreadful stories about the way dempster used his wife but in mrs phippss opinion it was six of one and halfadozen of the other mrs dempster had never been like other women she had always a flighty way with her carrying parcels of snuff to old mrs tooke and going to drink tea with mrs brinley the carpenters wife and then never taking care of her clothes always wearing the same things weekday or sunday a man has a poor lookout with a wife of that sort mr phipps amiable and laconic wondered how it was women were so fond of running each other down  mr pratt having been called in provisionally to a patient of mr pilgrims in a case of compound fracture observed in a friendly colloquy with his brother surgeon the next dayso dempster has left off driving himself i see he wont end with a broken neck after all youll have a case of meningitis and delirium tremens instead  ah said mr pilgrim he can hardly stand it much longer at the rate hes going on one would think hes been confoundedly cut up about that business of armstrongs i fancy it may do him some harm perhaps but dempster must have feathered his nest pretty well he can afford to lose a little business  his business will outlast him thats pretty clear said pratt hell run down like a watch with a broken spring one of these days  another prognostic of evil to dempster came at the beginning of march for then little mamsey dieddied suddenly the housemaid found her seated motionless in her armchair her knitting fallen down and the tortoiseshell cat reposing on it unreproved the little white old woman had ended her wintry age of patient sorrow believing to the last that robert might have been a good husband as he had been a good son  when the earth was thrown on mamseys coffin and the son in crape scarf and hatband turned away homeward his good angel lingering with outstretched wing on the edge of the grave cast one despairing look after him and took flight for ever     chapter 14   the last week in marchthree weeks after old mrs dempster diedoccurred the unpleasant windingup of affairs between dempster and mr pryme and under this additional source of irritation the attorneys diurnal drunkenness had taken on its most illtempered and brutal phase on the friday morning before setting out for rotherby he told his wife that he had invited four men to dinner at halfpast six that evening the previous night had been a terrible one for janet and when her husband broke his grim morning silence to say these few words she was looking so blank and listless that he added in a loud sharp key do you hear what i say or must i tell the cook she started and said yes i hear  then mind and have a dinner provided and dont go mooning about like crazy jane  half an hour afterwards mrs raynor quietly busy in her kitchen with her household laboursfor she had only a little twelveyearold girl as a servantheard with trembling the rattling of the garden gate and the opening of the outer door she knew the step and in one short moment she lived beforehand through the coming scene she hurried out of the kitchen and there in the passage as she had felt stood janet her eyes worn as if by nightlong watching her dress careless her step languid no cheerful morning greeting to her motherno kiss she turned into the parlour and seating herself on the sofa opposite her mothers chair looked vacantly at the walls and furniture until the corners of her mouth began to tremble and her dark eyes filled with tears that fell unwiped down her cheeks the mother sat silently opposite to her afraid to speak she felt sure there was nothing new the mattersure that the torrent of words would come sooner or later  mother why dont you speak to me janet burst out at last you dont care about my suffering you are blaming me because i feelbecause i am miserable  my child i am not blaming youmy heart is bleeding for you your head is bad this morningyou have had a bad night let me make you a cup of tea now perhaps you didnt like your breakfast  yes that is what you always think mother it is the old story you think you dont ask me what it is i have had to bear you are tired of hearing me you are cruel like the rest every one is cruel in this world nothing but blameblameblame never any pity god is cruel to have sent me into the world to bear all this misery  janet janet dont say so it is not for us to judge we must submit we must be thankful for the gift of life  thankful for life why should i be thankful god has made me with a heart to feel and he has sent me nothing but misery how could i help it how could i know what would come why didnt you tell me motherwhy did you let me marry you knew what brutes men could be and theres no help for meno hope i cant kill myself ive tried but i cant leave this world and go to another there may be no pity for me there as there is none here  janet my child there is pity have i ever done anything but love you and there is pity in god hasnt he put pity into your heart for many a poor sufferer where did it come from if not from him  janets nervous irritation now broke out into sobs instead of complainings and her mother was thankful for after that crisis there would very likely come relenting and tenderness and comparative calm she went out to make some tea and when she returned with the tray in her hands janet had dried her eyes and now turned them towards her mother with a faint attempt to smile but the poor face in its sad blurred beauty looked all the more piteous  mother will insist upon her tea she said and i really think i can drink a cup but i must go home directly for there are people coming to dinner could you go with me and help me mother  mrs raynor was always ready to do that she went to orchard street with janet and remained with her through the daycomforted as evening approached to see her become more cheerful and willing to attend to her toilette at halfpast five everything was in order janet was dressed and when the mother had kissed her and said goodbye she could not help pausing a moment in sorrowful admiration at the tall rich figure looking all the grander for the plainness of the deep mourning dress and the noble face with its massy folds of black hair made matronly by a simple white cap janet had that enduring beauty which belongs to pure majestic outline and depth of tint sorrow and neglect leave their traces on such beauty but it thrills us to the last like a glorious greek temple which for all the loss it has suffered from time and barbarous hands has gained a solemn history and fills our imagination the more because it is incomplete to the sense  it was six oclock before dempster returned from rotherby he had evidently drunk a great deal and was in an angry humour but janet who had gathered some little courage and forbearance from the consciousness that she had done her best today was determined to speak pleasantly to him  robert she said gently as she saw him seat himself in the diningroom in his dusty snuffy clothes and take some documents out of his pocket will you not wash and change your dress it will refresh you  leave me alone will you said dempster in his most brutal tone  do change your coat and waistcoat they are so dusty ive laid all your things out ready  o you have have you after a few minutes he rose very deliberately and walked upstairs into his bedroom janet had often been scolded before for not laying out his clothes and she thought now not without some wonder that this attention of hers had brought him to compliance  presently he called out janet and she went upstairs  here take that he said as soon as she reached the door flinging at her the coat she had laid out another time leave me to do as i please will you  the coat flung with great force only brushed her shoulder and fell some distance within the drawingroom the door of which stood open just opposite she hastily retreated as she saw the waistcoat coming and one by one the clothes she had laid out were all flung into the drawingroom  janets face flushed with anger and for the first time in her life her resentment overcame the long cherished pride that made her hide her griefs from the world there are moments when by some strange impulse we contradict our past selvesfatal moments when a fit of passion like a lava stream lays low the work of half our lives janet thought i will not pick up the clothes they shall lie there until the visitors come and he shall be ashamed of himself  there was a knock at the door and she made haste to seat herself in the drawingroom lest the servant should enter and remove the clothes which were lying half on the table and half on the ground mr lowme entered with a less familiar visitor a client of dempsters and the next moment dempster himself came in  his eye fell at once on the clothes and then turned for an instant with a devilish glance of concentrated hatred on janet who still flushed and excited affected unconsciousness after shaking hands with his visitors he immediately rang the bell  take those clothes away he said to the servant not looking at janet again  during dinner she kept up her assumed air of indifference and tried to seem in high spirits laughing and talking more than usual in reality she felt as if she had defied a wild beast within the four walls of his den and he was crouching backward in preparation for his deadly spring dempster affected to take no notice of her talked obstreperously and drank steadily  about eleven the party dispersed with the exception of mr budd who had joined them after dinner and appeared disposed to stay drinking a little longer janet began to hope that he would stay long enough for dempster to become heavy and stupid and so to fall asleep downstairs which was a rare but occasional ending of his nights she told the servants to sit up no longer and she herself undressed and went to bed trying to cheat her imagination into the belief that the day was ended for her but when she lay down she became more intensely awake than ever everything she had taken this evening seemed only to stimulate her senses and her apprehensions to new vividness her heart beat violently and she heard every sound in the house  at last when it was twelve she heard mr budd go out she heard the door slam dempster had not moved was he asleep would he forget the minute seemed long while with a quickening pulse she was on the stretch to catch every sound  janet the loud jarring voice seemed to strike her like a hurled weapon  janet he called again moving out of the diningroom to the foot of the stairs  there was a pause of a minute  if you dont come ill kill you  another pause and she heard him turn back into the diningroom he was gone for a lightperhaps for a weapon perhaps he would kill her let him life was as hideous as death for years she had been rushing on to some unknown but certain horror and now she was close upon it she was almost glad she was in a state of flushed feverish defiance that neutralized her womans terrors  she heard his heavy step on the stairs she saw the slowly advancing light then she saw the tall massive figure and the heavy face now fierce with drunken rage he had nothing but the candle in his hand he set it down on the table and advanced close to the bed  so you think youll defy me do you well see how long that will last get up madam out of bed this instant  in the close presence of the dreadful manof this huge crushing force armed with savage willpoor janets desperate defiance all forsook her and her terrors came back trembling she got up and stood helpless in her nightdress before her husband  he seized her with his heavy grasp by the shoulder and pushed her before him  ill cool your hot spirit for you ill teach you to brave me  slowly he pushed her along before him down stairs and through the passage where a small oillamp was still flickering what was he going to do to her she thought every moment he was going to dash her before him on the ground but she gave no screamshe only trembled  he pushed her on to the entrance and held her firmly in his grasp while he lifted the latch of the door then he opened the door a little way thrust her out and slammed it behind her  for a short space it seemed like a deliverance to janet the harsh northeast wind that blew through her thin nightdress and sent her long heavy black hair streaming seemed like the breath of pity after the grasp of that threatening monster but soon the sense of release from an overpowering terror gave way before the sense of the fate that had really come upon her  this then was what she had been travelling towards through her long years of misery not yet death o if she had been brave enough for it death would have been better the servants slept at the back of the house it was impossible to make them hear so that they might let her in again quietly without her husbands knowledge and she would not have tried he had thrust her out and it should be for ever  there would have been dead silence in orchard street but for the whistling of the wind and the swirling of the march dust on the pavement thick clouds covered the sky every door was closed every window was dark no ray of light fell on the tall white figure that stood in lonely misery on the doorstep no eye rested on janet as she sank down on the cold stone and looked into the dismal night she seemed to be looking into her own blank future     chapter 15   the stony street the bitter northeast wind and darknessand in the midst of them a tender woman thrust out from her husbands home in her thin nightdress the harsh wind cutting her naked feet and driving her long hair away from her halfclad bosom where the poor heart is crushed with anguish and despair  the drowning man urged by the supreme agony lives in an instant through all his happy and unhappy past when the dark flood has fallen like a curtain memory in a single moment sees the drama acted over again and even in those earlier crises which are but types of deathwhen we are cut off abruptly from the life we have known when we can no longer expect tomorrow to resemble yesterday and find ourselves by some sudden shock on the confines of the unknownthere is often the same sort of lightningflash through the dark and unfrequented chambers of memory  when janet sat down shivering on the doorstone with the door shut upon her past life and the future black and unshapen before her as the night the scenes of her childhood her youth and her painful womanhood rushed back upon her consciousness and made one picture with her present desolation the petted child taking her newest toy to bed with herthe young girl proud in strength and beauty dreaming that life was an easy thing and that it was pitiful weakness to be unhappythe bride passing with trembling joy from the outer court to the inner sanctuary of womans lifethe wife beginning her initiation into sorrow wounded resenting yet still hoping and forgivingthe poor bruised woman seeking through weary years the one refuge of despair oblivionjanet seemed to herself all these in the same moment that she was conscious of being seated on the cold stone under the shock of a new misery all her early gladness all her bright hopes and illusions all her gifts of beauty and affection served only to darken the riddle of her life they were the betraying promises of a cruel destiny which had brought out those sweet blossoms only that the winds and storms might have a greater work of desolation which had nursed her like a pet fawn into tenderness and fond expectation only that she might feel a keener terror in the clutch of the panther her mother had sometimes said that troubles were sent to make us better and draw us nearer to god what mockery that seemed to janet her troubles had been sinking her lower from year to year pressing upon her like heavy feverladen vapours and perverting the very plenitude of her nature into a deeper source of disease her wretchedness had been a perpetually tightening instrument of torture which had gradually absorbed all the other sensibilities of her nature into the sense of pain and the maddened craving for relief oh if some ray of hope of pity of consolation would pierce through the horrible gloom she might believe then in a divine lovein a heavenly father who cared for his children but now she had no faith no trust there was nothing she could lean on in the wide world for her mother was only a fellowsufferer in her own lot the poor patient woman could do little more than mourn with her daughter she had humble resignation enough to sustain her own soul but she could no more give comfort and fortitude to janet than the withered ivycovered trunk can bear up its strong fullboughed offspring crashing down under an alpine storm janet felt she was alone no human soul had measured her anguish had understood her selfdespair had entered into her sorrows and her sins with that deepsighted sympathy which is wiser than all blame more potent than all reproofsuch sympathy as had swelled her own heart for many a sufferer and if there was any divine pity she could not feel it it kept aloof from her it poured no balm into her wounds it stretched out no hand to bear up her weak resolve to fortify her fainting courage  now in her utmost loneliness she shed no tear she sat staring fixedly into the darkness while inwardly she gazed at her own past almost losing the sense that it was her own or that she was anything more than a spectator at a strange and dreadful play  the loud sound of the church clock striking one startled her she had not been there more than half an hour then and it seemed to her as if she had been there half the night she was getting benumbed with cold with that strong instinctive dread of pain and death which had made her recoil from suicide she started up and the disagreeable sensation of resting on her benumbed feet helped to recall her completely to the sense of the present the wind was beginning to make rents in the clouds and there came every now and then a dim light of stars that frightened her more than the darkness it was like a cruel finger pointing her out in her wretchedness and humiliation it made her shudder at the thought of the morning twilight what could she do not go to her mothernot rouse her in the dead of night to tell her this her mother would think she was a spectre it would be enough to kill her with horror and the way there was so long  if she should meet some one  yet she must seek some shelter somewhere to hide herself five doors off there was mrs pettifers that kind woman would take her in it was of no use now to be proud and mind about the worlds knowing she had nothing to wish for nothing to care about only she could not help shuddering at the thought of braving the morning light there in the streetshe was frightened at the thought of spending long hours in the cold life might mean anguish might mean despair but oh she must clutch it though with bleeding fingers her feet must cling to the firm earth that the sunlight would revisit not slip into the untried abyss where she might long even for familiar pains  janet trod slowly with her naked feet on the rough pavement trembling at the fitful gleams of starlight and supporting herself by the wall as the gusts of wind drove right against her the very wind was cruel it tried to push her back from the door where she wanted to go and knock and ask for pity  mrs pettifers house did not look into orchard street it stood a little way up a wide passage which opened into the street through an archway janet turned up the archway and saw a faint light coming from mrs pettifers bedroom window the glimmer of a rushlight from a room where a friend was lying was like a ray of mercy to janet after that long long time of darkness and loneliness it would not be so dreadful to awake mrs pettifer as she had thought yet she lingered some minutes at the door before she gathered courage to knock she felt as if the sound must betray her to others besides mrs pettifer though there was no other dwelling that opened into the passageonly warehouses and outbuildings there was no gravel for her to throw up at the window nothing but heavy pavement there was no doorbell she must knock her first rap was very timidone feeble fall of the knocker and then she stood still again for many minutes but presently she rallied her courage and knocked several times together not loudly but rapidly so that mrs pettifer if she only heard the sound could not mistake it and she had heard it for by and by the casement of her window was opened and janet perceived that she was bending out to try and discern who it was at the door  it is i mrs pettifer it is janet dempster take me in for pitys sake  merciful god what has happened  robert has turned me out i have been in the cold a long while  mrs pettifer said no more but hurried away from the window and was soon at the door with a light in her hand  come in my poor dear come in said the good woman in a tremulous voice drawing janet within the door come into my warm bed and may god in heaven save and comfort you  the pitying eyes the tender voice the warm touch caused a rush of new feeling in janet her heart swelled and she burst out suddenly like a child into loud passionate sobs mrs pettifer could not help crying with her but she said come upstairs my dear come dont linger in the cold  she drew the poor sobbing thing gently upstairs and persuaded her to get into the warm bed but it was long before janet could lie down she sat leaning her head on her knees convulsed by sobs while the motherly woman covered her with clothes and held her arms round her to comfort her with warmth at last the hysterical passion had exhausted itself and she fell back on the pillow but her throat was still agitated by piteous aftersobs such as shake a little child even when it has found a refuge from its alarms on its mothers lap  now janet was getting quieter mrs pettifer determined to go down and make a cup of tea the first thing a kind old woman thinks of as a solace and restorative under all calamities happily there was no danger of awaking her servant a heavy girl of sixteen who was snoring blissfully in the attic and might be kept ignorant of the way in which mrs dempster had come in so mrs pettifer busied herself with rousing the kitchen fire which was kept in under a huge rakera possibility by which the coal of the midland counties atones for all its slowness and white ashes  when she carried up the tea janet was lying quite still the spasmodic agitation had ceased and she seemed lost in thought her eyes were fixed vacantly on the rushlight shade and all the lines of sorrow were deepened in her face  now my dear said mrs pettifer let me persuade you to drink a cup of tea youll find it warm you and soothe you very much why dear heart your feet are like ice still now do drink this tea and ill wrap em up in flannel and then theyll get warm  janet turned her dark eyes on her old friend and stretched out her arms she was too much oppressed to say anything her suffering lay like a heavy weight on her power of speech but she wanted to kiss the good kind woman mrs pettifer setting down the cup bent towards the sad beautiful face and janet kissed her with earnest sacramental kissessuch kisses as seal a new and closer bond between the helper and the helped  she drank the tea obediently it does warm me she said but now you will get into bed i shall lie still now  mrs pettifer felt it was the best thing she could do to lie down quietly and say no more she hoped janet might go to sleep as for herself with that tendency to wakefulness common to advanced years she found it impossible to compose herself to sleep again after this agitating surprise she lay listening to the clock wondering what had led to this new outrage of dempsters praying for the poor thing at her side and pitying the mother who would have to hear it all tomorrow     chapter 16   janet lay still as she had promised but the tea which had warmed her and given her a sense of greater bodily ease had only heightened the previous excitement of her brain her ideas had a new vividness which made her feel as if she had only seen life through a dim haze before her thoughts instead of springing from the action of her own mind were external existences that thrust themselves imperiously upon her like haunting visions the future took shape after shape of misery before her always ending in her being dragged back again to her old life of terror and stupor and fevered despair her husband had so long overshadowed her life that her imagination could not keep hold of a condition in which that great dread was absent and even his absencewhat was it only a dreary vacant flat where there was nothing to strive after nothing to long for  at last the light of morning quenched the rushlight and janets thoughts became more and more fragmentary and confused she was every moment slipping off the level on which she lay thinking down down into some depth from which she tried to rise again with a start slumber was stealing over her weary brain that uneasy slumber which is only better than wretched waking because the life we seemed to live in it determines no wretched future because the things we do and suffer in it are but hateful shadows and leave no impress that petrifies into an irrevocable past  she had scarcely been asleep an hour when her movements became more violent her mutterings more frequent and agitated till at last she started up with a smothered cry and looked wildly round her shaking with terror  dont be frightened dear mrs dempster said mrs pettifer who was up and dressing you are with me your old friend mrs pettifer nothing will harm you  janet sank back again on her pillow still trembling after lying silent a little while she said it was a horrible dream dear mrs pettifer dont let any one know i am here keep it a secret if he finds out he will come and drag me back again  no my dear depend on me ive just thought i shall send the servant home on a holidayive promised her a good while ill send her away as soon as shes had her breakfast and shell have no occasion to know youre here theres no holding servants tongues if you let em know anything what they dont know they wont tell you may trust em so far but shouldnt you like me to go and fetch your mother  no not yet not yet i cant bear to see her yet  well it shall be just as you like now try and get to sleep again i shall leave you for an hour or two and send off phoebe and then bring you some breakfast ill lock the door behind me so that the girl maynt come in by chance  the daylight changes the aspect of misery to us as of everything else in the night it presses on our imaginationthe forms it takes are false fitful exaggerated in broad day it sickens our sense with the dreary persistence of definite measurable reality the man who looks with ghastly horror on all his property aflame in the dead of night has not half the sense of destitution he will have in the morning when he walks over the ruins lying blackened in the pitiless sunshine that moment of intensest depression was come to janet when the daylight which showed her the walls and chairs and tables and all the commonplace reality that surrounded her seemed to lay bare the future too and bring out into oppressive distinctness all the details of a weary life to be lived from day to day with no hope to strengthen her against that evil habit which she loathed in retrospect and yet was powerless to resist her husband would never consent to her living away from him she was become necessary to his tyranny he would never willingly loosen his grasp on her she had a vague notion of some protection the law might give her if she could prove her life in danger from him but she shrank utterly as she had always done from any active public resistance or vengeance she felt too crushed too faulty too liable to reproach to have the courage even if she had had the wish to put herself openly in the position of a wronged woman seeking redress she had no strength to sustain her in a course of selfdefence and independence there was a darker shadow over her life than the dread of her husbandit was the shadow of selfdespair the easiest thing would be to go away and hide herself from him but then there was her mother robert had all her little property in his hands and that little was scarcely enough to keep her in comfort without his aid if janet went away alone he would be sure to persecute her mother and if she did go awaywhat then she must work to maintain herself she must exert herself weary and hopeless as she was to begin life afresh how hard that seemed to her janets nature did not belie her grand face and form there was energy there was strength in it but it was the strength of the vine which must have its broad leaves and rich clusters borne up by a firm stay and now she had nothing to rest onno faith no love if her mother had been very feeble aged or sickly janets deep pity and tenderness might have made a daughters duties an interest and a solace but mrs raynor had never needed tendance she had always been giving help to her daughter she had always been a sort of humble ministering spirit and it was one of janets pangs of memory that instead of being her mothers comfort she had been her mothers trial everywhere the same sadness her life was a sundried barren tract where there was no shadow and where all the waters were bitter  no she suddenly thoughtand the thought was like an electric shockthere was one spot in her memory which seemed to promise her an untried spring where the waters might be sweet that short interview with mr tryan had come back upon herhis voice his words his look which told her that he knew sorrow his words have implied that he thought his death was near yet he had a faith which enabled him to labourenabled him to give comfort to others that look of his came back on her with a vividness greater than it had had for her in reality surely he knew more of the secrets of sorrow than other men perhaps he had some message of comfort different from the feeble words she had been used to hear from others she was tired she was sick of that barren exhortationdo right and keep a clear conscience and god will reward you and your troubles will be easier to bear she wanted strength to do rightshe wanted something to rely on besides her own resolutions for was not the path behind her all strewn with broken resolutions how could she trust in new ones she had often heard mr tryan laughed at for being fond of great sinners she began to see a new meaning in those words he would perhaps understand her helplessness her wants if she could pour out her heart to him if she could for the first time in her life unlock all the chambers of her soul  the impulse to confession almost always requires the presence of a fresh ear and a fresh heart and in our moments of spiritual need the man to whom we have no tie but our common nature seems nearer to us than mother brother or friend our daily familiar life is but a hiding of ourselves from each other behind a screen of trivial words and deeds and those who sit with us at the same hearth are often the farthest off from the deep human soul within us full of unspoken evil and unacted good  when mrs pettifer came back to her turning the key and opening the door very gently janet instead of being asleep as her good friend had hoped was intensely occupied with her new thought she longed to ask mrs pettifer if she could see mr tryan but she was arrested by doubts and timidity he might not feel for herhe might be shocked at her confessionhe might talk to her of doctrines she could not understand or believe she could not make up her mind yet but she was too restless under this mental struggle to remain in bed  mrs pettifer she said i cant lie here any longer i must get up will you lend me some clothes  wrapt in such drapery as mrs pettifer could find for her tall figure janet went down into the little parlour and tried to take some of the breakfast her friend had prepared for her but her effort was not a successful one her cup of tea and bit of toast were only half finished the leaden weight of discouragement pressed upon her more and more heavily the wind had fallen and a drizzling rain had come on there was no prospect from mrs pettifers parlour but a blank wall and as janet looked out at the window the rain and the smokeblackened bricks seemed to blend themselves in sickening identity with her desolation of spirit and the headachy weariness of her body  mrs pettifer got through her household work as soon as she could and sat down with her sewing hoping that janet would perhaps be able to talk a little of what had passed and find some relief by unbosoming herself in that way but janet could not speak to her she was importuned with the longing to see mr tryan and yet hesitating to express it  two hours passed in this way the rain went on drizzling and janet sat still leaning her aching head on her hand and looking alternately at the fire and out of the window she felt this could not lastthis motionless vacant misery she must determine on something she must take some step and yet everything was so difficult  it was one oclock and mrs pettifer rose from her seat saying i must go and see about dinner  the movement and the sound startled janet from her reverie it seemed as if an opportunity were escaping her and she said hastily is mr tryan in the town today do you think  no i should think not being saturday you know said mrs pettifer her face lighting up with pleasure but he would come if he was sent for i can send jessons boy with a note to him any time should you like to see him  yes i think i should  then ill send for him this instant     chapter 17   when dempster awoke in the morning he was at no loss to account to himself for the fact that janet was not by his side his hours of drunkenness were not cut off from his other hours by any blank wall of oblivion he remembered what janet had done to offend him the evening before he remembered what he had done to her at midnight just as he would have remembered if he had been consulted about a right of road  the remembrance gave him a definite ground for the extra illhumour which had attended his waking every morning this week but he would not admit to himself that it cost him any anxiety pooh he said inwardly she would go straight to her mothers shes as timid as a hare and shell never let anybody know about it shell be back again before night  but it would be as well for the servants not to know anything of the affair so he collected the clothes she had taken off the night before and threw them into a fireproof closet of which he always kept the key in his pocket when he went down stairs he said to the housemaid mrs dempster is gone to her mothers bring in the breakfast  the servants accustomed to hear domestic broils and to see their mistress put on her bonnet hastily and go to her mothers thought it only something a little worse than usual that she should have gone thither in consequence of a violent quarrel either at midnight or in the early morning before they were up the housemaid told the cook what she supposed had happened the cook shook her head and said eh dear dear but they both expected to see their mistress back again in an hour or two  dempster on his return home the evening before had ordered his man who lived away from the house to bring up his horse and gig from the stables at ten after breakfast he said to the housemaid no one need sit up for me tonight i shall not be at home till tomorrow evening and then he walked to the office to give some orders expecting as he returned to see the man waiting with his gig but though the church clock had struck ten no gig was there in dempsters mood this was more than enough to exasperate him he went in to take his accustomed glass of brandy before setting out promising himself the satisfaction of presently thundering at dawes for being a few minutes behind his time an outbreak of temper towards his man was not common with him for dempster like most tyrannous people had that dastardly kind of selfrestraint which enabled him to control his temper where it suited his own convenience to do so and feeling the value of dawes a steady punctual fellow he not only gave him high wages but usually treated him with exceptional civility this morning however illhumour got the better of prudence and dempster was determined to rate him soundly a resolution for which dawes gave him much better ground than he expected five minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour had passed and dempster was setting off to the stables in a back street to see what was the cause of the delay when dawes appeared with the gig  what the devil do you keep me here for thundered dempster kicking my heels like a beggarly tailor waiting for a carriers cart i ordered you to be here at ten we might have driven to whitlow by this time  why one o the traces was welly i two an i had to take it to bradys to be mended an he didnt get it done i time  then why didnt you take it to him last night because of your damned laziness i suppose do you think i give you wages for you to choose your own hours and come dawdling up a quarter of an hour after my time  come give me good words will yer said dawes sulkily im not lazy nor no man shall call me lazy i know well anuff what you gi me wages for its for doin what yer wont find many men as ull do  what you impudent scoundrel said dempster getting into the gig you think youre necessary to me do you as if a beastly bucketcarrying idiot like you wasnt to be got any day look out for a new master then wholl pay you for not doing as youre bid  dawes blood was now fairly up ill look out for a master as has got a better charicter nor a lyin bletherin drunkard an i shouldnt hev to go fur  dempster furious snatched the whip from the socket and gave dawes a cut which he meant to fall across his shoulders saying take that sir and go to hell with you  dawes was in the act of turning with the reins in his hand when the lash fell and the cut went across his face with white lips he said ill have the law on yer for that lawyer as yare and threw the reins on the horses back  dempster leaned forward seized the reins and drove off  why theres your friend dempster driving out without his man again said mr luke byles who was chatting with mr budd in the bridge way what a fool he is to drive that twowheeled thing hell get pitched on his head one of these days  not he said mr budd nodding to dempster as he passed hes got nine lives dempster has     chapter 18   it was dusk and the candles were lighted before mr tryan knocked at mrs pettifers door her messenger had brought back word that he was not at home and all afternoon janet had been agitated by the fear that he would not come but as soon as that anxiety was removed by the knock at the door she felt a sudden rush of doubt and timidity she trembled and turned cold  mrs pettifer went to open the door and told mr tryan in as few words as possible what had happened in the night as he laid down his hat and prepared to enter the parlour she said i wont go in with you for i think perhaps she would rather see you go in alone  janet wrapped up in a large white shawl which threw her dark face into startling relief was seated with her eyes turned anxiously towards the door when mr tryan entered he had not seen her since their interview at sally martins long months ago and he felt a strong movement of compassion at the sight of the painstricken face which seemed to bear written on it the signs of all janets intervening misery her heart gave a great leap as her eyes met his once more no she had not deceived herself there was all the sincerity all the sadness all the deep pity in them her memory had told her of more than it had told her for in proportion as his face had become thinner and more worn his eyes appeared to have gathered intensity  he came forward and putting out his hand said i am so glad you sent for mei am so thankful you thought i could be any comfort to you janet took his hand in silence she was unable to utter any words of mere politeness or even of gratitude her heart was too full of other words that had welled up the moment she met his pitying glance and felt her doubts fall away  they sat down opposite each other and she said in a low voice while slow difficult tears gathered in her aching eyesi want to tell you how unhappy i amhow weak and wicked i feel no strength to live or die i thought you could tell me something that would help me she paused  perhaps i can mr tryan said for in speaking to me you are speaking to a fellowsinner who has needed just the comfort and help you are needing  and you did find it  yes and i trust you will find it  o i should like to be good and to do right janet burst forth but indeed indeed my lot has been a very hard one i loved my husband very dearly when we were married and i meant to make him happyi wanted nothing else but he began to be angry with me for little things and  i dont want to accuse him  but he drank and got more and more unkind to me and then very cruel and he beat me and that cut me to the heart it made me almost mad sometimes to think all our love had come to that  i couldnt bear up against it i had never been used to drink anything but water i hated wine and spirits because robert drank them so but one day when i was very wretched and the wine was standing on the table i suddenly  i can hardly remember how i came to do it  i poured some wine into a large glass and drank it it blunted my feelings and made me more indifferent after that the temptation was always coming and it got stronger and stronger i was ashamed and i hated what i did but almost while the thought was passing through my mind that i would never do it again i did it it seemed as if there was a demon in me always making me rush to do what i longed not to do and i thought all the more that god was cruel for if he had not sent me that dreadful trial so much worse than other women have to bear i should not have done wrong in that way i suppose it is wicked to think so  i feel as if there must be goodness and right above us but i cant see it i cant trust in it and i have gone on in that way for years and years at one time it used to be better now and then but everything has got worse lately i felt sure it must soon end somehow and last night he turned me out of doors  i dont know what to do i will never go back to that life again if i can help it and yet everything else seems so miserable i feel sure that demon will always be urging me to satisfy the craving that comes upon me and the days will go on as they have done through all those miserable years i shall always be doing wrong and hating myself aftersinking lower and lower and knowing that i am sinking o can you tell me any way of getting strength have you ever known any one like me that got peace of mind and power to do right can you give me any comfortany hope  while janet was speaking she had forgotten everything but her misery and her yearning for comfort her voice had risen from the low tone of timid distress to an intense pitch of imploring anguish she clasped her hands tightly and looked at mr tryon with eager questioning eyes with parted trembling lips with the deep horizontal lines of overmastering pain on her brow in this artificial life of ours it is not often we see a human face with all a hearts agony in it uncontrolled by selfconsciousness when we do see it it startles us as if we had suddenly waked into the real world of which this everyday one is but a puppetshow copy for some moments mr tryan was too deeply moved to speak  yes dear mrs dempster he said at last there is comfort there is hope for you believe me there is for i speak from my own deep and hard experience he paused as if he had not made up his mind to utter the words that were urging themselves to his lips presently he continued ten years ago i felt as wretched as you do i think my wretchedness was even worse than yours for i had a heavier sin on my conscience i had suffered no wrong from others as you have and i had injured another irreparably in body and soul the image of the wrong i had done pursued me everywhere and i seemed on the brink of madness i hated my life for i thought just as you do that i should go on falling into temptation and doing more harm in the world and i dreaded death for with that sense of guilt on my soul i felt that whatever state i entered on must be one of misery but a dear friend to whom i opened my mind showed me it was just such as ithe helpless who feel themselves helplessthat god specially invites to come to him and offers all the riches of his salvation not forgiveness only forgiveness would be worth little if it left us under the powers of our evil passions but strengththat strength which enables us to conquer sin  but said janet i can feel no trust in god he seems always to have left me to myself i have sometimes prayed to him to help me and yet everything has been just the same as before if you felt like me how did you come to have hope and trust  do not believe that god has left you to yourself how can you tell but that the hardest trials you have known have been only the road by which he was leading you to that complete sense of your own sin and helplessness without which you would never have renounced all other hopes and trusted in his love alone i know dear mrs dempster i know it is hard to bear i would not speak lightly of your sorrows i feel that the mystery of our life is great and at one time it seemed as dark to me as it does to you mr tryan hesitated again he saw that the first thing janet needed was to be assured of sympathy she must be made to feel that her anguish was not strange to him that he entered into the only halfexpressed secrets of her spiritual weakness before any other message of consolation could find its way to her heart the tale of the divine pity was never yet believed from lips that were not felt to be moved by human pity and janets anguish was not strange to mr tryan he had never been in the presence of a sorrow and a selfdespair that had sent so strong a thrill through all the recesses of his saddest experience and it is because sympathy is but a living again through our own past in a new form that confession often prompts a response of confession mr tryan felt this prompting and his judgement too told him that in obeying it he would be taking the best means of administering comfort to janet yet he hesitated as we tremble to let in the daylight on a chamber of relics which we have never visited except in curtained silence but the first impulse triumphed and he went on i had lived all my life at a distance from god my youth was spent in thoughtless selfindulgence and all my hopes were of a vain worldly kind i had no thought of entering the church i looked forward to a political career for my father was private secretary to a man high in the whig ministry and had been promised strong interest in my behalf at college i lived in intimacy with the gayest men even adopting follies and vices for which i had no taste out of mere pliancy and the love of standing well with my companions you see i was more guilty even then than you have been for i threw away all the rich blessings of untroubled youth and health i had no excuse in my outward lot but while i was at college that event in my life occurred which in the end brought on the state of mind i have mentioned to youthe state of selfreproach and despair which enables me to understand to the full what you are suffering and i tell you the facts because i want you to be assured that i am not uttering mere vague words when i say that i have been raised from as low a depth of sin and sorrow as that in which you feel yourself to be at college i had an attachment to a lovely girl of seventeen she was very much below my own station in life and i never contemplated marrying her but i induced her to leave her fathers house i did not mean to forsake her when i left college and i quieted all scruples of conscience by promising myself that i would always take care of poor lucy but on my return from a vacation spent in travelling i found that lucy was gonegone away with a gentleman her neighbours said i was a good deal distressed but i tried to persuade myself that no harm would come to her soon afterwards i had an illness which left my health delicate and made all dissipation distasteful to me life seemed very wearisome and empty and i looked with envy on every one who had some great and absorbing objecteven on my cousin who was preparing to go out as a missionary and whom i had been used to think a dismal tedious person because he was constantly urging religious subjects upon me we were living in london then it was three years since i had lost sight of lucy and one summer evening about nine oclock as i was walking along gower street i saw a knot of people on the causeway before me as i came up to them i heard one woman say i tell you she is dead this awakened my interest and i pushed my way within the circle the body of a woman dressed in fine clothes was lying against a doorstep her head was bent on one side and the long curls had fallen over her cheek a tremor seized me when i saw the hair it was light chestnutthe colour of lucys i knelt down and turned aside the hair it was lucydeadwith paint on her cheeks i found out afterwards that she had taken poisonthat she was in the power of a wicked womanthat the very clothes on her back were not her own it was then that my past life burst upon me in all its hideousness i wished i had never been born i couldnt look into the future lucys dead painted face would follow me there as it did when i looked back into the pastas it did when i sat down to table with my friends when i lay down in my bed and when i rose up there was only one thing that could make life tolerable to me that was to spend all the rest of it in trying to save others from the ruin i had brought on one but how was that possible for me i had no comfort no strength no wisdom in my own soul how could i give them to others my mind was dark rebellious at war with itself and with god  mr tryan had been looking away from janet his face was towards the fire and he was absorbed in the images his memory was recalling but now he turned his eyes on her and they met hers fixed on him with the look of rapt expectation with which one clinging to a slippery summit of a rock while the waves are rising higher and higher watches the boat that has put from shore to his rescue  you see mrs dempster how deep my need was i went on in this way for months i was convinced that if i ever got health and comfort it must be from religion i went to hear celebrated preachers and i read religious books but i found nothing that fitted my own need the faith which puts the sinner in possession of salvation seemed as i understood it to be quite out of my reach i had no faith i only felt utterly wretched under the power of habits and dispositions which had wrought hideous evil at last as i told you i found a friend to whom i opened all my feelingsto whom i confessed everything he was a man who had gone through very deep experience and could understand the different wants of different minds he made it clear to me that the only preparation for coming to christ and partaking of his salvation was that very sense of guilt and helplessness which was weighing me down he said you are weary and heavyladen well it is you christ invites to come to him and find rest he asks you to cling to him to lean on him he does not command you to walk alone without stumbling he does not tell you as your fellowmen do that you must first merit his love he neither condemns nor reproaches you for the past he only bids you come to him that you may have life he bids you stretch out your hands and take of the fulness of his love you have only to rest on him as a child rests on its mothers arms and you will be upborne by his divine strength that is what is meant by faith your evil habits you feel are too strong for you you are unable to wrestle with them you know beforehand you shall fall but when once we feel our helplessness in that way and go to the saviour desiring to be freed from the power as well as the punishment of sin we are no longer left to our own strength as long as we live in rebellion against god desiring to have our own will seeking happiness in the things of this world it is as if we shut ourselves up in a crowded stifling room where we breathe only poisoned air but we have only to walk out under the infinite heavens and we breathe the pure free air that gives us health and strength and gladness it is just so with gods spirit as soon as we submit ourselves to his will as soon as we desire to be united to him and made pure and holy it is as if the walls had fallen down that shut us out from god and we are fed with his spirit which gives us new strength  that is what i want said janet i have left off minding about pleasure i think i could be contented in the midst of hardship if i felt that god cared for me and would give me strength to lead a pure life but tell me did you soon find peace and strength  not perfect peace for a long while but hope and trust which is strength no sense of pardon for myself could do away with the pain i had in thinking what i had helped to bring on another my friend used to urge upon me that my sin against god was greater than my sin against her butit may be from want of deeper spiritual feelingthat has remained to this hour the sin which causes me the bitterest pang i could never rescue lucy but by gods blessing i might rescue other weak and falling souls and that was why i entered the church i asked for nothing through the rest of my life but that i might be devoted to gods work without swerving in search of pleasure either to the right hand or to the left it has been often a hard strugglebut god has been with meand perhaps it may not last much longer  mr tryan paused for a moment he had forgotten janet and for a moment she had forgotten her own sorrows when she recurred to herself it was with a new feeling  ah what a difference between our lives you have been choosing pain and working and denying yourself and i have been thinking only of myself i was only angry and discontented because i had pain to bear you never had that wicked feeling that i have had so often did you that god was cruel to send me trials and temptations worse than others have  yes i had i had very blasphemous thoughts and i know that spirit of rebellion must have made the worst part of your lot you did not feel how impossible it is for us to judge rightly of gods dealings and you opposed yourself to his will but what do we know we cannot foretell the working of the smallest event in our own lot how can we presume to judge of things that are so much too high for us there is nothing that becomes us but entire submission perfect resignation as long as we set up our own will and our own wisdom against gods we make that wall between us and his love which i have spoken of just now but as soon as we lay ourselves entirely at his feet we have enough light given us to guide our own steps as the footsoldier who hears nothing of the councils that determine the course of the great battle he is in hears plainly enough the word of command which he must himself obey i know dear mrs dempster i know it is hardthe hardest thing of all perhapsto flesh and blood but carry that difficulty to the saviour along with all your other sins and weaknesses and ask him to pour into you a spirit of submission he enters into your struggles he has drunk the cup of our suffering to the dregs he knows the hard wrestling it costs us to say not my will but thine be done  pray with me said janetpray now that i may have light and strength    chapter 19   before leaving janet mr tryan urged her strongly to send for her mother  do not wound her he said by shutting her out any longer from your troubles it is right that you should be with her  yes i will send for her said janet but i would rather not go to my mothers yet because my husband is sure to think i am there and he might come and fetch me i cant go back to him  at least not yet ought i to go back to him  no certainly not at present something should be done to secure you from violence your mother i think should consult some confidential friend some man of character and experience who might mediate between you and your husband  yes i will send for my mother directly but i will stay here with mrs pettifer till something has been done i want no one to know where i am except you you will come again will you not you will not leave me to myself  you will not be left to yourself god is with you if i have been able to give you any comfort it is because his power and love have been present with us but i am very thankful that he has chosen to work through me i shall see you again tomorrownot before evening for it will be sunday you know but after the evening lecture i shall be at liberty you will be in my prayers till then in the meantime dear mrs dempster open your heart as much as you can to your mother and mrs pettifer cast away from you the pride that makes us shrink from acknowledging our weakness to our friends ask them to help you in guarding yourself from the least approach of the sin you most dread deprive yourself as far as possible of the very means and opportunity of committing it every effort of that kind made in humility and dependence is a prayer promise me you will do this  yes i promise you i know i have always been too proud i could never bear to speak to any one about myself i have been proud towards my mother even it has always made me angry when she has seemed to take notice of my faults  ah dear mrs dempster you will never say again that life is blank and that there is nothing to live for will you see what work there is to be done in life both in our own souls and for others surely it matters little whether we have more or less of this worlds comfort in these short years when god is training us for the eternal enjoyment of his love keep that great end of life before you and your troubles here will seem only the small hardships of a journey now i must go  mr tryan rose and held out his hand janet took it and said god has been very good to me in sending you to me i will trust in him i will try to do everything you tell me  blessed influence of one true loving human soul on another not calculable by algebra not deducible by logic but mysterious effectual mighty as the hidden process by which the tiny seed is quickened and bursts forth into tall stem and broad leaf and glowing tasseled flower ideas are often poor ghosts our sunfilled eyes cannot discern them they pass athwart us in thin vapour and cannot make themselves felt but sometimes they are made flesh they breathe upon us with warm breath they touch us with soft responsive hands they look at us with sad sincere eyes and speak to us in appealing tones they are clothed in a living human soul with all its conflicts its faith and its love then their presence is a power then they shake us like a passion and we are drawn after them with gentle compulsion as flame is drawn to flame  janets dark grand face still fatigued had become quite calm and looked up as she sat with a humble childlike expression at the thin blond face and slightly sunken grey eyes which now shone with hectic brightness she might have been taken for an image of passionate strength beaten and worn with conflict and he for an image of the selfrenouncing faith which has soothed that conflict into rest as he looked at the sweet submissive face he remembered its look of despairing anguish and his heart was very full as he turned away from her let me only live to see this work confirmed and then   it was nearly ten oclock when mr tryan left but janet was bent on sending for her mother so mrs pettifer as the readiest plan put on her bonnet and went herself to fetch mrs raynor the mother had been too long used to expect that every fresh week would be more painful than the last for mrs pettifers news to come upon her with the shock of a surprise quietly without any show of distress she made up a bundle of clothes and telling her little maid that she should not return home that night accompanied mrs pettifer back in silence  when they entered the parlour janet wearied out had sunk to sleep in the large chair which stood with its back to the door the noise of the opening door disturbed her and she was looking round wonderingly when mrs raynor came up to her chair and said its your mother janet  mother dear mother janet cried clasping her closely i have not been a good tender child to you but i will bei will not grieve you any more  the calmness which had withstood a new sorrow was overcome by a new joy and the mother burst into tears     chapter 20   on sunday morning the rain had ceased and janet looking out of the bedroom window saw above the housetops a shining mass of white cloud rolling under the faraway blue sky it was going to be a lovely april day the fresh sky left clear and calm after the long vexation of wind and rain mingled its mild influence with janets new thoughts and prospects she felt a buoyant courage that surprised herself after the cold crushing weight of despondency which had oppressed her the day before she could think even of her husbands rage without the old overpowering dread for a delicious hopethe hope of purification and inward peacehad entered into janets soul and made it springtime there as well as in the outer world  while her mother was brushing and coiling up her thick black haira favourite task because it seemed to renew the days of her daughters girlhoodjanet told how she came to send for mr tryan how she had remembered their meeting at sally martins in the autumn and had felt an irresistible desire to see him and tell him her sins and her troubles  i see gods goodness now mother in ordering it so that we should meet in that way to overcome my prejudice against him and make me feel that he was good and then bringing it back to my mind in the depth of my trouble you know what foolish things i used to say about him knowing nothing of him all the while and yet he was the man who was to give me comfort and help when everything else failed me it is wonderful how i feel able to speak to him as i never have done to any one before and how every word he says to me enters my heart and has a new meaning for me i think it must be because he has felt life more deeply than others and has a deeper faith i believe everything he says at once his words come to me like rain on the parched ground it has always seemed to me before as if i could see behind peoples words as one sees behind a screen but in mr tryan it is his very soul that speaks  well my dear child i love and bless him for your sake if he has given you any comfort i never believed the harm people said of him though i had no desire to go and hear him for i am contented with oldfashioned ways i find more good teaching than i can practise in reading my bible at home and hearing mr crewe at church but your wants are different my dear and we are not all led by the same road that was certainly good advice of mr tryans you told me of last nightthat we should consult some one that may interfere for you with your husband and i have been turning it over in my mind while ive been lying awake in the night i think nobody will do so well as mr benjamin landor for we must have a man that knows the law and that robert is rather afraid of and perhaps he could bring about an agreement for you to live apart your husbands bound to maintain you you know and if you liked we could move away from milby and live somewhere else   o mother we must do nothing yet i must think about it a little longer i have a different feeling this morning from what i had yesterday something seems to tell me that i must go back to robert some timeafter a little while i loved him once better than all the world and i have never had any children to love there were things in me that were wrong and i should like to make up for them if i can  well my dear i wont persuade you think of it a little longer but something must be done soon  how i wish i had my bonnet and shawl and black gown here said janet after a few minutes silence i should like to go to paddiford church and hear mr tryan there would be no fear of my meeting robert for he never goes out on a sunday morning  im afraid it would not do for me to go to the house and fetch your clothes said mrs raynor  o no no i must stay quietly here while you two go to church i will be mrs pettifers maid and get the dinner ready for her by the time she comes back dear good woman she was so tender to me when she took me in in the night mother and all the next day when i couldnt speak a word to her to thank her     chapter 21   the servants at dempsters felt some surprise when the morning noon and evening of saturday had passed and still their mistress did not reappear  its very odd said kitty the housemaid as she trimmed her next weeks cap while betty the middleaged cook looked on with folded arms do you think as mrs raynor was ill and sent for the missis afore we was up  o said betty if it had been that shed ha been backards an forards three or four times afore now leastways shed ha sent little ann to let us know  theres summat up more nor usual between her an the master that you may depend on said kitty i know those clothes as was lying i the drawingroom yesterday when the company was come meant summat i shouldnt wonder if that was what theyve had a fresh row about shes praps gone away ans made up her mind not to come back again  an i the right ont too said betty id ha overrun him long afore now if it had been me i wouldnt stan bein mauled as she is by no husband not if he was the biggest lord i the land its poor work bein a wife at that price id sooner be a cook wiout perkises an hev roast an boil an fry an bake all to mind at once she may well do as she does i know im glad enough of a drop o summat myself when im plagued i feel very low like tonight i think i shall put my beer i the saucepan an warm it  what a one you are for warmin your beer betty i couldnt abide itnasty bitter stuff  its fine talkin if you was a cook youd know what belongs to bein a cook its none so nice to hev a sinkin at your stomach i can tell you you wouldnt think so much o fine ribbins i your cap then  well well betty dont be grumpy liza thomson as is at phippss said to me last sunday i wonder youll stay at dempsters she says such goinson as there is but i says theres things to put up wi in ivery place an you may change an change an not better yourself when alls said an done lors why liza told me herself as mrs phipps was as skinny as skinny i the kitchen for all they keep so much company and as for follyers shes as cross as a turkeycock if she finds em out theres nothin o that sort i the missis how pretty she come an spoke to job last sunday there isnt a goodnaturder woman i the world thats my beliefan hansome too i alys think theres nobody looks half so well as the missis when shes got her air done nice lors i wish id got long air like hermy airs acomin off dreadful  therell be fine work tomorrow i expect said betty when the master comes home an dawes aswearin as hell niver do a stroke o work for him again itll be good fun if he sets the justice on him for cuttin him wi the whip the masterll praps get his comb cut for once in his life  why he was in a temper like a fiend this morning said kitty i daresay it was along o what had happened wi the missis we shall hev a pretty house wi him if she doesnt come backhell want to be leatherin us i shouldnt wonder he must hev somethin t illuse when hes in a passion  id tek care he didnt leather meno not if he was my husban ten times oer id pour hot drippin on him sooner but the missis hasnt a sperrit like me hell mek her come back youll see hell come round her somehow theres no likelihood of her coming hack tonight though so i should think we might fasten the doors and go to bed when we like  on sunday morning however kittys mind became disturbed by more definite and alarming conjectures about her mistress while betty encouraged by the prospect of unwonted leisure was sitting down to continue a letter which had long lain unfinished between the leaves of her bible kitty came running into the kitchen and saidlor betty im all of a tremble you might knock me down wi a feather ive just looked into the mississ wardrobe an theres both her bonnets she must ha gone wiout her bonnet an then i remember as her nightclothes wasnt on the bed yisterday mornin i thought shed put em away to be washed but she hednt for ive been lookin its my belief hes murdered her and shut her up i that closet as he keeps locked alys hes capible ont  lorshamassy why youd better run to mrs raynors an see if shes there arter all it was praps all a lie  mrs raynor had returned home to give directions to her little maiden when kitty with the elaborate manifestation of alarm which servants delight in rushed in without knocking and holding her hands on her heart as if the consequences to that organ were likely to be very serious saidif you please m is the missis here  no kitty why are you come to ask  because m shes niver been at home since yesterday mornin since afore we was up an we thought somethin must ha happened to her  no dont be frightened kitty your mistress is quite safe i know where she is is your master at home  no m he went out yesterday mornin an said he shouldnt be back afore tonight  well kitty theres nothing the matter with your mistress you neednt say anything to any one about her being away from home i shall call presently and fetch her gown and bonnet she wants them to put on  kitty perceiving there was a mystery she was not to inquire into returned to orchard street really glad to know that her mistress was safe but disappointed nevertheless at being told that she was not to be frightened she was soon followed by mrs raynor in quest of the gown and bonnet the good mother on learning that dempster was not at home had at once thought that she could gratify janets wish to go to paddiford church  see my dear she said as she entered mrs pettifers parlour ive brought you your black clothes roberts not at home and is not coming till this evening i couldnt find your best black gown but this will do i wouldnt bring anything else you know but there cant be any objection to my fetching clothes to cover you you can go to paddiford church now if you like and i will go with you  thats a dear mother then well all three go together come and help me to get ready good little mrs crewe it will vex her sadly that i should go to hear mr tryan but i must kiss her and make it up with her  many eyes were turned on janet with a look of surprise as she walked up the aisle of paddiford church she felt a little tremor at the notice she knew she was exciting but it was a strong satisfaction to her that she had been able at once to take a step that would let her neighbours know her change of feeling towards mr tryan she had left herself now no room for proud reluctance or weak hesitation the walk through the sweet spring air had stimulated all her fresh hopes all her yearning desires after purity strength and peace she thought she should find a new meaning in the prayers this morning her full heart like an overflowing river wanted those readymade channels to pour itself into and then she should hear mr tryan again and his words would fall on her like precious balm as they had done last night there was a liquid brightness in her eyes as they rested on the mere walls the pews the weavers and colliers in their sunday clothes the commonest things seemed to touch the spring of love within her just as when we are suddenly released from an acute absorbing bodily pain our heart and senses leap out in new freedom we think even the noise of streets harmonious and are ready to hug the tradesman who is wrapping up our change a door had been opened in janets cold dark prison of selfdespair and the golden light of morning was pouring in its slanting beams through the blessed opening there was sunlight in the world there was a divine love caring for her it had given her an earnest of good things it had been preparing comfort for her in the very moment when she had thought herself most forsaken  mr tryan might well rejoice when his eye rested on her as he entered his desk but he rejoiced with trembling he could not look at the sweet hopeful face without remembering its yesterdays look of agony and there was the possibility that that look might return  janets appearance at church was greeted not only by wondering eyes but by kind hearts and after the service several of mr tryans hearers with whom she had been on cold terms of late contrived to come up to her and take her by the hand  mother said miss linnet do let us go and speak to mrs dempster im sure theres a great change in her mind towards mr tryan i noticed how eagerly she listened to the sermon and shes come with mrs pettifer you see we ought to go and give her a welcome among us  why my dear weve never spoke friendly these five year you know shes been as haughty as anything since i quarrelled with her husband however let bygones be bygones ive no grudge again the poor thing more particular as she must ha flew in her husbands face to come an hear mr tryan yes let us go an speak to her  the friendly words and looks touched janet a little too keenly and mrs pettifer wisely hurried her home by the leastfrequented road when they reached home a violent fit of weeping followed by continuous lassitude showed that the emotions of the morning had overstrained her nerves she was suffering too from the absence of the longaccustomed stimulus which she had promised mr tryan not to touch again the poor thing was conscious of this and dreaded her own weakness as the victim of intermittent insanity dreads the oncoming of the old illusion  mother she whispered when mrs raynor urged her to lie down and rest all the afternoon that she might be the better prepared to see mr tryan in the evening mother dont let me have anything if i ask for it  in the mothers mind there was the same anxiety and in her it was mingled with another fearthe fear lest janet in her present excited state of mind should take some premature step in relation to her husband which might lead back to all the former troubles the hint she had thrown out in the morning of her wish to return to him after a time showed a new eagerness for difficult duties that only made the longsaddened sober mother tremble but as evening approached janets morning heroism all forsook her her imagination influenced by physical depression as well as by mental habits was haunted by the vision of her husbands return home and she began to shudder with the yesterdays dread she heard him calling her she saw him going to her mothers to look for her she felt sure he would find her out and burst in upon her  pray pray dont leave me dont go to church she said to mrs pettifer you and mother both stay with me till mr tryan comes  at twenty minutes past six the church bells were ringing for the evening service and soon the congregation was streaming along orchard street in the mellow sunset the street opened toward the west the red halfsunken sun shed a solemn splendour on the everyday houses and crimsoned the windows of dempsters projecting upper storey  suddenly a loud murmur arose and spread along the stream of churchgoers and one group after another paused and looked backward at the far end of the street men accompanied by a miscellaneous group of onlookers were slowly carrying somethinga body stretched on a door slowly they passed along the middle of the street lined all the way with awestruck faces till they turned aside and paused in the red sunlight before dempsters door  it was dempsters body no one knew whether he was alive or dead     chapter 22   it was probably a hard saying to the pharisees that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance and certain ingenious philosophers of our own day must surely take offence at a joy so entirely out of correspondence with arithmetical proportion but a heart that has been taught by its own sore struggles to bleed for the woes of anotherthat has learned pity through sufferingis likely to find very imperfect satisfaction in the balance of happiness doctrine of compensations and other short and easy methods of obtaining thorough complacency in the presence of pain and for such a heart that saying will not be altogether dark the emotions i have observed are but slightly influenced by arithmetical considerations the mother when her sweet lisping little ones have all been taken from her one after another and she is hanging over her last dead babe finds small consolation in the fact that the tiny dimpled corpse is but one of a necessary average and that a thousand other babes brought into the world at the same time are doing well and are likely to live and if you stood beside that motherif you knew her pang and shared itit is probable you would be equally unable to see a ground of complacency in statistics  doubtless a complacency resting on that basis is highly rational but emotion i fear is obstinately irrational it insists on caring for individuals it absolutely refuses to adopt the quantitative view of human anguish and to admit that thirteen happy lives are a setoff against twelve miserable lives which leaves a clear balance on the side of satisfaction this is the inherent imbecility of feeling and one must be a great philosopher to have got quite clear of all that and to have emerged into the serene air of pure intellect in which it is evident that individuals really exist for no other purpose than that abstractions may be drawn from themabstractions that may rise from heaps of ruined lives like the sweet savour of a sacrifice in the nostrils of philosophers and of a philosophic deity and so it comes to pass that for the man who knows sympathy because he has known sorrow that old old saying about the joy of angels over the repentant sinner outweighing their joy over the ninetynine just has a meaning which does not jar with the language of his own heart it only tells him that for angels too there is a transcendent value in human pain which refuses to be settled by equations that the eyes of angels too are turned away from the serene happiness of the righteous to bend with yearning pity on the poor erring soul wandering in the desert where no water is that for angels too the misery of one casts so tremendous a shadow as to eclipse the bliss of ninetynine  mr tryan had gone through the initiation of suffering it is no wonder then that janets restoration was the work that lay nearest his heart and that weary as he was in body when he entered the vestry after the evening service he was impatient to fulfil the promise of seeing her his experience enabled him to divinewhat was the factthat the hopefulness of the morning would be followed by a return of depression and discouragement and his sense of the inward and outward difficulties in the way of her restoration was so keen that he could only find relief from the foreboding it excited by lifting up his heart in prayer there are unseen elements which often frustrate our wisest calculationswhich raise up the sufferer from the edge of the grave contradicting the prophecies of the clearsighted physician and fulfilling the blind clinging hopes of affection such unseen elements mr tryan called the divine will and filled up the margin of ignorance which surrounds all our knowledge with the feelings of trust and resignation perhaps the profoundest philosophy could hardly fill it up better  his mind was occupied in this way as he was absently taking off his gown when mr landor startled him by entering the vestry and asking abruptly have you heard the news about dempster  no said mr tryan anxiously what is it  he has been thrown out of his gig in the bridge way and he was taken up for dead they were carrying him home as we were coming to church and i stayed behind to see what i could do i went in to speak to mrs dempster and prepare her a little but she was not at home dempster is not dead however he was stunned with the fall pilgrim came in a few minutes and he says the right leg is broken in two places its likely to be a terrible case with his state of body it seems he was more drunk than usual and they say he came along the bridge way flogging his horse like a madman till at last it gave a sudden wheel and he was pitched out the servants said they didnt know where mrs dempster was she had been away from home since yesterday morning but mrs raynor knew  i know where she is said mr tryan but i think it will be better for her not to be told of this just yet  ah that was what pilgrim said and so i didnt go round to mrs raynors he said it would be all the better if mrs dempster could be kept out of the house for the present do you know if anything new has happened between dempster and his wife lately i was surprised to hear of her being at paddiford church this morning  yes something has happened but i believe she is anxious that the particulars of his behaviour towards her should not be known she is at mrs pettifersthere is no reason for concealing that since what has happened to her husband and yesterday when she was in very deep trouble she sent for me i was very thankful she did so i believe a great change of feeling has begun in her but she is at present in that excitable state of mindshe has been shaken by so many painful emotions during the last two days that i think it would be better for this evening at least to guard her from a new shock if possible but i am going now to call upon her and i shall see how she is  mr tryan said mr jerome who had entered during the dialogue and had been standing by listening with a distressed face i shall take it as a favour if youll let me know if iver theres anything i can do for mrs dempster eh dear what a world this is i think i see em fifteen year agoas happy a young couple as iver was and now what its all come to i was in a hurry like to punish dempster for pessecutin but there was a stronger hand at work nor mine  yes mr jerome but dont let us rejoice in punishment even when the hand of god alone inflicts it the best of us are but poor wretches just saved from shipwreck can we feel anything but awe and pity when we see a fellowpassenger swallowed by the waves  right right mr tryan im over hot and hasty that i am but i beg on you to tell mrs dempsteri mean in course when youve an opportunitytell her shes a friend at the white house as she may send for any hour o the day  yes i shall have an opportunity i dare say and i will remember your wish i think continued mr tryan turning to mr landor i had better see mr pilgrim on my way and learn what is exactly the state of things by this time what do you think  by all means if mrs dempster is to know theres no one can break the news to her so well as you ill walk with you to dempsters door i dare say pilgrim is there still come mr jerome youve got to go our way too to fetch your horse  mr pilgrim was in the passage giving some directions to his assistant when to his surprise he saw mr tryan enter they shook hands for mr pilgrim never having joined the party of the antitryanites had no ground for resisting the growing conviction that the evangelical curate was really a good fellow though he was a fool for not taking better care of himself  why i didnt expect to see you in your old enemys quarters he said to mr tryan however it will be a good while before poor dempster shows any fight again  i came on mrs dempsters account said mr tryan she is staying at mrs pettifers she has had a great shock from some severe domestic trouble lately and i think it will be wiser to defer telling her of this dreadful event for a short time  why what has been up eh said mr pilgrim whose curiosity was at once awakened she used to be no friend of yours has there been some split between them its a new thing for her to turn round on him  o merely an exaggeration of scenes that must often have happened before but the question now is whether you think there is any immediate danger of her husbands death for in that case i think from what i have observed of her feelings she would be pained afterwards to have been kept in ignorance  well theres no telling in these cases you know i dont apprehend speedy death and it is not absolutely impossible that we may bring him round again at present hes in a state of apoplectic stupor but if that subsides delirium is almost sure to supervene and we shall have some painful scenes its one of those complicated cases in which the delirium is likely to be of the worst kindmeningitis and delirium tremens togetherand we may have a good deal of trouble with him if mrs dempster were told i should say it would be desirable to persuade her to remain out of the house at present she could do no good you know ive got nurses  thank you said mr tryan that is what i wanted to know goodbye  when mrs pettifer opened the door for mr tryan he told her in a few words what had happened and begged her to take an opportunity of letting mrs raynor know that they might if possible concur in preventing a premature or sudden disclosure of the event to janet  poor thing said mrs pettifer shes not fit to hear any bad news shes very low this eveningworn out with feeling and shes not had anything to keep her up as shes been used to she seems frightened at the thought of being tempted to take it  thank god for it that fear is her greatest security  when mr tryan entered the parlour this time janet was again awaiting him eagerly and her pale sad face was lighted up with a smile as she rose to meet him but the next moment she said with a look of anxietyhow very ill and tired you look you have been working so hard all day and yet you are come to talk to me o you are wearing yourself out i must go and ask mrs pettifer to come and make you have some supper but this is my mother you have not seen her before i think  while mr tryan was speaking to mrs raynor janet hurried out and he seeing that this goodnatured thoughtfulness on his behalf would help to counteract her depression was not inclined to oppose her wish but accepted the supper mrs pettifer offered him quietly talking the while about a clothing club he was going to establish in paddiford and the want of provident habits among the poor  presently however mrs raynor said she must go home for an hour to see how her little maiden was going on and mrs pettifer left the room with her to take the opportunity of telling her what had happened to dempster when janet was left alone with mr tryan she saidi feel so uncertain what to do about my husband i am so weakmy feelings change so from hour to hour this morning when i felt so hopeful and happy i thought i should like to go back to him and try to make up for what has been wrong in me i thought now god would help me and i should have you to teach and advise me and i could bear the troubles that would come but since thenall this afternoon and eveningi have had the same feelings i used to have the same dread of his anger and cruelty and it seems to me as if i should never be able to bear it without falling into the same sins and doing just what i did before yet if it were settled that i should live apart from him i know it would always be a load on my mind that i had shut myself out from going back to him it seems a dreadful thing in life when any one has been so near to one as a husband for fifteen years to part and be nothing to each other any more surely that is a very strong tie and i feel as if my duty can never lie quite away from it it is very difficult to know what to do what ought i to do  i think it will be well not to take any decisive step yet wait until your mind is calmer you might remain with your mother for a little while i think you have no real ground for fearing any annoyance from your husband at present he has put himself too much in the wrong he will very likely leave you unmolested for some time dismiss this difficult question from your mind just now if you can every new day may bring you new grounds for decision and what is most needful for your health of mind is repose from that haunting anxiety about the future which has been preying on you cast yourself on god and trust that he will direct you he will make your duty clear to you if you wait submissively on him  yes i will wait a little as you tell me i will go to my mothers tomorrow and pray to be guided rightly you will pray for me too     chapter 23   the next morning janet was so much calmer and at breakfast spoke so decidedly of going to her mothers that mrs pettifer and mrs raynor agreed it would be wise to let her know by degrees what had befallen her husband since as soon as she went out there would be danger of her meeting some one who would betray the fact but mrs raynor thought it would be well first to call at dempsters and ascertain how he was so she said to janetmy dear ill go home first and see to things and get your room ready you neednt come yet you know i shall be back again in an hour or so and we can go together  o no said mrs pettifer stay with me till evening i shall be lost without you you neednt go till quite evening  janet had dipped into the life of henry martyn which mrs pettifer had from the paddiford lending library and her interest was so arrested by that pathetic missionary story that she readily acquiesced in both propositions and mrs raynor set out  she had been gone more than an hour and it was nearly twelve oclock when janet put down her book and after sitting meditatively for some minutes with her eyes unconsciously fixed on the opposite wall she rose went to her bedroom and hastily putting on her bonnet and shawl came down to mrs pettifer who was busy in the kitchen  mrs pettifer she said tell mother when she comes back im gone to see what has become of those poor lakins in butchers lane i know theyre half starving and ive neglected them so lately and then i think ill go on to mrs crewe i want to see the dear little woman and tell her myself about my going to hear mr tryan she wont feel it half so much if i tell her myself  wont you wait till your mother comes or put it off till tomorrow said mrs pettifer alarmed youll hardly be back in time for dinner if you get talking to mrs crewe and youll have to pass by your husbands you know and yesterday you were so afraid of seeing him  o robert will be shut up at the office now if hes not gone out of the town i must goi feel i must be doing something for some onenot be a mere useless log any longer ive been reading about that wonderful henry martyn hes just like mr tryanwearing himself out for other people and i sit thinking of nothing but myself i must go goodbye i shall be back soon  she ran off before mrs pettifer could utter another word of dissuasion leaving the good woman in considerable anxiety lest this new impulse of janets should frustrate all precautions to save her from a sudden shock  janet having paid her visit in butcher lane turned again into orchard street on her way to mrs crewes and was thinking rather sadly that her mothers economical housekeeping would leave no abundant surplus to be sent to the hungry lakins when she saw mr pilgrim in advance of her on the other side of the street he was walking at a rapid pace and when he reached dempsters door he turned and entered without knocking  janet was startled mr pilgrim would never enter in that way unless there were some one very ill in the house it was her husband she felt certain of it at once something had happened to him without a moments pause she ran across the street opened the door and entered there was no one in the passage the diningroom door was wide openno one was there mr pilgrim then was already upstairs she rushed up at once to dempsters roomher own room the door was open and she paused in pale horror at the sight before her which seemed to stand out only with the more appalling distinctness because the noonday light was darkened to twilight in the chamber  two strong nurses were using their utmost force to hold dempster in bed while the medical assistant was applying a sponge to his head and mr pilgrim was busy adjusting some apparatus in the background dempsters face was purple and swollen his eyes dilated and fixed with a look of dire terror on something he seemed to see approaching him from the iron closet he trembled violently and struggled as if to jump out of bed  let me go let me go he said in a loud hoarse whisper shes coming  shes cold  shes dead  shell strangle me with her black hair ah he shrieked aloud her hair is all serpents  theyre black serpents  they hiss  they hiss   let me go    let me go    she wants to drag me with her cold arms  her arms are serpents  they are great white serpents  theyll twine round me  she wants to drag me into the cold water  her bosom is cold  it is black  it is all serpents   no robert janet cried in tones of yearning pity rushing to the side of the bed and stretching out her arms towards him no here is janet she is not deadshe forgives you  dempsters maddened senses seemed to receive some new impression from her appearance the terror gave way to rage  ha you sneaking hypocrite he burst out in a grating voice you threaten me  you mean to have your revenge on me do you do your worst ive got the law on my side  i know the law  ill hunt you down like a hare  prove it  prove that i was tampered with  prove that i took the money  prove it  you can prove nothing  you damned psalmsinging maggots ill make a fire under you and smoke off the whole pack of you  ill sweep you up  ill grind you to powder  small powder  here his voice dropt to a low tone of shuddering disgust  powder on the bedclothes  running about  black lice  they are coming in swarms  janet come and take them away  curse you why dont you come janet  poor janet was kneeling by the bed with her face buried in her hands she almost wished her worst moment back again rather than this it seemed as if her husband was already imprisoned in misery and she could not reach himhis ear deaf for ever to the sounds of love and forgiveness his sins had made a hard crust round his soul her pitying voice could not pierce it  not there isnt she he went on in a defiant tone why do you ask me where she is ill have every drop of yellow blood out of your veins if you come questioning me your blood is yellow  in your purse  running out of your purse  what youre changing it into toads are you theyre crawling  theyre flying  theyre flying about my head  the toads are flying about ostler ostler bring out my gig  bring it out you lazy beast    ha youll follow me will you  youll fly about my head  youve got fiery tongues  ostler curse you why dont you come janet come and take the toads away  janet  this last time he uttered her name with such a shriek of terror that janet involuntarily started up from her knees and stood as if petrified by the horrible vibration dempster stared wildly in silence for some months then he spoke again in a hoarse whisperdead  is she dead she did it then she buried herself in the iron chest  she left her clothes out though  she isnt dead  why do you pretend shes dead  shes coming  shes coming out of the iron closet  there are the black serpents  stop her  let me go  stop her  she wants to drag me away into the cold black water  her bosom is black  it is all serpents  they are getting longer  the great white serpents are getting longer   here mr pilgrim came forward with the apparatus to bind him but dempsters struggles became more and more violent ostler ostler he shouted bring out the gig  give me the whipand bursting loose from the strong hands that held him he began to flog the bedclothes furiously with his right arm  get along you lame brutescscsc thats it there you go they think

be the winner yet  get along you damned limping beast  ill lay your back open  ill   he raised himself with a stronger effort than ever to flog the bedclothes and fell back in convulsions janet gave a scream and sank on her knees again she thought he was dead  as soon as mr pilgrim was able to give her a moments attention he came to her and taking her by the arm attempted to draw her gently out of the room  now my dear mrs dempster let me persuade you not to remain in the room at present we shall soon relieve these symptoms i hope it is nothing but the delirium that ordinarily attends such cases  oh what is the matter what brought it on  he fell out of the gig the right leg is broken it is a terrible accident and i dont disguise that there is considerable danger attending it owing to the state of the brain but mr dempster has a strong constitution you know in a few days these symptoms may be allayed and he may do well let me beg of you to keep out of the room at present you can do no good until mr dempster is better and able to know you but you ought not to be alone let me advise you to have mrs raynor with you  yes i will send for mother but you must not object to my being in the room i shall be very quiet now only just at first the shock was so great i knew nothing about it i can help the nurses a great deal i can put the cold things to his head he may be sensible for a moment and know me pray do not say any more against it my heart is set on being with him  mr pilgrim gave way and janet having sent for her mother and put off her bonnet and shawl returned to take her place by the side of her husbands bed     chapter 24   day after day with only short intervals of rest janet kept her place in that sad chamber no wonder the sickroom and the lazaretto have so often been a refuge from the tossings of intellectual doubta place of repose for the worn and wounded spirit here is a duty about which all creeds and all philosophies are at one here at least the conscience will not be dogged by doubt the benign impulse will not be checked by adverse theory here you may begin to act without settling one preliminary question to moisten the sufferers parched lips through the long nightwatches to bear up the drooping head to lift the helpless limbs to divine the want that can find no utterance beyond the feeble motion of the hand or beseeching glance of the eyethese are offices that demand no selfquestionings no casuistry no assent to propositions no weighing of consequences within the four walls where the stir and glare of the world are shut out and every voice is subduedwhere a human being lies prostrate thrown on the tender mercies of his fellow the moral relation of man to man is reduced to its utmost clearness and simplicity bigotry cannot confuse it theory cannot pervert it passion awed into quiescence can neither pollute nor perturb it as we bend over the sickbed all the forces of our nature rush towards the channels of pity of patience and of love and sweep down the miserable choking drift of our quarrels our debates our wouldbe wisdom and our clamorous selfish desires this blessing of serene freedom from the importunities of opinion lies in all simple direct acts of mercy and is one source of that sweet calm which is often felt by the watcher in the sickroom even when the duties there are of a hard and terrible kind  something of that benign result was felt by janet during her tendance in her husbands chamber when the first heartpiercing hours were overwhen her horror at his delirium was no longer fresh she began to be conscious of her relief from the burden of decision as to her future course the question that agitated her about returning to her husband had been solved in a moment and this illness after all might be the herald of another blessing just as that dreadful midnight when she stood an outcast in cold and darkness had been followed by the dawn of a new hope robert would get better this illness might alter him he would be a long time feeble needing help walking with a crutch perhaps she would wait on him with such tenderness such allforgiving love that the old harshness and cruelty must melt away for ever under the heartsunshine she would pour around him her bosom heaved at the thought and delicious tears fell janets was a nature in which hatred and revenge could find no place the long bitter years drew half their bitterness from her everliving remembrance of the too short years of love that went before and the thought that her husband would ever put her hand to his lips again and recall the days when they sat on the grass together and he laid scarlet poppies on her black hair and called her his gypsy queen seemed to send a tide of loving oblivion over all the harsh and stony space they had traversed since the divine love that had already shone upon her would be with her she would lift up her soul continually for help mr tryan she knew would pray for her if she felt herself failing she would confess it to him at once if her feet began to slip there was that stay for her to cling to o she could never be drawn back into that cold damp vault of sin and despair again she had felt the morning sun she had tasted the sweet pure air of trust and penitence and submission  these were the thoughts passing through janets mind as she hovered about her husbands bed and these were the hopes she poured out to mr tryan when he called to see her it was so evident that they were strengthening her in her new strugglethey shed such a glow of calm enthusiasm over her face as she spoke of them that mr tryan could not bear to throw on them the chill of premonitory doubts though a previous conversation he had had with mr pilgrim had convinced him that there was not the faintest probability of dempsters recovery poor janet did not know the significance of the changing symptoms and when after the lapse of a week the delirium began to lose some of its violence and to be interrupted by longer and longer intervals of stupor she tried to think that these might be steps on the way to recovery and she shrank from questioning mr pilgrim lest he should confirm the fears that began to get predominance in her mind but before many days were past he thought it right not to allow her to blind herself any longer one dayit was just about noon when bad news always seems most sickeninghe led her from her husbands chamber into the opposite drawingroom where mrs raynor was sitting and said to her in that low tone of sympathetic feeling which sometimes gave a sudden air of gentleness to this rough manmy dear mrs dempster it is right in these cases you know to be prepared for the worst i think i shall be saving you pain by preventing you from entertaining any false hopes and mr dempsters state is now such that i fear we must consider recovery impossible the affection of the brain might not have been hopeless but you see there is a terrible complication and i am grieved to say the broken limb is mortifying  janet listened with a sinking heart that future of love and forgiveness would never come then he was going out of her sight for ever where her pity could never reach him she turned cold and trembled  but do you think he will die she said without ever coming to himself without ever knowing me  one cannot say that with certainty it is not impossible that the cerebral oppression may subside and that he may become conscious if there is anything you would wish to be said or done in that case it would be well to be prepared i should think mr pilgrim continued turning to mrs raynor mr dempsters affairs are likely to be in orderhis will is   o i wouldnt have him troubled about those things interrupted janet he has no relations but quite distant onesno one but me i wouldnt take up the time with that i only want to   she was unable to finish she felt her sobs rising and left the room o god she said inwardly is not thy love greater than mine have mercy on him have mercy on him  this happened on wednesday ten days after the fatal accident by the following sunday dempster was in a state of rapidly increasing prostration and when mr pilgrim who in turn with his assistant had slept in the house from the beginning came in about halfpast ten as usual he scarcely believed that the feebly struggling life would last out till morning for the last few days he had been administering stimulants to relieve the exhaustion which had succeeded the alternations of delirium and stupor this slight office was all that now remained to be done for the patient so at eleven oclock mr pilgrim went to bed having given directions to the nurse and desired her to call him if any change took place or if mrs dempster desired his presence  janet could not be persuaded to leave the room she was yearning and watching for a moment in which her husbands eyes would rest consciously upon her and he would know that she had forgiven him  how changed he was since that terrible monday nearly a fortnight ago he lay motionless but for the irregular breathing that stirred his broad chest and thick muscular neck his features were no longer purple and swollen they were pale sunken and haggard a cold perspiration stood in beads on the protuberant forehead and on the wasted hands stretched motionless on the bedclothes it was better to see the hands so than convulsively picking the air as they had been a week ago  janet sat on the edge of the bed through the long hours of candlelight watching the unconscious halfclosed eyes wiping the perspiration from the brow and cheeks and keeping her left hand on the cold unanswering right hand that lay beside her on the bedclothes she was almost as pale as her dying husband and there were dark lines under her eyes for this was the third night since she had taken off her clothes but the eager straining gaze of her dark eyes and the acute sensibility that lay in every line about her mouth made a strange contrast with the blank unconsciousness and emaciated animalism of the face she was watching  there was profound stillness in the house she heard no sound but her husbands breathing and the ticking of the watch on the mantelpiece the candle placed high up shed a soft light down on the one object she cared to see there was a smell of brandy in the room it was given to her husband from time to time but this smell which at first had produced in her a faint shuddering sensation was now becoming indifferent to her she did not even perceive it she was too unconscious of herself to feel either temptations or accusations she only felt that the husband of her youth was dying far far out of her reach as if she were standing helpless on the shore while he was sinking in the black stormwaves she only yearned for one moment in which she might satisfy the deep forgiving pity of her soul by one look of love one word of tenderness  her sensations and thoughts were so persistent that she could not measure the hours and it was a surprise to her when the nurse put out the candle and let in the faint morning light mrs raynor anxious about janet was already up and now brought in some fresh coffee for her and mr pilgrim having awaked had hurried on his clothes and was coming in to see how dempster was  this change from candlelight to morning this recommencement of the same round of things that had happened yesterday was a discouragement rather than a relief to janet she was more conscious of her chill weariness the new light thrown on her husbands face seemed to reveal the still work that death had been doing through the night she felt her last lingering hope that he would ever know her again forsake her  but now mr pilgrim having felt the pulse was putting some brandy in a teaspoon between dempsters lips the brandy went down and his breathing became freer janet noticed the change and her heart beat faster as she leaned forward to watch him suddenly a slight movement like the passing away of a shadow was visible in his face and he opened his eyes full on janet it was almost like meeting him again on the resurrection morning after the night of the grave  robert do you know me  he kept his eyes fixed on her and there was a faintly perceptible motion of the lips as if he wanted to speak  but the moment of speech was for ever gonethe moment for asking pardon of her if he wanted to ask it could he read the full forgiveness that was written in her eyes she never knew for as she was bending to kiss him the thick veil of death fell between them and her lips touched a corpse     chapter 25   the faces looked very hard and unmoved that surrounded dempsters grave while old mr crewe read the burialservice in his low broken voice the pallbearers were such men as mr pittman mr lowme and mr buddmen whom dempster had called his friends while he was in life and worldly faces never look so worldly as at a funeral they have the same effect of grating incongruity as the sound of a coarse voice breaking the solemn silence of night  the one face that had sorrow in it was covered by a thick crapeveil and the sorrow was suppressed and silent no one knew how deep it was for the thought in most of her neighbours minds was that mrs dempster could hardly have had better fortune than to lose a bad husband who had left her the compensation of a good income they found it difficult to conceive that her husbands death could be felt by her otherwise than as a deliverance the person who was most thoroughly convinced that janets grief was deep and real was mr pilgrim who in general was not at all weakly given to a belief in disinterested feeling  that woman has a tender heart he was frequently heard to observe in his morning rounds about this time i used to think there was a great deal of palaver in her but you may depend upon it theres no pretence about her if hed been the kindest husband in the world she couldnt have felt more theres a great deal of good in mrs dempstera great deal of good  i always said so was mrs lowmes reply when he made the observation to her she was always so very full of pretty attentions to me when i was ill but they tell me now shes turned tryanite if thats it we shant agree again its very inconsistent in her i think turning round in that way after being the foremost to laugh at the tryanite cant and especially in a woman of her habits she should cure herself of them before she pretends to be overreligious  well i think she means to cure herself do you know said mr pilgrim whose goodwill towards janet was just now quite above that temperate point at which he could indulge his feminine patients with a little judicious detraction i feel sure she has not taken any stimulants all through her husbands illness and she has been constantly in the way of them i can see she sometimes suffers a good deal of depression for want of themit shows all the more resolution in her those cures are rare but ive known them happen sometimes with people of strong will  mrs lowme took an opportunity of retailing mr pilgrims conversation to mrs phipps who as a victim of pratt and plethora could rarely enjoy that pleasure at firsthand mrs phipps was a woman of decided opinions though of wheezy utterance  for my part she remarked im glad to hear theres any likelihood of improvement in mrs dempster but i think the way things have turned out seems to show that she was more to blame than people thought she was else why should she feel so much about her husband and dempster i understand has left his wife pretty nearly all his property to do as she likes with that isnt behaving like such a very bad husband i dont believe mrs dempster can have had so much provocation as they pretended ive known husbands whove laid plans for tormenting their wives when theyre undergroundtying up their money and hindering them from marrying again not that i should ever wish to marry again i think one husband in ones life is enough in all consciencehere she threw a fierce glance at the amiable mr phipps who was innocently delighting himself with the facetiae in the rotherby guardian and thinking the editor must be a droll fellowbut its aggravating to be tied up in that way why they say mrs dempster will have as good as six hundred ayear at least a fine thing for her that was a poor girl without a farthing to her fortune its well if she doesnt make ducks and drakes of it somehow  mrs phippss view of janet however was far from being the prevalent one in milby even neighbours who had no strong personal interest in her could hardly see the noblelooking woman in her widows dress with a sad sweet gravity in her face and not be touched with fresh admiration for herand not feel at least vaguely that she had entered on a new life in which it was a sort of desecration to allude to the painful past and the old friends who had a real regard for her but whose cordiality had been repelled or chilled of late years now came round her with hearty demonstrations of affection mr jerome felt that his happiness had a substantial addition now he could once more call on that nice little woman mrs dempster and think of her with rejoicing instead of sorrow the pratts lost no time in returning to the footing of oldestablished friendship with janet and her mother and miss pratt felt it incumbent on her on all suitable occasions to deliver a very emphatic approval of the remarkable strength of mind she understood mrs dempster to be exhibiting the miss linnets were eager to meet mr tryans wishes by greeting janet as one who was likely to be a sister in religious feeling and good works and mrs linnet was so agreeably surprised by the fact that dempster had left his wife the money in that handsome way to do what she liked with it that she even included dempster himself and his villanous discovery of the flaw in her title to pyes croft in her magnanimous oblivion of past offences she and mrs jerome agreed over a friendly cup of tea that there were a many husbands as was very fine spoken an all that an yet all the while kep a will locked up from you as tied you up as tight as anything i assure you mrs jerome continued dropping her voice in a confidential manner i know no more to this day about mr jeromes will nor the child as is unborn ive no fears about a incomeim well aware mr jerome ud niver leave me stret for that but i should like to hev a thousand or two at my own disposial it makes a widow a deal more looked on  perhaps this ground of respect to widows might not be entirely without its influence on the milby mind and might do something towards conciliating those more aristocratic acquaintances of janets who would otherwise have been inclined to take the severest view of her apostasy towards evangelicalism errors look so very ugly in persons of small meansone feels they are taking quite a liberty in going astray whereas people of fortune may naturally indulge in a few delinquencies theyve got the money for it as the girl said of her mistress who had made herself ill with pickled salmon however it may have been there was not an acquaintance of janets in milby that did not offer her civilities in the early days of her widowhood even the severe mrs phipps was not an exception for heaven knows what would become of our sociality if we never visited people we speak ill of we should live like egyptian hermits in crowded solitude  perhaps the attentions most grateful to janet were those of her old friend mrs crewe whose attachment to her favourite proved quite too strong for any resentment she might be supposed to feel on the score of mr tryan the little deaf old lady couldnt do without her accustomed visitor whom she had seen grow up from child to woman always so willing to chat with her and tell her all the news though she was deaf while other people thought it tiresome to shout in her ear and irritated her by recommending eartrumpets of various construction  all this friendliness was very precious to janet she was conscious of the aid it gave her in the selfconquest which was the blessing she prayed for with every fresh morning the chief strength of her nature lay in her affection which coloured all the rest of her mind it gave a personal sisterly tenderness to her acts of benevolence it made her cling with tenacity to every object that had once stirred her kindly emotions alas it was unsatisfied wounded affection that had made her trouble greater than she could bear and now there was no check to the full flow of that plenteous current in her natureno gnawing secret anguishno overhanging terrorno inward shame friendly faces beamed on her she felt that friendly hearts were approving her and wishing her well and that mild sunshine of goodwill fell beneficently on her new hopes and efforts as the clear shining after rain falls on the tender leafbuds of spring and wins them from promise to fulfilment  and she needed these secondary helps for her wrestling with her past self was not always easy the strong emotions from which the life of a human being receives a new bias win their victory as the sea wins his though their advance may be sure they will often after a mightier wave than usual seem to roll back so far as to lose all the ground they had made janet showed the strong bent of her will by taking every outward precaution against the occurrence of a temptation her mother was now her constant companion having shut up her little dwelling and come to reside in orchard street and janet gave all dangerous keys into her keeping entreating her to lock them away in some secret place whenever the too wellknown depression and craving threatened her she would seek a refuge in what had always been her purest enjoymentin visiting one of her poor neighbours in carrying some food or comfort to a sickbed in cheering with her smile some of the familiar dwellings up the dingy backlanes but the great source of courage the great help to perseverance was the sense that she had a friend and teacher in mr tryan she could confess her difficulties to him she knew he prayed for her she had always before her the prospect of soon seeing him and hearing words of admonition and comfort that came to her charged with a divine power such as she had never found in human words before  so the time passed till it was far on in may nearly a month after her husbands death when as she and her mother were seated peacefully at breakfast in the diningroom looking through the open window at the oldfashioned garden where the grassplot was now whitened with appleblossoms a letter was brought in for mrs raynor  why theres the thurston postmark on it she said it must be about your aunt anna ah so it is poor thing shes been taken worse this last day or two and has asked them to send for me that dropsy is carrying her off at last i daresay poor thing it will be a happy release i must go my dearshes your fathers last sisterthough i am sorry to leave you however perhaps i shall not have to stay more than a night or two  janet looked distressed as she said yes you must go mother but i dont know what i shall do without you i think i shall run in to mrs pettifer and ask her to come and stay with me while youre away im sure she will  at twelve oclock janet having seen her mother in the coach that was to carry her to thurston called on her way back at mrs pettifers but found to her great disappointment that her old friend was gone out for the day so she wrote on a leaf of her pocketbook an urgent request that mrs pettifer would come and stay with her while her mother was away and desiring the servantgirl to give it to her mistress as soon as she came home walked on to the vicarage to sit with mrs crewe thinking to relieve in this way the feeling of desolateness and undefined fear that was taking possession of her on being left alone for the first time since that great crisis in her life and mrs crewe too was not at home  janet with a sense of discouragement for which she rebuked herself as childish walked sadly home again and when she entered the vacant diningroom she could not help bursting into tears it is such vague undefinable states of susceptibility as thisstates of excitement or depression half mental half physicalthat determine many a tragedy in womens lives janet could scarcely eat anything at her solitary dinner she tried to fix her attention on a book in vain she walked about the garden and felt the very sunshine melancholy  between four and five oclock old mr pittman called and joined her in the garden where she had been sitting for some time under one of the great appletrees thinking how robert in his best moods used to take little mamsey to look at the cucumbers or to see the alderney cow with its calf in the paddock the tears and sobs had come again at these thoughts and when mr pittman approached her she was feeling languid and exhausted but the old gentlemans sight and sensibility were obtuse and to janets satisfaction he showed no consciousness that she was in grief  i have a task to impose upon you mrs dempster he said with a certain toothless pomposity habitual to him i want you to look over those letters again in dempsters bureau and see if you can find one from poole about the mortgage on those houses at dingley it will be worth twenty pounds if you can find it and i dont know where it can be if it isnt among those letters in the bureau ive looked everywhere at the office for it im going home now but ill call again tomorrow if youll be good enough to look in the meantime  janet said she would look directly and turned with mr pittman into the house but the search would take her some time so he bade her goodbye and she went at once to a bureau which stood in a small backroom where dempster used sometimes to write letters and receive people who came on business out of office hours she had looked through the contents of the bureau more than once but today on removing the last bundle of letters from one of the compartments she saw what she had never seen before a small nick in the wood made in the shape of a thumbnail evidently intended as a means of pushing aside the movable back of the compartment in her examination hitherto she had not found such a letter as mr pittman had describedperhaps there might be more letters behind this slide she pushed it back at once and sawno letters but a small spiritdecanter half full of pale brandy dempsters habitual drink  an impetuous desire shook janet through all her members it seemed to master her with the inevitable force of strong fumes that flood our senses before we are aware her hand was on the decanter pale and excited she was lifting it out of its niche when with a start and a shudder she dashed it to the ground and the room was filled with the odour of the spirit without staying to shut up the bureau she rushed out of the room snatched up her bonnet and mantle which lay in the diningroom and hurried out of the house  where should she go in what place would this demon that had reentered her be scared back again she walks rapidly along the street in the direction of the church she is soon at the gate of the churchyard she passes through it and makes her way across the graves to a spot she knowsa spot where the turf was stirred not long ago where a tomb is to be erected soon it is very near the church wall on the side which now lies in deep shadow quite shut out from the rays of the westering sun by a projecting buttress  janet sat down on the ground it was a sombre spot a thick hedge surmounted by elmtrees was in front of her a projecting buttress on each side but she wanted to shut out even these objects her thick crape veil was down but she closed her eyes behind it and pressed her hands upon them she wanted to summon up the vision of the past she wanted to lash the demon out of her soul with the stinging memories of the bygone misery she wanted to renew the old horror and the old anguish that she might throw herself with the more desperate clinging energy at the foot of the cross where the divine sufferer would impart divine strength she tried to recall those first bitter moments of shame which were like the shuddering discovery of the leper that the dire taint is upon him the deeper and deeper lapse the oncoming of settled despair the awful moments by the bedside of her selfmaddened husband and then she tried to live through with a remembrance made more vivid by that contrast the blessed hours of hope and joy and peace that had come to her of late since her whole soul had been bent towards the attainment of purity and holiness  but now when the paroxysm of temptation was past dread and despondency began to thrust themselves like cold heavy mists between her and the heaven to which she wanted to look for light and guidance the temptation would come againthat rush of desire might overmaster her the next timeshe would slip back again into that deep slimy pit from which she had been once rescued and there might be no deliverance for her more her prayers did not help her for fear predominated over trust she had no confidence that the aid she sought would be given the idea of her future fall had grasped her mind too strongly alone in this way she was powerless if she could see mr tryan if she could confess all to him she might gather hope again she must see him she must go to him  janet rose from the ground and walked away with a quick resolved step she had been seated there a long while and the sun had already sunk it was late for her to walk to paddiford and go to mr tryans where she had never called before but there was no other way of seeing him that evening and she could not hesitate about it she walked towards a footpath through the fields which would take her to paddiford without obliging her to go through the town the way was rather long but she preferred it because it left less probability of her meeting acquaintances and she shrank from having to speak to any one  the evening red had nearly faded by the time janet knocked at mrs wagstaffs door the good woman looked surprised to see her at that hour but janets mourning weeds and the painful agitation of her face quickly brought the second thought that some urgent trouble had sent her there  mr tryans just come in she said if youll step into the parlour ill go up and tell him youre here he seemed very tired and poorly  at another time janet would have felt distress at the idea that she was disturbing mr tryan when he required rest but now her need was too great for that she could feel nothing but a sense of coming relief when she heard his step on the stair and saw him enter the room  he went towards her with a look of anxiety and said i fear something is the matter i fear you are in trouble  then poor janet poured forth her sad tale of temptation and despondency and even while she was confessing she felt half her burden removed the act of confiding in human sympathy the consciousness that a fellowbeing was listening to her with patient pity prepared her soul for that stronger leap by which faith grasps the idea of the divine sympathy when mr tryan spoke words of consolation and encouragement she could now believe the message of mercy the waterfloods that had threatened to overwhelm her rolled back again and life once more spread its heavencovered space before her she had been unable to pray alone but now his prayer bore her own soul along with it as the broad tongue of flame carries upwards in its vigorous leap the little flickering fire that could hardly keep alight by itself  but mr tryan was anxious that janet should not linger out at this late hour when he saw that she was calmed he said i will walk home with you now we can talk on the way but janets mind was now sufficiently at liberty for her to notice the signs of feverish weariness in his appearance and she would not hear of causing him any further fatigue  no no she said earnestly you will pain me very muchindeed you will by going out again tonight on my account there is no real reason why i should not go alone and when he persisted fearing that for her to be seen out so late alone might excite remark she said imploringly with a half sob in her voice what should iwhat would others like me do if you went from us why will you not think more of that and take care of yourself  he had often had that appeal made to him before but tonightfrom janets lipsit seemed to have a new force for him and he gave way at first indeed he only did so on condition that she would let mrs wagstaff go with her but janet had determined to walk home alone she preferred solitude she wished not to have her present feelings distracted by any conversation  so she went out into the dewy starlight and as mr tryan turned away from her he felt a stronger wish than ever that his fragile life might last out for him to see janets restoration thoroughly establishedto see her no longer fleeing struggling clinging up the steep sides of a precipice whence she might be any moment hurled back into the depths of despair but walking firmly on the level ground of habit he inwardly resolved that nothing but a peremptory duty should ever take him from milbythat he would not cease to watch over her until life forsook him  janet walked on quickly till she turned into the fields then she slackened her pace a little enjoying the sense of solitude which a few hours before had been intolerable to her the divine presence did not now seem far off where she had not wings to reach it prayer itself seemed superfluous in those moments of calm trust the temptation which had so lately made her shudder before the possibilities of the future was now a source of confidence for had she not been delivered from it had not rescue come in the extremity of danger yes infinite love was caring for her she felt like a little child whose hand is firmly grasped by its father as its frail limbs make their way over the rough ground if it should stumble the father will not let it go  that walk in the dewy starlight remained for ever in janets memory as one of those baptismal epochs when the soul dipped in the sacred waters of joy and peace rises from them with new energies with more unalterable longings  when she reached home she found mrs pettifer there anxious for her return after thanking her for coming janet only said i have been to mr tryans i wanted to speak to him and then remembering how she had left the bureau and papers she went into the backroom where apparently no one had been since she quitted it for there lay the fragments of glass and the room was still full of the hateful odour how feeble and miserable the temptation seemed to her at this moment she rang for kitty to come and pick up the fragments and rub the floor while she herself replaced the papers and locked up the bureau  the next morning when seated at breakfast with mrs pettifer janet saidwhat a dreary unhealthylooking place that is where mr tryan lives im sure it must be very bad for him to live there do you know all this morning since ive been awake ive been turning over a little plan in my mind i think it a charming oneall the more because you are concerned in it  why what can that be  you know that house on the redhill road they call holly mount it is shut up now that is roberts house at least it is mine now and it stands on one of the healthiest spots about here now ive been settling in my own mind that if a dear good woman of my acquaintance who knows how to make a home as comfortable and cosy as a birds nest were to take up her abode there and have mr tryan as a lodger she would be doing one of the most useful deeds in all her useful life  youve such a way of wrapping up things in pretty words you must speak plainer  in plain words then i should like to settle you at holly mount you would not have to pay any more rent than where you are and it would be twenty times pleasanter for you than living up that passage where you see nothing but a brick wall and then as it is not far from paddiford i think mr tryan might be persuaded to lodge with you instead of in that musty house among dead cabbages and smoky cottages i know you would like to have him live with you and you would be such a mother to him  to be sure i should like it it would be the finest thing in the world for me but therell be furniture wanted my little bit of furniture wont fill that house  o i can put some in out of this house it is too full and we can buy the rest they tell me im to have more money than i shall know what to do with  im almost afraid said mrs pettifer doubtfully mr tryan will hardly be persuaded hes been talked to so much about leaving that place and he always said he must stay therehe must be among the people and there was no other place for him in paddiford it cuts me to the heart to see him getting thinner and thinner and ive noticed him quite short o breath sometimes mrs linnet will have it mrs wagstaff half poisons him with bad cooking i dont know about that but he cant have many comforts i expect hell break down all of a sudden some day and never be able to preach any more  well i shall try my skill with him by and by i shall be very cunning and say nothing to him till all is ready you and i and mother when she comes home will set to work directly and get the house in order and then well get you snugly settled in it i shall see mr pittman today and i will tell him what i mean to do i shall say i wish to have you for a tenant everybody knows im very fond of that naughty person mrs pettifer so it will seem the most natural thing in the world and then i shall by and by point out to mr tryan that he will be doing you a service as well as himself by taking up his abode with you i think i can prevail upon him for last night when he was quite bent on coming out into the night air i persuaded him to give it up  well i only hope you may my dear i dont desire anything better than to do something towards prolonging mr tryans life for ive sad fears about him  dont speak of themi cant bear to think of them we will only think about getting the house ready we shall be as busy as bees how we shall want mothers clever fingers i know the room upstairs that will just do for mr tryans study there shall be no seats in it except a very easy chair and a very easy sofa so that he shall be obliged to rest himself when he comes home     chapter 26   that was the last terrible crisis of temptation janet had to pass through the goodwill of her neighbours the helpful sympathy of the friends who shared her religious feelings the occupations suggested to her by mr tryan concurred with her strong spontaneous impulses towards works of love and mercy to fill up her days with quiet social intercourse and charitable exertion besides her constitution naturally healthy and strong was every week tending with the gathering force of habit to recover its equipoise and set her free from those physical solicitations which the smallest habitual vice always leaves behind it the prisoner feels where the iron has galled him long after his fetters have been loosed  there were always neighbourly visits to be paid and received and as the months wore on increasing familiarity with janets present self began to efface even from minds as rigid as mrs phippss the unpleasant impressions that had been left by recent years janet was recovering the popularity which her beauty and sweetness of nature had won for her when she was a girl and popularity as every one knows is the most complex and selfmultiplying of echoes even antitryanite prejudice could not resist the fact that janet dempster was a changed womanchanged as the dusty bruised and sunwithered plant is changed when the soft rains of heaven have fallen on itand that this change was due to mr tryans influence the last lingering sneers against the evangelical curate began to die out and though much of the feeling that had prompted them remained behind there was an intimidating consciousness that the expression of such feeling would not be effectivejokes of that sort had ceased to tickle the milby mind even mr budd and mr tomlinson when they saw mr tryan passing pale and worn along the street had a secret sense that this man was somehow not that very natural and comprehensible thing a humbugthat in fact it was impossible to explain him from the stomach and pocket point of view twist and stretch their theory as they might it would not fit mr tryan and so with that remarkable resemblance as to mental processes which may frequently be observed to exist between plain men and philosophers they concluded that the less they said about him the better  among all janets neighbourly pleasures there was nothing she liked better than to take an early tea at the white house and to stroll with mr jerome round the oldfashioned garden and orchard there was endless matter for talk between her and the good old man for janet had that genuine delight in human fellowship which gives an interest to all personal details that come warm from truthful lips and besides they had a common interest in goodnatured plans for helping their poorer neighbours one great object of mr jeromes charities was as he often said to keep industrious men an women off the parish id rether given ten shillin an help a man to stand on his own legs nor pay halfacrown to buy him a parish crutch its the ruination on him if he once goes to the parish ive seed many a time if you help a man wi a present in a neeborly way it sweetens his bloodhe thinks it kind on you but the parish shillins turn it sourhe niver thinks em enough in illustration of this opinion mr jerome had a large store of details about such persons as jim hardy the coalcarrier as lost his hoss and sally butts as hed to sell her mangle though she was as decent a woman as need to be to the hearing of which details janet seriously inclined and you would hardly desire to see a prettier picture than the kindfaced whitehaired old man telling these fragments of his simple experience as he walked with shoulders slightly bent among the mossroses and espalier appletrees while janet in her widows cap her dark eyes bright with interest went listening by his side and little lizzie with her nankeen bonnet hanging down her back toddled on before them mrs jerome usually declined these lingering strolls and often observed i niver see the like to mr jerome when hes got mrs dempster to talk to it sinnifies nothin to him whether weve tea at four or at five oclock hed go on till six if youd let him alonehes like off his head however mrs jerome herself could not deny that janet was a very prettyspoken woman she alys says she niver gets sich pikelets as mine nowhere i know that very wellother folks buy em at shopsthick unwholesome things you might as well eat a sponge  the sight of little lizzie often stirred in janets mind a sense of the childlessness which had made a fatal blank in her life she had fleeting thoughts that perhaps among her husbands distant relatives there might be some children whom she could help to bring up some little girl whom she might adopt and she promised herself one day or other to hunt out a second cousin of hisa married woman of whom he had lost sight for many years  but at present her hands and heart were too full for her to carry out that scheme to her great disappointment her project of settling mrs pettifer at holly mount had been delayed by the discovery that some repairs were necessary in order to make the house habitable and it was not till september had set in that she had the satisfaction of seeing her old friend comfortably installed and the rooms destined for mr tryan looking pretty and cosy to her hearts content she had taken several of his chief friends into her confidence and they were warmly wishing success to her plan for inducing him to quit poor mrs wagstaffs dingy house and dubious cookery that he should consent to some such change was becoming more and more a matter of anxiety to his hearers for though no more decided symptoms were yet observable in him than increasing emaciation a dry hacking cough and an occasional shortness of breath it was felt that the fulfilment of mr pratts prediction could not long be deferred and that this obstinate persistence in labour and selfdisregard must soon be peremptorily cut short by a total failure of strength any hopes that the influence of mr tryans father and sister would prevail on him to change his mode of lifethat they would perhaps come to live with him or that his sister at least might come to see him and that the arguments which had failed from other lips might be more persuasive from herswere now quite dissipated his father had lately had an attack of paralysis and could not spare his only daughters tendance on mr tryans return from a visit to his father miss linnet was very anxious to know whether his sister had not urged him to try change of air from his answers she gathered that miss tryan wished him to give up his curacy and travel or at least go to the south devonshire coast  and why will you not do so miss linnet said you might come back to us well and strong and have many years of usefulness before you  no he answered quietly i think people attach more importance to such measures than is warranted i dont see any good end that is to be served by going to die at nice instead of dying amongst ones friends and ones work i cannot leave milbyat least i will not leave it voluntarily  but though he remained immovable on this point he had been compelled to give up his afternoon service on the sunday and to accept mr parrys offer of aid in the evening service as well as to curtail his weekday labours and he had even written to mr prendergast to request that he would appoint another curate to the paddiford district on the understanding that the new curate should receive the salary but that mr tryan should cooperate with him as long as he was able the hopefulness which is an almost constant attendant on consumption had not the effect of deceiving him as to the nature of his malady or of making him look forward to ultimate recovery he believed himself to be consumptive and he had not yet felt any desire to escape the early death which he had for some time contemplated as probable even diseased hopes will take their direction from the strong habitual bias of the mind and to mr tryan death had for years seemed nothing else than the laying down of a burden under which he sometimes felt himself fainting he was only sanguine about his powers of work he flattered himself that what he was unable to do one week he should be equal to the next and he would not admit that in desisting from any part of his labour he was renouncing it permanently he had lately delighted mr jerome by accepting his longproffered loan of the little chacenut hoss and he found so much benefit from substituting constant riding exercise for walking that he began to think he should soon be able to resume some of the work he had dropped  that was a happy afternoon for janet when after exerting herself busily for a week with her mother and mrs pettifer she saw holly mount looking orderly and comfortable from attic to cellar it was an old redbrick house with two gables in front and two clipped hollytrees flanking the gardengate a simple homelylooking place that quiet people might easily get fond of and now it was scoured and polished and carpeted and furnished so as to look really snug within when there was nothing more to be done janet delighted herself with contemplating mr tryans study first sitting down in the easychair and then lying for a moment on the sofa that she might have a keener sense of the repose he would get from those wellstuffed articles of furniture which she had gone to rotherby on purpose to choose  now mother she said when she had finished her survey you have done your work as well as any fairymother or godmother that ever turned a pumpkin into a coach and horses you stay and have tea cosily with mrs pettifer while i go to mrs linnets i want to tell mary and rebecca the good news that ive got the exciseman to promise that he will take mrs wagstaffs lodgings when mr tryan leaves theyll be so pleased to hear it because they thought he would make her poverty an objection to his leaving her  but my dear child said mrs raynor whose face always calm was now a happy one have a cup of tea with us first youll perhaps miss mrs linnets teatime  no i feel too excited to take tea yet im like a child with a new babyhouse walking in the air will do me good  so she set out holly mount was about a mile from that outskirt of paddiford common where mrs linnets house stood nestled among its laburnums lilacs and syringas janets way thither lay for a little while along the highroad and then led her into a deeprutted lane which wound through a flat tract of meadow and pasture while in front lay smoky paddiford and away to the left the mothertown of milby there was no line of silvery willows marking the course of a streamno group of scotch firs with their trunks reddening in the level sunbeamsnothing to break the flowerless monotony of grass and hedgerow but an occasional oak or elm and a few cows sprinkled here and there a very commonplace scene indeed but what scene was ever commonplace in the descending sunlight when colour has awakened from its noonday sleep and the long shadows awe us like a disclosed presence above all what scene is commonplace to the eye that is filled with serene gladness and brightens all things with its own joy  and janet just now was very happy as she walked along the rough lane with a buoyant step a half smile of innocent kindly triumph played about her mouth she was delighting beforehand in the anticipated success of her persuasive power and for the time her painful anxiety about mr tryans health was thrown into abeyance but she had not gone far along the lane before she heard the sound of a horse advancing at a walking pace behind her without looking back she turned aside to make way for it between the ruts and did not notice that for a moment it had stopped and had then come on with a slightly quickened pace in less than a minute she heard a wellknown voice say mrs dempster and turning saw mr tryan close to her holding his horse by the bridle it seemed very natural to her that he should be there her mind was so full of his presence at that moment that the actual sight of him was only like a more vivid thought and she behaved as we are apt to do when feeling obliges us to be genuine with a total forgetfulness of polite forms she only looked at him with a slight deepening of the smile that was already on her face he said gently take my arm and they walked on a little way in silence  it was he who broke it you are going to paddiford i suppose  the question recalled janet to the consciousness that this was an unexpected opportunity for beginning her work of persuasion and that she was stupidly neglecting it  yes she said i was going to mrs linnets i knew miss linnet would like to hear that our friend mrs pettifer is quite settled now in her new house she is as fond of mrs pettifer as i amalmost i wont admit that any one loves her quite as well for no one else has such good reason as i have but now the dear woman wants a lodger for you know she cant afford to live in so large a house by herself but i knew when i persuaded her to go there that she would be sure to get oneshes such a comfortable creature to live with and i didnt like her to spend all the rest of her days up that dull passage being at every ones beck and call who wanted to make use of her  yes said mr tryan i quite understand your feeling i dont wonder at your strong regard for her  well but now i want her other friends to second me there she is with three rooms to let ready furnished everything in order and i know some one who thinks as well of her as i do and who would be doing good all roundto every one that knows him as well as to mrs pettifer if he would go to live with her he would leave some uncomfortable lodgings which another person is already coveting and would take immediately and he would go to breathe pure air at holly mount and gladden mrs pettifers heart by letting her wait on him and comfort all his friends who are quite miserable about him  mr tryan saw it all in a momenthe saw that it had all been done for his sake he could not be sorry he could not say no he could not resist the sense that life had a new sweetness for him and that he should like it to be prolonged a littleonly a little for the sake of feeling a stronger security about janet when she had finished speaking she looked at him with a doubtful inquiring glance he was not looking at her his eyes were cast downwards but the expression of his face encouraged her and she said in a halfplayful tone of entreatyyou will go and live with her i know you will you will come back with me now and see the house  he looked at her then and smiled there is an unspeakable blending of sadness and sweetness in the smile of a face sharpened and paled by slow consumption that smile of mr tryans pierced poor janets heart she felt in it at once the assurance of grateful affection and the prophecy of coming death her tears rose they turned round without speaking and went back again along the lane     chapter 27   in less than a week mr tryan was settled at holly mount and there was not one of his many attached hearers who did not sincerely rejoice at the event  the autumn that year was bright and warm and at the beginning of october mr walsh the new curate came the mild weather the relaxation from excessive work and perhaps another benignant influence had for a few weeks a visibly favourable effect on mr tryan at least he began to feel new hopes which sometimes took the guise of new strength he thought of the cases in which consumption patients remain nearly stationary for years without suffering so as to make their life burdensome to themselves or to others and he began to struggle with a longing that it might be so with him he struggled with it because he felt it to be an indication that earthly affection was beginning to have too strong a hold on him and he prayed earnestly for more perfect submission and for a more absorbing delight in the divine presence as the chief good he was conscious that he did not wish for prolonged life solely that he might reclaim the wanderers and sustain the feeble he was conscious of a new yearning for those pure human joys which he had voluntarily and determinedly banished from his lifefor a draught of that deep affection from which he had been cut off by a dark chasm of remorse for now that affection was within his reach he saw it there like a palmshadowed well in the desert he could not desire to die in sight of it  and so the autumn rolled gently by in its calm decay until november mr tryan continued to preach occasionally to ride about visiting his flock and to look in at his schools but his growing satisfaction in mr walsh as his successor saved him from too eager exertion and from worrying anxieties janet was with him a great deal now for she saw that he liked her to read to him in the lengthening evenings and it became the rule for her and her mother to have tea at holly mount where with mrs pettifer and sometimes another friend or two they brought mr tryan the unaccustomed enjoyment of companionship by his own fireside  janet did not share his new hopes for she was not only in the habit of hearing mr pratts opinion that mr tryan could hardly stand out through the winter but she also knew that it was shared by dr madely of rotherby whom at her request he had consented to call in it was not necessary or desirable to tell mr tryan what was revealed by the stethoscope but janet knew the worst  she felt no rebellion under this prospect of bereavement but rather a quiet submissive sorrow gratitude that his influence and guidance had been given her even if only for a little whilegratitude that she was permitted to be with him to take a deeper and deeper impress from daily communion with him to be something to him in these last months of his life was so strong in her that it almost silenced regret janet had lived through the great tragedy of womans life her keenest personal emotions had been poured forth in her early loveher wounded affection with its years of anguishher agony of unavailing pity over that deathbed seven months ago the thought of mr tryan was associated for her with repose from that conflict of emotion with trust in the unchangeable with the influx of a power to subdue self to have been assured of his sympathy his teaching his help all through her life would have been to her like a heaven already beguna deliverance from fear and danger but the time was not yet come for her to be conscious that the hold he had on her heart was any other than that of the heavensent friend who had come to her like the angel in the prison and loosed her bonds and led her by the hand till she could look back on the dreadful doors that had once closed her in  before november was over mr tryan had ceased to go out a new crisis had come on the cough had changed its character and the worst symptoms developed themselves so rapidly that mr pratt began to think the end would arrive sooner than he had expected janet became a constant attendant on him now and no one could feel that she was performing anything but a sacred office she made holly mount her home and with her mother and mrs pettifer to help her she filled the painful days and nights with every soothing influence that care and tenderness could devise there were many visitors to the sickroom led thither by venerating affection and there could hardly be one who did not retain in after years a vivid remembrance of the scene thereof the pale wasted form in the easychair for he sat up to the last of the grey eyes so full even yet of inquiring kindness as the thin almost transparent hand was held out to give the pressure of welcome and of the sweet woman too whose dark watchful eyes detected every want and who supplied the want with a ready hand  there were others who would have had the heart and the skill to fill this place by mr tryans side and who would have accepted it as an honour but they could not help feeling that god had given it to janet by a train of events which were too impressive not to shame all jealousies into silence  that sad history which most of us know too well lasted more than three months he was too feeble and suffering for the last few weeks to see any visitors but he still sat up through the day the strange hallucinations of the disease which had seemed to take a more decided hold on him just at the fatal crisis and had made him think he was perhaps getting better at the very time when death had begun to hurry on with more rapid movement had now given way and left him calmly conscious of the reality one afternoon near the end of february janet was moving gently about the room in the firelit dusk arranging some things that would be wanted in the night there was no one else in the room and his eyes followed her as she moved with the firm grace natural to her while the bright fire every now and then lit up her face and gave an unusual glow to its dark beauty even to follow her in this way with his eyes was an exertion that gave a painful tension to his face while she looked like an image of life and strength  janet he said presently in his faint voicehe always called her janet now in a moment she was close to him bending over him he opened his hand as he looked up at her and she placed hers within it  janet he said again you will have a long while to live after i am gone  a sudden pang of fear shot through her she thought he felt himself dying and she sank on her knees at his feet holding his hand while she looked up at him almost breathless  but you will not feel the need of me as you have done  you have a sure trust in god  i shall not look for you in vain at the last  no  no  i shall be there  god will not forsake me  she could hardly utter the words though she was not weeping she was waiting with trembling eagerness for anything else he might have to say  let us kiss each other before we part  she lifted up her face to his and the full lifebreathing lips met the wasted dying ones in a sacred kiss of promise     chapter 28   it soon camethe blessed day of deliverance the sad day of bereavement and in the second week of march they carried him to the grave he was buried as he had desired there was no hearse no mourningcoach his coffin was borne by twelve of his humbler hearers who relieved each other by turns but he was followed by a long procession of mourning friends women as well as men  slowly amid deep silence the dark stream passed along orchard street where eighteen months before the evangelical curate had been saluted with hooting and hisses mr jerome and mr landor were the eldest pallbearers and behind the coffin led by mr tryans cousin walked janet in quiet submissive sorrow she could not feel that he was quite gone from her the unseen world lay so very near herit held all that had ever stirred the depths of anguish and joy within her  it was a cloudy morning and had been raining when they left holly mount but as they walked the sun broke out and the clouds were rolling off in large masses when they entered the churchyard and mr walshs voice was heard saying i am the resurrection and the life the faces were not hard at this funeral the burialservice was not a hollow form every heart there was filled with the memory of a man who through a selfsacrificing life and in a painful death had been sustained by the faith which fills that form with breath and substance  when janet left the grave she did not return to holly mount she went to her home in orchard street where her mother was waiting to receive her she said quite calmly let us walk round the garden mother and they walked round in silence with their hands clasped together looking at the golden crocuses bright in the spring sunshine janet felt a deep stillness within she thirsted for no pleasure she craved no worldly good she saw the years to come stretch before her like an autumn afternoon filled with resigned memory life to her could never more have any eagerness it was a solemn service of gratitude and patient effort she walked in the presence of unseen witnessesof the divine love that had rescued her of the human love that waited for its eternal repose until it had seen her endure to the end  janet is living still her black hair is grey and her step is no longer buoyant but the sweetness of her smile remains the love is not gone from her eyes and strangers sometimes ask who is that noblelooking elderly woman that walks about holding a little boy by the hand the little boy is the son of janets adopted daughter and janet in her old age has children about her knees and loving young arms round her neck  there is a simple gravestone in milby churchyard telling that in this spot lie the remains of edgar tryan for two years officiating curate at the paddiford chapelofease in this parish it is a meagre memorial and tells you simply that the man who lies there took upon him faithfully or unfaithfully the office of guide and instructor to his fellowmen  but there is another memorial of edgar tryan which bears a fuller record it is janet dempster rescued from selfdespair strengthened with divine hopes and now looking back on years of purity and helpful labour the man who has left such a memorial behind him must have been one whose heart beat with true compassion and whose lips were moved by fervent faith    the end
