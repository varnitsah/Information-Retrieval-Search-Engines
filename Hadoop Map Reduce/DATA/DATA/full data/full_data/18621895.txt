18621895	the middle years  by henry james  new york charles scribners sons  published november 1917  illustration from a copyrighted photograph by elliott and fry  henry james   by henry james  a small boy and others  notes of a son and brother  the middle years  notes on novelists with some other notes     editors note   the following pages represent all that henry james lived to write of a volume of autobiographical reminiscences to which he had given the name of one of his own short stories the middle years it was designed to follow on notes of a son and brother and to extend to about the same length the chapters here printed were dictated during the autumn of 1914 they were laid aside for other work toward the end of the year and were not revised by the author a few quite evident slips have been corrected and the marking of the paragraphswhich he usually deferred till the final revisionhas been completed  in dictating the middle years he used no notes and beyond an allusion or two in the unfinished volume itself there is no indication of the course which the book would have taken or the precise period it was intended to cover  percy lubbock     i   if the author of this meandering record has noted elsewhere1 that an event occurring early in 1870 was to mark the end of his youth he is moved here at once to qualify in one or two respects that emphasis everything depends in such a view on what one means by ones youthso shifting a consciousness is this and so related at the same time to many different matters we are never old that is we never cease easily to be young for all life at the same time youth is an army the whole battalion of our faculties and our freshnesses our passions and our illusions on a considerably reluctant march into the enemys country the country of the general lost freshness and i think it throws out at least as many stragglers behind as skirmishers aheadstragglers who often catch up but belatedly with the main body and even in many a case never catch up at all or under another figure it is a book in several volumes and even at this a mere instalment of the large library of life with a volume here and there closing as something in the clap of its covers may assure us while another remains either completely agape or kept open by a fond finger thrust in between the leaves a volume and a most substantial had felt its pages very gravely pressed together before the winters end that i have spoken of but a restriction may still bear and blessedly enough as i gather from memory on my sense of the whole year then terminateda year seen by me now in the light of agitations explorations initiations i scarce know how endearingly enough to name them which i should call fairly infantine in their indifference to proportions and aims had they not still more left with me effects and possessions that even yet lend themselves to estimation  1 notes of a son and brother 1914  it was at any rate impossible to have been younger in spite of whatever inevitable submissions to the rather violent push forward at certain particular points and on lines corresponding with them than i found myself from the first day of march 1869 in the face of an opportunity that affected me then and there as the happiest the most interesting the most alluring and beguiling that could ever have opened before a somewhat disabled young man who was about to complete his twentysixth year treasures of susceptibility treasures not only unconscious of the remotest approach to exhaustion but given the dazzling possibilities positively and ideally intact i now recognisei in fact long ago recognisedon the part of that intensely reacting small organism which couldnt have been in higher spirits or made more inward fuss about the matter if it had come into a property measured not by mere impressions and visions occasions for play of perception and imagination mind and soul but by dollars and shares lands and houses or flocks and herds it is to the account of that immense fantastication that i set down a state of mind so out of proportion to anything it could point to round about save by the vaguest of foolishlooking gestures and it would perhaps in truth be hard to say whether in the mixture of spirit and sense so determined the fact of innocence or that of intelligence most prevailed i like to recover this really prodigious flushas my reader clearly must perceive i do i like fairly to hang about a particular small hour of that momentous march daywhich i have glanced at too i believe on some other and less separated page than thisfor the sake of the extraordinary gage of experience that it seemed on the spot to offer and that i had but to take straight up my life on so complacently near a view as i now treat myself to having veritably consisted but in the prolongation of that act i took up the gage and as i look back the fullest as well as simplest account of the interval till now strikes me as being that i have never in common honour let it drop again and the small hour was just that of my having landed at liverpool in the gusty cloudy overwhelmingly english morning and pursued with immediate intensities of appreciation as i may call the muffled accompaniment for fear of almost indecently overnaming it a course which had seated me at a late breakfast in the coffeeroom of the old adelphi hotel radleys as i had to deplore its lately having ceased to be dubbed and handed me over without a scruple to my fate this doom of inordinate exposure to appearances aspects images every protrusive item almost in the great beheld sum of things i regard in other words as having settled upon me once for all while i observed for instance that in england the plate of buttered muffin and its cover were sacredly set upon the slopbowl after hot water had been ingenuously poured into the same and had seen that circumstance in a perfect cloud of accompaniments i must have had with my tea and my muffin a boiled egg or two and a dab of marmalade but it was from a far other store of condiments i most liberally helped myself i was lucidly aware of so gorgingesoterically as it were while i drew out the gustatory process and i must have said in that lost reference to this scene of my dedication which i mentioned above that i was again and again in the aftertime to win back the homeliest notes of the impression the damp and darksome light washed in from the steep black bricky street the crackle of the strong draught of the british seacoal fire much more confident of its function i thought than the fires i had left the rustle of the thick stiff loudly unfolded and refolded times the incomparable truth to type of the waiter truth to history to literature to poetry to dickens to thackeray positively to smollett and to hogarth to every connection that could help me to appropriate him and his setting an arrangement of things hanging together with a romantic rightness that had the force of a revelation  to what end appropriation became thus eager and romance thus easy one could have asked ones self only if the idea of connectibility as stretching away and away hadnt of a sudden taken on such a wealth of suggestion it represented at once a chain stretching off to heaven knew where but far into ones future at least ones possibilities of life and every link and pulse of which it was going accordingly to be indispensable besides being delightful and wonderful to recognise recognition i dare say was what remained through the adventure of the months to come the liveliest principle at work both as bearing on the already known on things unforgotten and of a sense intensely cultivated and cherished from my younger time and on the imagined the unimagined and the unimaginable a quantity that divided itself somehow into the double muster of its elements an endless vista or waiting array down the middle of which i should inconceivably passinconceivably save for being sure of some thrilled arrest some exchange of assurance and response at every step obviously half the charm as i can but thinly describe it of the substantially continuous experience the first passages of which i thus note was in the fact that immensely moved by it as i was and having so to deal with itin the anticipatory way or to the whatevers and wherevers and whenevers within me that should find it in orderi yet felt it in no degree as strange or obscure baffling or unrecognising on its own side everything was so far from impenetrable that my most general notion was the very ecstasy of understanding and that really wherever i looked and still more wherever i pressed i sank in and in up to my nose this in particular was of the perfect felicity that while the fact of difference all round me was immense the embarrassment of it was nilas if the getting into relation with the least waste had been prepared from so far back that a sort of divine economy now fairly ruled it was doubtless a part of the total fatuity and perhaps its sublimest mark that i knew what everything meant not simply then but for weeks and months after and was to know less only with increase of knowledge that must indeed have been of the essence of the general effect and the particular felicityonly not grotesque because for want of occasion not immediately exhibited a consciousness not other than that of a person abruptly introduced into a preoccupied and animated circle and yet so miraculously aware of the matters conversed about as to need no word of explanation before joining in to say of such a person that he hadnt lost time would i knew be feebly to express his advantage my likeness to him at any rate probably fell short of an absurd one through the chapter of accidents mostly of the happiest in their way too which restraining the personal impulse for me kept appearances and pretensions down the feast as it more and more opened out was all of the objective as we have learned so comfortably to say or at least of its convenient opposite only in so far as this undertook to interpret it for myself alone  to return at all across the years to the gates of the paradise of the first larger initiations is to be ever so tempted to pass them to push in again and breathe the air of this that and the other plot of rising ground particularly associated for memory and gratitude with the quickening process the trouble is that with these sacred spots to later appreciation the garden of youth is apt inordinately to bristle and that ones account of them has to shake them together fairly hard making a coherent thing of them to profit by the contribution of each in speaking of my earliest renewal of the vision of europe if i may give so grand a name to a scarce more than merely enlarged and uplifted gape i have i confess truly to jerk myself over the ground to wrench myself with violence from memories and images stages and phases and branching arms that catch and hold me as i pass them by such a matter as my recovery of contact with london for a few weeks the contact broken off some nine years before lays so many plausible traps for me that discretion half warns me to stand off the ground and walk round it altogether i stop my ears to the advice however under the pleading reminder that just those days began a business for me that was to go ever so much further than i then dreamed and planted a seed that was by my own measure singularly to sprout and flourishthe harvest of which i almost permit myself to believe has even yet not all been gathered i foresee moreover how little i shall be able to resist throughout these notes the force of persuasion expressed in the individual vivid image of the past wherever encountered these images having always such terms of their own such subtle secrets and insidious arts for keeping us in relation with them for bribing us by the beauty the authority the wonder of their saved intensity they have saved it they seem to say to us from such a welter of death and darkness and ruin that this alone makes a value and a light and a dignity for them something indeed of an argument that our story since we attempt to tell one has lapses and gaps without them not to be denied also over and above this is the downright pleasure of the illusion yet again created the apparent transfer from the past to the present of the particular combination of things that did at its hour ever so directly operate and that isnt after all then drained of virtue wholly wasted and lost for sensation for participation in the act of life in the attesting sights sounds smells the illusion as i say of the recording senses  what began during the springtime of my actual reference in a couple of dusky groundfloor rooms at number 7 halfmoon street was simply an establishment all in a few days of a personal relation with london that was not of course measurable at the momenti saw in my bedazzled state of comparative freedom too many other relations ahead a fairly intoxicated vision of choice and rangebut that none the less set going a more intimately inner consciousness a wheel within the wheels and led to my departing the actual the general incident closed in possession of a returnticket good as we say for a longer interval than i could then dream about and that the first really earnest fumble of after years brought surprisingly to light i think it must have been the very proportions themselves of the invitation and the interest that kept down under the immense impression everything in the nature of calculation and presumption dark huge and prodigious the other party to our relation londons and mine as i called it loomed and spreadmuch too mighty a goliath for the present in any conceivable ambition even of a fastgrowing david my earlier apprehension fed at the season as from a thousand outstretched silver spoonsfor these all shone to me with that effect of the handsomest hospitalitypiled up the monster to such a height that i could somehow only fear him as much as i admired and that his proportions in fact reached away quite beyond my expectation he was always the great figure of london and i was for no small time as the years followed to be kept at my awestruck distance for taking him on that sort of trust i had crept about his ankles i had glanced adventurously up at his knees and wasnt the moral for the most part the mere question of whether i should ever be big enough to so much as guess where he stopped  odd enough was it i make out that i was to feel no wonder of that kind or degree play in the coming time over such other social aspects such superficially more colourable scenes as i paid in repetition as frequent as possible my respects and my compliments to they might meet me with wreathed smiles and splendid promises and deep divinations of my own desire a thousand graces and gages in fine that i couldnt pretend to have picked up within the circle however experimentally widened of which halfmoon street was the centre and nothing therefore could have exceeded the splendour of these successive and multiplied assurances what it none the less infinitely beguiles me to recognise today is that such exhibitions for all their greater direct radiance and still more for all their general implication of a store of meaning and mystery and beauty that they alone from example to example from prodigy to prodigy had to open out left me comparatively little crushed by the impression of their concerning me further than my own action perhaps could make good it was as if i had seen that all there was for me of these great things i should sooner or later take the amount would be immense yet as who should say all on the same plane and the same connection the æsthetic the artistic the romantic in the looser sense or in other words in the air of the passions of the intelligence what other passions of a deeper strain whether personal or racial and thereby more superstitiously importunate i must have felt involved in the question of an effective experience of english life i was doubtless then altogether unprepared to say it probably came however i seem actually to make out very much to this particular perception exactly that any penetration of the london scene would be experience after a fashion that an exercise of ones mere intellectual curiosity wherever else wouldnt begin to represent glittering as the rewards to such curiosity amid alien peoples of genius might thoroughly appear on the other hand it was of course going to be nothing less than a superlative help that one would have but to reach out straight and in the full measure of ones passion for these rewards to find ones self carried all the way by ones active ones contemplative concern with themthis delightful affair fraught with increase of light of joy and wonder of possibilities of adventure for the mind in fine inevitably exhausting the relation     ii   let me not here withal appear to pretend to say how far i then foresaw myself likely to proceed as it were with the inimitable france and the incomparable italy my real point is altogether in the simple fact that they hovered before me even in their scrappy foretastes to a great effect of ease and inspiration whereas i shouldnt at all have resented the charge of fairly hiding behind the lowly door of mr lazarus foxso unmistakeably did it open into complications tremendous this excellent man my halfmoon street landlordi surrender i cant keep away from himfigures to me now as but one of the thousand forms of pressure in the collective assault but he couldnt have been more carefully chosen for his office had he consciously undertaken to express to me in a concentrated manner most of the things i was after the case was rather indeed perhaps that he himself by his own mere perfection put me up to much of what i should most confidently look for and that the right lines of observation and enjoyment of local and social contact as i may call it were most of all those that started out from him and came back to him it was as if nothing i saw could have done without him as if nothing he was could have done without everything else the very quarters i occupied under his protection happened for that matter to swarmas i estimated swarmingwith intensities of suggestionaware as i now encourage myself to become that the first note of the numberless reverberations i was to pick up in the aftertime had definitely been struck for me as under the wave of his conducting little wand he flourished it modestly enough ancient worthy of an immemorial order that he wasold pensioned servant of course of a cumberland as i believe family a kind slim celibate informing and informed member of which occupied his second floor apartments a friend indeed whom i had met on the very first occasion of my sallying forth from morleys hotel in trafalgar square to dine at a house of sustaining of inspiring hospitality in the kensington quarter succumbing thus to my tangle of memories from which i discern no escape i recognise further that if the endlessly befriending charles nortons introduced me to albert rutson and albert rutson introduced me to his feudal retainer so it was in no small degree through the confidence borrowed from the latters interest in the decent appearance i should make an interest of a consistency not to have been prefigured by any at all like instance in my past that i so far maintained my dizzy balance as to be able to ascend to the second floor under the thrill of sundry invitations to breakfast i dare say it is the invitations to breakfast that hold me at this moment by their spellso do they breathe to me across the age the note of a london world that we have left far behind in consequence of which i the more yearningly steal back to it as on sneaking tiptoe and shut myself up there without interference it is embalmed in disconnections in differences that i cultivate a free fancy for pronouncing advantageous to it sunk already was the shaft by which i should descend into the years and my inspiration is in touching as many as possible of the points of the other tradition retracing as many as possible of the features of the old face eventually to be blurred again even before my own eyes and with the materials for a portrait thereby accessible but to those who were present up to the time of the change  i dont pretend to date this change which still allows me to catch my younger observation and submission at play on the far side of it i make it fall into the right perspective however i think when i place it where i began to shudder before a confidence not to say an impudence of diminution in the aspects by which the british capital differed so from those of all the foreign together as to present throughout the straight contradiction to them that straight contradiction testifying invaluably at every turn had been from far back the thing romantically speaking to clutch and keep the clue and the logic of thanks to it the whole picture every element objects and figures background and actors nature and art hung consummately together appealing in their own light and under their own lawinteresting ever in every case by instituting comparisons sticking on the contrary to their true instinct and suggesting only contrast they were the opposite the assured the absolute the unashamed in respect to whatever might be of a generally similar intention elsewhere this was their dignity their beauty and their strengthto look back on which is to wonder if one didnt quite consciously tremble before the exhibition for any menaced or mitigated symptom in it i honestly think one did even in the first flushes of recognition more or less so tremble i remember at least that in spite of such disconcertments such dismays as certain of the most thoroughly victorian choses vues originally treated me to something yet deeper and finer than observation admonished me to like them just as they were or at least not too fatuously to dislikesince it somehow glimmered upon me that if they had lacked their oddity their monstrosity as it even might be their unabashed insular conformity other things that belong to them as they belong to these might have loomed less large and massed less thick which effect was wholly to be deprecated to catch that secret i make out the more i think of it was to have perhaps the smokiest but none the less the steadiest light to walk by the clue as i have called it was to be ones appreciation of an england that should turn its back directly enough and without fear of doing it too much on examples and ideas not strictly homebredsince she did her own sort of thing with such authority and was even then to be noted as sometimes trying other peoples with a kind of disaster not recorded at the worst among themselves  i must of course disavow pretending to have read this vivid philosophy into my most immediate impressions and i may in fact perhaps not claim to have been really aware of its seed till a considerable time had passed till apprehensions and reflections had taken place in quantity immeasurable quantity so to speak and a great stirup of the imagination been incurred undoubtedly is it in part the newthat is more strictly the elderacuteness that i touch all the prime profit with i didnt know at the time either how much appearances were all the while in the meltingpot or what wealth of reaction on them i was laying up i cherish for love of the unbroken interest all the same the theory of certain then positive and effective prefigurements because it leaves me thus free for remarking that i knew where i was as i may put it from the moment i saw the state of the london to come brought down with the weight of her abdication of her genius it not unnaturally may be said that it hasnt been till today that we see her genius in its fulnessthrowing up in a hundred lights matters we practically acknowledge such a plastic side as we had never dreamed she possessed the genius of accommodation is what we had last expected of heraccommodation to anything but her portentous self for in that connection she was ever remarkable and certainly the air of the generalised the emulous smart modern capital has come to be written upon her larger and larger even while we look  the unaccommodating and unaccommodated city remains none the less closely consecrated to ones fondest notion of herthe city too indifferent too proud too unaware too stupid even if one will to enter any lists that involved her moving from her base and that thereby when one approached her from the alien positive places i dont speak of the american in those days too negative to be related at all enjoyed the enormous pull for making her impression of ignoring everything but her own perversities and then of driving these home with an emphasis not to be gainsaid since she didnt emulate as i have termed it so she practised her own arts altogether and both these ways and these consequences were in the flattest opposition that was the happy point to foreign felicities or foreign standards so that the effect in every case was of the straightest reversal of themwith black for the foreign white and white for the foreign black wet for the foreign dry and dry for the foreign wet big for the foreign small and small for the foreign big i neednt extend the catalogue her idiosyncrasy was never in the least to have been inferred or presumed it could only in general make the outsider provisionally gape she sat thus imperturbable in her felicities and if that is how remounting the stream of time i like most to think of her this is because if her interest is still undeniableas that of overgrown things goesit has yet lost its fineness of quality phenomena may be interesting thank goodness without being phenomena of elegant expression or of any other form of restless smartness and when once type is strong when once it plays up from deep sources every show of its sincerity delivers us a message and we hang to real suspense on its continuance of energy on its again and yet again consistently acquitting itself so it keeps in tune and as the french adage says cest le ton qui fait la chanson the midvictorian london was sincerethat was a vast virtue and a vast appeal the contemporary is sceptical and most so when most plausible the turn of the tide could verily be fixed to an hourthe hour at which the new plausibility began to exceed the old sincerities by so much as a single sign they could truly have been arrayed face to face i think for an attentive eyeand i risk even saying that my own bent upon them as was to come to pass with a habit of anxiety that i should scarce be able to overstate had its unrecorded penetrations its alarms and recoveries even perhaps its very lapses of faith though always redeemed afresh by still fonder fanaticisms to a pitch that shall perhaps present itself when they expose it all the way as that of tiresome extravagance exposing it all the way is none the less i see exactly what i plot against itor otherwise expressed in favour of the fine truth of history so far as a throb of that awful pulse has been matter of ones own life in favour too of the mere returns derivable from more inordinate curiosity these notes would enjoy small selfrespect i think if that principle not to call it that passion didnt almost furiously ride them     iii   i was at any rate in the midst of sincerities enough sincerities of emphasis and composition perversities idiosyncrasies incalculabilities delightful all as densities at first insoluble delightful even indeed as so much mere bewilderment and shock when was the shock i ask myself as i look back not so deadened by the general atmospheric richness as not to melt more or less immediately into some succulence for the mind something that could feed the historic sense almost to sweetness i dont mean that it was a shock to be invited to breakfastthere were stronger ones than that but was in fact the trait de moeurs that disconnected me with most rapidity and intensity from all i had left on the other side of the sea to be so disconnected for the time and in the most insidious manner was above all what i had come out for and every appearance that might help it was to be artfully and gratefully cultivated i recollect well how many of these combined as i sat at quite punctual fried sole and marmalade in the comparatively disengaged sittingroom of the second floorthe occupancy of the first has remained vague to me disengaged from the mantle of gloom the folds of which draped most heavily the feet of the house as it were and thereby promoted in my own bower the chronic dusk favourable to mural decoration consisting mainly of framed and glazed coloured excisions from christmas numbers of the illustrated london news that had been at their hour quite modern miracles was it for that matter into a sudden splendour of the modern that i ascendingly emerged under the hospitality of my kind fellowtenant or was it rather into the fine classicism of a bygone age as literature and the arts had handed down that memory such were the questions whisked at every turn under my nose and reducing me by their obscure charm but to bewildered brooding i fear when i should have been myself to repay these attentions quite forward and informing and affirmative  there were eminent gentlemen as i was sure they could only be to meet and alas awfully to interrogate mefor vivid has remained to me as the best of my bewilderment the strangeness of finding that i could be of interest to them not indeed to call it rather the proved humiliation of my impotence my identity for myself was all in my sensibility to their own exhibition with not a scrap left over for a personal show which made it as inconvenient as it was queer that i should be treated as a specimen and have in the most unexpected manner to prove that i was a good one i knew myself the very worst conceivable but how to give to such other persons a decent or coherent reason for my being so required more presence of mind than i could in the least musterthe consequence of which failure had to be for me i fear under all that confused first flush rather an abject acceptance of the air of imbecility there were it appeared things of interest taking place in america and i had had in this absurd manner to come to england to learn it i had had over there on the ground itself no conception of any such matternothing of the smallest interest by any perception of mine as i suppose i should still blush to recall had taken place in america since the war how could anything i really wanted to askanything comparable that is to what was taking place under my eyes in halfmoon street and at dear softly presiding rutsons table of talk it doubtless essentially belonged to the exactly right type and tone and general figure of my fellowbreakfasters from the temple from the home office the foreign office the house of commons from goodness knew what other scarce discernible olympian altitudes it belonged to the very cut of their hair and their waistcoats and their whiskersfor it was still more or less a whiskered agethat they should desire from me much distinctness about general grants first cabinet upon the formation of which the light of the newspaper happened then to beat yet at the same time that i asked myself if it was to such cold communities such flat frustrations as were so proposed that i had sought to lift my head again in european air i found the crisis enriched by sundry other apprehensions  they melted together in it to that increase of savour i have already noted yet leaving me vividly admonished that the blankness of my mind as to the washington candidates relegated me to some class unencountered as yet by any one of my conversers a class only not perfectly ridiculous because perfectly insignificant also that politics walked abroad in england so that one might supremely bump against them as much as by my fond impression they took their exercise in america but through the back streets and the ways otherwise untrodden and the very darkness of night that further all lively attestations were ipso facto interesting and that finally and in the supreme degree the authenticity of whatever one was going to learn in the world would probably always have for its sign that one got it at some personal cost to this generalisation mightnt one even add that in proportion as the cost was great or became fairly excruciating the lesson the value acquired would probably be a thing to treasure i remember really going so far as to wonder if any act of acquisition of the lifeloving lifesearching sort that most appealed to me wouldnt mostly be fallacious if unaccompanied by that tag of the price paid in personal discomfort in some selfexposure and some none too impossible consequent discomfiture for the sake of it didnt i even on occasion mount to the very height of seeing it written that these bad moments were the downright consecration of knowledge that is of perception and essentially of exploration always dangerous and treacherous and so might afterwards come to figure to memory each in its order as the silver nail on the wall of the temple where the trophy is hung up all of which remark i freely grant is a great ado about the long since so bedimmed little halfmoon street breakfasts and is moreover quite wide of the mark if suggesting that the joys of recognition those of imaginatively of projectively fitting in and fitting out every piece in the puzzle and every recruit to the force of a further understanding werent in themselves a most bustling and cheering business  it was bustling at least assuredly if not quite always in the same degree exhilarating to breakfast out at all as distinguished from lunching without its being what the harvard scene made of it one of the incidents of boarding it was association at a jump with the ghosts of byron and sheridan and scott and moore and lockhart and rogers and tutti quantias well as the exciting note of a social order in which everyone wasnt hurled straight with the momentum of rising upon an office or a store the mere vision in numbers of persons embodying and in various ways sharply illustrating a clear alternative to that passivity told a tale that would be more and more worth the reading with every turn of the page so at all events i fantasticated while harassed by my necessity to weave into my general tapestry every thread that would conduce to a pattern and so the thread for instance of the great little difference of my literally never having but once at home been invited to breakfast on types as well as on toast and its accessories could suggest an effect of silk or silver when absolutely dangled before me that single occasion at home came back in a light that fairly brought tears to my eyes for it was touching now to the last wanness that the lady of the winter morn of the massachusetts sabbath one of those as i recover it of 1868 to reach whose board we had waded through snowdrifts had been herself fondling a reminiscence though i can scarce imagine supposing herself to offer for our consumption any other type than her own it was for that matter but the sweet staleness of her reminiscence that made her a type and i remember how it had had to do thereby all the work she of an age to reach so considerably back had breakfasted out in london and with mr rogers himselfthat was the point which i am bound to say did for the hour and on that spot supply richness of reference enough and i am caught up i find in the very act of this claim for my prior scantness of experience by a memory that makes it not a little less perfect and which is oddly enough again associated with a struggle on an empty stomach through the massed new england whiteness of the prime sunday hour i still cherish the vision which couldnt then have faded from me of my having during the age of innocencei mean of my ownbreakfasted with w d howells insidious disturber and fertiliser of that state in me to meet bayard taylor and arthur sedgwick all in the venetian manner the delightful venetian manner which toward the later sixties draped any motion on our hosts part as with a habit still appropriate he had risen that morning under the momentum of his but recently concluded consular term in venice where margin if only that of the great loungeable piazza had a breadth and though sedgwick and i had rather as it were to take the jump standing this was yet under the inspiration of feeling the case most special only it had been venetian snowshoes and all i had stored it sacredly away as not american at all and was of course to learn in halfmoon street how little it had been english either  what must have seemed to me of a fine international mixture during those weeks was my thrilling opportunity to sit one morning beside mrs charles nortons teaurn in queens gate terrace opposite to frederic harrison eminent to me at the moment as one of the subjects of matthew arnolds early fine banter one of his too confidently roaring young lions of the periodical press has any gilding ray since that happy season rested here and there with the sovereign charm of interest of drollery of felicity and infelicity taken on by scattered selected objects in that writers bright critical dawnan element in which we had the sense of sitting gratefully bathed so that we fairly took out our young minds and dabbled and soaked them in it as we were to do again in no other the beauty was thus at such a rate that people had references and that a reference was then to my mind whether in a person or an object the most glittering the most becoming ornament possible a style of decoration one seemed likely to perceive figures here and there whether animate or not quite groan under the accumulation and the weight of one had scarcely met it beforethat i now understood at the same time that there was perhaps a wan joy in ones never having missed it by all appearance having on the contrary ever instinctively caught it on the least glimmer of its presence even when present or what in the other time i had taken for present it had been of the thinnest whereas all about me hereafter it would be by all appearance almost glutinously thickto the point even of ones on occasion sticking fast in it that is finding intelligibility smothered in quantity i lost breath in fact no doubt again and again with this latter increase but was to go on and on for a long time before any first glimmer of reaction against so special a source of interest it attached itself to objects often i saw by no merit or virtueabove all repeatedly by no clevernessof their own but just by the luck of history by the action of multiplicity of circumstance condemned the human particle over here was to live on whatever terms in thicknessinstead of being free comparatively or as i at once ruefully and exquisitely found myself only to feel and to think in it ruefully because there were clearly a thousand contacts and sensations of the strong direct order that one lost by not so living exquisitely because of the equal number of immunities and independences blest independences of perception and judgment blest liberties of range for the intellectual adventure that accrued by the same stroke these at least had the advantage one of the most distinguished conceivable that when enjoyed with a certain intensity they might produce the illusion of the other intensity that of being involved in the composition and the picture itself in the situations the complications the circumstances admirable and dreadful while no corresponding illusion none making for the ideal play of reflection conclusion comparison however one should incline to appraise the luxury seemed likely to attend the immersed or engaged condition  whatever fatuity might at any rate have resided in these complacencies of view i made them my own with the best conscience in the world and i meet them again quite to extravagance of interest wherever on the whole extent of the scene my retrospect sets me down it wasnt in the least at the same time that encountered celebrities only thus provoked the shifting play of my small lamp and this too even though they were easily celebrated by my measure and though from the very first i owed an individual here and there among them as was highly proper the benefit of impression at the highest pitch on the great supporting and enclosing scene itself the big generalised picture painted in layer upon layer and tone upon tone ones fancy was all the while feeding objects and items illustrations and aspects might perpetually overlap or mutually interfere but never without leaving consistency the more marked and character the more unmistakeable the place the places bristled so for every glance with expressive particulars that i really conversed with them at happy moments more than with the figures that moved in them which affected me so often as but submissive articles of furniture put in by an artist duly careful of effect and yet duly respectful of proportion the great impression was doubtless no other then and there than what it is under every sky and before every scene that remind one afresh at the given moment of all the ways in which producing causes and produced creatures correspond and interdepend but i think i must have believed at that time that these cross references kept up their game in the english air with a frankness and a good faith that kept the process in all probability the most traceable of its kind on the globe  what was the secret of the force of that suggestionwhich was not i may say to be invalidated to my eyes by the further observation of cases and conditions was it that the enormous pull enjoyed at every point of the general surface the stoutness of the underlying belief in what was behind all surfacesso that the particular visible audible palpable fact however small and subsidiary was incomparably absolute or had so to speak such a conscience and a confidence such an absence of reserve and latent doubts about itself as was not elsewhere to be found didnt such elements as that represent in the heart of things possibilities of scepticism of mockery of irony of the return of the matter whatever it might be on itself by some play or other of the questioning spirit the spirit therefore weakening to entire comfort of affirmations didnt i see that humour itself which might seem elsewhere corrosive and subversive was as an english faculty turned outward altogether and never turned inwardby which convenient circumstance subversion or in other words alteration and variation were not promoted such truths were wondrous things to make out in such connections as my experience was then and for no small time after to be confined to but i positively catch myself listening to them even with my halfawakened ears as if they had been all so many sermons of the very stones of london there to come back to it was exactly the force with which these stones were to build me capaciously round i invited them i besought them to say all they would andto return to my figure of a while backit was soon so thoroughly as if they had understood that once having begun they were to keep year after year fairly chattering to me many of these pages i fondly foresee must consist but of the record of their chatter what was most of all happening i take it was that under an absurd special stress i was having as who should say to improvise a local medium and to arrange a local consciousness against my due appropriation of those originally closest at my hand inevitable accidents had conspiredand to conclude in respect to all this if a considerable time was to be wanted in the event for ideal certainty of adjustment half the terms required by this could then put forth the touching plea that they had quite achingly waited     iv   it may perhaps seem strange that the soil should have been watered by such an incident as mr lazarus foxs reply in the earliest rich dusk to my inquiry as to whither while i occupied his rooms i had best betake myself most regularly for my dinner well there is the bath hotel sir a very short walk away where i should think you would be very comfortable indeed mr soandso dines at his club sirbut there is also the albany in piccadilly to which i believe many gentlemen go i think i measured on the spot all that it took to make my friend most advisedlyfor it was clearly what he didsee me seated in lone state for my evening meal at the heavy mahogany of the stodgy little hotel that in those days and for long after occupied the northwest corner of arlington street and to which in common with many compatriots i repeatedly resorted during the years immediately following we suffered however on those occasions the unmitigated coffeeroom of mr foxs prescriptionit was part of a strange inevitability a concomitant of necessary shelter and we hadnt at least gone forth to invoke its austere charm i tried it in that singular way at the hour i speak ofand i well remember forecasting the interest of a social and moral order in which it could be supposed of me that having tried it once i should sublimely try it again my success in doing so would indeed have been sublime but a finer shade of the quality still attached somehow to my landlords confidence in it and this was one of the threads that as i have called them i was to tuck away for future pickingup again and unrolling i fell back on the albany which long ago passed away and which i seem to have brushed with a touch of reminiscence in some anticipation of the present indulgence that is itself quite ancient history it was a small eatinghouse of the very old english tradition as i then supposed at least just opposite the much greater establishment of the same name which latter it had borrowed and i remember wondering whether the tenants of the classic chambers the beadleguarded cluster of which was impressive even to the deprecated approach found their conception of the restaurantwe still pronounced it in the french mannermet by the small compartments narrow as horsestalls formed by the high straight backs of hard wooden benches and accommodating respectively two pairs of feeders who were thus so closely face to face as fairly to threaten with knife and fork each others more forward features  the scene was sordid the arrangements primitive the detail of the procedure as it struck me wellnigh of the rudest yet i remember rejoicing in it allas one indeed might perfectly rejoice in the juiciness of joints and the abundance of accessory pudding for i said to myself under every shock and at the hint of every savour that this was what it was for an exhibition to reek with local colour and one could dispense with a napkin with a crusty roll with room for ones elbows or ones feet with an immunity from intermittence of the plain boiled much better than one could dispense with that there were restaurants galore even at that time in new york and in boston but i had never before had to do with an eatinghouse and had not yet seen the little old english world of dickens let alone of the everhaunting hogarth of smollett and of boswell drenched with such a flood of light as one sat there one understood one drew out the severe séance not to stay the assault of precious conspiring truths not to break the current of inrushing telltale suggestion every face was a documentary scrap half a dozen broken words to piece with half a dozen others and so on and on every sound was strong whether rich and fine or only queer and coarse everything in this order drew a positive sweetness from never beingwhatever else it wasgracelessly flat the very rudeness was ripe the very commonness was consciousthat is not related to mere other forms of the same but to matters as different as possible into which it shaded off and off or up and up the image in fine was organic rounded and complete as definite as a dutch picture of low life hung on a museum wall low i say in respect to the life but that was the point for me that whereas the smartness and newness beyond the sea supposedly disavowed the low they did so but thinly and vainly falling markedly short of the high which the little boxed and boiled albany attained to some effect of after a fashion of its own just by having its so thoroughly appreciable notevalue in a scheme of manners it was imbedded so to speak in the scheme and it borrowed lights it borrowed even glooms from so much neighbouring distinction the places across the sea as they to my then eyes faintly afterglowed had no impinging borders but those of the desert to borrow from and if it be asked of me whether all the while i insist for demonstration of the complacency with which i desire to revert on not regretting the disappearance of such too long surviving sordidries as those i have evoked i can but answer that blind emotion in whichever sense directed has nothing to say to the question and that the sense of what we just could confidently live by at a given faraway hour is a simple stout fact of relief  relief again i say from the too enormous present accretions and alternativeswhich we witlessly thought so innumerable then which we artlessly found so much of the interest of in an immeasurable multiplicity and which i now feel myself thus grope for ghostly touch of in the name neither more nor less of poetic justice i wasnt doubtless at the time so very sure after all of the comparative felicity of our state that of the rare moment for the fond fancyi doubtless even a bit greedily missed certain quantities not to call them certain qualities here and there and the best of my actual purpose is to make amends for that blasphemy there isnt a thing i can imagine having missed that i dont quite ache to miss again and it remains at all events an odd stroke that having of old most felt the thrill of the place in its mighty muchness i have lived to adore it backward for its sweet simplicity i find myself in fact at the present writing only too sorry when not able to minimise conscientiously this that or the other of the old sources of impression the thing is indeed admirably possible in a general way though much of the exhibition was none the less undeniably was absolutely large how can i for instance recall the great cabrank mainly formed of delightful hansoms that stretched along piccadilly from the top of the green park unendingly down without having to take it for unsurpassably modern and majestic how can i thinki select my examples at hazardof the run of the more successful of mr robertsons comedies at the dear little old prince of waless theatre in tottenham court road as anything less than one of the wonders of our age how by the same token can i not lose myself still more in the glory of a time that was to watch the drawnout procession of henry irvings shakespearean splendours at the transcendent lyceum or how in the same general line not recognise that to live through the extravagant youth of the æsthetic era whether as embodied in the then apparently inexhaustible vein of the gilbert and sullivan operas or as more monotonously expressed in those last words of the raffiné that were chanted and crooned in the damaskhung temple of the grosvenor gallery was to seem privileged to such immensities as history would find left to her to record but with bated breath  these latter triumphs of taste however though lost in the abysm now had then a good many years to wait and i alight for illustrative support of my present mild thesis on the comparative humility say of the inward aspects in a large measure of the old national gallery where memory mixes for me together so many elements of the sense of an antique world the great element was of course that i wellnigh incredibly stood again in the immediate presence of titian and rembrandt of rubens and paul veronese and that the cup of sensation was thereby filled to overflowing but i look at it today as concomitantly warm and closedin and as who should say cosy that the ancient order and contracted state and thickcoloured dimness all unconscious of rearrangements and reversals blighting new lights and invidious shattering comparisons still prevailed and kept contemplation comfortably confused and serenely superstitious when not indeed at its sharpest moments quite fevered with incoherences the place looks to me across the half century richly dim yet at the same time both perversely plain and heavily violentviolent through indifference to the separations and selections that have become a tribute to modern nerves but i cherish exactly those facts of benightedness seeming as they do to have positively and blessedly conditioned the particular sweetness of wonder with which i haunted the family of darius the bacchus and ariadne or the socalled portrait of ariosto could one in those days feel anything with force whether for pleasure or for pain without feeling it as an immense little act or event of life and as therefore taking place on a scene and in circumstances scarce at all to be separated from its own sense and impactso that to recover it is to recover the whole medium the material pressure of things and find it most marked for preservation as an aspect even distinguishably a composition  what a composition for instance again i am capable at this hour of exclaiming the conditions of felicity in which i became aware one afternoon during a renewed gape before the bacchus and ariadne first that a little gentleman beside me and talking with the greatest vivacity to another gentleman was extremely remarkable second that he had the largest and most chevelu auburn head i had ever seen perched on a scarce perceptible body third that i held some scrap of a clue to his identity which couldnt fail to be eminent fourth that this tag of association was with nothing less than a small photograph sent me westward across the sea a few months before and fifth that the sitter for the photograph had been the author of atalanta in calydon and poems and ballads i thrilled it perfectly comes back to me with the prodigy of this circumstance that i should be admiring titian in the same breath with mr swinburnethat is in the same breath in which he admired titian and in which i also admired him the whole constituting on the spot between us for appreciation that is for mine a fact of intercourse such a fact as could stamp and colour the whole passage ineffaceably and this even though the more illustrious party to it had within the minute turned off and left me shaken i was shaken but i was satisfiedthat was the point i didnt ask more to interweave another touch in my pattern and as i once more gather in the impression i am struck with my having deserved truly as many of the like as possible i was welcome to them it may well be said on such easy termsand yet i ask myself whether after all it didnt take on my own part some doing as we nowadays say to make them so well worth having they themselves took i even at the time felt little enough trouble for it and the virtue of the business was repeatedly no doubt a good deal more in what i brought than in what i took  i apply this remark indeed to those extractions of the quintessence that had for their occasion either ones more undirected though never fruitless walks and wanderings or ones earnest ones positively pious approach to whatever consecrated ground or shrine of pilgrimage that might be at the moment in order there was not a regular prescribed sight that i during those weeks neglectedi remember haunting the museums in especial though the south kensington was then scarce more than embryonic with a sense of duty and of excitement that i was never again to know combined in equal measure i think and that it might really have taken some element of personal danger to account for there was the element in a manner to season the cup with sharpnessthe danger all the while that my freedom might be brief and my experience broken that i was under the menace of uncertainty and subject in fine to interruption the fact of having been so long gravely unwell sufficed by itself to keep apprehension alive it was our idea or at least quite intensely mine that what i was doing could i but put it through would be intimately good for meonly the putting it through was the difficulty and i sometimes faltered by the way this makes now for a general air on the part of all the objects of vision that i recover and almost as much in those of accidental encounter as in the breathlessly invoked of being looked at for the last time and giving out their message and story as with the still collected passion of an only chance this feeling about them not to say as i might have imputed it in them wonderfully helped as may be believed the extraction of quintessenceswhich sprang at me of themselves for that matter out of any appearance that confessed to the least value in the compound the least office in the harmony if the commonest streetvista was a fairly heartshaking contributive image if the incidents of the thick renascent light anywhere and the perpetual excitement of never knowing between it and the historic and determined gloom which was which and which one would most back for the general outcome and picture so the great soughtout compositions the hampton courts and the windsors the richmonds the dulwiches even the very hampstead heaths and putney commons to say nothing of the towers the temples the cathedrals and the strange penetrabilities of the city ranged themselves like the rows of great figures in a sum an amount immeasurably huge that one would draw on if not quite as long as one lived yet as soon as ever one should seriously get to work that to a tune of the most beautiful melancholyat least as i catch it again nowwas the way all values came out they were charged somehow with a useability the most immediate the most urgent and which i seemed to see would keep me restless till i should have done something of my very own with them  this was indeed perhaps what most painted them over with the admonitory appeal there were truly moments at which they seemed not to answer for it that i should get all the good of them and the finestwhat i was so extravagantly so fantastically afterunless i could somehow at once indite my sonnet and prove my title the difficulty was all in there being so much of themi might myself have been less restless if they could only have been less vivid this they absolutely declined at any moment and in any connection to be and it was ever so long till they abated a jot of the refusal thereby in consequence as may easily be judged they were to keep me in alarms to which my measures practically taken my catastrophes anxiously averted remained not quite proportionate i recall a most interesting young man who had been my shipmate on the homewardbound china shortly beforei could go at length into my reasons for having been so struck with him but i forbearwho on our talking to my intense trepidation of curiosity of where i might advisedly go in london let me know that he always went to craven street strand where bachelor lodgings were highly convenient and whence i in fact then saw them flush at me over the cold grey sea with an authenticity almost fierce i didnt in the event as has been seen go to craven street for rooms but i did go on the very first occasion for atmosphere neither more nor lessthe young man of the ship building so much better than he knew had guaranteed me such a rightness of that and it belongs to this reminiscence for the triviality of which i should apologize did i find myself at my present pitch capable of apologizing for anything that i had on the very spot there one of those hallucinations as to the precious effect dreadful to lose and yet impossible to render which interfused the æsthetic dream in presence of its subject with the mortal drop of despair as i should insist at least didnt the despair itself seem to have acted here as the preservative the precious effect in the case of craven street was that it absolutely reeked to my fond fancy with associations born of the particular ancient piety embodied in ones private altar to dickens and that this upstart little truth alone would revel in explanations that i should for the time have feverishly to forego the exquisite matter was not the identification with the scene of special shades or names it was just that the whole dickens procession marched up and down the whole dickens world looked out of its queer quite sinister windowsfor it was the socially sinister dickens i am afraid rather than the socially encouraging or confoundingly comic who still at that moment was most apt to meet me with his reasons such a reason was just that look of the inscrutable riverward street packed to blackness with accumulations of suffered experience these indescribably disavowed and confessed at one and the same time and with the fact of its blocked old thamesside termination a mere fact of more oppressive enclosure now telling all sorts of vague loose stories about it     v   why however should i pick up so small a crumb from that mere brief first course at a banquet of initiation which was in the event to prolong itself through years and yearsunless indeed as a scrap of a specimen chosen at hazard of the prompt activity of a process by which my intelligence afterwards came to find itself more fed i think than from any other source at all or for that matter from all other sources put together a hundred more suchlike modest memories breathe upon me each with its own dim little plea as i turn to face them but my idea is to deal somehow more conveniently with the whole gathered mass of my subsequent impressions in this order a fruitage that i feel to have been only too abundantly stored half a dozen of those of a larger and more immediate dignity incidents more particularly of the rather invidiously socalled social contact pull my sleeve as i pass but the long backwarddrawn train of the later life drags them along with it lost and smothered in its spreadonly one of them stands out or remains over insisting on its place and hour its felt distinguishability to this day i feel again that roused emotion my unsurpassably prized admission to the presence of the great george eliot whom i was taken to see by one of the kind dooropening norton ladies by whom mrs lewess guarded portal at north bank appeared especially penetrable on a sunday afternoon of april 69 later occasions after a considerable lapse were not to overlay the absolute facevalue as i may call it of all the appearances then and there presented mewhich were taken home by a young spirit almost abjectly grateful at any rate all devoutly prepared for them i find it idle even to wonder what place the author of silas marner and middlemarch may be conceived to have in the pride of our literatureso settled and consecrated in the individual range of view is many such a case free at last to find itself free after ups and downs after fluctuations of fame or whatever which have divested judgment of any relevance that isnt most of all the relevance of a living and recorded relation it has ceased then to know itself in any degree as an estimate has shaken off the anxieties of circumspection and comparison and just grown happy to act as an attachment pure and simple an effect of lifes own logic but in the ashes of which the wonted fires of youth need but to be blown upon for betrayal of a glow reflective appreciation may have originally been concerned whether at its most or at its least but it is well over to our infinite reliefyes to our immortal comfort i think the interval back cannot again be bridged we simply sit with our enjoyed gain our residual rounded possession in our lap a safe old treasure which has ceased to shrink if indeed also perhaps greatly to swell and all that further touches it is the fine vibration set up if the name we know it all by is called into questionperhaps however little  it was by george eliots name that i was to go on knowing was never to cease to know a great treasure of beauty and humanity of applied and achieved art a testimony historic as well as æsthetic to the deeper interest of the intricate english aspects and i now allow the vibration as i have called it all its playquite as if i had been wronged even by my own hesitation as to whether to pick up my anecdote that scruple wholly fades with the sense of how i must at the very time have foreseen that here was one of those associations that would determine in the far future an exquisite inability to revise it middlemarch had not then appearedwe of the faith were still to enjoy that saturation and felix holt the radical was upwards of three years old the impetus proceeding from this work however was still fresh enough in my pulses to have quickened the palpitation of my finding myself in presence i had rejoiced without reserve in felix holtthe illusion of reading which outstretched on my then too frequently inevitable bed at swampscott during a couple of very hot days of the summer of 1866 comes back to me followed by that in sooth of sitting up again at no great ease to indite with all promptness a review of the delightful thing the place of appearance of which nothing could now induce me to name shameless about the general fact as i may have been at the hour itself over such a feast of fine rich natural tone did i feel myself earnestly bend quite unforgettable to me the art and truth with which the note of this tone was struck in the beautiful prologue and the bygone appearances a hundred of the outward and visible signs of the authors own young rural and midmost england made to hold us by their harmony the book was not if i rightly remember altogether genially greeted but i was to hold fast to the charm i had thankfully suffered it i had been conscious of absolutely needing it to work  exquisite the remembrance of how it wouldnt have done for me at all in relation to other inward matters not to strain from the case the last drop of its happiest sense and i had even with the cooling of the first glow so little gone back upon it as we have nowadays learned to say had in fact so gone forward floated by its wave of superlative intended benignity that once in the cool quiet drawingroom at north bank i knew myself steeped in still deeper depths of the medium g h lewes was absent for the time on an urgent errand one of his sons on a visit at the house had been suddenly taken with a violent attack of pain the heritage of a bad accident not long before in the west indies a suffered onset from an angry bull i seem to recall who had tossed or otherwise mauled him and though beaten off left him considerably compromisedthese facts being promptly imparted to us in no small flutter by our distinguished lady who came in to us from another room where she had been with the hapless young man while his father appealed to the nearest good chemist for some known specific it infinitely moved me to see so great a celebrity quite humanly and familiarly agitatedeven with something clear and noble in it too to which as well as to the extraordinarily interesting dignity of her whole odd personal conformation i remember thinking her black silk dress and the lace mantilla attached to her head and keeping company on either side with the lowfalling thickness of her dark hair effectively contributed i have found myself my life long attaching value to every noted thing in respect to a great personand george eliot struck me on the spot as somehow illustratively great never at any rate has the impression of those troubled moments faded from me nor that at once of a certain high grace in her anxiety and a frank immediate appreciation of our presence modest embarrassed folk as we were it took me no long time to thrill with the sense sublime in its unexpectedness that we were perhaps or indeed quite clearly helping her to pass the time till mr lewess returnafter which he would again post off for mr paget the preeminent surgeon and i see involved with this the perfect amenity of her assisting us as it were to assist her through unrelinquished proper talk due responsible remark and report in the last degree suggestive to me on a short holiday taken with mr lewes in the south of france whence they had just returned yes indeed the lightest words of great persons are so little as any words of others are that i catch myself again inordinately struck with her dropping it offhand that the mistral scourge of their excursion had blown them into avignon where they had gone i think to see j s mill only to blow them straight out againthe figure put it so before us as well as with the moral interest the absence of the banal in their having on the whole scene found pleasure further poisoned by the frequency in all those parts of evil faces oh the evil faces that recorded source of suffering enormously affected mei felt it as beautifully characteristic i had never heard an impression de voyage so little tainted with the superficial or the vulgar i was myself at the time in the thick of impressions and it was true that they would have seemed to me rather to fail of life of their own doubtless inferior kind if submitting beyond a certain point to be touched with that sad or as who should say that grey colour mrs lewess were it appeared predominantly so touched and i could at once admire it in them and wonder if they didnt pay for this by some lack of intensity on other sides why i didnt more impute to her or to them that possible lack is more than i can say since under the law of moral earnestness the vulgar and the trivial would be then involved in the poor observations of my own makinga conclusion sufficiently depressing  however i didnt find myself depressed and i didnt find the great mind that was so good as to shine upon us at that awkward moment however dimly anything but augmented what was its sensibility to the evil faces but part of the large old tenderness which the occasion had caused to overflow and on which we were presently floated back into the room she had leftwhere we might perhaps beguile a little the impatience of the sufferer waiting for relief we ventured in our flutter to doubt whether we should beguile we held back with a certain delicacy from this irruption and if there was a momentary wonderful and beautiful conflict i remember how our yielding struck me as crowned with the finest grace it could possibly have that of the prodigious privilege of humouring yes literally humouring so renowned a spirit at a moment when we could really match our judgment with hers for the injured young man in the other and the larger room simply lay stretched on his back on the floor the posture apparently least painful to himthough painful enough at the best i easily saw on kneeling beside him after my first dismay to ask if i could in any way ease him i see his face again fair and young and flushed with its vague little smile and its moist brow i recover the moment or two during which we sought to make natural conversation in his presence and my question as to what conversation was natural and then as his fathers return still failed my having the inspiration that at once terminated the strain of the scene and yet prolonged the sublime connection mightnt i then hurry off for mr pageton whom as fast as a cab could carry me i would wait with the request that he would come at the first possible moment to the rescue mrs lewess and our stricken companions instant appreciation of this offer lent me wings on which i again feel myself borne very much as if suddenly acting as a messenger of the godssurely i had never come so near to performing in that character i shook off my fellow visitor for swifter cleaving of the air and i recall still feeling that i cleft it even in the dull fourwheeler of other days which on getting out of the house i recognised as the only object animating at a distance the long blank sunday vista beside the walledout regents park i crawled to hanover squareor was it cavendish i let the question standand after learning at the great mans door that though he was not at home he was soon expected back and would receive my message without delay cherished for the rest of the day the particular quality of my vibration  it was doubtless even excessive in proportion to its causeyet in what else but that consisted the force and the use of vibrations it was by their excess that one knew them for such as one for that matter only knew things in general worth knowing i didnt know what i had expected as an effect of our offered homage but i had somehow not at the best expected a relationand now a relation had been dramatically determined it would exist for me if i should never again in all the world ask a feathers weight of it for myself that is it would simply never be able not somehow to act its virtue was not in truth at all flagrantly to be put to the proofany opportunity for that underwent at the best a considerable lapse but why wasnt it intensely acting none the less during the time when before being in london again for any length of stay i found it intimately concerned in my perusal of middlemarch so soon then to appear and even in that of deronda its intervention on behalf of which defied any chill of time and to these references i can but subjoin that they obviously most illustrate the operation of a sense for drama the process of appropriation of the two fictions was experience in great intensity and roundabout the field was drawn the distinguishable ring of something that belonged equally to this condition and that embraced and further vivified the imaged mass playing in upon it lights of surpassing fineness so it was at any rate that my relationfor i didnt go so far as to call it ourshelped me to squeeze further values from the intrinsic substance of the copious final productions i have named a weight of variety dignity and beauty of which i have never allowed my measure to shrink  even this example of a rage for connections i may also remark doesnt deter me from the mention here somewhat out of its order of time of another of those in which my whole privilege of reference to mrs lewes such as it remained was to look to be preserved i stretch over the years a little to overtake it and it calls up at once another person the ornament or at least the diversion of a society long since extinct to me but who in common with every bearer of a name i yield to the temptation of writing insists on profiting promptly by the fact of inscriptionvery much as if first tricking me into it and then proving it upon me the extinct societies that once were so sure of themselves how can they not stir again if the right touch that of a hand they actually knew however little they may have happened to heed it reaches tenderly back to them the touch is the retrieval so far as it goes setting up as it does heaven knows what undefeated continuity i must have been present among the faithful at north bank during a sunday afternoon or two of the winter of 77 and 78i was to see the great lady alone but on a single occasion before her death but those attestations are all but lost to me now in the livelier pitch of a scene as i can only call it of which i feel myself again all amusedly rather as sacrificed witness i had driven over with mrs greville from milford cottage in surrey to the villa george eliot and george lewes had not long before built themselves and which they much inhabited at witleythis indeed i well remember in no great flush of assurance that my own measure of our intended felicity would be quite that of my buoyant hostess but here exactly comes with my memory of mrs greville from which numberless bymemories dangle the interesting question that makes for my recall why things happened under her muchwaved wing not in any too coherent fashionand this even though it was never once given her i surmise to guess that they anywhere fell short so gently used all round indeed was this large elegant extremely nearsighted and extremely demonstrative lady whose genius was all for friendship admiration declamation and expenditure that one doubted whether in the whole course of her career she had ever once been brought up as it were against a recognised reality other at least perhaps than the tiresome cost of the materially agreeable in life and the perverse appearance at times that though she said things otherwise recited choice morceaux whether french or english with a marked oddity of manner of attack a general incongruity of drawingroom art the various contributive elements hour scene persuaded patience and hushed attention were perforce a precarious quantity  it is in that bygone old grace of the unexploded factitious the air of a thousand dimmed illusions and more or less early victorian beatitudes on the part of the blandly idle and the supposedly accomplished that mrs greville with her exquisite goodnature and her innocent fatuity is embalmed for me so that she becomes in that light a truly shining specimen almost the image or compendium of a whole side of a social order just so she has happy suggestion just so whether or no by a twist of my mind toward the enviability of certain complacencies of faith and taste that we would yet neither live back into if we could nor can catch again if we would i see my forgotten friend of that moist autumn afternoon of our call and of another on the morrow which i shall not pass over as having rustled and gushed and protested and performed through her term under a kind of protection by the easygoing gods that is not of this fierce age amiabilities and absurdities harmless serenities and vanities pretensions and undertakings unashamed still profited by the mildness of the critical air and the benignity of the socialon the right side at least of the social line it had struck me from the first that nowhere so much as in england was it fortunate to be fortunate and that against that condition once it had somehow been handed down and determined a number of the sharp truths that one might privately apprehend beat themselves beautifully in vain i say beautifully for i confess without scruple to have found again and again at that time an attaching charm in the general exhibition of enjoyed immunity paid for as it was almost always by the personal amenity the practice of all sorts of pleasantness if it kept the gods themselves for the time in goodhumour one was willing enough or at least i was to be on the side of the gods unmistakable too as i seem to recover it was the positive interest of watching and noting roundabout one for the turn or rather for the blest continuity of their benevolence such an appeal proceeded in this that and the other particular case from the fools paradise really rounded and preserved before ones eyes for those who were so good as to animate it there was always the question of how long they would be left to and the growth of ones fine suspense not to say ones frank little gratitude as the miracle repeated itself  all of which i admit dresses in many reflections the small circumstance that milford cottage with its innumerable red candles and candleshades had affected me as the most embowered retreat for social innocence that it was possible to conceive and as absolutely settling the question of whether the practice of pleasantness mightnt quite ideally pay for the fantastic protectedness the red candles in the red shades have remained with me inexplicably as a vivid note of this pitch shedding their rosy light with the autumn gale the averted reality all shut out upon such felicities of feminine helplessness as i couldnt have prefigured in advance and as exemplified for further gathering in the possibilities of the old tone nowhere had the evening curtains seemed so drawn nowhere the copious service so soft nowhere the second volume of the new novel halfuncut so close to ones hand nowhere the exquisite head and incomparable brush of the domesticated collie such an attestation of that standard at least nowhere the harmonies of accidentof intention was more than one could sayso incapable of a wrong deflection that society would lack the highest finish without some such distributed clusters of the thoroughly gentle the mildly presumptuous and the inveterately mistaken was brought home to me there in fine to a tune with which i had no quarrel perverse enough as i had been from an early time to know but the impulse to egg on society to the fullest discharge of any material stirring within its breast and not making for cruelty or brutality mere baseness or mere stupidity that would fall into a picture or a scene the quality of serene anxiety on the part for instance of exquisite mrs thellusson mrs grevilles mother was by itself a plea for any privilege one should fancy her perched upon and i scarce know if this be more or be less true because the anxietyat least as i culled its fragrancewas all about the most secondary and superfluous small matters alone it struck me i remember as a new and unexpected form of the pathetic altogether and there was no form of the pathetic any more than of the tragic or the comic that didnt serve as another pearl for ones lengthening string and i pass over what was doubtless the happiest stroke in the composition the fact of its involving as alldistinguished husband of the other daughter an illustrious soldier and servant of his sovereign of his sovereigns that were successively to be than against whose patient handsome bearded presence the whole complexus of femininities and futilities couldnt have been left in more tolerated and more contrasted relief pass it over to remind myself of how in my particular friend of the three the comic and the tragic were presented in a confusion that made the least intended of them at any moment take effectively the place of the most the impression that is was never that of the sentiment operatingsave indeed perhaps when the dear lady applied her faculty for frank imitation of the ridiculous which she then quite directly and remarkably achieved but that she could be comic that she was comic was what least appeased her unrest and there were reasons enough in a word why her failure of the grand manner or the penetrating note should evoke the idea of their opposites perfectly achieved she sat alike in adoration and emulation at the feet of my admirable old friend fanny kemble the goodnature of whose consent to hear her was equalled only by the immediately consequent action of the splendidly corrective spring on the part of that unsurpassed subject of the dramatic afflatus fairly or as i should perhaps above all say contradictiously provoked then aspirant and auditor rash adventurer and shy alarmist were swept away together in the gust of magnificent rightness and beauty no scrap of the farscattered prime proposal being left to pick up  which detail of reminiscence has again stayed my course to the witley villa when even on the way i quaked a little with my sense of what generally most awaited or overtook my companions prime proposals what had come most to characterise the leweses to my apprehension was that there couldnt be a thing in the world about which they werent and on the most conceded and assured grounds almost scientifically particular which presumption however only added to the relevance of ones learning how such a matter as their relation with mrs greville could in accordance with noble consistencies be carried on i could trust her for it perfectly as she knew no law but that of innocent and exquisite aberration never wanting and never less than consecrating and i fear i but took refuge for the rest in declining all responsibility i remember trying to say to myself that even such as we were our visit couldnt but scatter a little the weight of cloud on the olympus we scaledgiven the dreadful drenching afternoon we were after all an imaginable short solace there and this indeed would have borne me through to the end save for an incident which with a quite ideal logic left our adventure an approved ruin i see again our bland benign commiserating hostess beside the fire in a chill desert of a room where the master of the house guarded the opposite hearthstone and i catch once more the impression of no occurrence of anything at all appreciable but their liking us to have come with our terribly trivial contribution mainly from a prevision of how they should more devoutly like it when we departed it is remarkable but the occasion yields me no single echo of a remark on the part of any of usnothing more than the sense that our great author herself peculiarly suffered from the fury of the elements and that they had about them rather the minimum of the paraphernalia of reading and writing not to speak of that of tea a conceivable feature of the hour but which was not provided for again i felt touched with privilege but not as in 69 with a form of it redeemed from barrenness by a motion of my own and the taste of barrenness was in fact in my mouth under the effect of our taking leave we did so with considerable flourish till we had passed out to the hall again indeed to the door of the waiting carriage toward which g h lewes himself all sociably then above all conversingly wafted usyet staying me by a sudden remembrance before i had entered the brougham and signing me to wait while he repaired his omission i returned to the doorstep whence i still see him reissue from the room we had just left and hurry toward me across the hall shaking high the pair of bluebound volumes his allusion to the uninvited the verily importunate loan of which by mrs greville had lingered on the air after his dash in quest of them ah those bookstake them away please away away i hear him unreservedly plead while he thrusts them again at me and i scurry back into our conveyance where and where only settled afresh with my companion i venture to assure myself of the horrid truth that had squinted at me as i relieved our good friend of his superfluity what indeed was this superfluity but the two volumes of my own precious lastwe were still in the blest age of volumespresented by its author to the lady of milford cottage and by her misguided votary dropped with the best conscience in the world into the witley abyss out of which it had jumped with violence under the touch of accident straight up again into my own exposed face  the bruise inflicted there i remember feeling for the moment only as sharp such a mixture of delightful small questions at once salved it over and such a charm in particular for me to my recognising that this particular wronginflicted all unawares which exactly made it sublimewas the only rightness of our visit our hosts hadnt so much as connected book with author or author with visitor or visitor with anything but the convenience of his ridding them of an unconsidered trifle grudging as they so justifiedly did the impingement of such matters on their consciousness the vivid demonstration of ones failure to penetrate there had been in the sweep of lewess gesture which could scarce have been bettered by his actually wielding a broom i think nothing passed between us in the brougham on revelation of the identity of the offered treat so emphatically declinedi see that i couldnt have laughed at it to the confusion of my gentle neighbour but i quite recall my grasp of the interest of our distinguished friends inaccessibility to the unattended plea with the light it seemed to throw on what it was really to be attended never never save as attendedby presumptions that is far other than any then hanging about onewould one so much as desire not to be pushed out of sight i neednt attempt however to supply all the links in the chain of association which led to my finally just qualified beatitude i had been served right enough in all conscience but the pity was that mrs greville had been this i never wanted for her and i may add in the connection that i discover now no grain of false humility in my having enjoyed in my own person adorning such a tale there was positively a fine high thrill in thinking of personsor at least of a person for any fact about lewes was but derivativeengaged in my own pursuit and yet detached by what i conceived detached by a pitch of intellectual life from all that made it actual to myself there was the lift of contemplation there the inspiring image and the big supporting truth the pitch of intellectual life in the very fact of which we seemed my hostess and i to have caught our celebrities sitting in that queer bleak way wouldnt have bullied me in the least if it hadnt been the centre of such a circle of gorgeous creation it was the fashion among the profane in short either to misdoubt before george eliots canvas the latters backing of rich thought or else to hold that this matter of philosophy and even if but of the philosophic vocabulary thrust itself through to the confounding of the picture but with that thin criticism i wasnt as i have already intimated to have a moments patience i was to become i was to remaini take pleasure in repeatingeven a very derondist of derondists for my own wanton joy which amounts to saying that i found the figured coloured tapestry always vivid enough to brave no matter what complication of the stitch     vi   i take courage to confess moreover that i am carried further still by the current on which mrs greville friend of the supereminent happens to have launched me for i can neither forbear a glance at one or two of the other adventures promoted by her nor in the least dissociate her from that long aftertaste of them such as they were which i have positively cultivated i ask myself first however whether or no our drive to aldworth on the noble height of blackdown had been preceded by the couple of occasions in london on which i was to feel i saw the laureate most at his ease yet on reflection concluding that the first of theseand the fewest days must have separated themformed my prime introduction to the poet i had earliest known and best loved the revelational evening i speak of is peopled to my memory not a little yet with a confusedness out of which tennysons own presence doesnt at all distinctly emerge he was occupying a house in eaton place as appeared then his wont for the earlier weeks of the spring and i seem to recover that i had gone on to it after dining somewhere else under protection of my supremely kind old friend the late lord houghton to whom i was indebted in those years for a most promiscuous befriending he must have been of the party and mrs greville quite independently must since i catch again the vision of her so expansively and voluminously seated that she might fairly have been couchant so to say for the proposed characteristic actthere was a deliberation about it that precluded the idea of a spring that namely of addressing something of the laureates very own to the laureates very face beyond the sense that he took these things with a gruff philosophyand could always repay them on the spot in heavilyshovelled coin of the same mint since it was a question of his geniusi gather in again no determined impression unless it may have been as could only be probable the effect of fond prefigurements utterly blighted  the fond prefigurements of youthful piety are predestined more often than not i think experience interfering to strange and violent shocks from which no general appeal is conceivable save by the prompt preclusion either of faith or of knowledge a sad choice at the best no other such illustration recurs to me of the possible refusal of those two conditions of an acquaintance to recognise each other at a given hour as the silent crash of which i was to be conscious several years later in paris when placed in presence of m ernest renan from the surpassing distinction of whose literary face with its exquisite finish of every feature i had from far back extracted every sort of shining gage a presumption general and positive widely enough to sink all interestthat was the dreadful thingopened there the chasm between the implied as i had taken it and the attested as i had at the first blush to take it so that one was in fact scarce to know what might have happened if interest hadnt by good fortune already reached such a compass as to stick half way down the descent what interest can survive becomes thus surely as much one of the lessons of life as the number of ways in which it remains impossible what comes up in face of the shocks as i have called them is the question of a shift of every supposition a change of base under fire as it were which must take place successfully if ones advance be not abandoned altogether i remember that i saw the tennyson directly presented as just utterly other than the tennyson indirectly and if the readjustment for acquaintance was less difficult than it was to prove in the case of the realised renan the obligation to accept the differencewholly as difference and without reference to strict loss or gainwas like a rap on the knuckles of a sweet superstition fine fine fine could he only befine in the sense of that quality in the texture of his verse which had appealed all along by its most inward principle to ones taste and had by the same stroke shown with what a force of lyric energy and sincerity the kind of beauty so engaged for could be associated was it that i had preconceived him in that light as pale and penetrating as emphasising in every aspect the fact that he was fastidious was it that i had supposed him more fastidious than really could have beenat the best for that effect was it that the grace of the man couldnt by my measure but march somehow with the grace of the poet given a perfection of this grace was it in fine that style of a particular kind when so highly developed seemed logically to leave no room for other quite contradictious kinds these were considerations of which i recall the pressure at the same time that i fear i have no account of them to give after they have fairly faced the full the monstrous demonstration that tennyson was not tennysonian the desperate sequel to that was that he thereby changed ones own state too ones beguiled ones æsthetic for what could this strange apprehension do but reduce the tennysonian amount altogether it dried up to a certain extent that is in my own vessel of sympathyleaving me so to ask whether it was before or after that i should take myself for the bigger fool there had been folly somewhere yet let me add that once i recognised this once i felt the old fond pitch drop of itself not alone inevitably but very soon quite conveniently and while i magnanimously granted that the error had been mine and nobodys else at all an odd prosaic pleasantness set itself straight up substitutionally over the whole ground which it swept clear of every single premeditated effect it made ones perceptive condition purely profane reduced it somehow to having rather the excess of awkwardness than the excess of felicity to reckon with yet still again as i say enabled a compromise to work  the compromise in fact worked beautifully under my renewal of impressionfor which a second visit at eaton place offered occasion and this even though i had to interweave with the scene as best i might a highly complicating influence to speak of james russell lowells influence as above all complicating on any scene to the interest of which he contributed may superficially seem a perverse appreciation of it and yet in the light of that truth only do i recover the full sense of his value his interest the moving moral of his london adventureto find myself already bumping so straight against which gives me i confess a sufficiently portentous shake he comes in as it were by a force not to be denied as soon as i look at him againas soon as i find him for instance on the doorstep in eaton place at the hour of my too approaching it for luncheon as he had just done there he is with the whole question of him at once before me and literally superimposed by that fact on any minor essence i quake positively with the apprehension of the commemorative dance he may lead me but for the moment just here i steady myself with an effort and go in with him to his having the laureates personal acquaintance by every symptom and rather to my surprise all to make mrs tennysons luncheon table was an open feast with places for possible when not assured guests and no one but the american minister scarce more than just installed and his extremely attached compatriot sat down at first with our gracious hostess the board considerably stretched and after it had been indicated to lowell that he had best sit at the end near the window where the bard would presently join him i remained near our hostess separated from him for some little time by an unpeopled waste hallam came in all genially and auspiciously yet only to brush us with his blessing and say he was lunching elsewhere and my wonder meanwhile hung about the representative of my country who though partaking of offered food appeared doomed to disconnection from us i may say at once that my wonder was always unable not to hang about this admired and cherished friend when other persons especially of the eminent order were concerned in the scene the case was quite other for the unshared relation or when it was shared by one or other of three or four of our common friends who had the gift of determining happily the pitch of ease suspense not to say anxiety as to the possible turn or drift of the affair quite droppedi rested then we alike rested i ever felt in a golden confidence this last was so definitely not the note of my attention to him so far as i might indulge it in the wider social world that i shall not scruple occasion offering to inquire into the reasons of the difference for i can only see the ghosts of my friends by this token as my j r l and whoever which means that my imagination of the wanton life of which these remarks pretend but to form the record had appropriated them under the prime contactfrom the moment the prime contact had successfully workedonce for all and contributed the light in which they were constantly exposed  yes delightful i shall undertake finding it and perhaps even making it to read j r ls exposure back into its light which i in fact see begin to shine for me more amply during those very minutes of our wait for our distinguished host and even the several that followed the latters arrival and his seating himself opposite the unknown guest whose identity he had failed to grasp nothing exactly could have made dear lowell more my lowell as i have presumed to figure him than the stretch of uncertainty so supervening and which in its form of silence at first completely unbroken between the two poets rapidly took on for me monstrous proportions i conversed with my gentle neighbour during what seemed an eternityreally but hearing as the minutes sped all that tennyson didnt say to lowell and all that lowell wouldnt on any such compulsion as that say to tennyson i like however to hang again upon the hushfor the sweetness of the relief of its break by the fine tennysonian growl i had never dreamed no of a growling tennysoni had too utterly otherwise fantasticated but no line of locksley hall rolled out as i was to happen soon after to hear it could have been sweeter than the interrogative sound of do you know anything about lowell launched on the chance across the table and crowned at once by mrs tennysons anxious quaver why my dear this is mr lowell the clearance took place successfully enough and the incident i am quite aware seems to shrink with it in spite of which i still cherish the reduced reminiscence for its connections so far as my vision of lowell was concerned they began at that moment so to multiply a belated guest or two more came in and i wish i could for my modestys sake refer to this circumstance alone the fact that nothing more of the occasion survives for me save the intense but restricted glow of certain instants in another room to which we had adjourned for smoking and where my alarmed sense of the bards restriction to giving what he had as a bard only became under a single turn of his hand a vision of quite general munificence incredibly inconceivably he had readand not only read but admired and not only admired but understandingly referred referred time and some accident aiding the appreciated object a short tale i had lately put forth to its actually present author who could scarce believe his ears on hearing the thing superlatively commended pronounced that is by the illustrious speaker more to his taste than no matter what other like attempt nothing would induce me to disclose the title of the piece which has little to do with the matter my point is but in its having on the spot been matter of pure romance to me that i was there and positively so addressed for it was a solution the happiest in the world and from which i at once extracted enormities of pleasure my relation to whatever had bewildered me simply became perfect the author of in memoriam had liked my own twenty pages and his doing so was a gage of his grace in which i felt i should rest foreverin which i have in fact rested to this hour my own basis of likingsuch a blessed supersession of all worryings and wonderingswas accordingly established and has met every demand made of it  greatest was to have been i dare say the demand to which i felt it exposed by the drive over to aldworth with mrs greville which i noted above and which took place if i am not mistaken on the morrow of our drive to witley a different shade of confidence and comfort i make out accompanied this experiment i believed more for reasons i shall not now attempt to recover in the furthermost maintenance of our flying bridge the final piers of which it was indubitable had at witley given way what could have been moreover less like g h lewess valedictory hurl back upon us of the printed appeal in which i was primarily concerned than that so recent and so directly opposed passage of the eaton place smokingroom thanks to which i could nurse a certified security all along the road i surrendered to security i perhaps even grossly took my ease in it and i was to breathe from beginning to end of our visit which began with our sitting again at luncheon an airso unlike that of witleyin which it seemed to me frankly that nothing but the blest obvious or at least the blest outright could so much as attempt to live these elements hung sociably and all auspiciously about usit was a large and simple and almost empty occasion yet empty without embarrassment rather as from a certain high guardedness or defensiveness of situation literally indeed from the material the local sublimity the fact of our all upliftedly hanging together over one of the grandest sweeps of view in england remembered passages again people however in their proportion the excess of opportunity each with that conclusive note of the outright all unadorned what could have partaken more of this quality for instance than the question i was startled to hear launched before we had left the table by the chance of mrs grevilles having happened to mention in some connection one of her french relatives mademoiselle laure de sade it had fallen on my own earthe mention at least hadwith a certain effect of unconscious provocation but this was as nothing to its effect on the ear of our host de sade he at once exclaimed with interestand with the consequence i may frankly add of my wondering almost to ecstasy that is to the ecstasy of curiosity to what length he would proceed he proceeded admirablyadmirably for the triumph of simplificationto the very greatest length imaginable as was signally promoted by the fact that clearly no one present with a single exception recognised the name or the nature of the scandalous the long ignored the at last all but unnameable author least of all the gentle relative of mademoiselle laure who listened with the blankest grace to her friends enumeration of his titles to infamy among which that of his most notorious work was pronounced it was the homeliest frankest most domestic passage as who should say and most remarkable for leaving none of us save myself by my impression in the least embarrassed or bewildered largely i think because of the failurea failure the most charmingly flatof all measure on the part of auditors and speaker alike of what might be intended or understood of what in fine the latter was talking about  he struck me in truth as neither knowing nor communicating knowledge and i recall how i felt this note in his own case to belong to that general intimation with which the whole air was charged of the want of proportion between the great spaces and reaches and echoes commanded the great eminence attained and the quantity and variety of experience supposable so to discriminate was in a manner to put ones hand on the key and thereby to find ones self in presence of a rare and anomalous but still scarcely the less beautiful fact the assured and achieved conditions the serenity the security the success to put it vulgarly shone in the light of their easiest lawthat by which they emerge early from the complication of life the great adventure of sensibility and find themselves determined once for all fortunately fixed all consecrated and consecrating if i should speak of this impression as that of glory without history that of the poetic character more worn than paid for or at least more saved than spent i should doubtless much overemphasise but such or something like it was none the less the explanation that met ones own fond fancy of the scene after one had cast about for it for i allow myself thus to repeat that i was so moved to cast about and perhaps at no moment more than during the friendly analysis of the reputation of m de sade was i not present at some undreamedof demonstration of the absence of the remoter real the real other than immediate and exquisite other than guaranteed and enclosed in landscape friendship fame above all in consciousness of awaited and admired and selfconsistent inspiration  the question was indeed to be effectively answered for me and everything meanwhile continued to play into this previsioneven to the pleasant growling note heard behind me as the bard followed with mrs greville who had permitted herself apparently some mild extravagance of homage oh yes you may do what you likeso long as you dont kiss me before the cabman the allusion was explained for us if i remembera matter of some more or less recent leavetaking of admirer and admired in london on his putting her down at her door after being taken to the play or wherever between the rugged humour of which reference and the other just commemorated there wasnt a pin to choose it struck me for a certain oldtime lincolnshire ease or comfortable stayathome license but it was later on when my introductress having accompanied us i sat upstairs with him in his study that he might read to us some poem of his own that we should venture to propose it was then that mystifications dropped that everything in the least dislocated fell into its place and that image and picture stamped themselves strongly and finally or to the point even as i recover it of leaving me almost too little to wonder about he had not got a third of the way through locksley hall which my choice given me i had made bold to suggest he should spoutfor i had already heard him spout in eaton placebefore i had begun to wonder that i didnt wonder didnt at least wonder more consumedly as a very little while back i should have made sure of my doing on any such prodigious occasion i sat at one of the windows that hung over space noting how the windy watery autumn day sometimes sheeting it all with rain called up the dreary dreary moorland or the long dun wolds i pinched myself for the determination of my identity and hung on the readers deepvoiced chant for the credibility of his i asked myself in fine why in complete deviation from everything that would have seemed from far back certain for the case i failed to swoon away under the heaviest pressure i had doubtless ever known the romantic situation bring to bear so lucidly all the while i considered so detachedly i judged so dissentingly to tell the whole truth i listened pinching myself as i say not at all to keep from swooning but much rather to set up some rush of sensibility it was all interesting it was at least all odd but why in the name of poetic justice had one anciently heaved and flushed with ones own recital of the splendid stuff if one was now only to sigh in secret oh dear oh dear the author lowered the whole pitch that of expression that of interpretation above all i heard him in cool surprise take even more out of his verse than he had put in and so bring me back to the point i had immediately and privately made the point that he wasnt tennysonian i felt him as he went on and on lose that character beyond repair and no effect of the organroll of monotonous majesty no suggestion of the long echo availed at all to save it what the case came to for me i take itand by the case i mean the intellectual the artisticwas that it lacked the intelligence the play of discrimination i should have taken for granted in it and thereby brooding monster that i was born to discriminate à tout propos lacked the interest  detached i have mentioned that i had become and it was doubtless at such a rate high time for that though i hasten to repeat that with the close of the incident i was happily able to feel a new sense in the whole connection established my critical reaction hadnt in the least invalidated our great mans being a bardit had in fact made him and left him more a bard than ever it had only settled to my perception as not before what a bard might and mightnt be the character was just a rigid idiosyncrasy to which everything in the man conformed but which supplied nothing outside of itself and which above all was not intellectually wasteful or heterogeneous conscious as it could only be of its intrinsic breadth and weight on two or three occasions of the aftertime i was to hear browning read out certain of his finest pages and this exactly with all the exhibition of point and authority the expressive particularisation so to speak that i had missed on the part of the laureate an observation through which the author of men and women appeared in spite of the beauty and force of his demonstration as little as possible a bard he particularised if ever a man did was heterogeneous and profane composed of pieces and patches that betrayed some creak of joints and addicted to the excursions from which these were brought home so that he had to prove himself a poet almost against all presumptions and with all the assurance and all the character he could use was not this last in especial the character so close to the surface with which browning fairly bristled what was most to come out in his personal delivery of the fruit of his genius it came out almost to harshness but the result was that what he read showed extraordinary life during that audition at aldworth the question seemed on the contrary not of life at allsave that is of ones own which was exactly not the question with all the resonance of the chant the whole thing was yet still with all the long swing of its motion it yet remained where it washeaving doubtless grandly enough up and down and beautiful to watch as through the superposed veils of its long selfconsciousness by all of which i dont mean to say that i was not on the day at aldworth thoroughly reconciled to learning what a bard consisted of for that came as soon as i had swallowed my own mistakethe mistake of having supposed tennyson something subtly other than one i had supposed probably such an impossibility had to repeat my term so absurdly fantasticated that the long journey round and about the truth no more than served me right just as after all it at last left me quite content     vii   it left me moreover i become awareor at least it now leaves mefingering the loose ends of this particular free stretch of my tapestry so that with my perhaps even extravagant aversion to loose ends i can but try for a moment to interweave them there dangles again for me least confusedly i think the vision of a dinner at mrs grevillesand i like even to remember that cadogan place where memories hang thick for me was the scene of itwhich took its light from the presence of louisa lady waterford who took hers in turn from that combination of rare beauty with rare talent which the previous victorian age had for many years not ceased to acclaim it insists on coming back to me with the utmost vividness that lady waterford was illustrational historically preciously so meeting ones largest demand for the blest recovery when possible of some glimmer of the sense of personal beauty to say nothing of personal accomplishment as our fathers were appointed to enjoy it scarce to be sated that form of wonder to my own imagination i confessso that i fairly believe there was no moment at which i wouldnt have been ready to turn my back for the time even on the most triumphant actuality of form and feature if a chance apprehension of a like force as it played on the sensibility of the past had competed and this for a reason i fear i can scarce explainunless when i come to consider it by the perversity of a conviction that the conditions of beauty have improved though those of character in the fine old sense may not and that with these the measure of it is more just the appreciation as who should say more competent and the effect more completely attained  what the question seems thus to come to would be a consuming curiosity as to any cited old case of the spell in the very interest of ones catching it comparatively out in the interest positively of the likelihood of ones doing so and this in the face of so many great testifying portraits my private perversity as i here glance at it has had its difficultiesmost of all possibly that of ones addiction in growing older to allowing a supreme force to ones earlier even ones earliest estimates of physical felicity or in other words that of the felt impulse to leave the palm for good looks to those who have reached out to it through the medium of our own history if the conditions grow better for them why then should we have almost the habit of thinking better of our handsome folk dead than of our livingand even to the very point of not resenting on the part of others similarly affected the wail of wonder as to what has strangely become of the happy types dantan i dodge that inquiry just nowwe may meet it again noting simply the fact that old pretenders to the particular crown i speak ofand in the sense especially of the pretension made rather for than by themoffered to my eyes a greater interest than the new whom i was ready enough to take for granted as one for the most part easily could belonging as it exactly did on the other hand to the interest of their elders that this couldnt be so taken that was just the attraction of the latter claimthat the grounds of it had to be made out puzzled out verily on occasion but that when they were recognised they had a force all their own one would have liked to be able to clear the distinction between the new and the old of all ambiguityexplain that is how little the superficially invidious term was sometimes noted as having in common with the elderly so much was it a clear light held up to the question that truly beautiful persons might be old without being elderly their juniors couldnt be new unfortunately without being youthfulunfortunately because the fact of youth so far from dispelling ambiguity positively introduced it one made up ones mind thus that the only sure specimens were and had to be those acquainted with time and with whom time on its side was acquainted those in fine who had borne the test and still looked at it face to face these were of ones own period of courseone looked at them face to face one blessedly hadnt to consider them by hearsay or to refer to any portrait of them for proof indeed in presence of the resisting the gained cases one found ones self practically averse to old facts or old traditions of portraiture accompanied by no matter what names  all of which leads by an avenue i trust not unduly majestic up to that hour of contemplation during which i could see quite enough for the major interest what was meant by lady waterfords great reputation nothing could in fact have been more informing than so to see what was meant than so copiously to share with admirers who had had their vision and passed on for if i spoke above of her image as illustrational this is because it affected me on the spot as so diffusing information my impression was of course but the old storyto which my reader will feel himself treated i fear to satiety when once i had drawn the curtain for the light shed by this or that or the other personal presence upon the society more or less intimately concerned in producing it the last thing i could think of was to darken the scene again for this right or this wrong reason then mrs grevilles admirable guest struck me as flooding it indebted in the highest degree to every art by which a commended appearance may have formed the habit of still suggesting commendation she certainlyto my imagination at leasttriumphed over time in the sense that if the years in their generosity went on helping her to live her grace returned the favour by paying life back to them i mean that she reanimated for the fond analyst the age in which persons of her type could so greatly flourishit being ever so pertinently of her type or at least of that of the age that she was regarded as having cast the spell of genius as well as of beauty she painted and on the largest scale with all confidence and facility and nothing could have contributed more by my sense to what i glance at again as her illustrational value than the apparently widespread appreciation of this facttaken together that is with ones own impression of the work of her hand there it was that like mrs greville herself yet in a still higher degree she bore witness to the fine old felicity of the fortunate and the great under the old order which would have made it so good then to live could one but have been in their shoes she determined in me i remember a renewed perception of the old order a renewed insistence on ones having come just in time to see it begin to stretch back a little earlier one wouldnt have had the light for this perhaps and a little later it would have receded too much  the precious persons the surviving figures who held up as i may call it the light were still here and there to be met my sense being that the last of them at least for any vision of mine has now quite gone and that illustrationnot to let that term slipaccordingly fails we all now illustrate together in higgledypiggledy fashion or as a vast monotonous mob our own wonderful period and order and nothing else whereby the historic imagination under its acuter need of facing backward gropes before it with a vain gesture missing or all but missing the concrete other always other specimen which has volumes to give where hearsay has only snippets the old as we call it i recognise doesnt disappear all at once the ancien régime of our commonest reference survived the revolution of our most horrific in patches and scraps and i bring myself to say that even at my present writing i am aware of more than one individual on the scene about me touched comparatively with the elder grace i think of the difference between these persons and so nearly all other persons as a grace for reasons that become perfectly clear in the immediate presence of the former but of which a generalising account is difficult none the less it used to be one of the finest of pleasures to acclaim and cherish in case of meeting them one and another of the complete examples of the conditions irrecoverable even if as i have already noted they were themselves least intelligently conscious of these and for the enjoyment of that critical emotion to draw ones own wanton line between the past and the present the happy effect of such apparitions as lady waterford to whom i thus undisseverably cling though i might give her after all much like company was that they made one draw it just where they might most profit from it they profited in that they recruited my group of the fatuously fortunate the class as i seemed to see it that had had the longest and happiest innings in historyhappier and longer on the whole even than their congeners of the old french timeand for whom the future wasnt going to be by most signs anything like as bland and benedictory as the past they placed themselves in the right perspective for appreciation and did it quite without knowing which was half the interest did it simply by showing themselves with all the right grace and the right assurance it was as if they had come up to the very edge of the ground that was going to begin to fail them yet looking over it looking on and on always with a confidence still unalarmed one would have turned away certainly from the sight of any actual catastrophe

delightful agreement on the subject stop and never again should a noble lady be lifted so still further aloft on the ecstatic breath of connoisseurship  this last consciousness confirming my impression of a climax that could only decline didnt break upon me all at once but spread itself through a couple of subsequent occasions into which my remembrance of the dinner at mrs grevilles was richly to play the first of these was a visit to an exhibition of lady waterfords paintings held in carlton house terrace under the roof of a friend of the artist and as it enriched the hour also to be able to feel a friend one of the most generously gracious of my own during which the reflection that they had indeed had their innings and were still splendidly using for the purpose the very fagend of the waning time mixed itself for me with all the wonderful colour framed and arrayed that blazed from the walls of the kindly great room lent for the advantage of a charity and lost itself in the general chorus of immense comparison and tender consecration later on a few days spent at a house of the greatest beauty and interest in northumberland did wonders to round off my view the place occupied for the time by genial tenants belonged to the family of lady waterfords husband and fairly bristled it might be said with coloured designs from her brush
