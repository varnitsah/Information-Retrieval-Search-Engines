80644374	mrs korner sins her mercies   by jerome k jerome    i do mean it declared mrs korner i like a man to be a man  but you would not like christopheri mean mr kornerto be that sort of man suggested her bosom friend  i dont mean that i should like it if he did it often but i should like to feel that he was able to be that sort of manhave you told your master that breakfast is ready demanded mrs korner of the domestic staff entering at the moment with three boiled eggs and a teapot  yus ive told im replied the staff indignantly  the domestic staff at acacia villa ravenscourt park lived in a state of indignation it could be heard of mornings and evenings saying its prayers indignantly  what did he say  said e11 be down the moment es dressed  nobody wants him to come before commented mrs korner answered me that he was putting on his collar when i called up to him five minutes ago  answer yer the same thing now if yer called up to im agen i spect was the opinion of the staff was on is ands and knees when i looked in scooping round under the bed for is collar stud  mrs korner paused with the teapot in her hand was he talking  talkin nobody there to talk to i adnt got no time to stop and chatter  i mean to himself explained mrs korner hehe wasnt swearing there was a note of eagerness almost of hope in mrs korners voice  swearin e why e dont know any  thank you said mrs korner that will do harriet you may go  mrs korner put down the teapot with a bang the very girl said mrs korner bitterly the very girl despises him  perhaps suggested miss greene he had been swearing and had finished  but mrs korner was not to be comforted finished any other man would have been swearing all the time  perhaps suggested the kindly bosom friend ever the one to plead the cause of the transgressor perhaps he was swearing and she did not hear him you see if he had his head well underneath the bed  the door opened  sorry i am late said mr korner bursting cheerfully into the room it was a point with mr korner always to be cheerful in the morning greet the day with a smile and it will leave you with a blessing was the motto mrs korner this day a married woman of six months and three weeks standing had heard her husband murmur before getting out of bed on precisely two hundred and two occasions the motto entered largely into the scheme of mr korners life written in fine copperplate upon cards all of the same size a choice selection counselled him each morning from the rim of his shavingglass  did you find it asked mrs korner  it is most extraordinary replied mr korner as he seated himself at the breakfasttable i saw it go under the bed with my own eyes perhaps  dont ask me to look for it interrupted mrs korner crawling about on their hands and knees knocking their heads against iron bedsteads would be enough to make some people swear the emphasis was on the some  it is not bad training for the character hinted mr korner occasionally to force oneself to perform patiently tasks calculated  if you get tied up in one of those long sentences of yours you will never get out in time to eat your breakfast was the fear of mrs korner  i should be sorry for anything to happen to it remarked mr korner its intrinsic value may perhaps  i will look for it after breakfast volunteered the amiable miss greene i am good at finding things  i can well believe it the gallant mr korner assured her as with the handle of his spoon he peeled his egg from such bright eyes as yours few  youve only got ten minutes his wife reminded him do get on with your breakfast  i should like said mr korner to finish a speech occasionally  you never would asserted mrs korner  i should like to try sighed mr korner one of these days  how did you sleep dear i forgot to ask you questioned mrs korner of the bosom friend  i am always restless in a strange bed the first night explained miss greene i daresay too i was a little excited  i could have wished said mr korner it had been a better example of the delightful art of the dramatist when one goes but seldom to the theatre  one wants to enjoy oneself interrupted mrs korner  i really do not think said the bosom friend that i have ever laughed so much in all my life  it was amusing i laughed myself admitted mr korner at the same time i cannot help thinking that to treat drunkenness as a theme  he wasnt drunk argued mrs korner he was just jovial  my dear mr korner corrected her he simply couldnt stand  he was much more amusing than some people who can retorted mrs korner  it is possible my dear aimee her husband pointed out to her for a man to be amusing without being drunk also for a man to be drunk without  oh a man is all the better declared mrs korner for letting himself go occasionally  my dear  you christopher would be all the better for letting yourself gooccasionally  i wish said mr korner as he passed his empty cup you would not say things you do not mean anyone hearing you  if theres one thing makes me more angry than another said mrs korner it is being told i say things that i do not mean  why say them then suggested mr korner  i dont i doi mean i do mean them explained mrs korner  you can hardly mean my dear persisted her husband that you really think i should be all the better for getting drunkeven occasionally  i didnt say drunk i said going it  but i do go it in moderation pleaded mr korner moderation in all things that is my motto  i know it returned mrs korner  a little of everything and nothing this time mr korner interrupted himself i fear said mr korner rising we must postpone the further discussion of this interesting topic if you would not mind stepping out with me into the passage dear there are one or two little matters connected with the house  host and hostess squeezed past the visitor and closed the door behind them the visitor continued eating  i do mean it repeated mrs korner for the third time reseating herself a minute later at the table i would give anythinganything reiterated the lady recklessly to see christopher more like the ordinary sort of man  but he has always been the sortthe sort of man he is her bosom friend reminded her  oh during the engagement of course one expects a man to be perfect i didnt think he was going to keep it up  he seems to me said miss greene a dear good fellow you are one of those people who never know when they are well off  i know he is a good fellow agreed mrs korner and i am very fond of him it is just because i am fond of him that i hate feeling ashamed of him i want him to be a manly man to do the things that other men do  do all the ordinary sort of men swear and get occasionally drunk  of course they do asserted mrs korner in a tone of authority one does not want a man to be a milksop  have you ever seen a drunken man inquired the bosom friend who was nibbling sugar  heaps replied mrs korner who was sucking marmalade off her fingers  by which mrs korner meant that some half a dozen times in her life she had visited the play choosing by preference the lighter form of british drama the first time she witnessed the real thing which happened just precisely a month later long after the conversation here recorded had been forgotten by the parties most concerned no one could have been more utterly astonished than was mrs korner  how it came about mr korner was never able to fully satisfy himself mr korner was not the type that serves the purpose of the temperance lecturer his first glass he had drunk more years ago than he could recollect and since had tasted the varied contents of many others but never before had mr korner exceeded nor been tempted to exceed the limits of his favourite virtue moderation  we had one bottle of claret between us mr korner would often recall to his mind of which he drank the greater part and then he brought out the little green flask he said it was made from pearsthat in peru they kept it specially for childrens parties of course that may have been his joke but in any case i cannot see how just one glassi wonder could i have taken more than one glass while he was talking it was a point that worried mr korner  the he who had talked possibly to such bad effect was a distant cousin of mr korners one bill damon chief mate of the steamship la fortuna until their chance meeting that afternoon in leadenhall street they had not seen each other since they were boys together the fortuna was leaving st katherines docks early the next morning bound for south america and it might be years before they met again as mr damon pointed out fate by thus throwing them into each others arms clearly intended they should have a cosy dinner together that very evening in the captains cabin of the fortuna  mr korner returning to the office despatched to ravenscourt park an express letter announcing the strange news that he might not be home that evening much before ten and at halfpast six for the first time since his marriage directed his steps away from home and mrs korner  the two friends talked of many things and later on they spoke of sweethearts and of wives mate damons experiences had apparently been wide and varied they talkedor rather the mate talked and mr korner listenedof the olivetinted beauties of the spanish main of the darkeyed passionate creoles of the blond junos of the californian valleys the mate had theories concerning the care and management of women theories that if the mates word could be relied upon had stood the test of studied application a new world opened out to mr korner a world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who though loving them in return knew how to be their masters mr korner warmed gradually from cold disapproval to bubbling appreciation sat entranced time alone set a limit to the recital of the mates adventures at eleven oclock the cook reminded them that the captain and the pilot might be aboard at any moment mr korner surprised at the lateness of the hour took a long and tender farewell of his cousin and found st katherines docks one of the most bewildering places out of which he had ever tried to escape under a lamppost in the minories it suddenly occurred to mr korner that he was an unappreciated man mrs korner never said and did the sort of things by means of which the beauties of the southern main endeavoured feebly to express their consuming passion for gentlemen superior in no wayas far as he could seeto mr korner himself thinking over the sort of things mrs korner did say and did do tears sprung into mr korners eyes noticing that a policeman was eyeing him with curiosity he dashed them aside and hurried on pacing the platform of the mansion house station where it is always draughty the thought of his wrongs returned to him with renewed force why was there no trace of doglike devotion about mrs korner the faultso he bitterly told himselfthe fault was his a woman loves her master it is her instinct mused mr korner to himself damme thought mr korner i dont believe that half her time she knows i am her master  go away said mr korner to a youth of pasty appearance who with open mouth had stopped immediately in front of him  im fond o listening explained the pasty youth  whos talking demanded mr korner  you are replied the pasty youth  it is a long journey from the city to ravenscourt park but the task of planning out the future life of mrs korner and himself kept mr korner wide awake and interested when he got out of the train the thing chiefly troubling him was the threequarters of a mile of muddy road stretching between him and his determination to make things clear to mrs korner then and there  the sight of acacia villa suggesting that everybody was in bed and asleep served to further irritate him a doglike wife would have been sitting up to see if there was anything he wanted mr korner acting on the advice of his own brass plate not only knocked but also rang as the door did not immediately fly open he continued to knock and ring the window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened  is that you said the voice of mrs korner there was as it happened a distinct suggestion of passion in mrs korners voice but not of the passion mr korner was wishful to inspire it made him a little more angry than he was before  dont you talk to me with your head out of the window as if this were a gallanty show you come down and open the door commanded mr korner  havent you got your latchkey demanded mrs korner  for answer mr korner attacked the door again the window closed the next moment but six or seven the door was opened with such suddenness that mr korner still gripping the knocker was borne inward in a flying attitude mrs korner had descended the stairs ready with a few remarks she had not anticipated that mr korner usually slow of speech could be even readier  wheres my supper indignantly demanded mr korner still supported by the knocker  mrs korner too astonished for words simply stared  wheres my supper repeated mr korner by this time worked up into genuine astonishment that it was not ready for him whats everybody mean going off to bed when the masterororous hasnt had his supper  is anything the matter dear was heard the voice of miss greene speaking from the neighbourhood of the first landing  come in christopher pleaded mrs korner please come in and let me shut the door  mrs korner was the type of young lady fond of domineering with a not ungraceful hauteur over those accustomed to yield readily to her it is a type that is easily frightened  i wan grilled kinneysontoast explained mr korner exchanging the knocker for the hatstand and wishing the next moment that he had not don lets avareytalk about it unnerstan i dowan any talk about it  what on earth am i to do whispered the terrified mrs korner to her bosom friend there isnt a kidney in the house  i should poach him a couple of eggs suggested the helpful bosom friend put plenty of cayenne pepper on them very likely he wont remember  mr korner allowed himself to be persuaded into the diningroom which was also the breakfast parlour and the library the two ladies joined by the hastily clad staff whose chronic indignation seemed to have vanished in face of the first excuse for it that acacia villa had afforded her made haste to light the kitchen fire  i should never have believed it whispered the whitefaced mrs korner never  makes yer know theres a man about the ouse dont it chirped the delighted staff mrs korner for answer boxed the girls ears it relieved her feelings to a slight extent  the staff retained its equanimity but the operations of mrs korner and her bosom friend were retarded rather than assisted by the voice of mr korner heard every quarter of a minute roaring out fresh directions  i dare not go in alone said mrs korner when all things were in order on the tray so the bosom friend followed her and the staff brought up the rear  whats this frowned mr korner i told you chops  im so sorry dear faltered mrs korner but there werent any in the house  in a perfectly organizedouse such as for the future i meanterave continued mr korner helping himself to beer there should always be chopanteak unnerstanme chopanteak  ill try and remember dear said mrs korner  pearsterme said mr korner between mouthfuls youre norrer sort of housekeeper i want  ill try to be dear pleaded mrs korner  wheres your books mr korner suddenly demanded  my books repeated mrs korner in astonishment  mr korner struck the corner of the table with his fist which made most things in the room including mrs korner jump  dont you defy me my girl said mr korner you know whatermean your housekeepin books  they happened to be in the drawer of the chiffonier mrs korner produced them and passed them to her husband with a trembling hand mr korner opening one by hazard bent over it with knitted brows  pearsterme my girl you cant add said mr korner  ii was always considered rather good at arithmetic as a girl stammered mrs korner  what you mayabeen as a girl and whattwennerseven and nine fiercely questioned mr korner  thirtyeightseven commenced to blunder the terrified mrs korner  know your nine tables or dont you thundered mr korner  i used to sobbed mrs korner  say it commanded mr korner  nine times one are nine sobbed the poor little woman nine times two  goron said mr korner sternly  she went on steadily in a low monotone broken by stifled sobs the dreary rhythm of the repetition may possibly have assisted as she mentioned fearfully that nine times eleven were ninetynine miss greene pointed stealthily toward the table mrs korner glancing up fearfully saw that the eyes of her lord and master were closed heard the rising snore that issued from his head resting between the empty beerjug and the cruet stand  he will be all right counselled miss greene you go to bed and lock yourself in harriet and i will see to his breakfast in the morning it will be just as well for you to be out of the way  and mrs korner only too thankful for some one to tell her what to do obeyed in all things  toward seven oclock the sunlight streaming into the room caused mr korner first to blink then yawn then open half an eye  greet the day with a smile murmured mr korner sleepily and it will  mr korner sat up suddenly and looked about him this was not bed the fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet to the tablecloth an overturned cruetstand mingled with egg gave colour a tingling sensation about his head called for investigation mr korner was forced to the conclusion that somebody had been trying to make a salad of himsomebody with an exceptionally heavy hand for mustard a sound directed mr korners attention to the door  the face of miss greene portentously grave was peeping through the jar  mr korner rose miss greene entered stealthily and closing the door stood with her back against it  i suppose you know whatwhat youve done suggested miss greene  she spoke in a sepulchral tone it chilled poor mr korner to the bone  it is beginning to come back to me but notnot very clearly admitted mr korner  you came home drunkvery drunk miss greene informed him at two oclock in the morning the noise you made must have awakened half the street  a groan escaped from his parched lips  you insisted upon aimee cooking you a hot supper  i insisted mr korner glanced down upon the table andand she did it  you were very violent explained miss greene we were terrified at you all three of us regarding the pathetic object in front of her miss greene found it difficult to recollect that a few hours before she really had been frightened of it sense of duty alone restrained her present inclination to laugh  while you sat there eating your supper continued miss greene remorselessly you made her bring you her books  mr korner had passed the stage when anything could astonish him  you lectured her about her housekeeping there was a twinkle in the eye of mrs korners bosom friend but lightning could have flashed before mr korners eyes without his noticing it just then  you told her that she could not add and you made her say her tables  i made her mr korner spoke in the emotionless tones of one merely desiring information i made aimee say her tables  her nine times nodded miss greene  mr korner sat down upon his chair and stared with stony eyes into the future  whats to be done said mr korner shell never forgive me i know her you are not chaffing me he cried with a momentary gleam of hope i really did it  you sat in that very chair where you are sitting now and ate poached eggs while she stood opposite to you and said her nine times table at the end of it seeing you had gone to sleep yourself i persuaded her to go to bed it was three oclock and we thought you would not mind miss greene drew up a chair and with her elbows on the table looked across at mr korner decidedly there was a twinkle in the eyes of mrs korners bosom friend  youll never do it again suggested miss greene  do you think it possible cried mr korner that she may forgive me  no i dont replied miss greene at which mr korners face fell back to zero i think the best way out will be for you to forgive her  the idea did not even amuse him miss greene glanced round to satisfy herself that the door was still closed and listened a moment to assure herself of the silence  dont you remember miss greene took the extra precaution to whisper it the talk we had at breakfasttime the first morning of my visit when aimee said you would be all the better for going it occasionally  yes slowly it came back to mr korner but she only said going it mr korner recollected to his dismay  well youve been going it persisted miss greene besides she did not mean going it she meant the real thing only she did not like to say the word we talked about it after you had gone she said she would give anything to see you more like the ordinary man and that is her idea of the ordinary man  mr korners sluggishness of comprehension irritated miss greene she leaned across the table and shook him dont you understand you have done it on purpose to teach her a lesson it is she who has got to ask you to forgive her  you think  i think if you manage it properly it will be the best days work you have ever done get out of the house before she wakes i shall say nothing to her indeed i shall not have the time i must catch the ten oclock from paddington when you come home this evening you talk first thats what youve got to do and mr korner in his excitement kissed the bosom friend before he knew what he had done  mrs korner sat waiting for her husband that evening in the drawingroom she was dressed as for a journey and about the corners of her mouth were lines familiar to christopher the sight of which sent his heart into his boots fortunately he recovered himself in time to greet her with a smile it was not the smile he had been rehearsing half the day but that it was a smile of any sort astonished the words away from mrs korners lips and gave him the inestimable advantage of first speech  well said mr korner cheerily and how did you like it  for the moment mrs korner feared her husbands new complaint had already reached the chronic stage but his still smiling face reassured herto that extent at all events  when would you like me to go it again oh come continued mr korner in response to his wifes bewilderment you surely have not forgotten the talk we had at breakfasttimethe first morning of mildreds visit you hinted how much more attractive i should be for occasionally letting myself go  mr korner watching intently perceived that upon mrs korner recollection was slowly forcing itself  i was unable to oblige you before explained mr korner having to keep my head clear for business and not knowing what the effect upon one might be yesterday i did my best and i hope you are pleased with me though if you could see your way to being contentjust for the present and until i get more used to itwith a similar performance not oftener than once a fortnight say i should be grateful added mr korner  you mean said mrs korner rising  i mean my dear said mr korner that almost from the day of our marriage you have made it clear that you regard me as a milksop you have got your notion of men from silly books and sillier plays and your trouble is that i am not like them well ive shown you that if you insist upon it i can be like them  but you werent argued mrs korner not a bit like them  i did my best repeated mr korner we are not all made alike that was my drunk  i didnt say drunk  but you meant it interrupted mr korner we were talking about drunken men the man in the play was drunk you thought him amusing  he was amusing persisted mrs korner now in tears i meant that sort of drunk  his wife mr korner reminded her didnt find him amusing in the third act she was threatening to return home to her mother which if i may judge from finding you here with all your clothes on is also the idea that has occurred to you  but youyou were so awful whimpered mrs korner  what did i do questioned mr korner  you came hammering at the door  yes yes i remember that i wanted my supper and you poached me a couple of eggs what happened after that  the recollection of that crowning indignity lent to her voice the true note of tragedy  you made me say my tablesmy nine times  mr korner looked at mrs korner and mrs korner looked at mr korner and for a while there was silence  were youwere you really a little bit on faltered mrs korner or only pretending  really confessed mr korner for the first time in my life if you are content for the last time also  i am sorry said mrs korner i have been very silly please forgive me
