22081309	the haunted hotel  a mystery of modern venice   by  wilkie collins 18241889    after the edition of chatto  windus london 1879     the first part     chapter i   in the year 1860 the reputation of doctor wybrow as a london physician reached its highest point it was reported on good authority that he was in receipt of one of the largest incomes derived from the practice of medicine in modern times  one afternoon towards the close of the london season the doctor had just taken his luncheon after a specially hard mornings work in his consultingroom and with a formidable list of visits to patients at their own houses to fill up the rest of his daywhen the servant announced that a lady wished to speak to him  who is she the doctor asked a stranger  yes sir  i see no strangers out of consultinghours tell her what the hours are and send her away  i have told her sir  well  and she wont go  wont go the doctor smiled as he repeated the words he was a humourist in his way and there was an absurd side to the situation which rather amused him has this obstinate lady given you her name he inquired  no sir she refused to give any nameshe said she wouldnt keep you five minutes and the matter was too important to wait till tomorrow there she is in the consultingroom and how to get her out again is more than i know  doctor wybrow considered for a moment his knowledge of women professionally speaking rested on the ripe experience of more than thirty years he had met with them in all their varietiesespecially the variety which knows nothing of the value of time and never hesitates at sheltering itself behind the privileges of its sex a glance at his watch informed him that he must soon begin his rounds among the patients who were waiting for him at their own houses he decided forthwith on taking the only wise course that was open under the circumstances in other words he decided on taking to flight  is the carriage at the door he asked  yes sir  very well open the housedoor for me without making any noise and leave the lady in undisturbed possession of the consultingroom when she gets tired of waiting you know what to tell her if she asks when i am expected to return say that i dine at my club and spend the evening at the theatre now then softly thomas if your shoes creak i am a lost man  he noiselessly led the way into the hall followed by the servant on tiptoe  did the lady in the consultingroom suspect him or did thomass shoes creak and was her sense of hearing unusually keen whatever the explanation may be the event that actually happened was beyond all doubt exactly as doctor wybrow passed his consultingroom the door openedthe lady appeared on the thresholdand laid her hand on his arm  i entreat you sir not to go away without letting me speak to you first  the accent was foreign the tone was low and firm her fingers closed gently and yet resolutely on the doctors arm  neither her language nor her action had the slightest effect in inclining him to grant her request the influence that instantly stopped him on the way to his carriage was the silent influence of her face the startling contrast between the corpselike pallor of her complexion and the overpowering life and light the glittering metallic brightness in her large black eyes held him literally spellbound she was dressed in dark colours with perfect taste she was of middle height and apparently of middle agesay a year or two over thirty her lower featuresthe nose mouth and chinpossessed the fineness and delicacy of form which is oftener seen among women of foreign races than among women of english birth she was unquestionably a handsome personwith the one serious drawback of her ghastly complexion and with the less noticeable defect of a total want of tenderness in the expression of her eyes apart from his first emotion of surprise the feeling she produced in the doctor may be described as an overpowering feeling of professional curiosity the case might prove to be something entirely new in his professional experience it looks like it he thought and its worth waiting for  she perceived that she had produced a strong impression of some kind upon him and dropped her hold on his arm  you have comforted many miserable women in your time she said comfort one more today  without waiting to be answered she led the way back into the room  the doctor followed her and closed the door he placed her in the patients chair opposite the windows even in london the sun on that summer afternoon was dazzlingly bright the radiant light flowed in on her her eyes met it unflinchingly with the steely steadiness of the eyes of an eagle the smooth pallor of her unwrinkled skin looked more fearfully white than ever for the first time for many a long year past the doctor felt his pulse quicken its beat in the presence of a patient  having possessed herself of his attention she appeared strangely enough to have nothing to say to him a curious apathy seemed to have taken possession of this resolute woman forced to speak first the doctor merely inquired in the conventional phrase what he could do for her  the sound of his voice seemed to rouse her still looking straight at the light she said abruptly i have a painful question to ask  what is it  her eyes travelled slowly from the window to the doctors face without the slightest outward appearance of agitation she put the painful question in these extraordinary words  i want to know if you please whether i am in danger of going mad  some men might have been amused and some might have been alarmed doctor wybrow was only conscious of a sense of disappointment was this the rare case that he had anticipated judging rashly by appearances was the new patient only a hypochondriacal woman whose malady was a disordered stomach and whose misfortune was a weak brain why do you come to me he asked sharply why dont you consult a doctor whose special employment is the treatment of the insane  she had her answer ready on the instant  i dont go to a doctor of that sort she said for the very reason that he is a specialist he has the fatal habit of judging everybody by lines and rules of his own laying down i come to you because my case is outside of all lines and rules and because you are famous in your profession for the discovery of mysteries in disease are you satisfied  he was more than satisfiedhis first idea had been the right idea after all besides she was correctly informed as to his professional position the capacity which had raised him to fame and fortune was his capacity unrivalled among his brethren for the discovery of remote disease  i am at your disposal he answered let me try if i can find out what is the matter with you  he put his medical questions they were promptly and plainly answered and they led to no other conclusion than that the strange lady was mentally and physically in excellent health not satisfied with questions he carefully examined the great organs of life neither his hand nor his stethoscope could discover anything that was amiss with the admirable patience and devotion to his art which had distinguished him from the time when he was a student he still subjected her to one test after another the result was always the same not only was there no tendency to brain diseasethere was not even a perceptible derangement of the nervous system i can find nothing the matter with you he said i cant even account for the extraordinary pallor of your complexion you completely puzzle me  the pallor of my complexion is nothing she answered a little impatiently in my early life i had a narrow escape from death by poisoning i have never had a complexion sinceand my skin is so delicate i cannot paint without producing a hideous rash but that is of no importance i wanted your opinion given positively i believed in you and you have disappointed me her head dropped on her breast and so it ends she said to herself bitterly  the doctors sympathies were touched perhaps it might be more correct to say that his professional pride was a little hurt it may end in the right way yet he remarked if you choose to help me  she looked up again with flashing eyes speak plainly she said how can i help you  plainly madam you come to me as an enigma and you leave me to make the right guess by the unaided efforts of my art my art will do much but not all for example something must have occurredsomething quite unconnected with the state of your bodily healthto frighten you about yourself or you would never have come here to consult me is that true  she clasped her hands in her lap that is true she said eagerly i begin to believe in you again  very well you cant expect me to find out the moral cause which has alarmed you i can positively discover that there is no physical cause of alarm and unless you admit me to your confidence i can do no more  she rose and took a turn in the room suppose i tell you she said but mind i shall mention no names  there is no need to mention names the facts are all i want  the facts are nothing she rejoined i have only my own impressions to confessand you will very likely think me a fanciful fool when you hear what they are no matter i will do my best to content youi will begin with the facts that you want take my word for it they wont do much to help you  she sat down again in the plainest possible words she began the strangest and wildest confession that had ever reached the doctors ears      chapter ii   it is one fact sir that i am a widow she said it is another fact that i am going to be married again  there she paused and smiled at some thought that occurred to her doctor wybrow was not favourably impressed by her smilethere was something at once sad and cruel in it it came slowly and it went away suddenly he began to doubt whether he had been wise in acting on his first impression his mind reverted to the commonplace patients and the discoverable maladies that were waiting for him with a certain tender regret  the lady went on  my approaching marriage she said has one embarrassing circumstance connected with it the gentleman whose wife i am to be was engaged to another lady when he happened to meet with me abroad that lady mind being of his own blood and family related to him as his cousin i have innocently robbed her of her lover and destroyed her prospects in life innocently i saybecause he told me nothing of his engagement until after i had accepted him when we next met in englandand when there was danger no doubt of the affair coming to my knowledgehe told me the truth i was naturally indignant he had his excuse ready he showed me a letter from the lady herself releasing him from his engagement a more noble a more highminded letter i never read in my life i cried over iti who have no tears in me for sorrows of my own if the letter had left him any hope of being forgiven i would have positively refused to marry him but the firmness of itwithout anger without a word of reproach with heartfelt wishes even for his happinessthe firmness of it i say left him no hope he appealed to my compassion he appealed to his love for me you know what women are i too was softheartedi said very well yes in a week more i tremble as i think of it we are to be married  she did really trembleshe was obliged to pause and compose herself before she could go on the doctor waiting for more facts began to fear that he stood committed to a long story forgive me for reminding you that i have suffering persons waiting to see me he said the sooner you can come to the point the better for my patients and for me  the strange smileat once so sad and so cruelshowed itself again on the ladys lips every word i have said is to the point she answered you will see it yourself in a moment more  she resumed her narrative  yesterdayyou need fear no long story sir only yesterdayi was among the visitors at one of your english luncheon parties a lady a perfect stranger to me came in lateafter we had left the table and had retired to the drawingroom she happened to take a chair near me and we were presented to each other i knew her by name as she knew me it was the woman whom i had robbed of her lover the woman who had written the noble letter now listen you were impatient with me for not interesting you in what i said just now i said it to satisfy your mind that i had no enmity of feeling towards the lady on my side i admired her i felt for heri had no cause to reproach myself this is very important as you will presently see on her side i have reason to be assured that the circumstances had been truly explained to her and that she understood i was in no way to blame now knowing all these necessary things as you do explain to me if you can why when i rose and met that womans eyes looking at me i turned cold from head to foot and shuddered and shivered and knew what a deadly panic of fear was for the first time in my life  the doctor began to feel interested at last  was there anything remarkable in the ladys personal appearance he asked  nothing whatever was the vehement reply here is the true description of herthe ordinary english lady the clear cold blue eyes the fine rosy complexion the inanimately polite manner the large goodhumoured mouth the too plump cheeks and chin these and nothing more  was there anything in her expression when you first looked at her that took you by surprise  there was natural curiosity to see the woman who had been preferred to her and perhaps some astonishment also not to see a more engaging and more beautiful person both those feelings restrained within the limits of good breeding and both not lasting for more than a few momentsso far as i could see i say so far because the horrible agitation that she communicated to me disturbed my judgment if i could have got to the door i would have run out of the room she frightened me so i was not even able to stand upi sank back in my chair i stared horrorstruck at the calm blue eyes that were only looking at me with a gentle surprise to say they affected me like the eyes of a serpent is to say nothing i felt her soul in them looking into minelooking if such a thing can be unconsciously to her own mortal self i tell you my impression in all its horror and in all its folly that woman is destined without knowing it herself to be the evil genius of my life her innocent eyes saw hidden capabilities of wickedness in me that i was not aware of myself until i felt them stirring under her look if i commit faults in my life to comeif i am even guilty of crimesshe will bring the retribution without as i firmly believe any conscious exercise of her own will in one indescribable moment i felt all thisand i suppose my face showed it the good artless creature was inspired by a sort of gentle alarm for me i am afraid the heat of the room is too much for you will you try my smelling bottle i heard her say those kind words and i remember nothing elsei fainted when i recovered my senses the company had all gone only the lady of the house was with me for the moment i could say nothing to her the dreadful impression that i have tried to describe to you came back to me with the coming back of my life as soon i could speak i implored her to tell me the whole truth about the woman whom i had supplanted you see i had a faint hope that her good character might not really be deserved that her noble letter was a skilful piece of hypocrisyin short that she secretly hated me and was cunning enough to hide it no the lady had been her friend from her girlhood was as familiar with her as if they had been sistersknew her positively to be as good as innocent as incapable of hating anybody as the greatest saint that ever lived my one last hope that i had only felt an ordinary forewarning of danger in the presence of an ordinary enemy was a hope destroyed for ever there was one more effort i could make and i made it i went next to the man whom i am to marry i implored him to release me from my promise he refused i declared i would break my engagement he showed me letters from his sisters letters from his brothers and his dear friendsall entreating him to think again before he made me his wife all repeating reports of me in paris vienna and london which are so many vile lies if you refuse to marry me he said you admit that these reports are trueyou admit that you are afraid to face society in the character of my wife what could i answer there was no contradicting himhe was plainly right if i persisted in my refusal the utter destruction of my reputation would be the result i consented to let the wedding take place as we had arranged itand left him the night has passed i am here with my fixed convictionthat innocent woman is ordained to have a fatal influence over my life i am here with my one question to put to the one man who can answer it for the last time sir what am ia demon who has seen the avenging angel or only a poor mad woman misled by the delusion of a deranged mind  doctor wybrow rose from his chair determined to close the interview  he was strongly and painfully impressed by what he had heard the longer he had listened to her the more irresistibly the conviction of the womans wickedness had forced itself on him he tried vainly to think of her as a person to be pitieda person with a morbidly sensitive imagination conscious of the capacities for evil which lie dormant in us all and striving earnestly to open her heart to the counterinfluence of her own better nature the effort was beyond him a perverse instinct in him said as if in words beware how you believe in her  i have already given you my opinion he said there is no sign of your intellect being deranged or being likely to be deranged that medical science can discoveras i understand it as for the impressions you have confided to me i can only say that yours is a case as i venture to think for spiritual rather than for medical advice of one thing be assured what you have said to me in this room shall not pass out of it your confession is safe in my keeping  she heard him with a certain dogged resignation to the end  is that all she asked  that is all he answered  she put a little paper packet of money on the table thank you sir there is your fee  with those words she rose her wild black eyes looked upward with an expression of despair so defiant and so horrible in its silent agony that the doctor turned away his head unable to endure the sight of it the bare idea of taking anything from hernot money only but anything even that she had touchedsuddenly revolted him still without looking at her he said take it back i dont want my fee  she neither heeded nor heard him still looking upward she said slowly to herself let the end come i have done with the struggle i submit  she drew her veil over her face bowed to the doctor and left the room  he rang the bell and followed her into the hall as the servant closed the door on her a sudden impulse of curiosityutterly unworthy of him and at the same time utterly irresistiblesprang up in the doctors mind blushing like a boy he said to the servant follow her home and find out her name for one moment the man looked at his master doubting if his own ears had not deceived him doctor wybrow looked back at him in silence the submissive servant knew what that silence meanthe took his hat and hurried into the street  the doctor went back to the consultingroom a sudden revulsion of feeling swept over his mind had the woman left an infection of wickedness in the house and had he caught it what devil had possessed him to degrade himself in the eyes of his own servant he had behaved infamouslyhe had asked an honest man a man who had served him faithfully for years to turn spy stung by the bare thought of it he ran out into the hall again and opened the door the servant had disappeared it was too late to call him back but one refuge from his contempt for himself was now open to himthe refuge of work he got into his carriage and went his rounds among his patients  if the famous physician could have shaken his own reputation he would have done it that afternoon never before had he made himself so little welcome at the bedside never before had he put off until tomorrow the prescription which ought to have been written the opinion which ought to have been given today he went home earlier than usualunutterably dissatisfied with himself  the servant had returned dr wybrow was ashamed to question him the man reported the result of his errand without waiting to be asked  the ladys name is the countess narona she lives at  without waiting to hear where she lived the doctor acknowledged the allimportant discovery of her name by a silent bend of the head and entered his consultingroom the fee that he had vainly refused still lay in its little white paper covering on the table he sealed it up in an envelope addressed it to the poorbox of the nearest policecourt and calling the servant in directed him to take it to the magistrate the next morning faithful to his duties the servant waited to ask the customary question do you dine at home today sir  after a moments hesitation he said no i shall dine at the club  the most easily deteriorated of all the moral qualities is the quality called conscience in one state of a mans mind his conscience is the severest judge that can pass sentence on him in another state he and his conscience are on the best possible terms with each other in the comfortable capacity of accomplices when doctor wybrow left his house for the second time he did not even attempt to conceal from himself that his sole object in dining at the club was to hear what the world said of the countess narona      chapter iii   there was a time when a man in search of the pleasures of gossip sought the society of ladies the man knows better now he goes to the smokingroom of his club  doctor wybrow lit his cigar and looked round him at his brethren in social conclave assembled the room was well filled but the flow of talk was still languid the doctor innocently applied the stimulant that was wanted when he inquired if anybody knew the countess narona he was answered by something like a shout of astonishment never the conclave agreed had such an absurd question been asked before every human creature with the slightest claim to a place in society knew the countess narona an adventuress with a european reputation of the blackest possible coloursuch was the general description of the woman with the deathlike complexion and the glittering eyes  descending to particulars each member of the club contributed his own little stock of scandal to the memoirs of the countess it was doubtful whether she was really what she called herself a dalmatian lady it was doubtful whether she had ever been married to the count whose widow she assumed to be it was doubtful whether the man who accompanied her in her travels under the name of baron rivar and in the character of her brother was her brother at all report pointed to the baron as a gambler at every table on the continent report whispered that his socalled sister had narrowly escaped being implicated in a famous trial for poisoning at viennathat she had been known at milan as a spy in the interests of austriathat her apartment in paris had been denounced to the police as nothing less than a private gamblinghouseand that her present appearance in england was the natural result of the discovery only one member of the assembly in the smokingroom took the part of this muchabused woman and declared that her character had been most cruelly and most unjustly assailed but as the man was a lawyer his interference went for nothing it was naturally attributed to the spirit of contradiction inherent in his profession he was asked derisively what he thought of the circumstances under which the countess had become engaged to be married and he made the characteristic answer that he thought the circumstances highly creditable to both parties and that he looked on the ladys future husband as a most enviable man  hearing this the doctor raised another shout of astonishment by inquiring the name of the gentleman whom the countess was about to marry  his friends in the smokingroom decided unanimously that the celebrated physician must be a second ripvanwinkle and that he had just awakened from a supernatural sleep of twenty years it was all very well to say that he was devoted to his profession and that he had neither time nor inclination to pick up fragments of gossip at dinnerparties and balls a man who did not know that the countess narona had borrowed money at homburg of no less a person than lord montbarry and had then deluded him into making her a proposal of marriage was a man who had probably never heard of lord montbarry himself the younger members of the club humouring the joke sent a waiter for the peerage and read aloud the memoir of the nobleman in question for the doctors benefitwith illustrative morsels of information interpolated by themselves  herbert john westwick first baron montbarry of montbarry kings county ireland created a peer for distinguished military services in india born 1812 fortyeight years old doctor at the present time not married will be married next week doctor to the delightful creature we have been talking about heir presumptive his lordships next brother stephen robert married to ella youngest daughter of the reverend silas marden rector of runnigate and has issue three daughters younger brothers of his lordship francis and henry unmarried sisters of his lordship lady barville married to sir theodore barville bart and anne widow of the late peter norbury esq of norbury cross bear his lordships relations well in mind doctor three brothers westwick stephen francis and henry and two sisters lady barville and mrs norbury not one of the five will be present at the marriage and not one of the five will leave a stone unturned to stop it if the countess will only give them a chance add to these hostile members of the family another offended relative not mentioned in the peerage a young lady  a sudden outburst of protest in more than one part of the room stopped the coming disclosure and released the doctor from further persecution  dont mention the poor girls name its too bad to make a joke of that part of the business she has behaved nobly under shameful provocation there is but one excuse for montbarryhe is either a madman or a fool in these terms the protest expressed itself on all sides speaking confidentially to his next neighbour the doctor discovered that the lady referred to was already known to him through the countesss confession as the lady deserted by lord montbarry her name was agnes lockwood she was described as being the superior of the countess in personal attraction and as being also by some years the younger woman of the two making all allowance for the follies that men committed every day in their relations with women montbarrys delusion was still the most monstrous delusion on record in this expression of opinion every man present agreedthe lawyer even included not one of them could call to mind the innumerable instances in which the sexual influence has proved irresistible in the persons of women without even the pretension to beauty the very members of the club whom the countess in spite of her personal disadvantages could have most easily fascinated if she had thought it worth her while were the members who wondered most loudly at montbarrys choice of a wife  while the topic of the countesss marriage was still the one topic of conversation a member of the club entered the smokingroom whose appearance instantly produced a dead silence doctor wybrows next neighbour whispered to him montbarrys brotherhenry westwick  the newcomer looked round him slowly with a bitter smile  you are all talking of my brother he said dont mind me not one of you can despise him more heartily than i do go on gentlemengo on  but one man present took the speaker at his word that man was the lawyer who had already undertaken the defence of the countess  i stand alone in my opinion he said and i am not ashamed of repeating it in anybodys hearing i consider the countess narona to be a cruellytreated woman why shouldnt she be lord montbarrys wife who can say she has a mercenary motive in marrying him  montbarrys brother turned sharply on the speaker i say it he answered  the reply might have shaken some men the lawyer stood on his ground as firmly as ever  i believe i am right he rejoined in stating that his lordships income is not more than sufficient to support his station in life also that it is an income derived almost entirely from landed property in ireland every acre of which is entailed  montbarrys brother made a sign admitting that he had no objection to offer so far  if his lordship dies first the lawyer proceeded i have been informed that the only provision he can make for his widow consists in a rentcharge on the property of no more than four hundred a year his retiring pension and allowances it is well known die with him four hundred a year is therefore all that he can leave to the countess if he leaves her a widow  four hundred a year is not all was the reply to this my brother has insured his life for ten thousand pounds and he has settled the whole of it on the countess in the event of his death  this announcement produced a strong sensation men looked at each other and repeated the three startling words ten thousand pounds driven fairly to the wall the lawyer made a last effort to defend his position  may i ask who made that settlement a condition of the marriage he said surely it was not the countess herself  henry westwick answered it was the countesss brother and added which comes to the same thing  after that there was no more to be saidso long at least as montbarrys brother was present the talk flowed into other channels and the doctor went home  but his morbid curiosity about the countess was not set at rest yet in his leisure moments he found himself wondering whether lord montbarrys family would succeed in stopping the marriage after all and more than this he was conscious of a growing desire to see the infatuated man himself every day during the brief interval before the wedding he looked in at the club on the chance of hearing some news nothing had happened so far as the club knew the countesss position was secure montbarrys resolution to be her husband was unshaken they were both roman catholics and they were to be married at the chapel in spanish place so much the doctor discovered about themand no more  on the day of the wedding after a feeble struggle with himself he actually sacrificed his patients and their guineas and slipped away secretly to see the marriage to the end of his life he was angry with anybody who reminded him of what he had done on that day  the wedding was strictly private a close carriage stood at the church door a few people mostly of the lower class and mostly old women were scattered about the interior of the building here and there doctor wybrow detected the faces of some of his brethren of the club attracted by curiosity like himself four persons only stood before the altarthe bride and bridegroom and their two witnesses one of these last was an elderly woman who might have been the countesss companion or maid the other was undoubtedly her brother baron rivar the bridal party the bride herself included wore their ordinary morning costume lord montbarry personally viewed was a middleaged military man of the ordinary type nothing in the least remarkable distinguished him either in face or figure baron rivar again in his way was another conventional representative of another wellknown type one sees his finelypointed moustache his bold eyes his crisplycurling hair and his dashing carriage of the head repeated hundreds of times over on the boulevards of paris the only noteworthy point about him was of the negative sorthe was not in the least like his sister even the officiating priest was only a harmless humblelooking old man who went through his duties resignedly and felt visible rheumatic difficulties every time he bent his knees the one remarkable person the countess herself only raised her veil at the beginning of the ceremony and presented nothing in her plain dress that was worth a second look never on the face of it was there a less interesting and less romantic marriage than this from time to time the doctor glanced round at the door or up at the galleries vaguely anticipating the appearance of some protesting stranger in possession of some terrible secret commissioned to forbid the progress of the service nothing in the shape of an event occurrednothing extraordinary nothing dramatic bound fast together as man and wife the two disappeared followed by their witnesses to sign the registers and still doctor wybrow waited and still he cherished the obstinate hope that something worth seeing must certainly happen yet  the interval passed and the married couple returning to the church walked together down the nave to the door doctor wybrow drew back as they approached to his confusion and surprise the countess discovered him he heard her say to her husband one moment i see a friend lord montbarry bowed and waited she stepped up to the doctor took his hand and wrung it hard he felt her overpowering black eyes looking at him through her veil one step more you see on the way to the end she whispered those strange words and returned to her husband before the doctor could recover himself and follow her lord and lady montbarry had stepped into their carriage and had driven away  outside the church door stood the three or four members of the club who like doctor wybrow had watched the ceremony out of curiosity near them was the brides brother waiting alone he was evidently bent on seeing the man whom his sister had spoken to in broad daylight his bold eyes rested on the doctors face with a momentary flash of suspicion in them the cloud suddenly cleared away the baron smiled with charming courtesy lifted his hat to his sisters friend and walked off  the members constituted themselves into a club conclave on the church steps they began with the baron damned illlooking rascal they went on with montbarry is he going to take that horrid woman with him to ireland not he he cant face the tenantry they know about agnes lockwood well but where is he going to scotland does she like that its only for a fortnight they come back to london and go abroad and they will never return to england eh who can tell did you see how she looked at montbarry when she had to lift her veil at the beginning of the service in his place i should have bolted did you see her doctor by this time doctor wybrow had remembered his patients and had heard enough of the club gossip he followed the example of baron rivar and walked off  one step more you see on the way to the end he repeated to himself on his way home what end      chapter iv   on the day of the marriage agnes lockwood sat alone in the little drawingroom of her london lodgings burning the letters which had been written to her by montbarry in the bygone time  the countesss maliciously smart description of her addressed to doctor wybrow had not even hinted at the charm that most distinguished agnesthe artless expression of goodness and purity which instantly attracted everyone who approached her she looked by many years younger than she really was with her fair complexion and her shy manner it seemed only natural to speak of her as a girl although she was now really advancing towards thirty years of age she lived alone with an old nurse devoted to her on a modest little income which was just enough to support the two there were none of the ordinary signs of grief in her face as she slowly tore the letters of her false lover in two and threw the pieces into the small fire which had been lit to consume them unhappily for herself she was one of those women who feel too deeply to find relief in tears pale and quiet with cold trembling fingers she destroyed the letters one by one without daring to read them again she had torn the last of the series and was still shrinking from throwing it after the rest into the swiftly destroying flame when the old nurse came in and asked if she would see master henrymeaning that youngest member of the westwick family who had publicly declared his contempt for his brother in the smokingroom of the club  agnes hesitated a faint tinge of colour stole over her face  there had been a long past time when henry westwick had owned that he loved her she had made her confession to him acknowledging that her heart was given to his eldest brother he had submitted to his disappointment and they had met thenceforth as cousins and friends never before had she associated the idea of him with embarrassing recollections but now on the very day when his brothers marriage to another woman had consummated his brothers treason towards her there was something vaguely repellent in the prospect of seeing him the old nurse who remembered them both in their cradles observed her hesitation and sympathising of course with the man put in a timely word for henry he says hes going away my dear and he only wants to shake hands and say goodbye this plain statement of the case had its effect agnes decided on receiving her cousin  he entered the room so rapidly that he surprised her in the act of throwing the fragments of montbarrys last letter into the fire she hurriedly spoke first  you are leaving london very suddenly henry is it business or pleasure  instead of answering her he pointed to the flaming letter and to some black ashes of burnt paper lying lightly in the lower part of the fireplace  are you burning letters  yes  his letters  yes  he took her hand gently i had no idea i was intruding on you at a time when you must wish to be alone forgive me agnesi shall see you when i return  she signed to him with a faint smile to take a chair  we have known one another since we were children she said why should i feel a foolish pride about myself in your presence why should i have any secrets from you i sent back all your brothers gifts to me some time ago i have been advised to do more to keep nothing that can remind me of himin short to burn his letters i have taken the advice but i own i shrank a little from destroying the last of the letters nonot because it was the last but because it had this in it she opened her hand and showed him a lock of montbarrys hair tied with a morsel of golden cord well well let it go with the rest  she dropped it into the flame for a while she stood with her back to henry leaning on the mantelpiece and looking into the fire he took the chair to which she had pointed with a strange contradiction of expression in his face the tears were in his eyes while the brows above were knit close in an angry frown he muttered to himself damn him  she rallied her courage and looked at him again when she spoke well henry and why are you going away  i am out of spirits agnes and i want a change  she paused before she spoke again his face told her plainly that he was thinking of her when he made that reply she was grateful to him but her mind was not with him her mind was still with the man who had deserted her she turned round again to the fire  is it true she asked after a long silence that they have been married today  he answered ungraciously in the one necessary wordyes  did you go to the church  he resented the question with an expression of indignant surprise go to the church he repeated i would as soon go to he checked himself there how can you ask he added in lower tones i have never spoken to montbarry i have not even seen him since he treated you like the scoundrel and the fool that he is  she looked at him suddenly without saying a word he understood her and begged her pardon but he was still angry the reckoning comes to some men he said even in this world he will live to rue the day when he married that woman  agnes took a chair by his side and looked at him with a gentle surprise  is it quite reasonable to be so angry with her because your brother preferred her to me she asked  henry turned on her sharply do you defend the countess of all the people in the world  why not agnes answered i know nothing against her on the only occasion when we met she appeared to be a singularly timid nervous person looking dreadfully ill and being indeed so ill that she fainted under the heat of my room why should we not do her justice we know that she was innocent of any intention to wrong me we know that she was not aware of my engagement  henry lifted his hand impatiently and stopped her there is such a thing as being too just and too forgiving he interposed i cant bear to hear you talk in that patient way after the scandalously cruel manner in which you have been treated try to forget them both agnes i wish to god i could help you to do it  agnes laid her hand on his arm you are very good to me henry but you dont quite understand me i was thinking of myself and my trouble in quite a different way when you came in i was wondering whether anything which has so entirely filled my heart and so absorbed all that is best and truest in me as my feeling for your brother can really pass away as if it had never existed i have destroyed the last visible things that remind me of him in this world i shall see him no more but is the tie that once bound us completely broken am i as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved what do you think henry i can hardly believe it  if you could bring the retribution on him that he has deserved henry westwick answered sternly i might be inclined to agree with you  as that reply passed his lips the old nurse appeared again at the door announcing another visitor  im sorry to disturb you my dear but here is little mrs ferrari wanting to know when she may say a few words to you  agnes turned to henry before she replied you remember emily bidwell my favourite pupil years ago at the village school and afterwards my maid she left me to marry an italian courier named ferrariand i am afraid it has not turned out very well do you mind my having her in here for a minute or two  henry rose to take his leave i should be glad to see emily again at any other time he said but it is best that i should go now my mind is disturbed agnes i might say things to you if i stayed here any longer whichwhich are better not said now i shall cross the channel by the mail tonight and see how a few weeks change will help me he took her hand is there anything in the world that i can do for you he asked very earnestly she thanked him and tried to release her hand he held it with a tremulous lingering grasp god bless you agnes he said in faltering tones with his eyes on the ground her face flushed again and the next instant turned paler than ever she knew his heart as well as he knew it himselfshe was too distressed to speak he lifted her hand to his lips kissed it fervently and without looking at her again left the room the nurse hobbled after him to the head of the stairs she had not forgotten the time when the younger brother had been the unsuccessful rival of the elder for the hand of agnes dont be downhearted master henry whispered the old woman with the unscrupulous common sense of persons in the lower rank of life try her again when you come back  left alone for a few moments agnes took a turn in the room trying to compose herself she paused before a little watercolour drawing on the wall which had belonged to her mother it was her own portrait when she was a child how much happier we should be she thought to herself sadly if we never grew up  the couriers wife was shown ina little meek melancholy woman with white eyelashes and watery eyes who curtseyed deferentially and was troubled with a small chronic cough agnes shook hands with her kindly well emily what can i do for you  the couriers wife made rather a strange answer im afraid to tell you miss  is it such a very difficult favour to grant sit down and let me hear how you are going on perhaps the petition will slip out while we are talking how does your husband behave to you  emilys light grey eyes looked more watery than ever she shook her head and sighed resignedly i have no positive complaint to make against him miss but im afraid he doesnt care about me and he seems to take no interest in his homei may almost say hes tired of his home it might be better for both of us miss if he went travelling for a whilenot to mention the money which is beginning to be wanted sadly she put her handkerchief to her eyes and sighed again more resignedly than ever  i dont quite understand said agnes i thought your husband had an engagement to take some ladies to switzerland and italy  that was his illluck miss one of the ladies fell illand the others wouldnt go without her they paid him a months salary as compensation but they had engaged him for the autumn and winterand the loss is serious  i am sorry to hear it emily let us hope he will soon have another chance  its not his turn miss to be recommended when the next applications come to the couriers office you see there are so many of them out of employment just now if he could be privately recommended she stopped and left the unfinished sentence to speak for itself  agnes understood her directly you want my recommendation she rejoined why couldnt you say so at once  emily blushed it would be such a chance for my husband she answered confusedly a letter inquiring for a good courier a six months engagement miss came to the office this morning its another mans turn to be chosenand the secretary will recommend him if my husband could only send his testimonials by the same postwith just a word in your name missit might turn the scale as they say a private recommendation between gentlefolks goes so far she stopped again and sighed again and looked down at the carpet as if she had some private reason for feeling a little ashamed of herself  agnes began to be rather weary of the persistent tone of mystery in which her visitor spoke if you want my interest with any friend of mine she said why cant you tell me the name  the couriers wife began to cry im ashamed to tell you miss  for the first time agnes spoke sharply nonsense emily tell me the name directlyor drop the subjectwhichever you like best  emily made a last desperate effort she wrung her handkerchief hard in her lap and let off the name as if she had been letting off a loaded gunlord montbarry  agnes rose and looked at her  you have disappointed me she said very quietly but with a look which the couriers wife had never seen in her face before knowing what you know you ought to be aware that it is impossible for me to communicate with lord montbarry i always supposed you had some delicacy of feeling i am sorry to find that i have been mistaken  weak as she was emily had spirit enough to feel the reproof she walked in her meek noiseless way to the door i beg your pardon miss i am not quite so bad as you think me but i beg your pardon all the same  she opened the door agnes called her back there was something in the womans apology that appealed irresistibly to her just and generous nature come she said we must not part in this way let me not misunderstand you what is it that you expected me to do  emily was wise enough to answer this time without any reserve my husband will send his testimonials miss to lord montbarry in scotland i only wanted you to let him say in his letter that his wife has been known to you since she was a child and that you feel some little interest in his welfare on that account i dont ask it now miss you have made me understand that i was wrong  had she really been wrong past remembrances as well as present troubles pleaded powerfully with agnes for the couriers wife it seems only a small favour to ask she said speaking under the impulse of kindness which was the strongest impulse in her nature but i am not sure that i ought to allow my name to be mentioned in your husbands letter let me hear again exactly what he wishes to say emily repeated the wordsand then offered one of those suggestions which have a special value of their own to persons unaccustomed to the use of their pens suppose you try miss how it looks in writing childish as the idea was agnes tried the experiment if i let you mention me she said we must at least decide what you are to say she wrote the words in the briefest and plainest formi venture to state that my wife has been known from her childhood to miss agnes lockwood who feels some little interest in my welfare on that account reduced to this one sentence there was surely nothing in the reference to her name which implied that agnes had permitted it or that she was even aware of it after a last struggle with herself she handed the written paper to emily your husband must copy it exactly without altering anything she stipulated on that condition i grant your request emily was not only thankfulshe was really touched agnes hurried the little woman out of the room dont give me time to repent and take it back again she said emily vanished  is the tie that once bound us completely broken am i as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved agnes looked at the clock on the mantelpiece not ten minutes since those serious questions had been on her lips it almost shocked her to think of the commonplace manner in which they had already met with their reply the mail of that night would appeal once more to montbarrys remembrance of herin the choice of a servant  two days later the post brought a few grateful lines from emily her husband had got the place ferrari was engaged for six months certain as lord montbarrys courier     the second part      chapter v   after only one week of travelling in scotland my lord and my lady returned unexpectedly to london introduced to the mountains and lakes of the highlands her ladyship positively declined to improve her acquaintance with them when she was asked for her reason she answered with a roman brevity i have seen switzerland  for a week more the newlymarried couple remained in london in the strictest retirement on one day in that week the nurse returned in a state of most uncustomary excitement from an errand on which agnes had sent her passing the door of a fashionable dentist she had met lord montbarry himself just leaving the house the good womans report described him with malicious pleasure as looking wretchedly ill his cheeks are getting hollow my dear and his beard is turning grey i hope the dentist hurt him  knowing how heartily her faithful old servant hated the man who had deserted her agnes made due allowance for a large infusion of exaggeration in the picture presented to her the main impression produced on her mind was an impression of nervous uneasiness if she trusted herself in the streets by daylight while lord montbarry remained in london how could she be sure that his next chancemeeting might not be a meeting with herself she waited at home privately ashamed of her own undignified conduct for the next two days on the third day the fashionable intelligence of the newspapers announced the departure of lord and lady montbarry for paris on their way to italy  mrs ferrari calling the same evening informed agnes that her husband had left her with all reasonable expression of conjugal kindness his temper being improved by the prospect of going abroad but one other servant accompanied the travellerslady montbarrys maid rather a silent unsociable woman so far as emily had heard her ladyships brother baron rivar was already on the continent it had been arranged that he was to meet his sister and her husband at rome  one by one the dull weeks succeeded each other in the life of agnes she faced her position with admirable courage seeing her friends keeping herself occupied in her leisure hours with reading and drawing leaving no means untried of diverting her mind from the melancholy remembrance of the past but she had loved too faithfully she had been wounded too deeply to feel in any adequate degree the influence of the moral remedies which she employed persons who met with her in the ordinary relations of life deceived by her outward serenity of manner agreed that miss lockwood seemed to be getting over her disappointment but an old friend and school companion who happened to see her during a brief visit to london was inexpressibly distressed by the change that she detected in agnes this lady was mrs westwick the wife of that brother of lord montbarry who came next to him in age and who was described in the peerage as presumptive heir to the title he was then away looking after his interests in some mining property which he possessed in america mrs westwick insisted on taking agnes back with her to her home in ireland come and keep me company while my husband is away my three little girls will make you their playfellow and the only stranger you will meet is the governess whom i answer for your liking beforehand pack up your things and i will call for you tomorrow on my way to the train in those hearty terms the invitation was given agnes thankfully accepted it for three happy months she lived under the roof of her friend the girls hung round her in tears at her departure the youngest of them wanted to go back with agnes to london half in jest half in earnest she said to her old friend at parting if your governess leaves you keep the place open for me mrs westwick laughed the wiser children took it seriously and promised to let agnes know    on the very day when miss lockwood returned to london she was recalled to those associations with the past which she was most anxious to forget after the first kissings and greetings were over the old nurse who had been left in charge at the lodgings had some startling information to communicate derived from the couriers wife  here has been little mrs ferrari my dear in a dreadful state of mind inquiring when you would be back her husband has left lord montbarry without a word of warningand nobody knows what has become of him  agnes looked at her in astonishment are you sure of what you are saying she asked  the nurse was quite sure why lord bless you the news comes from the couriers office in golden squarefrom the secretary miss agnes the secretary himself hearing this agnes began to feel alarmed as well as surprised it was still early in the evening she at once sent a message to mrs ferrari to say that she had returned  in an hour more the couriers wife appeared in a state of agitation which it was not easy to control her narrative when she was at last able to speak connectedly entirely confirmed the nurses report of it  after hearing from her husband with tolerable regularity from paris rome and venice emily had twice written to him afterwardsand had received no reply feeling uneasy she had gone to the office in golden square to inquire if he had been heard of there the post of the morning had brought a letter to the secretary from a courier then at venice it contained startling news of ferrari his wife had been allowed to take a copy of it which she now handed to agnes to read  the writer stated that he had recently arrived in venice he had previously heard that ferrari was with lord and lady montbarry at one of the old venetian palaces which they had hired for a term being a friend of ferrari he had gone to pay him a visit ringing at the door that opened on the canal and failing to make anyone hear him he had gone round to a side entrance opening on one of the narrow lanes of venice here standing at the door as if she was waiting for him to try that way next he found a pale woman with magnificent dark eyes who proved to be no other than lady montbarry herself  she asked in italian what he wanted he answered that he wanted to see the courier ferrari if it was quite convenient she at once informed him that ferrari had left the palace without assigning any reason and without even leaving an address at which his monthly salary then due to him could be paid amazed at this reply the courier inquired if any person had offended ferrari or quarrelled with him the lady answered to my knowledge certainly not i am lady montbarry and i can positively assure you that ferrari was treated with the greatest kindness in this house we are as much astonished as you are at his extraordinary disappearance if you should hear of him pray let us know so that we may at least pay him the money which is due  after one or two more questions quite readily answered relating to the date and the time of day at which ferrari had left the palace the courier took his leave  he at once entered on the necessary investigationswithout the slightest result so far as ferrari was concerned nobody had seen him nobody appeared to have been taken into his confidence nobody knew anything that is to say anything of the slightest importance even about persons so distinguished as lord and lady montbarry it was reported that her ladyships english maid had left her before the disappearance of ferrari to return to her relatives in her own country and that lady montbarry had taken no steps to supply her place his lordship was described as being in delicate health he lived in the strictest retirementnobody was admitted to him not even his own countrymen a stupid old woman was discovered who did the housework at the palace arriving in the morning and going away again at night she had never seen the lost couriershe had never even seen lord montbarry who was then confined to his room her ladyship a most gracious and adorable mistress was in constant attendance on her noble husband there was no other servant then in the house so far as the old woman knew but herself the meals were sent in from a restaurant my lord it was said disliked strangers my lords brotherinlaw the baron was generally shut up in a remote part of the palace occupied the gracious mistress said with experiments in chemistry the experiments sometimes made a nasty smell a doctor had latterly been called in to his lordshipan italian doctor long resident in venice inquiries being addressed to this gentleman a physician of undoubted capacity and respectability it turned out that he also had never seen ferrari having been summoned to the palace as his memorandum book showed at a date subsequent to the couriers disappearance the doctor described lord montbarrys malady as bronchitis so far there was no reason to feel any anxiety though the attack was a sharp one if alarming symptoms should appear he had arranged with her ladyship to call in another physician for the rest it was impossible to speak too highly of my lady night and day she was at her lords bedside  with these particulars began and ended the discoveries made by ferraris courierfriend the police were on the lookout for the lost manand that was the only hope which could be held forth for the present to ferraris wife  what do you think of it miss the poor woman asked eagerly what would you advise me to do  agnes was at a loss how to answer her it was an effort even to listen to what emily was saying the references in the couriers letter to montbarrythe report of his illness the melancholy picture of his secluded lifehad reopened the old wound she was not even thinking of the lost ferrari her mind was at venice by the sick mans bedside  i hardly know what to say she answered i have had no experience in serious matters of this kind  do you think it would help you miss if you read my husbands letters to me there are only three of themthey wont take long to read  agnes compassionately read the letters  they were not written in a very tender tone dear emily and yours affectionatelythese conventional phrases were the only phrases of endearment which they contained in the first letter lord montbarry was not very favourably spoken ofwe leave paris tomorrow i dont much like my lord he is proud and cold and between ourselves stingy in money matters i have had to dispute such trifles as a few centimes in the hotel bill and twice already some sharp remarks have passed between the newlymarried couple in consequence of her ladyships freedom in purchasing pretty tempting things at the shops in paris i cant afford it you must keep to your allowance she has had to hear those words already for my part i like her she has the nice easy foreign mannersshe talks to me as if i was a human being like herself  the second letter was dated from rome  my lords caprices ferrari wrote have kept us perpetually on the move he is becoming incurably restless i suspect he is uneasy in his mind painful recollections i should sayi find him constantly reading old letters when her ladyship is not present we were to have stopped at genoa but he hurried us on the same thing at florence here at rome my lady insists on resting her brother has met us at this place there has been a quarrel already the ladys maid tells me between my lord and the baron the latter wanted to borrow money of the former his lordship refused in language which offended baron rivar my lady pacified them and made them shake hands  the third and last letter was from venice  more of my lords economy instead of staying at the hotel we have hired a damp mouldy rambling old palace my lady insists on having the best suites of rooms wherever we goand the palace comes cheaper for a two months term my lord tried to get it for longer he says the quiet of venice is good for his nerves but a foreign speculator has secured the palace and is going to turn it into an hotel the baron is still with us and there have been more disagreements about money matters i dont like the baronand i dont find the attractions of my lady grow on me she was much nicer before the baron joined us my lord is a punctual paymaster its a matter of honour with him he hates parting with his money but he does it because he has given his word i receive my salary regularly at the end of each monthnot a franc extra though i have done many things which are not part of a couriers proper work fancy the baron trying to borrow money of me he is an inveterate gambler i didnt believe it when my ladys maid first told me sobut i have seen enough since to satisfy me that she was right i have seen other things besides whichwell which dont increase my respect for my lady and the baron the maid says she means to give warning to leave she is a respectable british female and doesnt take things quite so easily as i do it is a dull life here no going into companyno company at homenot a creature sees my lordnot even the consul or the banker when he goes out he goes alone and generally towards nightfall indoors he shuts himself up in his own room with his books and sees as little of his wife and the baron as possible i fancy things are coming to a crisis here if my lords suspicions are once awakened the consequences will be terrible under certain provocations the noble montbarry is a man who would stick at nothing however the pay is goodand i cant afford to talk of leaving the place like my ladys maid  agnes handed back the lettersso suggestive of the penalty paid already for his own infatuation by the man who had deserted herwith feelings of shame and distress which made her no fit counsellor for the helpless woman who depended on her advice  the one thing i can suggest she said after first speaking some kind words of comfort and hope is that we should consult a person of greater experience than ours suppose i write and ask my lawyer who is also my friend and trustee to come and advise us tomorrow after his business hours  emily eagerly and gratefully accepted the suggestion an hour was arranged for the meeting on the next day the correspondence was left under the care of agnes and the couriers wife took her leave  weary and heartsick agnes lay down on the sofa to rest and compose herself the careful nurse brought in a reviving cup of tea her quaint gossip about herself and her occupations while agnes had been away acted as a relief to her mistresss overburdened mind they were still talking quietly when they were startled by a loud knock at the house door hurried footsteps ascended the stairs the door of the sittingroom was thrown open violently the couriers wife rushed in like a mad woman hes dead theyve murdered him those wild words were all she could say she dropped on her knees at the foot of the sofaheld out her hand with something clasped in itand fell back in a swoon  the nurse signing to agnes to open the window took the necessary measures to restore the fainting woman whats this she exclaimed heres a letter in her hand see what it is miss  the open envelope was addressed evidently in a feigned handwriting to mrs ferrari the postmark was venice the contents of the envelope were a sheet of foreign notepaper and a folded enclosure  on the notepaper one line only was written it was again in a feigned handwriting and it contained these words  to console you for the loss of your husband  agnes opened the enclosure next  it was a bank of england note for a thousand pounds      chapter vi   the next day the friend and legal adviser of agnes lockwood mr troy called on her by appointment in the evening  mrs ferraristill persisting in the conviction of her husbands deathhad sufficiently recovered to be present at the consultation assisted by agnes she told the lawyer the little that was known relating to ferraris disappearance and then produced the correspondence connected with that event mr troy read first the three letters addressed by ferrari to his wife secondly the letter written by ferraris courierfriend describing his visit to the palace and his interview with lady montbarry and thirdly the one line of anonymous writing which had accompanied the extraordinary gift of a thousand pounds to ferraris wife  well known at a later period as the lawyer who acted for lady lydiard in the case of theft generally described as the case of my ladys money mr troy was not only a man of learning and experience in his professionhe was also a man who had seen something of society at home and abroad he possessed a keen eye for character a quaint humour and a kindly nature which had not been deteriorated even by a lawyers professional experience of mankind with all these personal advantages it is a question nevertheless whether he was the fittest adviser whom agnes could have chosen under the circumstances little mrs ferrari with many domestic merits was an essentially commonplace woman mr troy was the last person living who was likely to attract her sympathieshe was the exact opposite of a commonplace man  she looks very ill poor thing in these words the lawyer opened the business of the evening referring to mrs ferrari as unceremoniously as if she had been out of the room  she has suffered a terrible shock agnes answered  mr troy turned to mrs ferrari and looked at her again with the interest due to the victim of a shock he drummed absently with his fingers on the table at last he spoke to her  my good lady you dont really believe that your husband is dead  mrs ferrari put her handkerchief to her eyes the word dead was ineffectual to express her feelings murdered she said sternly behind her handkerchief  why and by whom mr troy asked  mrs ferrari seemed to have some difficulty in answering you have read my husbands letters sir she began i believe he discovered she got as far as that and there she stopped  what did he discover  there are limits to human patienceeven the patience of a bereaved wife this cool question irritated mrs ferrari into expressing herself plainly at last  he discovered lady montbarry and the baron she answered with a burst of hysterical vehemence the baron is no more that vile womans brother than i am the wickedness of those two wretches came to my poor dear husbands knowledge the ladys maid left her place on account of it if ferrari had gone away too he would have been alive at this moment they have killed him i say they have killed him to prevent it from getting to lord montbarrys ears so in short sharp sentences and in louder and louder accents mrs ferrari stated her opinion of the case  still keeping his own view in reserve mr troy listened with an expression of satirical approval  very strongly stated mrs ferrari he said you build up your sentences well you clinch your conclusions in a workmanlike manner if you had been a man you would have made a good lawyeryou would have taken juries by the scruff of their necks complete the case my good ladycomplete the case tell us next who sent you this letter enclosing the banknote the two wretches who murdered mr ferrari would hardly put their hands in their pockets and send you a thousand pounds who is iteh i see the postmark on the letter is venice have you any friend in that interesting city with a large heart and a purse to correspond who has been let into the secret and who wishes to console you anonymously  it was not easy to reply to this mrs ferrari began to feel the first inward approaches of something like hatred towards mr troy i dont understand you sir she answered i dont think this is a joking matter  agnes interfered for the first time she drew her chair a little nearer to her legal counsellor and friend  what is the most probable explanation in your opinion she asked  i shall offend mrs ferrari if i tell you mr troy answered  no sir you wont cried mrs ferrari hating mr troy undisguisedly by this time  the lawyer leaned back in his chair very well he said in his most goodhumoured manner lets have it out observe madam i dont dispute your view of the position of affairs at the palace in venice you have your husbands letters to justify you and you have also the significant fact that lady montbarrys maid did really leave the house we will say then that lord montbarry has presumably been made the victim of a foul wrongthat mr ferrari was the first to find it outand that the guilty persons had reason to fear not only that he would acquaint lord montbarry with his discovery but that he would be a principal witness against them if the scandal was made public in a court of law now mark admitting all this i draw a totally different conclusion from the conclusion at which you have arrived here is your husband left in this miserable household of three under very awkward circumstances for him what does he do but for the banknote and the written message sent to you with it i should say that he had wisely withdrawn himself from association with a disgraceful discovery and exposure by taking secretly to flight the money modifies this viewunfavourably so far as mr ferrari is concerned i still believe he is keeping out of the way but i now say he is paid for keeping out of the wayand that banknote there on the table is the price of his absence sent by the guilty persons to his wife  mrs ferraris watery grey eyes brightened suddenly mrs ferraris dull drabcoloured complexion became enlivened by a glow of brilliant red  its false she cried its a burning shame to speak of my husband in that way  i told you i should offend you said mr troy  agnes interposed once morein the interests of peace she took the offended wifes hand she appealed to the lawyer to reconsider that side of his theory which reflected harshly on ferrari while she was still speaking the servant interrupted her by entering the room with a visitingcard it was the card of henry westwick and there was an ominous request written on it in pencil i bring bad news let me see you for a minute downstairs agnes immediately left the room  alone with mrs ferrari mr troy permitted his natural kindness of heart to show itself on the surface at last he tried to make his peace with the couriers wife  you have every claim my good soul to resent a reflection cast upon your husband he began i may even say that i respect you for speaking so warmly in his defence at the same time remember that i am bound in such a serious matter as this to tell you what is really in my mind i can have no intention of offending you seeing that i am a total stranger to you and to mr ferrari a thousand pounds is a large sum of money and a poor man may excusably be tempted by it to do nothing worse than to keep out of the way for a while my only interest acting on your behalf is to get at the truth if you will give me time i see no reason to despair of finding your husband yet  ferraris wife listened without being convinced her narrow little mind filled to its extreme capacity by her unfavourable opinion of mr troy had no room left for the process of correcting its first impression i am much obliged to you sir was all she said her eyes were more communicativeher eyes added in their language you may say what you please i will never forgive you to my dying day  mr troy gave it up he composedly wheeled his chair around put his hands in his pockets and looked out of window  after an interval of silence the drawingroom door was opened  mr troy wheeled round again briskly to the table expecting to see agnes to his surprise there appeared in her place a perfect stranger to hima gentleman in the prime of life with a marked expression of pain and embarrassment on his handsome face he looked at mr troy and bowed gravely  i am so unfortunate as to have brought news to miss agnes lockwood which has greatly distressed her he said she has retired to her room i am requested to make her excuses and to speak to you in her place  having introduced himself in those terms he noticed mrs ferrari and held out his hand to her kindly it is some years since we last met emily he said i am afraid you have almost forgotten the master henry of old times emily in some little confusion made her acknowledgments and begged to know if she could be of any use to miss lockwood the old nurse is with her henry answered they will be better left together he turned once more to mr troy i ought to tell you he said that my name is henry westwick i am the younger brother of the late lord montbarry  the late lord montbarry mr troy exclaimed  my brother died at venice yesterday evening there is the telegram with that startling answer he handed the paper to mr troy  the message was in these words  lady montbarry venice to stephen robert westwick newburys hotel london it is useless to take the journey lord montbarry died of bronchitis at 840 this evening all needful details by post  was this expected sir the lawyer asked  i cannot say that it has taken us entirely by surprise henry answered my brother stephen who is now the head of the family received a telegram three days since informing him that alarming symptoms had declared themselves and that a second physician had been called in he telegraphed back to say that he had left ireland for london on his way to venice and to direct that any further message might be sent to his hotel the reply came in a second telegram it announced that lord montbarry was in a state of insensibility and that in his brief intervals of consciousness he recognised nobody my brother was advised to wait in london for later information the third telegram is now in your hands that is all i know up to the present time  happening to look at the couriers wife mr troy was struck by the expression of blank fear which showed itself in the womans face  mrs ferrari he said have you heard what mr westwick has just told me  every word of it sir  have you any questions to ask  no sir  you seem to be alarmed the lawyer persisted is it still about your husband  i shall never see my husband again sir i have thought so all along as you know i feel sure of it now  sure of it after what you have just heard  yes sir  can you tell me why  no sir its a feeling i have i cant tell why  oh a feeling mr troy repeated in a tone of compassionate contempt when it comes to feelings my good soul he left the sentence unfinished and rose to take his leave of mr westwick the truth is he began to feel puzzled himself and he did not choose to let mrs ferrari see it accept the expression of my sympathy sir he said to mr westwick politely i wish you good evening  henry turned to mrs ferrari as the lawyer closed the door i have heard of your trouble emily from miss lockwood is there anything i can do to help you  nothing sir thank you perhaps i had better go home after what has happened i will call tomorrow and see if i can be of any use to miss agnes i am very sorry for her she stole away with her formal curtsey her noiseless step and her obstinate resolution to take the gloomiest view of her husbands case  henry westwick looked round him in the solitude of the little drawingroom there was nothing to keep him in the house and yet he lingered in it it was something to be even near agnesto see the things belonging to her that were scattered about the room there in the corner was her chair with her embroidery on the worktable by its side on the little easel near the window was her last drawing not quite finished yet the book she had been reading lay on the sofa with her tiny pencilcase in it to mark the place at which she had left off one after another he looked at the objects that reminded him of the woman whom he lovedtook them up tenderlyand laid them down again with a sigh ah how far how unattainably far from him she was still she will never forget montbarry he thought to himself as he took up his hat to go not one of us feels his death as she feels it miserable miserable wretchhow she loved him  in the street as henry closed the housedoor he was stopped by a passing acquaintancea wearisome inquisitive mandoubly unwelcome to him at that moment sad news westwick this about your brother rather an unexpected death wasnt it we never heard at the club that montbarrys lungs were weak what will the insurance offices do  henry started he had never thought of his brothers life insurance what could the offices do but pay a death by bronchitis certified by two physicians was surely the least disputable of all deaths i wish you hadnt put that question into my head he broke out irritably ah said his friend you think the widow will get the money so do i so do i      chapter vii   some days later the insurance offices two in number received the formal announcement of lord montbarrys death from her ladyships london solicitors the sum insured in each office was five thousand poundson which one years premium only had been paid in the face of such a pecuniary emergency as this the directors thought it desirable to consider their position the medical advisers of the two offices who had recommended the insurance of lord montbarrys life were called into council over their own reports the result excited some interest among persons connected with the business of life insurance without absolutely declining to pay the money the two offices acting in concert decided on sending a commission of inquiry to venice for the purpose of obtaining further information  mr troy received the earliest intelligence of what was going on he wrote at once to communicate his news to agnes adding what he considered to be a valuable hint in these words  you are intimately acquainted i know with lady barville the late lord montbarrys eldest sister the solicitors employed by her husband are also the solicitors to one of the two insurance offices there may possibly be something in the report of the commission of inquiry touching on ferraris disappearance ordinary persons would not be permitted of course to see such a document but a sister of the late lord is so near a relative as to be an exception to general rules if sir theodore barville puts it on that footing the lawyers even if they do not allow his wife to look at the report will at least answer any discreet questions she may ask referring to it let me hear what you think of this suggestion at your earliest convenience  the reply was received by return of post agnes declined to avail herself of mr troys proposal  my interference innocent as it was she wrote has already been productive of such deplorable results that i cannot and dare not stir any further in the case of ferrari if i had not consented to let that unfortunate man refer to me by name the late lord montbarry would never have engaged him and his wife would have been spared the misery and suspense from which she is suffering now i would not even look at the report to which you allude if it was placed in my handsi have heard more than enough already of that hideous life in the palace at venice if mrs ferrari chooses to address herself to lady barville with your assistance that is of course quite another thing but even in this case i must make it a positive condition that my name shall not be mentioned forgive me dear mr troy i am very unhappy and very unreasonablebut i am only a woman and you must not expect too much from me  foiled in this direction the lawyer next advised making the attempt to discover the present address of lady montbarrys english maid this excellent suggestion had one drawback it could only be carried out by spending moneyand there was no money to spend mrs ferrari shrank from the bare idea of making any use of the thousandpound note it had been deposited in the safe keeping of a bank if it was even mentioned in her hearing she shuddered and referred to it with melodramatic fervour as my husbands bloodmoney  so under stress of circumstances the attempt to solve the mystery of ferraris disappearance was suspended for a while    it was the last month of the year 1860 the commission of inquiry was already at work having begun its investigations on december 6 on the 10th the term for which the late lord montbarry had hired the venetian palace expired news by telegram reached the insurance offices that lady montbarry had been advised by her lawyers to leave for london with as little delay as possible baron rivar it was believed would accompany her to england but would not remain in that country unless his services were absolutely required by her ladyship the baron well known as an enthusiastic student of chemistry had heard of certain recent discoveries in connection with that science in the united states and was anxious to investigate them personally  these items of news collected by mr troy were duly communicated to mrs ferrari whose anxiety about her husband made her a frequent a too frequent visitor at the lawyers office she attempted to relate what she had heard to her good friend and protectress agnes steadily refused to listen and positively forbade any further conversation relating to lord montbarrys wife now that lord montbarry was no more you have mr troy to advise you she said and you are welcome to what little money i can spare if money is wanted all i ask in return is that you will not distress me i am trying to separate myself from remembrances her voice faltered she paused to control herselffrom remembrances she resumed which are sadder than ever since i have heard of lord montbarrys death help me by your silence to recover my spirits if i can let me hear nothing more until i can rejoice with you that your husband is found  time advanced to the 13th of the month and more information of the interesting sort reached mr troy the labours of the insurance commission had come to an endthe report had been received from venice on that day      chapter viii   on the 14th the directors and their legal advisers met for the reading of the report with closed doors these were the terms in which the commissioners related the results of their inquiry private and confidential  we have the honour to inform our directors that we arrived in venice on december 6 1860 on the same day we proceeded to the palace inhabited by lord montbarry at the time of his last illness and death  we were received with all possible courtesy by lady montbarrys brother baron rivar my sister was her husbands only attendant throughout his illness the baron informed us she is overwhelmed by grief and fatigueor she would have been here to receive you personally what are your wishes gentlemen and what can i do for you in her ladyships place  in accordance with our instructions we answered that the death and burial of lord montbarry abroad made it desirable to obtain more complete information relating to his illness and to the circumstances which had attended it than could be conveyed in writing we explained that the law provided for the lapse of a certain interval of time before the payment of the sum assured and we expressed our wish to conduct the inquiry with the most respectful consideration for her ladyships feelings and for the convenience of any other members of the family inhabiting the house  to this the baron replied i am the only member of the family living here and i and the palace are entirely at your disposal from first to last we found this gentleman perfectly straightforward and most amiably willing to assist us  with the one exception of her ladyships room we went over the whole of the palace the same day it is an immense place only partially furnished the first floor and part of the second floor were the portions of it that had been inhabited by lord montbarry and the members of the household we saw the bedchamber at one extremity of the palace in which his lordship died and the small room communicating with it which he used as a study next to this was a large apartment or hall the doors of which he habitually kept locked his object being as we were informed to pursue his studies uninterruptedly in perfect solitude on the other side of the large hall were the bedchamber occupied by her ladyship and the dressingroom in which the maid slept previous to her departure for england beyond these were the dining and reception rooms opening into an antechamber which gave access to the grand staircase of the palace  the only inhabited rooms on the second floor were the sittingroom and bedroom occupied by baron rivar and another room at some distance from it which had been the bedroom of the courier ferrari  the rooms on the third floor and on the basement were completely unfurnished and in a condition of great neglect we inquired if there was anything to be seen below the basementand we were at once informed that there were vaults beneath which we were at perfect liberty to visit  we went down so as to leave no part of the palace unexplored the vaults were it was believed used as dungeons in the old timessay some centuries since air and light were only partially admitted to these dismal places by two long shafts of winding construction which communicated with the back yard of the palace and the openings of which high above the ground were protected by iron gratings the stone stairs leading down into the vaults could be closed at will by a heavy trapdoor in the back hall which we found open the baron himself led the way down the stairs we remarked that it might be awkward if that trapdoor fell down and closed the opening behind us the baron smiled at the idea dont be alarmed gentlemen he said the door is safe i had an interest in seeing to it myself when we first inhabited the palace my favourite study is the study of experimental chemistryand my workshop since we have been in venice is down here  these last words explained a curious smell in the vaults which we noticed the moment we entered them we can only describe the smell by saying that it was of a twofold sortfaintly aromatic as it were in its first effect but with some afterodour very sickening in our nostrils the barons furnaces and retorts and other things were all there to speak for themselves together with some packages of chemicals having the name and address of the person who had supplied them plainly visible on their labels not a pleasant place for study baron rivar observed but my sister is timid she has a horror of chemical smells and explosionsand she has banished me to these lower regions so that my experiments may neither be smelt nor heard he held out his hands on which we had noticed that he wore gloves in the house accidents will happen sometimes he said no matter how careful a man may be i burnt my hands severely in trying a new combination the other day and they are only recovering now  we mention these otherwise unimportant incidents in order to show that our exploration of the palace was not impeded by any attempt at concealment we were even admitted to her ladyships own roomon a subsequent occasion when she went out to take the air our instructions recommended us to examine his lordships residence because the extreme privacy of his life at venice and the remarkable departure of the only two servants in the house might have some suspicious connection with the nature of his death we found nothing to justify suspicion  as to his lordships retired way of life we have conversed on the subject with the consul and the bankerthe only two strangers who held any communication with him he called once at the bank to obtain money on his letter of credit and excused himself from accepting an invitation to visit the banker at his private residence on the ground of delicate health his lordship wrote to the same effect on sending his card to the consul to excuse himself from personally returning that gentlemans visit to the palace we have seen the letter and we beg to offer the following copy of it many years passed in india have injured my constitution i have ceased to go into society the one occupation of my life now is the study of oriental literature the air of italy is better for me than the air of england or i should never have left home pray accept the apologies of a student and an invalid the active part of my life is at an end the selfseclusion of his lordship seems to us to be explained in these brief lines we have not however on that account spared our inquiries in other directions nothing to excite a suspicion of anything wrong has come to our knowledge  as to the departure of the ladys maid we have seen the womans receipt for her wages in which it is expressly stated that she left lady montbarrys service because she disliked the continent and wished to get back to her own country this is not an uncommon result of taking english servants to foreign parts lady montbarry has informed us that she abstained from engaging another maid in consequence of the extreme dislike which his lordship expressed to having strangers in the house in the state of his health at that time  the disappearance of the courier ferrari is in itself unquestionably a suspicious circumstance neither her ladyship nor the baron can explain it and no investigation that we could make has thrown the smallest light on this event or has justified us in associating it directly or indirectly with the object of our inquiry we have even gone the length of examining the portmanteau which ferrari left behind him it contains nothing but clothes and linenno money and not even a scrap of paper in the pockets of the clothes the portmanteau remains in charge of the police  we have also found opportunities of speaking privately to the old woman who attends to the rooms occupied by her ladyship and the baron she was recommended to fill this situation by the keeper of the restaurant who has supplied the meals to the family throughout the period of their residence at the palace her character is most favourably spoken of unfortunately her limited intelligence makes her of no value as a witness we were patient and careful in questioning her and we found her perfectly willing to answer us but we could elicit nothing which is worth including in the present report  on the second day of our inquiries we had the honour of an interview with lady montbarry her ladyship looked miserably worn and ill and seemed to be quite at a loss to understand what we wanted with her baron rivar who introduced us explained the nature of our errand in venice and took pains to assure her that it was a purely formal duty on which we were engaged having satisfied her ladyship on this point he discreetly left the room  the questions which we addressed to lady montbarry related mainly of course to his lordships illness the answers given with great nervousness of manner but without the slightest appearance of reserve informed us of the facts that follow  lord montbarry had been out of order for some time pastnervous and irritable he first complained of having taken cold on november 13 last he passed a wakeful and feverish night and remained in bed the next day her ladyship proposed sending for medical advice he refused to allow her to do this saying that he could quite easily be his own doctor in such a trifling matter as a cold some hot lemonade was made at his request with a view to producing perspiration lady montbarrys maid having left her at that time the courier ferrari then the only servant in the house went out to buy the lemons her ladyship made the drink with her own hands it was successful in producing perspirationand lord montbarry had some hours of sleep afterwards later in the day having need of ferraris services lady montbarry rang for him the bell was not answered baron rivar searched for the man in the palace and out of it in vain from that time forth not a trace of ferrari could be discovered this happened on november 14  on the night of the 14th the feverish symptoms accompanying his lordships cold returned they were in part perhaps attributable to the annoyance and alarm caused by ferraris mysterious disappearance it had been impossible to conceal the circumstance as his lordship rang repeatedly for the courier insisting that the man should relieve lady montbarry and the baron by taking their places during the night at his bedside  on the 15th the day on which the old woman first came to do the housework his lordship complained of sore throat and of a feeling of oppression on the chest on this day and again on the 16th her ladyship and the baron entreated him to see a doctor he still refused i dont want strange faces about me my cold will run its course in spite of the doctorthat was his answer on the 17th he was so much worse that it was decided to send for medical help whether he liked it or not baron rivar after inquiry at the consuls secured the services of doctor bruno well known as an eminent physician in venice with the additional recommendation of having resided in england and having made himself acquainted with english forms of medical practice    thus far our account of his lordships illness has been derived from statements made by lady montbarry the narrative will now be most fitly continued in the language of the doctors own report herewith subjoined  my medical diary informs me that i first saw the english lord montbarry on november 17 he was suffering from a sharp attack of bronchitis some precious time had been lost through his obstinate objection to the presence of a medical man at his bedside generally speaking he appeared to be in a delicate state of health his nervous system was out of orderhe was at once timid and contradictory when i spoke to him in english he answered in italian and when i tried him in italian he went back to english it mattered littlethe malady had already made such progress that he could only speak a few words at a time and those in a whisper  i at once applied the necessary remedies copies of my prescriptions with translation into english accompany the present statement and are left to speak for themselves  for the next three days i was in constant attendance on my patient he answered to the remedies employedimproving slowly but decidedly i could conscientiously assure lady montbarry that no danger was to be apprehended thus far she was indeed a most devoted wife i vainly endeavoured to induce her to accept the services of a competent nurse she would allow nobody to attend on her husband but herself night and day this estimable woman was at his bedside in her brief intervals of repose her brother watched the sick man in her place this brother was i must say very good company in the intervals when we had time for a little talk he dabbled in chemistry down in the horrid underwater vaults of the palace and he wanted to show me some of his experiments i have enough of chemistry in writing prescriptionsand i declined he took it quite goodhumouredly  i am straying away from my subject let me return to the sick lord  up to the 20th then things went well enough i was quite unprepared for the disastrous change that showed itself when i paid lord montbarry my morning visit on the 21st he had relapsed and seriously relapsed examining him to discover the cause i found symptoms of pneumoniathat is to say in unmedical language inflammation of the substance of the lungs he breathed with difficulty and was only partially able to relieve himself by coughing i made the strictest inquiries and was assured that his medicine had been administered as carefully as usual and that he had not been exposed to any changes of temperature it was with great reluctance that i added to lady montbarrys distress but i felt bound when she suggested a consultation with another physician to own that i too thought there was really need for it  her ladyship instructed me to spare no expense and to get the best medical opinion in italy the best opinion was happily within our reach the first and foremost of italian physicians is torello of padua i sent a special messenger for the great man he arrived on the evening of the 21st and confirmed my opinion that pneumonia had set in and that our patients life was in danger i told him what my treatment of the case had been and he approved of it in every particular he made some valuable suggestions and at lady montbarrys express request he consented to defer his return to padua until the following morning  we both saw the patient at intervals in the course of the night the disease steadily advancing set our utmost resistance at defiance in the morning doctor torello took his leave i can be of no further use he said to me the man is past all helpand he ought to know it  later in the day i warned my lord as gently as i could that his time had come i am informed that there are serious reasons for my stating what passed between us on this occasion in detail and without any reserve i comply with the request  lord montbarry received the intelligence of his approaching death with becoming composure but with a certain doubt he signed to me to put my ear to his mouth he whispered faintly are you sure it was no time to deceive him i said positively sure he waited a little gasping for breath and then he whispered again feel under my pillow i found under his pillow a letter sealed and stamped ready for the post his next words were just audible and no morepost it yourself i answered of course that i would do soand i did post the letter with my own hand i looked at the address it was directed to a lady in london the street i cannot remember the name i can perfectly recall it was an italian namemrs ferrari  that night my lord nearly died of asphyxia i got him through it for the time and his eyes showed that he understood me when i told him the next morning that i had posted the letter this was his last effort of consciousness when i saw him again he was sunk in apathy he lingered in a state of insensibility supported by stimulants until the 25th and died unconscious to the last on the evening of that day  as to the cause of his death it seems if i may be excused for saying so simply absurd to ask the question bronchitis terminating in pneumoniathere is no more doubt that this and this only was the malady of which he expired than that two and two make four doctor torellos own note of the case is added here to a duplicate of my certificate in order as i am informed to satisfy some english offices in which his lordships life was insured the english offices must have been founded by that celebrated saint and doubter mentioned in the new testament whose name was thomas    doctor brunos evidence ends here  reverting for a moment to our inquiries addressed to lady montbarry we have to report that she can give us no information on the subject of the letter which the doctor posted at lord montbarrys request when his lordship wrote it what it contained why he kept it a secret from lady montbarry and from the baron also and why he should write at all to the wife of his courier these are questions to which we find it simply impossible to obtain any replies it seems even useless to say that the matter is open to suspicion suspicion implies conjecture of some kindand the letter under my lords pillow baffles all conjecture application to mrs ferrari may perhaps clear up the mystery her residence in london will be easily discovered at the italian couriers office golden square  having arrived at the close of the present report we have now to draw your attention to the conclusion which is justified by the results of our investigation  the plain question before our directors and ourselves appears to be this has the inquiry revealed any extraordinary circumstances which render the death of lord montbarry open to suspicion the inquiry has revealed extraordinary circumstances beyond all doubtsuch as the disappearance of ferrari the remarkable absence of the customary establishment of servants in the house and the mysterious letter which his lordship asked the doctor to post but where is the proof that any one of these circumstances is associatedsuspiciously and directly associatedwith the only event which concerns us the event of lord montbarrys death in the absence of any such proof and in the face of the evidence of two eminent physicians it is impossible to dispute the statement on the certificate that his lordship died a natural death we are bound therefore to report that there are no valid grounds for refusing the payment of the sum for which the late lord montbarrys life was assured  we shall send these lines to you by the post of tomorrow december 10 leaving time to receive your further instructions if any in reply to our telegram of this evening announcing the conclusion of the inquiry      chapter ix   now my good creature whatever you have to say to me out with it at once i dont want to hurry you needlessly but these are business hours and i have other peoples affairs to attend to besides yours  addressing ferraris wife with his usual blunt goodhumour in these terms mr troy registered the lapse of time by a glance at the watch on his desk and then waited to hear what his client had to say to him  its something more sir about the letter with the thousandpound note mrs ferrari began i have found out who sent it to me  mr troy started this is news indeed he said who sent you the letter  lord montbarry sent it sir  it was not easy to take mr troy by surprise but mrs ferrari threw him completely off his balance for a while he could only look at her in silent surprise nonsense he said as soon as he had recovered himself there is some mistakeit cant be  there is no mistake mrs ferrari rejoined in her most positive manner two gentlemen from the insurance offices called on me this morning to see the letter they were completely puzzledespecially when they heard of the banknote inside but they know who sent the letter his lordships doctor in venice posted it at his lordships request go to the gentlemen yourself sir if you dont believe me they were polite enough to ask if i could account for lord montbarrys writing to me and sending me the money i gave them my opinion directlyi said it was like his lordships kindness  like his lordships kindness mr troy repeated in blank amazement  yes sir lord montbarry knew me like all the other members of his family when i was at school on the estate in ireland if he could have done it he would have protected my poor dear husband but he was helpless himself in the hands of my lady and the baronand the only kind thing he could do was to provide for me in my widowhood like the true nobleman he was  a very pretty explanation said mr troy what did your visitors from the insurance offices think of it  they asked if i had any proof of my husbands death  and what did you say  i said i give you better than proof gentlemen i give you my positive opinion  that satisfied them of course  they didnt say so in words sir they looked at each otherand wished me goodmorning  well mrs ferrari unless you have some more extraordinary news for me i think i shall wish you goodmorning too i can take a note of your information very startling information i own and in the absence of proof i can do no more  i can provide you with proof sirif that is all you want said mrs ferrari with great dignity i only wish to know first whether the law justifies me in doing it you may have seen in the fashionable intelligence of the newspapers that lady montbarry has arrived in london at newburys hotel i propose to go and see her  the deuce you do may i ask for what purpose  mrs ferrari answered in a mysterious whisper for the purpose of catching her in a trap i shant send in my namei shall announce myself as a person on business and the first words i say to her will be these i come my lady to acknowledge the receipt of the money sent to ferraris widow ah you may well start mr troy it almost takes you off your guard doesnt it make your mind easy sir i shall find the proof that everybody asks me for in her guilty face let her only change colour by the shadow of a shadelet her eyes only drop for half an instanti shall discover her the one thing i want to know is does the law permit it  the law permits it mr troy answered gravely but whether her ladyship will permit it is quite another question have you really courage enough mrs ferrari to carry out this notable scheme of yours you have been described to me by miss lockwood as rather a nervous timid sort of personand if i may trust my own observation i should say you justify the description  if you had lived in the country sir instead of living in london mrs ferrari replied you would sometimes have seen even a sheep turn on a dog i am far from saying that i am a bold womanquite the reverse but when i stand in that wretchs presence and think of my murdered husband the one of us two who is likely to be frightened is not me i am going there now sir you shall hear how it ends i wish you goodmorning  with those brave words the couriers wife gathered her mantle about her and walked out of the room  mr troy smilednot satirically but compassionately the little simpleton he thought to himself if half of what they say of lady montbarry is true mrs ferrari and her trap have but a poor prospect before them i wonder how it will end  all mr troys experience failed to forewarn him of how it did end      chapter x   in the mean time mrs ferrari held to her resolution she went straight from mr troys office to newburys hotel  lady montbarry was at home and alone but the authorities of the hotel hesitated to disturb her when they found that the visitor declined to mention her name her ladyships new maid happened to cross the hall while the matter was still in debate she was a frenchwoman and on being appealed to she settled the question in the swift easy rational french way madames appearance was perfectly respectable madame might have reasons for not mentioning her name which miladi might approve in any case there being no orders forbidding the introduction of a strange lady the matter clearly rested between madame and miladi would madame therefore be good enough to follow miladis maid up the stairs  in spite of her resolution mrs ferraris heart beat as if it would burst out of her bosom when her conductress led her into an anteroom and knocked at a door opening into a room beyond but it is remarkable that persons of sensitivelynervous organisation are the very persons who are capable of forcing themselves apparently by the exercise of a spasmodic effort of will into the performance of acts of the most audacious courage a low grave voice from the inner room said come in the maid opening the door announced a person to see you miladi on business and immediately retired in the one instant while these events passed timid little mrs ferrari mastered her own throbbing heart stepped over the threshold conscious of her clammy hands dry lips and burning head and stood in the presence of lord montbarrys widow to all outward appearance as supremely selfpossessed as her ladyship herself  it was still early in the afternoon but the light in the room was dim the blinds were drawn down lady montbarry sat with her back to the windows as if even the subdued daylight were disagreeable to her she had altered sadly for the worse in her personal appearance since the memorable day when doctor wybrow had seen her in his consultingroom her beauty was goneher face had fallen away to mere skin and bone the contrast between her ghastly complexion and her steely glittering black eyes was more startling than ever robed in dismal black relieved only by the brilliant whiteness of her widows capreclining in a pantherlike suppleness of attitude on a little green sofashe looked at the stranger who had intruded on her with a moments languid curiosity then dropped her eyes again to the handscreen which she held between her face and the fire i dont know you she said what do you want with me  mrs ferrari tried to answer her first burst of courage had already worn itself out the bold words that she had determined to speak were living words still in her mind but they died on her lips  there was a moment of silence lady montbarry looked round again at the speechless stranger are you deaf she asked there was another pause lady montbarry quietly looked back again at the screen and put another question do you want money  money that one word roused the sinking spirit of the couriers wife she recovered her courage she found her voice look at me my lady if you please she said with a sudden outbreak of audacity  lady montbarry looked round for the third time the fatal words passed mrs ferraris lips  i come my lady to acknowledge the receipt of the money sent to ferraris widow  lady montbarrys glittering black eyes rested with steady attention on the woman who had addressed her in those terms not the faintest expression of confusion or alarm not even a momentary flutter of interest stirred the deadly stillness of her face she reposed as quietly she held the screen as composedly as ever the test had been tried and had utterly failed  there was another silence lady montbarry considered with herself the smile that came slowly and went away suddenlythe smile at once so sad and so cruelshowed itself on her thin lips she lifted her screen and pointed with it to a seat at the farther end of the room be so good as to take that chair she said  helpless under her first bewildering sense of failurenot knowing what to say or what to do nextmrs ferrari mechanically obeyed lady montbarry rising on the sofa for the first time watched her with undisguised scrutiny as she crossed the roomthen sank back into a reclining position once more no she said to herself the woman walks steadily she is not intoxicatedthe only other possibility is that she may be mad  she had spoken loud enough to be heard stung by the insult mrs ferrari instantly answered her i am no more drunk or mad than you are  no said lady montbarry then you are only insolent the ignorant english mind i have observed is apt to be insolent in the exercise of unrestrained english liberty this is very noticeable to us foreigners among you people in the streets of course i cant be insolent to you in return i hardly know what to say to you my maid was imprudent in admitting you so easily to my room i suppose your respectable appearance misled her i wonder who you are you mentioned the name of a courier who left us very strangely was he married by any chance are you his wife and do you know where he is  mrs ferraris indignation burst its way through all restraints she advanced to the sofa she feared nothing in the fervour and rage of her reply  i am his widowand you know it you wicked woman ah it was an evil hour when miss lockwood recommended my husband to be his lordships courier  before she could add another word lady montbarry sprang from the sofa with the stealthy suddenness of a catseized her by both shouldersand shook her with the strength and frenzy of a madwoman you lie you lie you lie she dropped her hold at the third repetition of the accusation and threw up her hands wildly with a gesture of despair oh jesu maria is it possible she cried can the courier have come to me through that woman she turned like lightning on mrs ferrari and stopped her as she was escaping from the room stay here you foolstay here and answer me if you cry out as sure as the heavens are above you ill strangle you with my own hands sit down againand fear nothing wretch it is i who am frightenedfrightened out of my senses confess that you lied when you used miss lockwoods name just now no i dont believe you on your oath i will believe nobody but miss lockwood herself where does she live tell me that you noxious stinging little insectand you may go terrified as she was mrs ferrari hesitated lady montbarry lifted her hands threateningly with the long lean yellowwhite fingers outspread and crooked at the tips mrs ferrari shrank at the sight of them and gave the address lady montbarry pointed contemptuously to the doorthen changed her mind no not yet you will tell miss lockwood what has happened and she may refuse to see me i will go there at once and you shall go with me as far as the housenot inside of it sit down again i am going to ring for my maid turn your back to the dooryour cowardly face is not fit to be seen  she rang the bell the maid appeared  my cloak and bonnetinstantly  the maid produced the cloak and bonnet from the bedroom  a cab at the doorbefore i can count ten  the maid vanished lady montbarry surveyed herself in the glass and wheeled round again with her catlike suddenness to mrs ferrari  i look more than half dead already dont i she said with a grim outburst of irony give me your arm  she took mrs ferraris arm and left the room you have nothing to fear so long as you obey she whispered on the way downstairs you leave me at miss lockwoods door and never see me again  in the hall they were met by the landlady of the hotel lady montbarry graciously presented her companion my good friend mrs ferrari i am so glad to have seen her the landlady accompanied them to the door the cab was waiting get in first good mrs ferrari said her ladyship and tell the man where to go  they were driven away lady montbarrys variable humour changed again with a low groan of misery she threw herself back in the cab lost in her own dark thoughts as careless of the woman whom she had bent to her iron will as if no such person sat by her side she preserved a sinister silence until they reached the house where miss lockwood lodged in an instant she roused herself to action she opened the door of the cab and closed it again on mrs ferrari before the driver could get off his box  take that lady a mile farther on her way home she said as she paid the man his fare the next moment she had knocked at the housedoor is miss lockwood at home yes maam she stepped over the thresholdthe door closed on her  which way maam asked the driver of the cab  mrs ferrari put her hand to her head and tried to collect her thoughts could she leave her friend and benefactress helpless at lady montbarrys mercy she was still vainly endeavouring to decide on the course that she ought to followwhen a gentleman stopping at miss lockwoods door happened to look towards the cabwindow and saw her  are you going to call on miss agnes too he asked  it was henry westwick mrs ferrari clasped her hands in gratitude as she recognised him  go in sir she cried go in directly that dreadful woman is with miss agnes go and protect her  what woman henry asked  the answer literally struck him speechless with amazement and indignation in his face he looked at mrs ferrari as she pronounced the hated name of lady montbarry ill see to it was all he said he knocked at the housedoor and he too in his turn was let in      chapter xi   lady montbarry miss  agnes was writing a letter when the servant astonished her by announcing the visitors name her first impulse was to refuse to see the woman who had intruded on her but lady montbarry had taken care to follow close on the servants heels before agnes could speak she had entered the room  i beg to apologise for my intrusion miss lockwood i have a question to ask you in which i am very much interested no one can answer me but yourself in low hesitating tones with her glittering black eyes bent modestly on the ground lady montbarry opened the interview in those words  without answering agnes pointed to a chair she could do this and for the time she could do no more all that she had read of the hidden and sinister life in the palace at venice all that she had heard of montbarrys melancholy death and burial in a foreign land all that she knew of the mystery of ferraris disappearance rushed into her mind when the blackrobed figure confronted her standing just inside the door the strange conduct of lady montbarry added a new perplexity to the doubts and misgivings that troubled her there stood the adventuress whose character had left its mark on society all over europethe fury who had terrified mrs ferrari at the hotelinconceivably transformed into a timid shrinking woman lady montbarry had not once ventured to look at agnes since she had made her way into the room advancing to take the chair that had been pointed out to her she hesitated put her hand on the rail to support herself and still remained standing please give me a moment to compose myself she said faintly her head sank on her bosom she stood before agnes like a conscious culprit before a merciless judge  the silence that followed was literally the silence of fear on both sides in the midst of it the door was opened once moreand henry westwick appeared  he looked at lady montbarry with a moments steady attentionbowed to her with formal politenessand passed on in silence at the sight of her husbands brother the sinking spirit of the woman sprang to life again her drooping figure became erect her eyes met westwicks look brightly defiant she returned his bow with an icy smile of contempt  henry crossed the room to agnes  is lady montbarry here by your invitation he asked quietly  no  do you wish to see her  it is very painful to me to see her  he turned and looked at his sisterinlaw do you hear that he asked coldly  i hear it she answered more coldly still  your visit is to say the least of it illtimed  your interference is to say the least of it out of place  with that retort lady montbarry approached agnes the presence of henry westwick seemed at once to relieve and embolden her permit me to ask my question miss lockwood she said with graceful courtesy it is nothing to embarrass you when the courier ferrari applied to my late husband for employment did you her resolution failed her before she could say more she sank trembling into the nearest chair and after a moments struggle composed herself again did you permit ferrari she resumed to make sure of being chosen for our courier by using your name  agnes did not reply with her customary directness trifling as it was the reference to montbarry proceeding from that woman of all others confused and agitated her  i have known ferraris wife for many years she began and i take an interest  lady montbarry abruptly lifted her hands with a gesture of entreaty ah miss lockwood dont waste time by talking of his wife answer my plain question plainly  let me answer her henry whispered i will undertake to speak plainly enough  agnes refused by a gesture lady montbarrys interruption had roused her sense of what was due to herself she resumed her reply in plainer terms  when ferrari wrote to the late lord montbarry she said he did certainly mention my name  even now she had innocently failed to see the object which her visitor had in view lady montbarrys impatience became ungovernable she started to her feet and advanced to agnes  was it with your knowledge and permission that ferrari used your name she asked the whole soul of my question is in that for gods sake answer meyes or no  yes  that one word struck lady montbarry as a blow might have struck her the fierce life that had animated her face the instant before faded out of it suddenly and left her like a woman turned to stone she stood mechanically confronting agnes with a stillness so wrapt and perfect that not even the breath she drew was perceptible to the two persons who were looking at her  henry spoke to her roughly rouse yourself he said you have received your answer  she looked round at him i have received my sentence she rejoinedand turned slowly to leave the room  to henrys astonishment agnes stopped her wait a moment lady montbarry i have something to ask on my side you have spoken of ferrari i wish to speak of him too  lady montbarry bent her head in silence her hand trembled as she took out her handkerchief and passed it over her forehead agnes detected the trembling and shrank back a step is the subject painful to you she asked timidly  still silent lady montbarry invited her by a wave of the hand to go on henry approached attentively watching his sisterinlaw agnes went on  no trace of ferrari has been discovered in england she said have you any news of him and will you tell me if you have heard anything in mercy to his wife  lady montbarrys thin lips suddenly relaxed into their sad and cruel smile  why do you ask me about the lost courier she said you will know what has become of him miss lockwood when the time is ripe for it  agnes started i dont understand you she said how shall i know will some one tell me  some one will tell you  henry could keep silence no longer perhaps your ladyship may be the person he interrupted with ironical politeness  she answered him with contemptuous ease you may be right mr westwick one day or another i may be the person who tells miss lockwood what has become of ferrari if she stopped with her eyes fixed on agnes  if what henry asked  if miss lockwood forces me to it  agnes listened in astonishment force you to it she repeated how can i do that do you mean to say my will is stronger than yours  do you mean to say that the candle doesnt burn the moth when the moth flies into it lady montbarry rejoined have you ever heard of such a thing as the fascination of terror i am drawn to you by a fascination of terror i have no right to visit you i have no wish to visit you you are my enemy for the first time in my life against my own will i submit to my enemy see i am waiting because you told me to waitand the fear of you i swear it creeps through me while i stand here oh dont let me excite your curiosity or your pity follow the example of mr westwick be hard and brutal and unforgiving like him grant me my release tell me to go  the frank and simple nature of agnes could discover but one intelligible meaning in this strange outbreak  you are mistaken in thinking me your enemy she said the wrong you did me when you gave your hand to lord montbarry was not intentionally done i forgave you my sufferings in his lifetime i forgive you even more freely now that he has gone  henry heard her with mingled emotions of admiration and distress say no more he exclaimed you are too good to her she is not worthy of it  the interruption passed unheeded by lady montbarry the simple words in which agnes had replied seemed to have absorbed the whole attention of this strangelychangeable woman as she listened her face settled slowly into an expression of hard and tearless sorrow there was a marked change in her voice when she spoke next it expressed that last worst resignation which has done with hope  you good innocent creature she said what does your amiable forgiveness matter what are your poor little wrongs in the reckoning for greater wrongs which is demanded of me i am not trying to frighten you i am only miserable about myself do you know what it is to have a firm presentiment of calamity that is coming to youand yet to hope that your own positive conviction will not prove true when i first met you before my marriage and first felt your influence over me i had that hope it was a starveling sort of hope that lived a lingering life in me until today you struck it dead when you answered my question about ferrari  how have i destroyed your hopes agnes asked what connection is there between my permitting ferrari to use my name to lord montbarry and the strange and dreadful things you are saying to me now  the time is near miss lockwood when you will discover that for yourself in the mean while you shall know what my fear of you is in the plainest words i can find on the day when i took your hero from you and blighted your lifei am firmly persuaded of ityou were made the instrument of the retribution that my sins of many years had deserved oh such things have happened before today one person has before now been the means of innocently ripening the growth of evil in another you have done that alreadyand you have more to do yet you have still to bring me to the day of discovery and to the punishment that is my doom we shall meet againhere in england or there in venice where my husband diedand meet for the last time  in spite of her better sense in spite of her natural superiority to superstitions of all kinds agnes was impressed by the terrible earnestness with which those words were spoken she turned pale as she looked at henry do you understand her she asked  nothing is easier than to understand her he replied contemptuously she knows what has become of ferrari and she is confusing you in a cloud of nonsense because she darent own the truth let her go  if a dog had been under one of the chairs and had barked lady montbarry could not have proceeded more impenetrably with the last words she had to say to agnes  advise your interesting mrs ferrari to wait a little longer she said you will know what has become of her husband and you will tell her there will be nothing to alarm you some trifling event will bring us together the next timeas trifling i dare say as the engagement of ferrari sad nonsense mr westwick is it not but you make allowances for women we all talk nonsense good morning miss lockwood  she opened the doorsuddenly as if she was afraid of being called back for the second timeand left them      chapter xii   do you think she is mad agnes asked  i think she is simply wicked false superstitious inveterately cruelbut not mad i believe her main motive in coming here was to enjoy the luxury of frightening you  she has frightened me i am ashamed to own itbut so it is  henry looked at her hesitated for a moment and seated himself on the sofa by her side  i am very anxious about you agnes he said but for the fortunate chance which led me to call here todaywho knows what that vile woman might not have said or done if she had found you alone my dear you are leading a sadly unprotected solitary life i dont like to think of it i want to see it changedespecially after what has happened today no no it is useless to tell me that you have your old nurse she is too old she is not in your rank of lifethere is no sufficient protection in the companionship of such a person for a lady in your position dont mistake me agnes what i say i say in the sincerity of my devotion to you he paused and took her hand she made a feeble effort to withdraw itand yielded will the day never come he pleaded when the privilege of protecting you may be mine when you will be the pride and joy of my life as long as my life lasts he pressed her hand gently she made no reply the colour came and went on her face her eyes were turned away from him have i been so unhappy as to offend you he asked  she answered thatshe said almost in a whisper no  have i distressed you  you have made me think of the sad days that are gone she said no more she only tried to withdraw her hand from his for the second time he still held it he lifted it to his lips    can i never make you think of other days than thoseof the happier days to come or if you must think of the time that is passed can you not look back to the time when i first loved you  she sighed as he put the question spare me henry she answered sadly say no more  the colour again rose in her cheeks her hand trembled in his she looked lovely with her eyes cast down and her bosom heaving gently at that moment he would have given everything he had in the world to take her in his arms and kiss her some mysterious sympathy passing from his hand to hers seemed to tell her what was in his mind she snatched her hand away and suddenly looked up at him the tears were in her eyes she said nothing she let her eyes speak for her they warned himwithout anger without unkindnessbut still they warned him to press her no further that day  only tell me that i am forgiven he said as he rose from the sofa  yes she answered quietly you are forgiven  i have not lowered myself in your estimation agnes  oh no  do you wish me to leave you  she rose in her turn from the sofa and walked to her writingtable before she replied the unfinished letter which she had been writing when lady montbarry interrupted her lay open on the blottingbook as she looked at the letter and then looked at henry the smile that charmed everybody showed itself in her face  you must not go just yet she said i have something to tell you i hardly know how to express it the shortest way perhaps will be to let you find it out for yourself you have been speaking of my lonely unprotected life here it is not a very happy life henryi own that she paused observing the growing anxiety of his expression as he looked at her with a shy satisfaction that perplexed him do you know that i have anticipated your idea she went on i am going to make a great change in my lifeif your brother stephen and his wife will only consent to it she opened the desk of the writingtable while she spoke took a letter out and handed it to henry  he received it from her mechanically vague doubts which he hardly understood himself kept him silent it was impossible that the change in her life of which she had spoken could mean that she was about to be marriedand yet he was conscious of a perfectly unreasonable reluctance to open the letter their eyes met she smiled again look at the address she said you ought to know the handwritingbut i dare say you dont  he looked at the address it was in the large irregular uncertain writing of a child he opened the letter instantly  dear aunt agnesour governess is going away she has had money left to her and a house of her own we have had cake and wine to drink her health you promised to be our governess if we wanted another we want you mamma knows nothing about this please come before mamma can get another governess your loving lucy who writes this clara and blanche have tried to write too but they are too young to do it they blot the paper  your eldest niece agnes explained as henry looked at her in amazement the children used to call me aunt when i was staying with their mother in ireland in the autumn the three girls were my inseparable companionsthey are the most charming children i know it is quite true that i offered to be their governess if they ever wanted one on the day when i left them to return to london i was writing to propose it to their mother just before you came  not seriously henry exclaimed  agnes placed her unfinished letter in his hand enough of it had been written to show that she did seriously propose to enter the household of mr and mrs stephen westwick as governess to their children henrys bewilderment was not to be expressed in words  they wont believe you are in earnest he said  why not agnes asked quietly  you are my brother stephens cousin you are his wifes old friend  all the more reason henry for trusting me with the charge of their children  but you are their equal you are not obliged to get your living by teaching there is something absurd in your entering their service as a governess  what is there absurd in it the children love me the mother loves me the father has shown me innumerable instances of his true friendship and regard i am the very woman for the placeand as to my education i must have completely forgotten it indeed if i am not fit to teach three children the eldest of whom is only eleven years old you say i am their equal are there no other women who serve as governesses and who are the equals of the persons whom they serve besides i dont know that i am their equal have i not heard that your brother stephen was the next heir to the title will he not be the new lord never mind answering me we wont dispute whether i am right or wrong in turning governesswe will wait the event i am weary of my lonely useless existence here and eager to make my life more happy and more useful in the household of all others in which i should like most to have a place if you will look again you will see that i have these personal considerations still to urge before i finish my letter you dont know your brother and his wife as well as i do if you doubt their answer i believe they have courage enough and heart enough to say yes  henry submitted without being convinced  he was a man who disliked all eccentric departures from custom and routine and he felt especially suspicious of the change proposed in the life of agnes with new interests to occupy her mind she might be less favourably disposed to listen to him on the next occasion when he urged his suit the influence of the lonely useless existence of which she complained was distinctly an influence in his favour while her heart was empty her heart was accessible but with his nieces in full possession of it the clouds of doubt overshadowed his prospects he knew the sex well enough to keep these purely selfish perplexities to himself the waiting policy was especially the policy to pursue with a woman as sensitive as agnes if he once offended her delicacy he was lost for the moment he wisely controlled himself and changed the subject  my little nieces letter has had an effect he said which the child never contemplated in writing it she has just reminded me of one of the objects that i had in calling on you today  agnes looked at the childs letter how does lucy do that she asked  lucys governess is not the only lucky person who has had money left her henry answered is your old nurse in the house  you dont mean to say that nurse has got a legacy  she has got a hundred pounds send for her agnes while i show you the letter  he took a handful of letters from his pocket and looked through them while agnes rang the bell returning to him she noticed a printed letter among the rest which lay open on the table it was a prospectus and the title of it was palace hotel company of venice limited the two words palace and venice instantly recalled her mind to the unwelcome visit of lady montbarry what is that she asked pointing to the title  henry suspended his search and glanced at the prospectus a really promising speculation he said large hotels always pay well if they are well managed i know the man who is appointed to be manager of this hotel when it is opened to the public and i have such entire confidence in him that i have become one of the shareholders of the company  the reply did not appear to satisfy agnes why is the hotel called the palace hotel she inquired  henry looked at her and at once penetrated her motive for asking the question yes he said it is the palace that montbarry hired at venice and it has been purchased by the company to be changed into an hotel  agnes turned away in silence and took a chair at the farther end of the room henry had disappointed her his income as a younger son stood in need as she well knew of all the additions that he could make to it by successful speculation but she was unreasonable enough nevertheless to disapprove of his attempting to make money already out of the house in which his brother had died incapable of understanding this purely sentimental view of a plain matter of business henry returned to his papers in some perplexity at the sudden change in the manner of agnes towards him just as he found the letter of which he was in search the nurse made her appearance he glanced at agnes expecting that she would speak first she never even looked up when the nurse came in it was left to henry to tell the old woman why the bell had summoned her to the drawingroom  well nurse he said you have had a windfall of luck you have had a legacy left you of a hundred pounds  the nurse showed no outward signs of exultation she waited a little to get the announcement of the legacy well settled in her mindand then she said quietly master henry who gives me that money if you please  my late brother lord montbarry gives it to you agnes instantly looked up interested in the matter for the first time henry went on his will leaves legacies to the surviving old servants of the family there is a letter from his lawyers authorising you to apply to them for the money  in every class of society gratitude is the rarest of all human virtues in the nurses class it is extremely rare her opinion of the man who had deceived and deserted her mistress remained the same opinion still perfectly undisturbed by the passing circumstance of the legacy  i wonder who reminded my lord of the old servants she said he would never have heart enough to remember them himself  agnes suddenly interposed nature always abhorring monotony institutes reserves of temper as elements in the composition of the gentlest women living even agnes could on rare occasions be angry the nurses view of montbarrys character seemed to have provoked her beyond endurance  if you have any sense of shame in you she broke out you ought to be ashamed of what you have just said your ingratitude disgusts me i leave you to speak with her henryyou wont mind it with this significant intimation that he too had dropped out of his customary place in her good opinion she left the room  the nurse received the smart reproof administered to her with every appearance of feeling rather amused by it than not when the door had closed this female philosopher winked at henry  theres a power of obstinacy in young women she remarked miss agnes wouldnt give my lord up as a bad one even when he jilted her and now shes sweet on him after hes dead say a word against him and she fires up as you see all obstinacy it will wear out with time stick to her master henrystick to her  she doesnt seem to have offended you said henry  she the nurse repeated in amazementshe offend me i like her in her tantrums it reminds me of her when she was a baby lord bless you when i go to bid her goodnight shell give me a big kiss poor dearand say nurse i didnt mean it about this money master henry if i was younger i should spend it in dress and jewellery but im too old for that what shall i do with my legacy when i have got it  put it out at interest henry suggested get so much a year for it you know how much shall i get the nurse asked  if you put your hundred pounds into the funds you will get between three and four pounds a year  the nurse shook her head three or four pounds a year that wont do i want more than that look here master henry i dont care about this bit of moneyi never did like the man who has left it to me though he was your brother if i lost it all tomorrow i shouldnt break my heart im well enough off as it is for the rest of my days they say youre a speculator put me in for a good thing theres a dear neckornothingand that for the funds she snapped her fingers to express her contempt for security of investment at three per cent  henry produced the prospectus of the venetian hotel company youre a funny old woman he said there you dashing speculatorthere is neckornothing for you you must keep it a secret from miss agnes mind im not at all sure that she would approve of my helping you to this investment  the nurse took out her spectacles six per cent guaranteed she read and the directors have every reason to believe that ten per cent or more will be ultimately realised to the shareholders by the hotel put me into that master henry and wherever you go for heavens sake recommend the hotel to your friends  so the nurse following henrys mercenary example had her pecuniary interest too in the house in which lord montbarry had died  three days passed before henry was able to visit agnes again in that time the little cloud between them had entirely passed away agnes received him with even more than her customary kindness she was in better spirits than usual her letter to mrs stephen westwick had been answered by return of post and her proposal had been joyfully accepted with one modification she was to visit the westwicks for a monthand if she really liked teaching the children she was then to be governess aunt and cousin all in oneand was only to go away in an event which her friends in ireland persisted in contemplating the event of her marriage  you see i was right she said to henry  he was still incredulous are you really going he asked  i am going next week  when shall i see you again  you know you are always welcome at your brothers house you can see me when you like she held out her hand pardon me for leaving youi am beginning to pack up already  henry tried to kiss her at parting she drew back directly  why not i am your cousin he said  i dont like it she answered  henry looked at her and submitted her refusal to grant him his privilege as a cousin was a good signit was indirectly an act of encouragement to him in the character of her lover  on the first day in the new week agnes left london on her way to ireland as the event proved this was not destined to be the end of her journey the way to ireland was only the first stage on a roundabout roadthe road that led to the palace at venice     the third part     chapter xiii   in the spring of the year 1861 agnes was established at the countryseat of her two friendsnow promoted on the death of the first lord without offspring to be the new lord and lady montbarry the old nurse was not separated from her mistress a place suited to her time of life had been found for her in the pleasant irish household she was perfectly happy in her new sphere and she spent her first halfyears dividend from the venice hotel company with characteristic prodigality in presents for the children  early in the year also the directors of the life insurance offices submitted to circumstances and paid the ten thousand pounds immediately afterwards the widow of the first lord montbarry otherwise the dowager lady montbarry left england with baron rivar for the united states the barons object was announced in the scientific columns of the newspapers to be investigation into the present state of experimental chemistry in the great american republic his sister informed inquiring friends that she accompanied him in the hope of finding consolation in change of scene after the bereavement that had fallen on her hearing this news from henry westwick then paying a visit at his brothers house agnes was conscious of a certain sense of relief with the atlantic between us she said surely i have done with that terrible woman now  barely a week passed after those words had been spoken before an event happened which reminded agnes of the terrible woman once more  on that day henrys engagements had obliged him to return to london he had ventured on the morning of his departure to press his suit once more on agnes and the children as he had anticipated proved to be innocent obstacles in the way of his success on the other hand he had privately secured a firm ally in his sisterinlaw have a little patience the new lady montbarry had said and leave me to turn the influence of the children in the right direction if they can persuade her to listen to youthey shall  the two ladies had accompanied henry and some other guests who went away at the same time to the railway station and had just driven back to the house when the servant announced that a person of the name of rolland was waiting to see her ladyship  is it a woman  yes my lady  young lady montbarry turned to agnes  this is the very person she said whom your lawyer thought likely to help him when he was trying to trace the lost courier  you dont mean the english maid who was with lady montbarry at venice  my dear dont speak of montbarrys horrid widow by the name which is my name now stephen and i have arranged to call her by her foreign title before she was married i am lady montbarry and she is the countess in that way there will be no confusionyes mrs rolland was in my service before she became the countesss maid she was a perfectly trustworthy person with one defect that obliged me to send her awaya sullen temper which led to perpetual complaints of her in the servants hall would you like to see her  agnes accepted the proposal in the faint hope of getting some information for the couriers wife the complete defeat of every attempt to trace the lost man had been accepted as final by mrs ferrari she had deliberately arrayed herself in widows mourning and was earning her livelihood in an employment which the unwearied kindness of agnes had procured for her in london the last chance of penetrating the mystery of ferraris disappearance seemed to rest now on what ferraris former fellowservant might be able to tell with highlywrought expectations agnes followed her friend into the room in which mrs rolland was waiting  a tall bony woman in the autumn of life with sunken eyes and irongrey hair rose stiffly from her chair and saluted the ladies with stern submission as they opened the door a person of unblemished character evidentlybut not without visible drawbacks big bushy eyebrows an awfully deep and solemn voice a harsh unbending manner a complete absence in her figure of the undulating lines characteristic of the sex presented virtue in this excellent person under its least alluring aspect strangers on a first introduction to her were accustomed to wonder why she was not a man  are you pretty well mrs rolland  i am as well as i can expect to be my lady at my time of life  is there anything i can do for you  your ladyship can do me a great favour if you will please speak to my character while i was in your service i am offered a place to wait on an invalid lady who has lately come to live in this neighbourhood  ah yesi have heard of her a mrs carbury with a very pretty niece i am told but mrs rolland you left my service some time ago mrs carbury will surely expect you to refer to the last mistress by whom you were employed  a flash of virtuous indignation irradiated mrs rollands sunken eyes she coughed before she answered as if her last mistress stuck in her throat  i have explained to mrs carbury my lady that the person i last servedi really cannot give her her title in your ladyships presencehas left england for america mrs carbury knows that i quitted the person of my own free will and knows why and approves of my conduct so far a word from your ladyship will be amply sufficient to get me the situation  very well mrs rolland i have no objection to be your reference under the circumstances mrs carbury will find me at home tomorrow until two oclock  mrs carbury is not well enough to leave the house my lady her niece miss haldane will call and make the inquiries if your ladyship has no objection  i have not the least objection the pretty niece carries her own welcome with her wait a minute mrs rolland this lady is miss lockwoodmy husbands cousin and my friend she is anxious to speak to you about the courier who was in the late lord montbarrys service at venice  mrs rollands bushy eyebrows frowned in stern disapproval of the new topic of conversation i regret to hear it my lady was all she said  perhaps you have not been informed of what happened after you left venice agnes ventured to add ferrari left the palace secretly and he has never been heard of since  mrs rolland mysteriously closed her eyesas if to exclude some vision of the lost courier which was of a nature to disturb a respectable woman nothing that mr ferrari could do would surprise me she replied in her deepest bass tones  you speak rather harshly of him said agnes  mrs rolland suddenly opened her eyes again i speak harshly of nobody without reason she said mr ferrari behaved to me miss lockwood as no man living has ever behavedbefore or since  what did he do  mrs rolland answered with a stony stare of horror he took liberties with me  young lady montbarry suddenly turned aside and put her handkerchief over her mouth in convulsions of suppressed laughter  mrs rolland went on with a grim enjoyment of the bewilderment which her reply had produced in agnes and when i insisted on an apology miss he had the audacity to say that the life at the palace was dull and he didnt know how else to amuse himself  i am afraid i have hardly made myself understood said agnes i am not speaking to you out of any interest in ferrari are you aware that he is married  i pity his wife said mrs rolland  she is naturally in great grief about him agnes proceeded  she ought to thank god she is rid of him mrs rolland interposed  agnes still persisted i have known mrs ferrari from her childhood and i am sincerely anxious to help her in this matter did you notice anything while you were at venice that would account for her husbands extraordinary disappearance on what sort of terms for instance did he live with his master and mistress  on terms of familiarity with his mistress said mrs rolland which were simply sickening to a respectable english servant she used to encourage him to talk to her about all his affairshow he got on with his wife and how pressed he was for money and such likejust as if they were equals contemptiblethats what i call it  and his master agnes continued how did ferrari get on with lord montbarry  my lord used to live shut up with his studies and his sorrows mrs rolland answered with a hard solemnity expressive of respect for his lordships memory mr ferrari got his money when it was due and he cared for nothing else if i could afford it i would leave the place too but i cant afford it those were the last words he said to me on the morning when i left the palace i made no reply after what had happened on that other occasion i was naturally not on speaking terms with mr ferrari  can you really tell me nothing which will throw any light on this matter  nothing said mrs rolland with an undisguised relish of the disappointment that she was inflicting  there was another member of the family at venice agnes resumed determined to sift the question to the bottom while she had the chance there was baron rivar  mrs rolland lifted her large hands covered with rusty black gloves in mute protest against the introduction of baron rivar as a subject of inquiry are you aware miss she began that i left my place in consequence of what i observed  agnes stopped her there i only wanted to ask she explained if anything was said or done by baron rivar which might account for ferraris strange conduct  nothing that i know of said mrs rolland the baron and mr ferrari if i may use such an expression were birds of a feather so far as i could seei mean one was as unprincipled as the other i am a just woman and i will give you an example only the day before i left i heard the baron say through the open door of his room while i was passing along the corridor ferrari i want a thousand pounds what would you do for a thousand pounds and i heard mr ferrari answer anything sir as long as i was not found out and then they both burst out laughing i heard no more than that judge for yourself miss  agnes reflected for a moment a thousand pounds was the sum that had been sent to mrs ferrari in the anonymous letter was that enclosure in any way connected as a result with the conversation between the baron and ferrari it was useless to press any more inquiries on mrs rolland she could give no further information which was of the slightest importance to the object in view there was no alternative but to grant her dismissal one more effort had been made to find a trace of the lost man and once again the effort had failed    they were a family party at the dinnertable that day the only guest left in the house was a nephew of the new lord montbarrythe eldest son of his sister lady barrville lady montbarry could not resist telling the story of the first and last attack made on the virtue of mrs rolland with a comicallyexact imitation of mrs rollands deep and dismal voice being asked by her husband what was the object which had brought that formidable person to the house she naturally mentioned the expected visit of miss haldane arthur barville unusually silent and preoccupied so far suddenly struck into the conversation with a burst of enthusiasm miss haldane is the most charming girl in all ireland he said i caught sight of her yesterday over the wall of her garden as i was riding by what time is she coming tomorrow before two ill look into the drawingroom by accidenti am dying to be introduced to her  agnes was amused by his enthusiasm are you in love with miss haldane already she asked  arthur answered gravely its no joking matter i have been all day at the garden wall waiting to see her again it depends on miss haldane to make me the happiest or the wretchedest man living  you foolish boy how can you talk such nonsense  he was talking nonsense undoubtedly but if agnes had only known it he was doing something more than that he was innocently leading her another stage nearer on the way to venice      chapter xiv   as the summer months advanced the transformation of the venetian palace into the modern hotel proceeded rapidly towards completion  the outside of the building with its fine palladian front looking on the canal was wisely left unaltered inside as a matter of necessity the rooms were almost rebuiltso far at least as the size and the arrangement of them were concerned the vast saloons were partitioned off into apartments containing three or four rooms each the broad corridors in the upper regions afforded spare space enough for rows of little bedchambers devoted to servants and to travellers with limited means nothing was spared but the solid floors and the finelycarved ceilings these last in excellent preservation as to workmanship merely required cleaning and regilding here and there to add greatly to the beauty and importance of the best rooms in the hotel the only exception to the complete reorganization of the interior was at one extremity of the edifice on the first and second floors here there happened in each case to be rooms of such comparatively moderate size and so attractively decorated that the architect suggested leaving them as they were it was afterwards discovered that these were no other than the apartments formerly occupied by lord montbarry on the first floor and by baron rivar on the second the room in which montbarry had died was still fitted up as a bedroom and was now distinguished as number fourteen the room above it in which the baron had slept took its place on the hotelregister as number thirtyeight with the ornaments on the walls and ceilings cleaned and brightened up and with the heavy oldfashioned beds chairs and tables replaced by bright pretty and luxurious modern furniture these two promised to be at once the most attractive and the most comfortable bedchambers in the hotel as for the oncedesolate and disused ground floor of the building it was now transformed by means of splendid diningrooms receptionrooms billiardrooms and smokingrooms into a palace by itself even the dungeonlike vaults beneath now lighted and ventilated on the most approved modern plan had been turned as if by magic into kitchens servants offices icerooms and wine cellars worthy of the splendour of the grandest hotel in italy in the now bygone period of seventeen years since  passing from the lapse of the summer months at venice to the lapse of the summer months in ireland it is next to be recorded that mrs rolland obtained the situation of attendant on the invalid mrs carbury and that the fair miss haldane like a female caesar came saw and conquered on her first days visit to the new lord montbarrys house  the ladies were as loud in her praises as arthur barville himself lord montbarry declared that she was the only perfectly pretty woman he had ever seen who was really unconscious of her own attractions the old nurse said she looked as if she had just stepped out of a picture and wanted nothing but a gilt frame round her to make her complete miss haldane on her side returned from her first visit to the montbarrys charmed with her new acquaintances later on the same day arthur called with an offering of fruit and flowers for mrs carbury and with instructions to ask if she was well enough to receive lord and lady montbarry and miss lockwood on the morrow in a weeks time the two households were on the friendliest terms mrs carbury confined to the sofa by a spinal malady had been hitherto dependent on her niece for one of the few pleasures she could enjoy the pleasure of having the best new novels read to her as they came out discovering this arthur volunteered to relieve miss haldane at intervals in the office of reader he was clever at mechanical contrivances of all sorts and he introduced improvements in mrs carburys couch and in the means of conveying her from the bedchamber to the drawingroom which alleviated the poor ladys sufferings and brightened her gloomy life with these claims on the gratitude of the aunt aided by the personal advantages which he unquestionably possessed arthur advanced rapidly in the favour of the charming niece she was it is needless to say perfectly well aware that he was in love with her while he was himself modestly reticent on the subjectso far as words went but she was not equally quick in penetrating the nature of her own feelings towards arthur watching the two young people with keen powers of observation necessarily concentrated on them by the complete seclusion of her life the invalid lady discovered signs of roused sensibility in miss haldane when arthur was present which had never yet shown themselves in her social relations with other admirers eager to pay their addresses to her having drawn her own conclusions in private mrs carbury took the first favourable opportunity in arthurs interests of putting them to the test  i dont know what i shall do she said one day when arthur goes away  miss haldane looked up quickly from her work surely he is not going to leave us she exclaimed  my dear he has already stayed at his uncles house a month longer than he intended his father and mother naturally expect to see him at home again  miss haldane met this difficulty with a suggestion which could only have proceeded from a judgment already disturbed by the ravages of the tender passion why cant his father and mother go and see him at lord montbarrys she asked sir theodores place is only thirty miles away and lady barville is lord montbarrys sister they neednt stand on ceremony  they may have other engagements mrs carbury remarked  my dear aunt we dont know that suppose you ask arthur  suppose you ask him  miss haldane bent her head again over her work suddenly as it was done her aunt had seen her faceand her face betrayed her  when arthur came the next day mrs carbury said a word to him in private while her niece was in the garden the last new novel lay neglected on the table arthur followed miss haldane into the garden the next day he wrote home enclosing in his letter a photograph of miss haldane before the end of the week sir theodore and lady barville arrived at lord montbarrys and formed their own judgment of the fidelity of the portrait they had themselves married early in lifeand strange to say they did not object on principle to the early marriages of other people the question of age being thus disposed of the course of true love had no other obstacles to encounter miss haldane was an only child and was possessed of an ample fortune arthurs career at the university had been creditable but certainly not brilliant enough to present his withdrawal in the light of a disaster as sir theodores eldest son his position was already made for him he was twoandtwenty years of age and the young lady was eighteen there was really no producible reason for keeping the lovers waiting and no excuse for deferring the weddingday beyond the first week in september in the interval while the bride and bridegroom would be necessarily absent on the inevitable tour abroad a sister of mrs carbury volunteered to stay with her during the temporary separation from her niece on the conclusion of the honeymoon the young couple were to return to ireland and were to establish themselves in mrs carburys spacious and comfortable house  these arrangements were decided upon early in the month of august about the same date the last alterations in the old palace at venice were completed the rooms were dried by steam the cellars were stocked the manager collected round him his army of skilled servants and the new hotel was advertised all over europe to open in october      chapter xv            miss agnes lockwood to mrs ferrari  i promised to give you some account dear emily of the marriage of mr arthur barville and miss haldane it took place ten days since but i have had so many things to look after in the absence of the master and mistress of this house that i am only able to write to you today  the invitations to the wedding were limited to members of the families on either side in consideration of the ill health of miss haldanes aunt on the side of the montbarry family there were present besides lord and lady montbarry sir theodore and lady barville mrs norbury whom you may remember as his lordships second sister and mr francis westwick and mr henry westwick the three children and i attended the ceremony as bridesmaids we were joined by two young ladies cousins of the bride and very agreeable girls our dresses were white trimmed with green in honour of ireland and we each had a handsome gold bracelet given to us as a present from the bridegroom if you add to the persons whom i have already mentioned the elder members of mrs carburys family and the old servants in both housesprivileged to drink the healths of the married pair at the lower end of the roomyou will have the list of the company at the weddingbreakfast complete  the weather was perfect and the ceremony with music was beautifully performed as for the bride no words can describe how lovely she looked or how well she went through it all we were very merry at the breakfast and the speeches went off on the whole quite well enough the last speech before the party broke up was made by mr henry westwick and was the best of all he offered a happy suggestion at the end which has produced a very unexpected change in my life here  as well as i remember he concluded in these wordson one point we are all agreedwe are sorry that the parting hour is near and we should be glad to meet again why should we not meet again this is the autumn time of the year we are most of us leaving home for the holidays what do you say if you have no engagements that will prevent it to joining our young married friends before the close of their tour and renewing the social success of this delightful breakfast by another festival in honour of the honeymoon the bride and bridegroom are going to germany and the tyrol on their way to italy i propose that we allow them a month to themselves and that we arrange to meet them afterwards in the north of italysay at venice  this proposal was received with great applause which was changed into shouts of laughter by no less a person than my dear old nurse the moment mr westwick pronounced the word venice she started up among the servants at the lower end of the room and called out at the top of her voice go to our hotel ladies and gentlemen we get six per cent on our money already and if you will only crowd the place and call for the best of everything it will be ten per cent in our pockets in no time ask master henry  appealed to in this irresistible manner mr westwick had no choice but to explain that he was concerned as a shareholder in a new hotel company at venice and that he had invested a small sum of money for the nurse not very considerately as i think in the speculation hearing this the company by way of humouring the joke drank a new toastsuccess to the nurses hotel and a speedy rise in the dividend  when the conversation returned in due time to the more serious question of the proposed meeting at venice difficulties began to present themselves caused of course by invitations for the autumn which many of the guests had already accepted only two members of mrs carburys family were at liberty to keep the proposed appointment on our side we were more at leisure to do as we pleased mr henry westwick decided to go to venice in advance of the rest to test the accommodation of the new hotel on the opening day mrs norbury and mr francis westwick volunteered to follow him and after some persuasion lord and lady montbarry consented to a species of compromise his lordship could not conveniently spare time enough for the journey to venice but he and lady montbarry arranged to accompany mrs norbury and mr francis westwick as far on their way to italy as paris five days since they took their departure to meet their travelling companions in london leaving me here in charge of the three dear children they begged hard of course to be taken with papa and mamma but it was thought better not to interrupt the progress of their education and not to expose them especially the two younger girls to the fatigues of travelling  i have had a charming letter from the bride this morning dated cologne you cannot think how artlessly and prettily she assures me of her happiness some people as they say in ireland are born to good luckand i think arthur barville is one of them  when you next write i hope to hear that you are in better health and spirits and that you continue to like your employment believe me sincerely your frienda l  agnes had just closed and directed her letter when the eldest of her three pupils entered the room with the startling announcement that lord montbarrys travellingservant had arrived from paris alarmed by the idea that some misfortune had happened she ran out to meet the man in the hall her face told him how seriously he had frightened her before she could speak theres nothing wrong miss he hastened to say my lord and my lady are enjoying themselves at paris they only want you and the young ladies to be with them saying these amazing words he handed to agnes a letter from lady montbarry  dearest agnes she read i am so charmed with the delightful change in my lifeit is six years remember since i last travelled on the continentthat i have exerted all my fascinations to persuade lord montbarry to go on to venice and what is more to the purpose i have actually succeeded he has just gone to his room to write the necessary letters of excuse in time for the post to england may you have as good a husband my dear when your time comes in the mean while the one thing wanting now to make my happiness complete is to have you and the darling children with us montbarry is just as miserable without them as i amthough he doesnt confess it so freely you will have no difficulties to trouble you louis will deliver these hurried lines and will take care of you on the journey to paris kiss the children for me a thousand timesand never mind their education for the present pack up instantly my dear and i will be fonder of you than ever your affectionate friend adela montbarry  agnes folded up the letter and feeling the need of composing herself took refuge for a few minutes in her own room  her first natural sensations of surprise and excitement at the prospect of going to venice were succeeded by impressions of a less agreeable kind with the recovery of her customary composure came the unwelcome remembrance of the parting words spoken to her by montbarrys widowwe shall meet againhere in england or there in venice where my husband diedand meet for the last time  it was an odd coincidence to say the least of it that the march of events should be unexpectedly taking agnes to venice after those words had been spoken was the woman of the mysterious warnings and the wild black eyes still thousands of miles away in america or was the march of events taking her unexpectedly too on the journey to venice agnes started out of her chair ashamed of even the momentary concession to superstition which was implied by the mere presence of such questions as these in her mind  she rang the bell and sent for her little pupils and announced their approaching departure to the household the noisy delight of the children the inspiriting effort of packing up in a hurry roused all her energies she dismissed her own absurd misgivings from consideration with the contempt that they deserved she worked as only women can work when their hearts are in what they do the travellers reached dublin that day in time for the boat to england two days later they were with lord and lady montbarry at paris     the fourth part    chapter xvi   it was only the twentieth of september when agnes and the children reached paris mrs norbury and her brother francis had then already started on their journey to italyat least three weeks before the date at which the new hotel was to open for the reception of travellers  the person answerable for this premature departure was francis westwick  like his younger brother henry he had increased his pecuniary resources by his own enterprise and ingenuity with this difference that his speculations were connected with the arts he had made money in the first instance by a weekly newspaper and he had then invested his profits in a london theatre this latter enterprise admirably conducted had been rewarded by the public with steady and liberal encouragement pondering over a new form of theatrical attraction for the coming winter season francis had determined to revive the languid public taste for the ballet by means of an entertainment of his own invention combining dramatic interest with dancing he was now accordingly in search of the best dancer possessed of the indispensable personal attractions who was to be found in the theatres of the continent hearing from his foreign correspondents of two women who had made successful first appearances one at milan and one at florence he had arranged to visit those cities and to judge of the merits of the dancers for himself before he joined the bride and bridegroom his widowed sister having friends at florence whom she was anxious to see readily accompanied him the montbarrys remained at paris until it was time to present themselves at the family meeting in venice henry found them still in the french capital when he arrived from london on his way to the opening of the new hotel  against lady montbarrys advice he took the opportunity of renewing his addresses to agnes he could hardly have chosen a more unpropitious time for pleading his cause with her the gaieties of paris quite incomprehensibly to herself as well as to everyone about her had a depressing effect on her spirits she had no illness to complain of she shared willingly in the evervarying succession of amusements offered to strangers by the ingenuity of the liveliest people in the worldbut nothing roused her she remained persistently dull and weary through it all in this frame of mind and body she was in no humour to receive henrys illtimed addresses with favour or even with patience she plainly and positively refused to listen to him why do you remind me of what i have suffered she asked petulantly dont you see that it has left its mark on me for life  i thought i knew something of women by this time henry said appealing privately to lady montbarry for consolation but agnes completely puzzles me it is a year since montbarrys death and she remains as devoted to his memory as if he had died faithful to hershe still feels the loss of him as none of us feel it  she is the truest woman that ever breathed the breath of life lady montbarry answered remember that and you will understand her can such a woman as agnes give her love or refuse it according to circumstances because the man was unworthy of her was he less the man of her choice the truest and best friend to him little as he deserved it in his lifetime she naturally remains the truest and best friend to his memory now if you really love her wait and trust to your two best friendsto time and to me there is my advice let your own experience decide whether it is not the best advice that i can offer resume your journey to venice tomorrow and when you take leave of agnes speak to her as cordially as if nothing had happened  henry wisely followed this advice thoroughly understanding him agnes made the leavetaking friendly and pleasant on her side when he stopped at the door for a last look at her she hurriedly turned her head so that her face was hidden from him was that a good sign lady montbarry accompanying henry down the stairs said yes decidedly write when you get to venice we shall wait here to receive letters from arthur and his wife and we shall time our departure for italy accordingly  a week passed and no letter came from henry some days later a telegram was received from him it was despatched from milan instead of from venice and it brought this strange messagei have left the hotel will return on the arrival of arthur and his wife address meanwhile albergo reale milan  preferring venice before all other cities of europe and having arranged to remain there until the family meeting took place what unexpected event had led henry to alter his plans and why did he state the bare fact without adding a word of explanation let the narrative follow himand find the answer to those questions at venice      chapter xvii   the palace hotel appealing for encouragement mainly to english and american travellers celebrated the opening of its doors as a matter of course by the giving of a grand banquet and the delivery of a long succession of speeches  delayed on his journey henry westwick only reached venice in time to join the guests over their coffee and cigars observing the splendour of the reception rooms and taking note especially of the artful mixture of comfort and luxury in the bedchambers he began to share the old nurses view of the future and to contemplate seriously the coming dividend of ten per cent the hotel was beginning well at all events so much interest in the enterprise had been aroused at home and abroad by profuse advertising that the whole accommodation of the building had been secured by travellers of all nations for the opening night henry only obtained one of the small rooms on the upper floor by a lucky accidentthe absence of the gentleman who had written to engage it he was quite satisfied and was on his way to bed when another accident altered his prospects for the night and moved him into another and a better room  ascending on his way to the higher regions as far as the first floor of the hotel henrys attention was attracted by an angry voice protesting in a strong new england accent against one of the greatest hardships that can be inflicted on a citizen of the united statesthe hardship of sending him to bed without gas in his room  the americans are not only the most hospitable people to be found on the face of the earththey are under certain conditions the most patient and goodtempered people as well but they are human and the limit of american endurance is found in the obsolete institution of a bedroom candle the american traveller in the present case declined to believe that his bedroom was in a complete finished state without a gasburner the manager pointed to the fine antique decorations renewed and regilt on the walls and the ceiling and explained that the emanations of burning gaslight would certainly spoil them in the course of a few months to this the traveller replied that it was possible but that he did not understand decorations a bedroom with gas in it was what he was used to was what he wanted and was what he was determined to have the compliant manager volunteered to ask some other gentleman housed on the inferior upper storey which was lit throughout with gas to change rooms hearing this and being quite willing to exchange a small bedchamber for a large one henry volunteered to be the other gentleman the excellent american shook hands with him on the spot you are a cultured person sir he said and you will no doubt understand the decorations  henry looked at the number of the room on the door as he opened it the number was fourteen  tired and sleepy he naturally anticipated a good nights rest in the thoroughly healthy state of his nervous system he slept as well in a bed abroad as in a bed at home without the slightest assignable reason however his just expectations were disappointed the luxurious bed the wellventilated room the delicious tranquillity of venice by night all were in favour of his sleeping well he never slept at all an indescribable sense of depression and discomfort kept him waking through darkness and daylight alike he went down to the coffeeroom as soon as the hotel was astir and ordered some breakfast another unaccountable change in himself appeared with the appearance of the meal he was absolutely without appetite an excellent omelette and cutlets cooked to perfection he sent away untastedhe whose appetite never failed him whose digestion was still equal to any demands on it  the day was bright and fine he sent for a gondola and was rowed to the lido  out on the airy lagoon he felt like a new man he had not left the hotel ten minutes before he was fast asleep in the gondola waking on reaching the landingplace he crossed the lido and enjoyed a mornings swim in the adriatic there was only a poor restaurant on the island in those days but his appetite was now ready for anything he ate whatever was offered to him like a famished man he could hardly believe when he reflected on it that he had sent away untasted his excellent breakfast at the hotel  returning to venice he spent the rest of the day in the picturegalleries and the churches towards six oclock his gondola took him back with another fine appetite to meet some travelling acquaintances with whom he had engaged to dine at the table dhote  the dinner was deservedly rewarded with the highest approval by every guest in the hotel but one to henrys astonishment the appetite with which he had entered the house mysteriously and completely left him when he sat down to table he could drink some wine but he could literally eat nothing what in the world is the matter with you his travelling acquaintances asked he could honestly answer i know no more than you do  when night came he gave his comfortable and beautiful bedroom another trial the result of the second experiment was a repetition of the result of the first again he felt the allpervading sense of depression and discomfort again he passed a sleepless night and once more when he tried to eat his breakfast his appetite completely failed him  this personal experience of the new hotel was too extraordinary to be passed over in silence henry mentioned it to his friends in the public room in the hearing of the manager the manager naturally zealous in defence of the hotel was a little hurt at the implied reflection cast on number fourteen he invited the travellers present to judge for themselves whether mr westwicks bedroom was to blame for mr westwicks sleepless nights and he especially appealed to a greyheaded gentleman a guest at the breakfasttable of an english traveller to take the lead in the investigation this is doctor bruno our first physician in venice he explained i appeal to him to say if there are any unhealthy influences in mr westwicks room  introduced to number fourteen the doctor looked round him with a certain appearance of interest which was noticed by everyone present the last time i was in this room he said was on a melancholy occasion it was before the palace was changed into an hotel i was in professional attendance on an english nobleman who died here one of the persons present inquired the name of the nobleman doctor bruno answered without the slightest suspicion that he was speaking before a brother of the dead man lord montbarry  henry quietly left the room without saying a word to anybody  he was not in any sense of the term a superstitious man but he felt nevertheless an insurmountable reluctance to remaining in the hotel he decided on leaving venice to ask for another room would be as he could plainly see an offence in the eyes of the manager to remove to another hotel would be to openly abandon an establishment in the success of which he had a pecuniary interest leaving a note for arthur barville on his arrival in venice in which he merely mentioned that he had gone to look at the italian lakes and that a line addressed to his hotel at milan would bring him back again he took the afternoon train to paduaand dined with his usual appetite and slept as well as ever that night  the next day a gentleman and his wife perfect strangers to the montbarry family returning to england by way of venice arrived at the hotel and occupied number fourteen  still mindful of the slur that had been cast on one of his best bedchambers the manager took occasion to ask the travellers the next morning how they liked their room they left him to judge for himself how well they were satisfied by remaining a day longer in venice than they had originally planned to do solely for the purpose of enjoying the excellent accommodation offered to them by the new hotel we have met with nothing like it in italy they said you may rely on our recommending you to all our friends  on the day when number fourteen was again vacant an english lady travelling alone with her maid arrived at the hotel saw the room and at once engaged it  the lady was mrs norbury she had left francis westwick at milan occupied in negotiating for the appearance at his theatre of the new dancer at the scala not having heard to the contrary mrs norbury supposed that arthur barville and his wife had already arrived at venice she was more interested in meeting the young married couple than in awaiting the result of the hard bargaining which delayed the engagement of the new dancer and she volunteered to make her brothers apologies if his theatrical business caused him to be late in keeping his appointment at the honeymoon festival  mrs norburys experience of number fourteen differed entirely from her brother henrys experience of the room  failing asleep as readily as usual her repose was disturbed by a succession of frightful dreams the central figure in every one of them being the figure of her dead brother the first lord montbarry she saw him starving in a loathsome prison she saw him pursued by assassins and dying under their knives she saw him drowning in immeasurable depths of dark water she saw him in a bed on fire burning to death in the flames she saw him tempted by a shadowy creature to drink and dying of the poisonous draught the reiterated horror of these dreams had such an effect on her that she rose with the dawn of day afraid to trust herself again in bed in the old times she had been noted in the family as the one member of it who lived on affectionate terms with montbarry his other sister and his brothers were constantly quarrelling with him even his mother owned that her eldest son was of all her children the child whom she least liked sensible and resolute woman as she was mrs norbury shuddered with terror as she sat at the window of her room watching the sunrise and thinking of her dreams  she made the first excuse that occurred to her when her maid came in at the usual hour and noticed how ill she looked the woman was of so superstitious a temperament that it would have been in the last degree indiscreet to trust her with the truth mrs norbury merely remarked that she had not found the bed quite to her liking on account of the large size of it she was accustomed at home as her maid knew to sleep in a small bed informed of this objection later in the day the manager regretted that he could only offer to the lady the choice of one other bedchamber numbered thirtyeight and situated immediately over the bedchamber which she desired to leave mrs norbury accepted the proposed change of quarters she was now about to pass her second night in the room occupied in the old days of the palace by baron rivar  once more she fell asleep as usual and once more the frightful dreams of the first night terrified her following each other in the same succession this time her nerves already shaken were not equal to the renewed torture of terror inflicted on them she threw on her dressinggown and rushed out of her room in the middle of the night the porter alarmed by the banging of the door met her hurrying headlong down the stairs in search of the first human being she could find to keep her company considerably surprised at this last new manifestation of the famous english eccentricity the man looked at the hotel register and led the lady upstairs again to the room occupied by her maid the maid was not asleep and more wonderful still was not even undressed she received her mistress quietly when they were alone and when mrs norbury had as a matter of necessity taken her attendant into her confidence the woman made a very strange reply  i have been asking about the hotel at the servants supper tonight she said the valet of one of the gentlemen staying here has heard that the late lord montbarry was the last person who lived in the palace before it was made into an hotel the room he died in maam was the room you slept in last night your room tonight is the room just above it i said nothing for fear of frightening you for my own part i have passed the night as you see keeping my light on and reading my bible in my opinion no member of your family can hope to be happy or comfortable in this house  what do you mean  please to let me explain myself maam when mr henry westwick was here i have this from the valet too he occupied the room his brother died in without knowing it like you for two nights he never closed his eyes without any reason for it the valet heard him tell the gentlemen in the coffeeroom he could not sleep he felt so low and so wretched in himself and what is more when daytime came he couldnt even eat while he was under this roof you may laugh at me maambut even a servant may draw her own conclusions its my conclusion that something happened to my lord which we none of us know about when he died in this house his ghost walks in torment until he can tell itand the living persons related to him are the persons who feel he is near them those persons may yet see him in the time to come dont pray dont stay any longer in this dreadful place i wouldnt stay another night here myselfno not for anything that could be offered me  mrs norbury at once set her servants mind at ease on this last point  i dont think about it as you do she said gravely but i should like to speak to my brother of what has happened we will go back to milan  some hours necessarily elapsed before they could leave the hotel by the first train in the forenoon  in that interval mrs norburys maid found an opportunity of confidentially informing the valet of what had passed between her mistress and herself the valet had other friends to whom he related the circumstances in his turn in due course of time the narrative passing from mouth to mouth reached the ears of the manager he instantly saw that the credit of the hotel was in danger unless something was done to retrieve the character of the room numbered fourteen english travellers well acquainted with the peerage of their native country informed him that henry westwick and mrs norbury were by no means the only members of the montbarry family curiosity might bring more of them to the hotel after hearing what had happened the managers ingenuity easily hit on the obvious means of misleading them in this case the numbers of all the rooms were enamelled in blue on white china plates screwed to the doors he ordered a new plate to be prepared bearing the number 13 a and he kept the room empty after its tenant for the time being had gone away until the plate was ready he then renumbered the room placing the removed number fourteen on the door of his own room on the second floor which not being to let had not previously been numbered at all by this device number fourteen disappeared at once and for ever from the books of the hotel as the number of a bedroom to let  having warned the servants to beware of gossiping with travellers on the subject of the changed numbers under penalty of being dismissed the manager composed his mind with the reflection that he had done his duty to his employers now he thought to himself with an excusable sense of triumph let the whole family come here if they like the hotel is a match for them      chapter xviii   before the end of the week the manager found himself in relations with the family once more a telegram from milan announced that mr francis westwick would arrive in venice on the next day and would be obliged if number fourteen on the first floor could be reserved for him in the event of its being vacant at the time  the manager paused to consider before he issued his directions  the renumbered room had been last let to a french gentleman it would be occupied on the day of mr francis westwicks arrival but it would be empty again on the day after would it be well to reserve the room for the special occupation of mr francis and when he had passed the night unsuspiciously and comfortably in no 13 a to ask him in the presence of witnesses how he liked his bedchamber in this case if the reputation of the room happened to be called in question again the answer would vindicate it on the evidence of a member of the very family which had first given number fourteen a bad name after a little reflection the manager decided on trying the experiment and directed that 13 a should be reserved accordingly  on the next day francis westwick arrived in excellent spirits  he had signed agreements with the most popular dancer in italy he had transferred the charge of mrs norbury to his brother henry who had joined him in milan and he was now at full liberty to amuse himself by testing in every possible way the extraordinary influence exercised over his relatives by the new hotel when his brother and sister first told him what their experience had been he instantly declared that he would go to venice in the interest of his theatre the circumstances related to him contained invaluable hints for a ghostdrama the title occurred to him in the railway the haunted hotel post that in red letters six feet high on a black ground all over londonand trust the excitable public to crowd into the theatre  received with the politest attention by the manager francis met with a disappointment on entering the hotel some mistake sir no such room on the first floor as number fourteen the room bearing that number is on the second floor and has been occupied by me from the day when the hotel opened perhaps you meant number 13 a on the first floor it will be at your service tomorrowa charming room in the mean time we will do the best we can for you tonight  a man who is the successful manager of a theatre is probably the last man in the civilized universe who is capable of being impressed with favourable opinions of his fellowcreatures francis privately set the manager down as a humbug and the story about the numbering of the rooms as a lie  on the day of his arrival he dined by himself in the restaurant before the hour of the table dhote for the express purpose of questioning the waiter without being overheard by anybody the answer led him to the conclusion that 13 a occupied the situation in the hotel which had been described by his brother and sister as the situation of 14 he asked next for the visitors list and found that the french gentleman who then occupied 13 a was the proprietor of a theatre in paris personally well known to him was the gentleman then in the hotel he had gone out but would certainly return for the table dhote when the public dinner was over francis entered the room and was welcomed by his parisian colleague literally with open arms come and have a cigar in my room said the friendly frenchman i want to hear whether you have really engaged that woman at milan or not in this easy way francis found his opportunity of comparing the interior of the room with the description which he had heard of it at milan  arriving at the door the frenchman bethought himself of his travelling companion my scenepainter is here with me he said on the lookout for materials an excellent fellow who will take it as a kindness if we ask him to join us ill tell the porter to send him up when he comes in he handed the key of his room to francis i will be back in a minute its at the end of the corridor13 a  francis entered the room alone there were the decorations on the walls and the ceiling exactly as they had been described to him he had just time to perceive this at a glance before his attention was diverted to himself and his own sensations by a grotesquely disagreeable occurrence which took him completely by surprise  he became conscious of a mysteriously offensive odour in the room entirely new in his experience of revolting smells it was composed if such a thing could be of two mingling exhalations which were separatelydiscoverable exhalations nevertheless this strange blending of odours consisted of something faintly and unpleasantly aromatic mixed with another underlying smell so unutterably sickening that he threw open the window and put his head out into the fresh air unable to endure the horribly infected atmosphere for a moment longer  the french proprietor joined his english friend with his cigar already lit he started back in dismay at a sight terrible to his countrymen in generalthe sight of an open window you english people are perfectly mad on the subject of fresh air he exclaimed we shall catch our deaths of cold  francis turned and looked at him in astonishment are you really not aware of the smell there is in the room he asked  smell repeated his brothermanager i smell my own good cigar try one yourself and for heavens sake shut the window  francis declined the cigar by a sign forgive me he said i will leave you to close the window i feel faint and giddyi had better go out he put his handkerchief over his nose and mouth and crossed the room to the door  the frenchman followed the movements of francis in such a state of bewilderment that he actually forgot to seize the opportunity of shutting out the fresh air is it so nasty as that he asked with a broad stare of amazement  horrible francis muttered behind his handkerchief i never smelt anything like it in my life  there was a knock at the door the scenepainter appeared his employer instantly asked him if he smelt anything  i smell your cigar delicious give me one directly  wait a minute besides my cigar do you smell anything elsevile abominable overpowering indescribable neverneverneversmelt before  the scenepainter appeared to be puzzled by the vehement energy of the language addressed to him the room is as fresh and sweet as a room can be he answered as he spoke he looked back with astonishment at francis westwick standing outside in the corridor and eyeing the interior of the bedchamber with an expression of undisguised disgust  the parisian director approached his english colleague and looked at him with grave and anxious scrutiny  you see my friend here are two of us with as good noses as yours who smell nothing if you want evidence from more noses look there he pointed to two little english girls at play in the corridor the door of my room is wide openand you know how fast a smell can travel now listen while i appeal to these innocent noses in the language of their own dismal island my little loves do you sniff a nasty smell hereha the children burst out laughing and answered emphatically no my good westwick the frenchman resumed in his own language the conclusion is surely plain there is something wrong very wrong with your own nose i recommend you to see a medical man  having given that advice he returned to his room and shut out the horrid fresh air with a loud exclamation of relief francis left the hotel by the lanes that led to the square of st mark the nightbreeze soon revived him he was able to light a cigar and to think quietly over what had happened      chapter xix   avoiding the crowd under the colonnades francis walked slowly up and down the noble open space of the square bathed in the light of the rising moon  without being aware of it himself he was a thorough materialist the strange effect produced on him by the roomfollowing on the other strange effects produced on the other relatives of his dead brotherexercised no perplexing influence over the mind of this sensible man perhaps he reflected my temperament is more imaginative than i supposed it to beand this is a trick played on me by my own fancy or perhaps my friend is right something is physically amiss with me i dont feel ill certainly but that is no safe criterion sometimes i am not going to sleep in that abominable room tonighti can well wait till tomorrow to decide whether i shall speak to a doctor or not in the mean time the hotel doesnt seem likely to supply me with the subject of a piece a terrible smell from an invisible ghost is a perfectly new idea but it has one drawback if i realise it on the stage i shall drive the audience out of the theatre  as his strong common sense arrived at this facetious conclusion he became aware of a lady dressed entirely in black who was observing him with marked attention am i right in supposing you to be mr francis westwick the lady asked at the moment when he looked at her  that is my name madam may i inquire to whom i have the honour of speaking  we have only met once she answered a little evasively when your late brother introduced me to the members of his family i wonder if you have quite forgotten my big black eyes and my hideous complexion she lifted her veil as she spoke and turned so that the moonlight rested on her face  francis recognised at a glance the woman of all others whom he most cordially dislikedthe widow of his dead brother the first lord montbarry he frowned as he looked at her his experience on the stage gathered at innumerable rehearsals with actresses who had sorely tried his temper had accustomed him to speak roughly to women who were distasteful to him i remember you he said i thought you were in america  she took no notice of his ungracious tone and manner she simply stopped him when he lifted his hat and turned to leave her  let me walk with you for a few minutes she quietly replied i have something to say to you  he showed her his cigar i am smoking he said  i dont mind smoking  after that there was nothing to be done short of downright brutality but to yield he did it with the worst possible grace well he resumed what do you want of me  you shall hear directly mr westwick let me first tell you what my position is i am alone in the world to the loss of my husband has now been added another bereavement the loss of my companion in america my brotherbaron rivar  the reputation of the baron and the doubt which scandal had thrown on his assumed relationship to the countess were well known to francis shot in a gamblingsaloon he asked brutally  the question is a perfectly natural one on your part she said with the impenetrably ironical manner which she could assume on certain occasions as a native of horseracing england you belong to a nation of gamblers my brother died no extraordinary death mr westwick he sank with many other unfortunate people under a fever prevalent in a western city which we happened to visit the calamity of his loss made the united states unendurable to me i left by the first steamer that sailed from new yorka french vessel which brought me to havre i continued my lonely journey to the south of france and then i went on to venice  what does all this matter to me francis thought to himself she paused evidently expecting him to say something so you have come to venice he said carelessly why  because i couldnt help it she answered  francis looked at her with cynical curiosity that sounds odd he remarked why couldnt you help it  women are accustomed to act on impulse she explained suppose we say that an impulse has directed my journey and yet this is the last place in the world that i wish to find myself in associations that i detest are connected with it in my mind if i had a will of my own i would never see it again i hate venice as you see however i am here when did you meet with such an unreasonable woman before never i am sure she stopped eyed him for a moment and suddenly altered her tone when is miss agnes lockwood expected to be in venice she asked  it was not easy to throw francis off his balance but that extraordinary question did it how the devil did you know that miss lockwood was coming to venice he exclaimed  she laugheda bitter mocking laugh say i guessed it  something in her tone or perhaps something in the audacious defiance of her eyes as they rested on him roused the quick temper that was in francis warwick lady montbarry he began  stop there she interposed your brother stephens wife calls herself lady montbarry now i share my title with no woman call me by my name before i committed the fatal mistake of marrying your brother address me if you please as countess narona  countess narona francis resumed if your object in claiming my acquaintance is to mystify me you have come to the wrong man speak plainly or permit me to wish you good evening  if your object is to keep miss lockwoods arrival in venice a secret she retorted speak plainly mr westwick on your side and say so  her intention was evidently to irritate him and she succeeded nonsense he broke out petulantly my brothers travelling arrangements are secrets to nobody he brings miss lockwood here with lady montbarry and the children as you seem so well informed perhaps you know why she is coming to venice  the countess had suddenly become grave and thoughtful she made no reply the two strangely associated companions having reached one extremity of the square were now standing before the church of st mark the moonlight was bright enough to show the architecture of the grand cathedral in its wonderful variety of detail even the pigeons of st mark were visible in dark closely packed rows roosting in the archways of the great entrance doors  i never saw the old church look so beautiful by moonlight the countess said quietly speaking not to francis but to herself goodbye st marks by moonlight i shall not see you again  she turned away from the church and saw francis listening to her with wondering looks no she resumed placidly picking up the lost thread of the conversation i dont know why miss lockwood is coming here i only know that we are to meet in venice  by previous appointment  by destiny she answered with her head on her breast and her eyes on the ground francis burst out laughing or if you like it better she instantly resumed by what fools call chance francis answered easily out of the depths of his strong common sense chance seems to be taking a queer way of bringing the meeting about he said we have all arranged to meet at the palace hotel how is it that your name is not on the visitors list destiny ought to have brought you to the palace hotel too  she abruptly pulled down her veil destiny may do that yet she said the palace hotel she repeated speaking once more to herself the old hell transformed into the new purgatory the place itself jesu maria the place itself she paused and laid her hand on her companions arm perhaps miss lockwood is not going there with the rest of you she burst out with sudden eagerness are you positively sure she will be at the hotel  positively havent i told you that miss lockwood travels with lord and lady montbarry and dont you know that she is a member of the family you will have to move countess to our hotel  she was perfectly impenetrable to the bantering tone in which he spoke yes she said faintly i shall have to move to your hotel her hand was still on his armhe could feel her shivering from head to foot while she spoke heartily as he disliked and distrusted her the common instinct of humanity obliged him to ask if she felt cold  yes she said cold and faint  cold and faint countess on such a night as this  the night has nothing to do with it mr westwick how do you suppose the criminal feels on the scaffold while the hangman is putting the rope around his neck cold and faint too i should think excuse my grim fancy you see destiny has got the rope round my neckand i feel it  she looked about her they were at that moment close to the famous cafe known as florians take me in there she said i must have something to revive me you had better not hesitate you are interested in reviving me i have not said what i wanted to say to you yet its business and its connected with your theatre  wondering inwardly what she could possibly want with his theatre francis reluctantly yielded to the necessities of the situation and took her into the cafe he found a quiet corner in which they could take their places without attracting notice what will you have he inquired resignedly she gave her own orders to the waiter without troubling him to speak for her  maraschino and a pot of tea  the waiter stared francis stared the tea was a novelty in connection with maraschino to both of them careless whether she surprised them or not she instructed the waiter when her directions had been complied with to pour a large wineglassfull of the liqueur into a tumbler and to fill it up from the teapot i cant do it for myself she remarked my hand trembles so she drank the strange mixture eagerly hot as it was maraschino punchwill you taste some of it she said i inherit the discovery of this drink when your english queen caroline was on the continent my mother was attached to her court that much injured royal person invented in her happier hours maraschino punch fondly attached to her gracious mistress my mother shared her tastes and i in my turn learnt from my mother now mr westwick suppose i tell you what my business is you are manager of a theatre do you want a new play  i always want a new playprovided its a good one  and you pay if its a good one  i pay liberallyin my own interests  if i write the play will you read it  francis hesitated what has put writing a play into your head he asked  mere accident she answered i had once occasion to tell my late brother of a visit which i paid to miss lockwood when i was last in england he took no interest at what happened at the interview but something struck him in my way of relating it he said you describe what passed between you and the lady with the point and contrast of good stage dialogue you have the dramatic instincttry if you can write a play you might make money that put it into my head  those last words seemed to startle francis surely you dont want money he exclaimed  i always want money my tastes are expensive i have nothing but my poor little four hundred a yearand the wreck that is left of the other money about two hundred pounds in circular notesno more  francis knew that she was referring to the ten thousand pounds paid by the insurance offices all those thousands gone already he exclaimed  she blew a little puff of air over her fingers gone like that she answered coolly  baron rivar  she looked at him with a flash of anger in her hard black eyes  my affairs are my own secret mr westwick i have made you a proposaland you have not answered me yet dont say no without thinking first remember what a life mine has been i have seen more of the world than most people playwrights included i have had strange adventures i have heard remarkable stories i have observed i have remembered are there no materials here in my head for writing a playif the opportunity is granted to me she waited a moment and suddenly repeated her strange question about agnes  when is miss lockwood expected to be in venice  what has that to do with your new play countess  the countess appeared to feel some difficulty in giving that question its fit reply she mixed another tumbler full of maraschino punch and drank one good half of it before she spoke again  it has everything to do with my new play was all she said answer me francis answered her  miss lockwood may be here in a week or for all i know to the contrary sooner than that  very well if i am a living woman and a free woman in a weeks timeor if i am in possession of my senses in a weeks time dont interrupt me i know what i am talking abouti shall have a sketch or outline of my play ready as a specimen of what i can do once again will you read it  i will certainly read it but countess i dont understand  she held up her hand for silence and finished the second tumbler of maraschino punch  i am a living enigmaand you want to know the right reading of me she said here is the reading as your english phrase goes in a nutshell there is a foolish idea in the minds of many persons that the natives of the warm climates are imaginative people there never was a greater mistake you will find no such unimaginative people anywhere as you find in italy spain greece and the other southern countries to anything fanciful to anything spiritual their minds are deaf and blind by nature now and then in the course of centuries a great genius springs up among them and he is the exception which proves the rule now see i though i am no geniusi am in my little way as i suppose an exception too to my sorrow i have some of that imagination which is so common among the english and the germansso rare among the italians the spaniards and the rest of them and what is the result i think it has become a disease in me i am filled with presentiments which make this wicked life of mine one long terror to me it doesnt matter just now what they are enough that they absolutely govern methey drive me over land and sea at their own horrible will they are in me and torturing me at this moment why dont i resist them ha but i do resist them i am trying with the help of the good punch to resist them now at intervals i cultivate the difficult virtue of common sense sometimes sound sense makes a hopeful woman of me at one time i had the hope that what seemed reality to me was only mad delusion after alli even asked the question of an english doctor at other times other sensible doubts of myself beset me never mind dwelling on them nowit always ends in the old terrors and superstitions taking possession of me again in a weeks time i shall know whether destiny does indeed decide my future for me or whether i decide it for myself in the last case my resolution is to absorb this selftormenting fancy of mine in the occupation that i have told you of already do you understand me a little better now and our business being settled dear mr westwick shall we get out of this hot room into the nice cool air again  they rose to leave the cafe francis privately concluded that the maraschino punch offered the only discoverable explanation of what the countess had said to him      chapter xx   shall i see you again she asked as she held out her hand to take leave it is quite understood between us i suppose about the play  francis recalled his extraordinary experience of that evening in the renumbered room my stay in venice is uncertain he replied if you have anything more to say about this dramatic venture of yours it may be as well to say it now have you decided on a subject already i know the public taste in england better than you doi might save you some waste of time and trouble if you have not chosen your subject wisely  i dont care what subject i write about so long as i write she answered carelessly if you have got a subject in your head give it to me i answer for the characters and the dialogue  you answer for the characters and the dialogue francis repeated thats a bold way of speaking for a beginner i wonder if i should shake your sublime confidence in yourself if i suggested the most ticklish subject to handle which is known to the stage what do you say countess to entering the lists with shakespeare and trying a drama with a ghost in it a true story mind founded on events in this very city in which you and i are interested  she caught him by the arm and drew him away from the crowded colonnade into the solitary middle space of the square now tell me she said eagerly here where nobody is near us how am i interested in it how how  still holding his arm she shook him in her impatience to hear the coming disclosure for a moment he hesitated thus far amused by her ignorant belief in herself he had merely spoken in jest now for the first time impressed by her irresistible earnestness he began to consider what he was about from a more serious point of view with her knowledge of all that had passed in the old palace before its transformation into an hotel it was surely possible that she might suggest some explanation of what had happened to his brother and sister and himself or failing to do this she might accidentally reveal some event in her own experience which acting as a hint to a competent dramatist might prove to be the making of a play the prosperity of his theatre was his one serious object in life i may be on the trace of another corsican brothers he thought a new piece of that sort would be ten thousand pounds in my pocket at least  with these motives worthy of the singlehearted devotion to dramatic business which made francis a successful manager he related without further hesitation what his own experience had been and what the experience of his relatives had been in the haunted hotel he even described the outbreak of superstitious terror which had escaped mrs norburys ignorant maid sad stuff if you look at it reasonably he remarked but there is something dramatic in the notion of the ghostly influence making itself felt by the relations in succession as they one after another enter the fatal roomuntil the one chosen relative comes who will see the unearthly creature and know the terrible truth material for a play countessfirstrate material for a play  there he paused she neither moved nor spoke he stooped and looked closer at her  what impression had he produced it was an impression which his utmost ingenuity had failed to anticipate she stood by his sidejust as she had stood before agnes when her question about ferrari was plainly answered at lastlike a woman turned to stone her eyes were vacant and rigid all the life in her face had faded out of it francis took her by the hand her hand was as cold as the pavement that they were standing on he asked her if she was ill  not a muscle in her moved he might as well have spoken to the dead  surely he said you are not foolish enough to take what i have been telling you seriously  her lips moved slowly as it seemed she was making an effort to speak to him  louder he said i cant hear you  she struggled to recover possession of herself a faint light began to soften the dull cold stare of her eyes in a moment more she spoke so that he could hear her  i never thought of the other world she murmured in low dull tones like a woman talking in her sleep  her mind had gone back to the day of her last memorable interview with agnes she was slowly recalling the confession that had escaped her the warning words which she had spoken at that past time necessarily incapable of understanding this francis looked at her in perplexity she went on in the same dull vacant tone steadily following out her own train of thought with her heedless eyes on his face and her wandering mind far away from him  i said some trifling event would bring us together the next time i was wrong no trifling event will bring us together i said i might be the person who told her what had become of ferrari if she forced me to it shall i feel some other influence than hers will he force me to it when she sees him shall i see him too  her head sank a little her heavy eyelids dropped slowly she heaved a long low weary sigh francis put her arm in his and made an attempt to rouse her  come countess you are weary and overwrought we have had enough talking tonight let me see you safe back to your hotel is it far from here  she started when he moved and obliged her to move with him as if he had suddenly awakened her out of a deep sleep  not far she said faintly the old hotel on the quay my minds in a strange state i have forgotten the name  danielis  yes  he led her on slowly she accompanied him in silence as far as the end of the piazzetta there when the full view of the moonlit lagoon revealed itself she stopped him as he turned towards the riva degli schiavoni i have something to ask you i want to wait and think  she recovered her lost idea after a long pause  are you going to sleep in the room tonight she asked  he told her that another traveller was in possession of the room that night but the manager has reserved it for me tomorrow he added if i wish to have it  no she said you must give it up  to whom  to me  he started after what i have told you do you really wish to sleep in that room tomorrow night  i must sleep in it  are you not afraid  i am horribly afraid  so i should have thought after what i have observed in you tonight why should you take the room you are not obliged to occupy it unless you like  i was not obliged to go to venice when i left america she answered and yet i came here i must take the room and keep the room until she broke off at those words never mind the rest she said it doesnt interest you  it was useless to dispute with her francis changed the subject we can do nothing tonight he said i will call on you tomorrow morning and hear what you think of it then  they moved on again to the hotel as they approached the door francis asked if she was staying in venice under her own name  she shook her head as your brothers widow i am known here as countess narona i am known here i want to be unknown this time to strangers in venice i am travelling under a common english name she hesitated and stood still what has come to me she muttered to herself some things i remember and some i forget i forgot danielisand now i forget my english name she drew him hurriedly into the hall of the hotel on the wall of which hung a list of visitors names running her finger slowly down the list she pointed to the english name that she had assumedmrs james  remember that when you call tomorrow she said my head is heavy good night  francis went back to his own hotel wondering what the events of the next day would bring forth a new turn in his affairs had taken place in his absence as he crossed the hall he was requested by one of the servants to walk into the private office the manager was waiting there with a gravely preoccupied manner as if he had something serious to say he regretted to hear that mr francis westwick had like other members of the family discovered serious sources of discomfort in the new hotel he had been informed in strict confidence of mr westwicks extraordinary objection to the atmosphere of the bedroom upstairs without presuming to discuss the matter he must beg to be excused from reserving the room for mr westwick after what had happened  francis answered sharply a little ruffled by the tone in which the manager had spoken to him i might very possibly have declined to sleep in the room if you had reserved it he said do you wish me to leave the hotel  the manager saw the error that he had committed and hastened to repair it certainly not sir we will do our best to make you comfortable while you stay with us i beg your pardon if i have said anything to offend you the reputation of an establishment like this is a matter of very serious importance may i hope that you will do us the great favour to say nothing about what has happened upstairs the two french gentlemen have kindly promised to keep it a secret  this apology left francis no polite alternative but to grant the managers request there is an end to the countesss wild scheme he thought to himself as he retired for the night so much the better for the countess  he rose late the next morning inquiring for his parisian friends he was informed that both the french gentlemen had left for milan as he crossed the hall on his way to the restaurant he noticed the head porter chalking the numbers of the rooms on some articles of luggage which were waiting to go upstairs one trunk attracted his attention by the extraordinary number of old travelling labels left on it the porter was marking it at the momentand the number was 13 a francis instantly looked at the card fastened on the lid it bore the common english name mrs james he at once inquired about the lady she had arrived early that morning and she was then in the reading room looking into the room he discovered a lady in it alone advancing a little nearer he found himself face to face with the countess  she was seated in a dark corner with her head down and her arms crossed over her bosom yes she said in a tone of weary impatience before francis could speak to her i thought it best not to wait for youi determined to get here before anybody else could take the room  have you taken it for long francis asked  you told me miss lockwood would be here in a weeks time i have taken it for a week  what has miss lockwood to do with it  she has everything to do with itshe must sleep in the room i shall give the room up to her when she comes here  francis began to understand the superstitious purpose that she had in view are you an educated woman really of the same opinion as my sisters maid he exclaimed assuming your absurd superstition to be a serious thing you are taking the wrong means to prove it true if i and my brother and sister have seen nothing how should agnes lockwood discover what was not revealed to us she is only distantly related to the montbarrysshe is only our cousin  she was nearer to the heart of the montbarry who is dead than any of you the countess answered sternly to the last day of his life my miserable husband repented his desertion of her she will see what none of you have seenshe shall have the room  francis listened utterly at a loss to account for the motives that animated her i dont see what interest you have in trying this extraordinary experiment he said  it is my interest not to try it it is my interest to fly from venice and never set eyes on agnes lockwood or any of your family again  what prevents you from doing that  she started to her feet and looked at him wildly i know no more what prevents me than you do she burst out some will that is stronger than mine drives me on to my destruction in spite of my own self she suddenly sat down again and waved her hand for him to go leave me she said leave me to my thoughts  francis left her firmly persuaded by this time that she was out of her senses for the rest of the day he saw nothing of her the night so far as he knew passed quietly the next morning he breakfasted early determining to wait in the restaurant for the appearance of the countess she came in and ordered her breakfast quietly looking dull and worn and selfabsorbed as she had looked when he last saw her he hastened to her table and asked if anything had happened in the night  nothing she answered  you have rested as well as usual  quite as well as usual have you had any letters this morning have you heard when she is coming  i have had no letters are you really going to stay here has your experience of last night not altered the opinion which you expressed to me yesterday  not in the least  the momentary gleam of animation which had crossed her face when she questioned him about agnes died out of it again when he answered her she looked she spoke she ate her breakfast with a vacant resignation like a woman who had done with hopes done with interests done with everything but the mechanical movements and instincts of life  francis went out on the customary travellers pilgrimage to the shrines of titian and tintoret after some hours of absence he found a letter waiting for him when he got back to the hotel it was written by his brother henry and it recommended him to return to milan immediately the proprietor of a french theatre recently arrived from venice was trying to induce the famous dancer whom francis had engaged to break faith with him and accept a higher salary  having made this startling announcement henry proceeded to inform his brother that lord and lady montbarry with agnes and the children would arrive in venice in three days more they know nothing of our adventures at the hotel henry wrote and they have telegraphed to the manager for the accommodation that they want there would be something absurdly superstitious in our giving them a warning which would frighten the ladies and children out of the best hotel in venice we shall be a strong party this timetoo strong a party for ghosts i shall meet the travellers on their arrival of course and try my luck again at what you call the haunted hotel arthur barville and his wife have already got as far on their way as trent and two of the ladys relations have arranged to accompany them on the journey to venice  naturally indignant at the conduct of his parisian colleague francis made his preparations for returning to milan by the train of that day  on his way out he asked the manager if his brothers telegram had been received the telegram had arrived and to the surprise of francis the rooms were already reserved i thought you would refuse to let any more of the family into the house he said satirically the manager answered with the due dash of respect in the same tone number 13 a is safe sir in the occupation of a stranger i am the servant of the company and i dare not turn money out of the hotel  hearing this francis said goodbyeand said nothing more he was ashamed to acknowledge it to himself but he felt an irresistible curiosity to know what would happen when agnes arrived at the hotel besides mrs james had reposed a confidence in him he got into his gondola respecting the confidence of mrs james    towards evening on the third day lord montbarry and his travelling companions arrived punctual to their appointment  mrs james sitting at the window of her room watching for them saw the new lord land from the gondola first he handed his wife to the steps the three children were next committed to his care last of all agnes appeared in the little black doorway of the gondola cabin and taking lord montbarrys hand passed in her turn to the steps she wore no veil as she ascended to the door of the hotel the countess eyeing her through an operaglass noticed that she paused to look at the outside of the building and that her face was very pale      chapter xxi   lord and lady montbarry were received by the housekeeper the manager being absent for a day or two on business connected with the affairs of the hotel  the rooms reserved for the travellers on the first floor were three in number consisting of two bedrooms opening into each other and communicating on the left with a drawingroom complete so far the arrangements proved to be less satisfactory in reference to the third bedroom required for agnes and for the eldest daughter of lord montbarry who usually slept with her on their travels the bedchamber on the right of the drawingroom was already occupied by an english widow lady other bedchambers at the other end of the corridor were also let in every case there was accordingly no alternative but to place at the disposal of agnes a comfortable room on the second floor lady montbarry vainly complained of this separation of one of the members of her travelling party from the rest the housekeeper politely hinted that it was impossible for her to ask other travellers to give up their rooms she could only express her regret and assure miss lockwood that her bedchamber on the second floor was one of the best rooms in that part of the hotel  on the retirement of the housekeeper lady montbarry noticed that agnes had seated herself apart feeling apparently no interest in the question of the bedrooms was she ill no she felt a little unnerved by the railway journey and that was all hearing this lord montbarry proposed that she should go out with him and try the experiment of half an hours walk in the cool evening air agnes gladly accepted the suggestion they directed their steps towards the square of st mark so as to enjoy the breeze blowing over the lagoon it was the first visit of agnes to venice the fascination of the wonderful city of the waters exerted its full influence over her sensitive nature the proposed halfhour of the walk had passed away and was fast expanding to half an hour more before lord montbarry could persuade his companion to remember that dinner was waiting for them as they returned passing under the colonnade neither of them noticed a lady in deep mourning loitering in the open space of the square she started as she recognised agnes walking with the new lord montbarryhesitated for a momentand then followed them at a discreet distance back to the hotel  lady montbarry received agnes in high spiritswith news of an event which had happened in her absence  she had not left the hotel more than ten minutes before a little note in pencil was brought to lady montbarry by the housekeeper the writer proved to be no less a person than the widow lady who occupied the room on the other side of the drawingroom which her ladyship had vainly hoped to secure for agnes writing under the name of mrs james the polite widow explained that she had heard from the housekeeper of the disappointment experienced by lady montbarry in the matter of the rooms mrs james was quite alone and as long as her bedchamber was airy and comfortable it mattered nothing to her whether she slept on the first or the second floor of the house she had accordingly much pleasure in proposing to change rooms with miss lockwood her luggage had already been removed and miss lockwood had only to take possession of the room number 13 a which was now entirely at her disposal  i immediately proposed to see mrs james lady montbarry continued and to thank her personally for her extreme kindness but i was informed that she had gone out without leaving word at what hour she might be expected to return i have written a little note of thanks saying that we hope to have the pleasure of personally expressing our sense of mrs jamess courtesy tomorrow in the mean time agnes i have ordered your boxes to be removed downstairs goand judge for yourself my dear if that good lady has not given up to you the prettiest room in the house  with those words lady montbarry left miss lockwood to make a hasty toilet for dinner  the new room at once produced a favourable impression on agnes the large window opening into a balcony commanded an admirable view of the canal the decorations on the walls and ceiling were skilfully copied from the exquisitely graceful designs of raphael in the vatican the massive wardrobe possessed compartments of unusual size in which double the number of dresses that agnes possessed might have been conveniently hung at full length in the inner corner of the room near the head of the bedstead there was a recess which had been turned into a little dressingroom and which opened by a second door on the inferior staircase of the hotel commonly used by the servants noticing these aspects of the room at a glance agnes made the necessary change in her dress as quickly as possible on her way back to the drawingroom she was addressed by a chambermaid in the corridor who asked for her key i will put your room tidy for the night miss the woman said and i will then bring the key back to you in the drawingroom  while the chambermaid was at her work a solitary lady loitering about the corridor of the second storey was watching her over the bannisters after a while the maid appeared with her pail in her hand leaving the room by way of the dressingroom and the back stairs as she passed out of sight the lady on the second floor no other it is needless to add than the countess herself ran swiftly down the stairs entered the bedchamber by the principal door and hid herself in the empty side compartment of the wardrobe the chambermaid returned completed her work locked the door of the dressingroom on the inner side locked the principal entrancedoor on leaving the room and returned the key to agnes in the drawingroom  the travellers were just sitting down to their late dinner when one of the children noticed that agnes was not wearing her watch had she left it in her bedchamber in the hurry of changing her dress she rose from the table at once in search of her watch lady montbarry advising her as she went out to see to the security of her bedchamber in the event of there being thieves in the house agnes found her watch forgotten on the toilet table as she had anticipated before leaving the room again she acted on lady montbarrys advice and tried the key in the lock of the dressingroom door it was properly secured she left the bedchamber locking the main door behind her  immediately on her departure the countess oppressed by the confined air in the wardrobe ventured on stepping out of her hiding place into the empty room  entering the dressingroom she listened at the door until the silence outside informed her that the corridor was empty upon this she unlocked the door and passing out closed it again softly leaving it to all appearance when viewed on the inner side as carefully secured as agnes had seen it when she tried the key in the lock with her own hand  while the montbarrys were still at dinner henry westwick joined them arriving from milan  when he entered the room and again when he advanced to shake hands with her agnes was conscious of a latent feeling which secretly reciprocated henrys unconcealed pleasure on meeting her again for a moment only she returned his look and in that moment her own observation told her that she had silently encouraged him to hope she saw it in the sudden glow of happiness which overspread his face and she confusedly took refuge in the usual conventional inquiries relating to the relatives whom he had left at milan  taking his place at the table henry gave a most amusing account of the position of his brother francis between the mercenary operadancer on one side and the unscrupulous manager of the french theatre on the other matters had proceeded to such extremities that the law had been called on to interfere and had decided the dispute in favour of francis on winning the victory the english manager had at once left milan recalled to london by the affairs of his theatre he was accompanied on the journey back as he had been accompanied on the journey out by his sister resolved after passing two nights of terror in the venetian hotel never to enter it again mrs norbury asked to be excused from appearing at the family festival on the ground of illhealth at her age travelling fatigued her and she was glad to take advantage of her brothers escort to return to england  while the talk at the dinnertable flowed easily onward the eveningtime advanced to nightand it became necessary to think of sending the children to bed  as agnes rose to leave the room accompanied by the eldest girl she observed with surprise that henrys manner suddenly changed he looked serious and preoccupied and when his niece wished him good night he abruptly said to her marian i want to know what part of the hotel you sleep in marian puzzled by the question answered that she was going to sleep as usual with aunt agnes not satisfied with that reply henry next inquired whether the bedroom was near the rooms occupied by the other members of the travelling party answering for the child and wondering what henrys object could possibly be agnes mentioned the polite sacrifice made to her convenience by mrs james thanks to that ladys kindness she said marian and i are only on the other side of the drawingroom henry made no remark he looked incomprehensibly discontented as he opened the door for agnes and her companion to pass out after wishing them good night he waited in the corridor until he saw them enter the fatal cornerroomand then he called abruptly to his brother come out stephen and let us smoke  as soon as the two brothers were at liberty to speak together privately henry explained the motive which had led to his strange inquiries about the bedrooms francis had informed him of the meeting with the countess at venice and of all that had followed it and henry now carefully repeated the narrative to his brother in all its details i am not satisfied he added about that womans purpose in giving up her room without alarming the ladies by telling them what i have just told you can you not warn agnes to be careful in securing her door  lord montbarry replied that the warning had been already given by his wife and that agnes might be trusted to take good care of herself and her little bedfellow for the rest he looked upon the story of the countess and her superstitions as a piece of theatrical exaggeration amusing enough in itself but unworthy of a moments serious attention  while the gentlemen were absent from the hotel the room which had been already associated with so many startling circumstances became the scene of another strange event in which lady montbarrys eldest child was concerned  little marian had been got ready for bed as usual and had so far taken hardly any notice of the new room as she knelt down to say her prayers she happened to look up at that part of the ceiling above her which was just over the head of the bed the next instant she alarmed agnes by starting to her feet with a cry of terror and pointing to a small brown spot on one of the white panelled spaces of the carved ceiling its a spot of blood the child exclaimed take me away i wont sleep here  seeing plainly that it would be useless to reason with her while she was in the room agnes hurriedly wrapped marian in a dressinggown and carried her back to her mother in the drawingroom here the ladies did their best to soothe and reassure the trembling girl the effort proved to be useless the impression that had been produced on the young and sensitive mind was not to be removed by persuasion marian could give no explanation of the panic of terror that had seized her she was quite unable to say why the spot on the ceiling looked like the colour of a spot of blood she only knew that she should die of terror if she saw it again under these circumstances but one alternative was left it was arranged that the child should pass the night in the room occupied by her two younger sisters and the nurse  in half an hour more marian was peacefully asleep with her arm around her sisters neck lady montbarry went back with agnes to her room to see the spot on the ceiling which had so strangely frightened the child it was so small as to be only just perceptible and it had in all probability been caused by the carelessness of a workman or by a dripping from water accidentally spilt on the floor of the room above  i really cannot understand why marian should place such a shocking interpretation on such a trifling thing lady montbarry remarked  i suspect the nurse is in some way answerable for what has happened agnes suggested she may quite possibly have been telling marian some tragic nursery story which has left its mischievous impression behind it persons in her position are sadly ignorant of the danger of exciting a childs imagination you had better caution the nurse tomorrow  lady montbarry looked round the room with admiration is it not prettily decorated she said i suppose agnes you dont mind sleeping here by yourself  agnes laughed i feel so tired she replied that i was thinking of bidding you goodnight instead of going back to the drawingroom  lady montbarry turned towards the door i see your jewelcase on the table she resumed dont forget to lock the other door there in the dressingroom  i have already seen to it and tried the key myself said agnes can i be of any use to you before i go to bed  no my dear thank you i feel sleepy enough to follow your example good night agnesand pleasant dreams on your first night in venice      chapter xxii   having closed and secured the door on lady montbarrys departure agnes put on her dressinggown and turning to her open boxes began the business of unpacking in the hurry of making her toilet for dinner she had taken the first dress that lay uppermost in the trunk and had thrown her travelling costume on the bed she now opened the doors of the wardrobe for the first time and began to hang her dresses on the hooks in the large compartment on one side  after a few minutes only of this occupation she grew weary of it and decided on leaving the trunks as they were until the next morning the oppressive south wind which had blown throughout the day still prevailed at night the atmosphere of the room felt close agnes threw a shawl over her head and shoulders and opening the window stepped into the balcony to look at the view  the night was heavy and overcast nothing could be distinctly seen the canal beneath the window looked like a black gulf the opposite houses were barely visible as a row of shadows dimly relieved against the starless and moonless sky at long intervals the warning cry of a belated gondolier was just audible as he turned the corner of a distant canal and called to invisible boats which might be approaching him in the darkness now and then the nearer dip of an oar in the water told of the viewless passage of other gondolas bringing guests back to the hotel excepting these rare sounds the mysterious nightsilence of venice was literally the silence of the grave  leaning on the parapet of the balcony agnes looked vacantly into the black void beneath her thoughts reverted to the miserable man who had broken his pledged faith to her and who had died in that house some change seemed to have come over her since her arrival in venice some new influence appeared to be at work for the first time in her experience of herself compassion and regret were not the only emotions aroused in her by the remembrance of the dead montbarry a keen sense of the wrong that she had suffered never yet felt by that gentle and forgiving nature was felt by it now she found herself thinking of the bygone days of her humiliation almost as harshly as henry westwick had thought of themshe who had rebuked him the last time he had spoken slightingly of his brother in her presence a sudden fear and doubt of herself startled her physically as well as morally she turned from the shadowy abyss of the dark water as if the mystery and the gloom of it had been answerable for the emotions which had taken her by surprise abruptly closing the window she threw aside her shawl and lit the candles on the mantelpiece impelled by a sudden craving for light in the solitude of her room  the cheering brightness round her contrasting with the black gloom outside restored her spirits she felt herself enjoying the light like a child  would it be well she asked herself to get ready for bed no the sense of drowsy fatigue that she had felt half an hour since was gone she returned to the dull employment of unpacking her boxes after a few minutes only the occupation became irksome to her once more she sat down by the table and took up a guidebook suppose i inform myself she thought on the subject of venice  her attention wandered from the book before she had turned the first page of it  the image of henry westwick was the presiding image in her memory now recalling the minutest incidents and details of the evening she could think of nothing which presented him under other than a favourable and interesting aspect she smiled to herself softly her colour rose by fine gradations as she felt the full luxury of dwelling on the perfect truth and modesty of his devotion to her was the depression of spirits from which she had suffered so persistently on her travels attributable by any chance to their long separation from each otherembittered perhaps by her own vain regret when she remembered her harsh reception of him in paris suddenly conscious of this bold question and of the selfabandonment which it implied she returned mechanically to her book distrusting the unrestrained liberty of her own thoughts what lurking temptations to forbidden tenderness find their hidingplaces in a womans dressinggown when she is alone in her room at night with her heart in the tomb of the dead montbarry could agnes even think of another man and think of love how shameful how unworthy of her for the second time she tried to interest herself in the guidebookand once more she tried in vain throwing the book aside she turned desperately to the one resource that was left to her luggageresolved to fatigue herself without mercy until she was weary enough and sleepy enough to find a safe refuge in bed  for some little time she persisted in the monotonous occupation of transferring her clothes from her trunk to the wardrobe the large clock in the hall striking midnight reminded her that it was getting late she sat down for a moment in an armchair by the bedside to rest  the silence in the house now caught her attention and held itheld it disagreeably was everybody in bed and asleep but herself surely it was time for her to follow the general example with a certain irritable nervous haste she rose again and undressed herself i have lost two hours of rest she thought frowning at the reflection of herself in the glass as she arranged her hair for the night i shall be good for nothing tomorrow  she lit the nightlight and extinguished the candleswith one exception which she removed to a little table placed on the side of the bed opposite to the side occupied by the armchair having put her travellingbox of matches and the guidebook near the candle in case she might be sleepless and might want to read she blew out the light and laid her head on the pillow  the curtains of the bed were looped back to let the air pass freely over her lying on her left side with her face turned away from the table she could see the armchair by the dim nightlight it had a chintz coveringrepresenting large bunches of roses scattered over a pale green ground she tried to weary herself into drowsiness by counting over and over again the bunches of roses that were visible from her point of view twice her attention was distracted from the counting by sounds outsideby the clock chiming the halfhour past twelve and then again by the fall of a pair of boots on the upper floor thrown out to be cleaned with that barbarous disregard of the comfort of others which is observable in humanity when it inhabits an hotel in the silence that followed these passing disturbances agnes went on counting the roses on the armchair more and more slowly before long she confused herself in the figurestried to begin counting againthought she would wait a little firstfelt her eyelids drooping and her head reclining lower and lower on the pillowsighed faintlyand sank into sleep  how long that first sleep lasted she never knew she could only remember in the aftertime that she woke instantly  every faculty and perception in her passed the boundary line between insensibility and consciousness so to speak at a leap without knowing why she sat up suddenly in the bed listening for she knew not what her head was in a whirl her heart beat furiously without any assignable cause but one trivial event had happened during the interval while she had been asleep the nightlight had gone out and the room as a matter of course was in total darkness  she felt for the matchbox and paused after finding it a vague sense of confusion was still in her mind she was in no hurry to light the match the pause in the darkness was for the moment agreeable to her  in the quieter flow of her thoughts during this interval she could ask herself the natural questionwhat cause had awakened her so suddenly and had so strangely shaken her nerves had it been the influence of a dream she had not dreamed at allor to speak more correctly she had no waking remembrance of having dreamed the mystery was beyond her fathoming the darkness began to oppress her she struck the match on the box and lit her candle  as the welcome light diffused itself over the room she turned from the table and looked towards the other side of the bed  in the moment when she turned the chill of a sudden terror gripped her round the heart as with the clasp of an icy hand  she was not alone in her room  therein the chair at the bedsidethere suddenly revealed under the flow of light from the candle was the figure of a woman reclining her head lay back over the chair her face turned up to the ceiling had the eyes closed as if she was wrapped in a deep sleep  the shock of the discovery held agnes speechless and helpless her first conscious action when she was in some degree mistress of herself again was to lean over the bed and to look closer at the woman who had so incomprehensibly stolen into her room in the dead of night one glance was enough she started back with a cry of amazement the person in the chair was no other than the widow of the dead montbarrythe woman who had warned her that they were to meet again and that the place might be venice  her courage returned to her stung into action by the natural sense of indignation which the presence of the countess provoked  wake up she called out how dare you come here how did you get in leave the roomor i will call for help  she raised her voice at the last words it produced no effect leaning farther over the bed she boldly took the countess by the shoulder and shook her not even this effort succeeded in rousing the sleeping woman she still lay back in the chair possessed by a torpor like the torpor of deathinsensible to sound insensible to touch was she really sleeping or had she fainted  agnes looked closer at her she had not fainted her breathing was audible rising and falling in deep heavy gasps at intervals she ground her teeth savagely beads of perspiration stood thickly on her forehead her clenched hands rose and fell slowly from time to time on her lap was she in the agony of a dream or was she spiritually conscious of something hidden in the room  the doubt involved in that last question was unendurable agnes determined to rouse the servants who kept watch in the hotel at night  the bellhandle was fixed to the wall on the side of the bed by which the table stood  she raised herself from the crouching position which she had assumed in looking close at the countess and turning towards the other side of the bed stretched out her hand to the bell at the same instant she stopped and looked upward her hand fell helplessly at her side she shuddered and sank back on the pillow  what had she seen  she had seen another intruder in her room  midway between her face and the ceiling there hovered a human headsevered at the neck like a head struck from the body by the guillotine  nothing visible nothing audible had given her any intelligible warning of its appearance silently and suddenly the head had taken its place above her no supernatural change had passed over the room or was perceptible in it now the dumblytortured figure in the chair the broad window opposite the foot of the bed with the black night beyond it the candle burning on the tablethese and all other objects in the room remained unaltered one object more unutterably horrid had been added to the rest that was the only changeno more no less  by the yellow candlelight she saw the head distinctly hovering in midair above her she looked at it steadfastly spellbound by the terror that held her  the flesh of the face was gone the shrivelled skin was darkened in hue like the skin of an egyptian mummyexcept at the neck there it was of a lighter colour there it showed spots and splashes of the hue of that brown spot on the ceiling which the childs fanciful terror had distorted into the likeness of a spot of blood thin remains of a discoloured moustache and whiskers hanging over the upper lip and over the hollows where the cheeks had once been made the head just recognisable as the head of a man over all the features death and time had done their obliterating work the eyelids were closed the hair on the skull discoloured like the hair on the face had been burnt away in places the bluish lips parted in a fixed grin showed the double row of teeth by slow degrees the hovering head perfectly still when she first saw it began to descend towards agnes as she lay beneath by slow degrees that strange doublyblended odour which the commissioners had discovered in the vaults of the old palacewhich had sickened francis westwick in the bedchamber of the new hotelspread its fetid exhalations over the room downward and downward the hideous apparition made its slow progress until it stopped close over agnesstopped and turned slowly so that the face of it confronted the upturned face of the woman in the chair  there was a pause then a supernatural movement disturbed the rigid repose of the dead face  the closed eyelids opened slowly the eyes revealed themselves bright with the glassy film of deathand fixed their dreadful look on the woman in the chair  agnes saw that look saw the eyelids of the living woman open slowly like the eyelids of the dead saw her rise as if in obedience to some silent commandand saw no more    her next conscious impression was of the sunlight pouring in at the window of the friendly presence of lady montbarry at the bedside and of the childrens wondering faces peeping in at the door      chapter xxiii   you have some influence over agnes try what you can do henry to make her take a sensible view of the matter there is really nothing to make a fuss about my wifes maid knocked at her door early in the morning with the customary cup of tea getting no answer she went round to the dressingroomfound the door on that side unlockedand discovered agnes on the bed in a fainting fit with my wifes help they brought her to herself again and she told the extraordinary story which i have just repeated to you you must have seen for yourself that she has been overfatigued poor thing by our long railway journeys her nerves are out of orderand she is just the person to be easily terrified by a dream she obstinately refuses however to accept this rational view dont suppose that i have been severe with her all that a man can do to humour her i have done i have written to the countess in her assumed name offering to restore the room to her she writes back positively declining to return to it i have accordingly arranged so as not to have the thing known in the hotel to occupy the room for one or two nights and to leave agnes to recover her spirits under my wifes care is there anything more that i can do whatever questions agnes has asked of me i have answered to the best of my ability she knows all that you told me about francis and the countess last night but try as i may i cant quiet her mind i have given up the attempt in despair and left her in the drawingroom go like a good fellow and try what you can do to compose her  in those words lord montbarry stated the case to his brother from the rational point of view henry made no remark he went straight to the drawingroom  he found agnes walking rapidly backwards and forwards flushed and excited if you come here to say what your brother has been saying to me she broke out before he could speak spare yourself the trouble i dont want common sensei want a true friend who will believe in me  i am that friend agnes henry answered quietly and you know it  you really believe that i am not deluded by a dream  i know that you are not deludedin one particular at least  in what particular  in what you have said of the countess it is perfectly true  agnes stopped him there why do i only hear this morning that the countess and mrs james are one and the same person she asked distrustfully why was i not told of it last night  you forget that you had accepted the exchange of rooms before i reached venice henry replied i felt strongly tempted to tell you even thenbut your sleeping arrangements for the night were all made i should only have inconvenienced and alarmed you i waited till the morning after hearing from my brother that you had yourself seen to your security from any intrusion how that intrusion was accomplished it is impossible to say i can only declare that the countesss presence by your bedside last night was no dream of yours on her own authority i can testify that it was a reality  on her own authority agnes repeated eagerly have you seen her this morning  i have seen her not ten minutes since  what was she doing  she was busily engaged in writing i could not even get her to look at me until i thought of mentioning your name  she remembered me of course  she remembered you with some difficulty finding that she wouldnt answer me on any other terms i questioned her as if i had come direct from you then she spoke she not only admitted that she had the same superstitious motive for placing you in that room which she had acknowledged to francisshe even owned that she had been by your bedside watching through the night to see what you saw as she expressed it hearing this i tried to persuade her to tell me how she got into the room unluckily her manuscript on the table caught her eye she returned to her writing the baron wants money she said i must get on with my play what she saw or dreamed while she was in your room last night it is at present impossible to discover but judging by my brothers account of her as well as by what i remember of her myself some recent influence has been at work which has produced a marked change in this wretched woman for the worse her mind since last night perhaps is partially deranged one proof of it is that she spoke to me of the baron as if he were still a living man when francis saw her she declared that the baron was dead which is the truth the united states consul at milan showed us the announcement of the death in an american newspaper so far as i can see such sense as she still possesses seems to be entirely absorbed in one absurd ideathe idea of writing a play for francis to bring out at his theatre he admits that he encouraged her to hope she might get money in this way i think he did wrong dont you agree with me  without heeding the question agnes rose abruptly from her chair  do me one more kindness henry she said take me to the countess at once  henry hesitated are you composed enough to see her after the shock that you have suffered he asked  she trembled the flush on her face died away and left it deadly pale but she held to her resolution you have heard of what i saw last night she said faintly  dont speak of it henry interposed dont uselessly agitate yourself  i must speak my mind is full of horrid questions about it i know i cant identify itand yet i ask myself over and over again in whose likeness did it appear was it in the likeness of ferrari or was it she stopped shuddering the countess knows i must see the countess she resumed vehemently whether my courage fails me or not i must make the attempt take me to her before i have time to feel afraid of it  henry looked at her anxiously if you are really sure of your own resolution he said i agree with youthe sooner you see her the better you remember how strangely she talked of your influence over her when she forced her way into your room in london  i remember it perfectly why do you ask  for this reason in the present state of her mind i doubt if she will be much longer capable of realizing her wild idea of you as the avenging angel who is to bring her to a reckoning for her evil deeds it may be well to try what your influence can do while she is still capable of feeling it  he waited to hear what agnes would say she took his arm and led him in silence to the door  they ascended to the second floor and after knocking entered the countesss room  she was still busily engaged in writing when she looked up from the paper and saw agnes a vacant expression of doubt was the only expression in her wild black eyes after a few moments the lost remembrances and associations appeared to return slowly to her mind the pen dropped from her hand haggard and trembling she looked closer at agnes and recognised her at last has the time come already she said in low awestruck tones give me a little longer respite i havent done my writing yet  she dropped on her knees and held out her clasped hands entreatingly agnes was far from having recovered after the shock that she had suffered in the night her nerves were far from being equal to the strain that was now laid on them she was so startled by the change in the countess that she was at a loss what to say or to do next henry was obliged to speak to her put your questions while you have the chance he said lowering his voice see the vacant look is coming over her face again  agnes tried to rally her courage you were in my room last night she began before she could add a word more the countess lifted her hands and wrung them above her head with a low moan of horror agnes shrank back and turned as if to leave the room henry stopped her and whispered to her to try again she obeyed him after an effort i slept last night in the room that you gave up to me she resumed i saw  the countess suddenly rose to her feet no more of that she cried oh jesu maria do you think i want to be told what you saw do you think i dont know what it means for you and for me decide for yourself miss examine your own mind are you well assured that the day of reckoning has come at last are you ready to follow me back through the crimes of the past to the secrets of the dead  she returned again to the writingtable without waiting to be answered her eyes flashed she looked like her old self once more as she spoke it was only for a moment the old ardour and impetuosity were nearly worn out her head sank she sighed heavily as she unlocked a desk which stood on the table opening a drawer in the desk she took out a leaf of vellum covered with faded writing some ragged ends of silken thread were still attached to the leaf as if it had been torn out of a book  can you read italian she asked handing the leaf to agnes  agnes answered silently by an inclination of her head  the leaf the countess proceeded once belonged to a book in the old library of the palace while this building was still a palace by whom it was torn out you have no need to know for what purpose it was torn out you may discover for yourself if you will read it firstat the fifth line from the top of the page  agnes felt the serious necessity of composing herself give me a chair she said to henry and i will do my best he placed himself behind her chair so that he could look over her shoulder and help her to understand the writing on the leaf rendered into english it ran as follows  i have now completed my literary survey of the first floor of the palace at the desire of my noble and gracious patron the lord of this glorious edifice i next ascend to the second floor and continue my catalogue or description of the pictures decorations and other treasures of art therein contained let me begin with the corner room at the western extremity of the palace called the room of the caryatides from the statues which support the mantelpiece this work is of comparatively recent execution it dates from the eighteenth century only and reveals the corrupt taste of the period in every part of it still there is a certain interest which attaches to the mantelpiece it conceals a cleverly constructed hidingplace between the floor of the room and the ceiling of the room beneath which was made during the last evil days of the inquisition in venice and which is reported to have saved an ancestor of my gracious lord pursued by that terrible tribunal the machinery of this curious place of concealment has been kept in good order by the present lord as a species of curiosity he condescended to show me the method of working it approaching the two caryatides rest your hand on the forehead midway between the eyebrows of the figure which is on your left as you stand opposite to the fireplace then press the head inwards as if you were pushing it against the wall behind by doing this you set in motion the hidden machinery in the wall which turns the hearthstone on a pivot and discloses the hollow place below there is room enough in it for a man to lie easily at full length the method of closing the cavity again is equally simple place both your hands on the temples of the figures pull as if you were pulling it towards youand the hearthstone will revolve into its proper position again  you need read no farther said the countess be careful to remember what you have read  she put back the page of vellum in her writingdesk locked it and led the way to the door  come she said and see what the mocking frenchman called the beginning of the end  agnes was barely able to rise from her chair she trembled from head to foot henry gave her his arm to support her fear nothing he whispered i shall be with you  the countess proceeded along the westward corridor and stopped at the door numbered thirtyeight this was the room which had been inhabited by baron rivar in the old days of the palace it was situated immediately over the bedchamber in which agnes had passed the night for the last two days the room had been empty the absence of luggage in it when they opened the door showed that it had not yet been let  you see said the countess pointing to the carved figure at the fireplace and you know what to do have i deserved that you should temper justice with mercy she went on in lower tones give me a few hours more to myself the baron wants moneyi must get on with my play  she smiled vacantly and imitated the action of writing with her right hand as she pronounced the last words the effort of concentrating her weakened mind on other and less familiar topics than the constant want of money in the barons lifetime and the vague prospect of gain from the still unfinished play had evidently exhausted her poor reserves of strength when her request had been granted she addressed no expressions of gratitude to agnes she only said feel no fear miss of my attempting to escape you where you are there i must be till the end comes  her eyes wandered round the room with a last weary and stupefied look she returned to her writing with slow and feeble steps like the steps of an old woman      chapter xxiv   henry and agnes were left alone in the room of the caryatides  the person who had written the description of the palaceprobably a poor author or artisthad correctly pointed out the defects of the mantelpiece bad taste exhibiting itself on the most costly and splendid scale was visible in every part of the work it was nevertheless greatly admired by ignorant travellers of all classes partly on account of its imposing size and partly on account of the number of variouslycoloured marbles which the sculptor had contrived to introduce into his design photographs of the mantelpiece were exhibited in the public rooms and found a ready sale among english and american visitors to the hotel  henry led agnes to the figure on the left as they stood facing the empty fireplace shall i try the experiment he asked or will you she abruptly drew her arm away from him and turned back to the door i cant even look at it she said that merciless marble face frightens me  henry put his hand on the forehead of the figure what is there to alarm you my dear in this conventionally classical face he asked jestingly before he could press the head inwards agnes hurriedly opened the door wait till i am out of the room she cried the bare idea of what you may find there horrifies me she looked back into the room as she crossed the threshold i wont leave you altogether she said i will wait outside  she closed the door left by himself henry lifted his hand once more to the marble forehead of the figure  for the second time he was checked on the point of setting the machinery of the hidingplace in motion on this occasion the interruption came from an outbreak of friendly voices in the corridor a womans voice exclaimed dearest agnes how glad i am to see you again a mans voice followed offering to introduce some friend to miss lockwood a third voice which henry recognised as the voice of the manager of the hotel became audible next directing the housekeeper to show the ladies and gentlemen the vacant apartments at the other end of the corridor if more accommodation is wanted the manager went on i have a charming room to let here he opened the door as he spoke and found himself face to face with henry westwick  this is indeed an agreeable surprise sir said the manager cheerfully you are admiring our famous chimneypiece i see may i ask mr westwick how you find yourself in the hotel this time have the supernatural influences affected your appetite again  the supernatural influences have spared me this time henry answered perhaps you may yet find that they have affected some other member of the family he spoke gravely resenting the familiar tone in which the manager had referred to his previous visit to the hotel have you just returned he asked by way of changing the topic  just this minute sir i had the honour of travelling in the same train with friends of yours who have arrived at the hotelmr and mrs arthur barville and their travelling companions miss lockwood is with them looking at the rooms they will be here before long if they find it convenient to have an extra room at their disposal  this announcement decided henry on exploring the hidingplace before the interruption occurred it had crossed his mind when agnes left him that he ought perhaps to have a witness in the not very probable event of some alarming discovery taking place the toofamiliar manager suspecting nothing was there at his disposal he turned again to the caryan figure maliciously resolving to make the manager his witness  i am delighted to hear that our friends have arrived at last he said before i shake hands with them let me ask you a question about this queer work of art here i see photographs of it downstairs are they for sale  certainly mr westwick  do you think the chimneypiece is as solid as it looks henry proceeded when you came in i was just wondering whether this figure here had not accidentally got loosened from the wall behind it he laid his hand on the marble forehead for the third time to my eye it looks a little out of the perpendicular i almost fancied i could jog the head just now when i touched it he pressed the head inwards as he said those words  a sound of jarring iron was instantly audible behind the wall the solid hearthstone in front of the fireplace turned slowly at the feet of the two men and disclosed a dark cavity below at the same moment the strange and sickening combination of odours hitherto associated with the vaults of the old palace and with the bedchamber beneath now floated up from the open recess and filled the room  the manager started back good god mr westwick he exclaimed what does this mean  remembering not only what his brother francis had felt in the room beneath but what the experience of agnes had been on the previous night henry was determined to be on his guard i am as much surprised as you are was his only reply  wait for me one moment sir said the manager i must stop the ladies and gentlemen outside from coming in  he hurried awaynot forgetting to close the door after him henry opened the window and waited there breathing the purer air vague apprehensions of the next discovery to come filled his mind for the first time he was doubly resolved now not to stir a step in the investigation without a witness  the manager returned with a wax taper in his hand which he lighted as soon as he entered the room  we need fear no interruption now he said be so kind mr westwick as to hold the light it is my business to find out what this extraordinary discovery means  henry held the taper looking into the cavity by the dim and flickering light they both detected a dark object at the bottom of it i think i can reach the thing the manager remarked if i lie down and put my hand into the hole  he knelt on the floorand hesitated might i ask you sir to give me my gloves he said they are in my hat on the chair behind you  henry gave him the gloves i dont know what i may be going to take hold of the manager explained smiling rather uneasily as he put on his right glove  he stretched himself at full length on the floor and passed his right arm into the cavity i cant say exactly what i have got hold of he said but i have got it  half raising himself he drew his hand out  the next instant he started to his feet with a shriek of terror a human head dropped from his nerveless grasp on the floor and rolled to henrys feet it was the hideous head that agnes had seen hovering above her in the vision of the night  the two men looked at each other both struck speechless by the same emotion of horror the manager was the first to control himself see to the door for gods sake he said some of the people outside may have heard me  henry moved mechanically to the door  even when he had his hand on the key ready to turn it in the lock in case of necessity he still looked back at the appalling object on the floor there was no possibility of identifying those decayed and distorted features with any living creature whom he had seenand yet he was conscious of feeling a vague and awful doubt which shook him to the soul the questions which had tortured the mind of agnes were now his questions too he asked himself in whose likeness might i have recognised it before the decay set in the likeness of ferrari or the likeness of he paused trembling as agnes had paused trembling before him agnes the name of all womens names the dearest to him was a terror to him now what was he to say to her what might be the consequence if he trusted her with the terrible truth  no footsteps approached the door no voices were audible outside the travellers were still occupied in the rooms at the eastern end of the corridor  in the brief interval that had passed the manager had sufficiently recovered himself to be able to think once more of the first and foremost interests of his lifethe interests of the hotel he approached henry anxiously  if this frightful discovery becomes known he said the closing of the hotel and the ruin of the company will be the inevitable results i feel sure that i can trust your discretion sir so far  you can certainly trust me henry answered but surely discretion has its limits he added after such a discovery as we have made  the manager understood that the duty which they owed to the community as honest and lawabiding men was the duty to which henry now referred i will at once find the means he said of conveying the remains privately out of the house and i will myself place them in the care of the police authorities will you leave the room with me or do you not object to keep watch here and help me when i return  while he was speaking the voices of the travellers made themselves heard again at the end of the corridor henry instantly consented to wait in the room he shrank from facing the inevitable meeting with agnes if he showed himself in the corridor at that moment  the manager hastened his departure in the hope of escaping notice he was discovered by his guests before he could reach the head of the stairs henry heard the voices plainly as he turned the key while the terrible drama of discovery was in progress on one side of the door trivial questions about the amusements of venice and facetious discussions on the relative merits of french and italian cookery were proceeding on the other little by little the sound of the talking grew fainter the visitors having arranged their plans of amusement for the day were on their way out of the hotel in a minute or two there was silence once more  henry turned to the window thinking to relieve his mind by looking at the bright view over the canal he soon grew wearied of the familiar scene the morbid fascination which seems to be exercised by all horrible sights drew him back again to the ghastly object on the floor  dream or reality how had agnes survived the sight of it as the question passed through his mind he noticed for the first time something lying on the floor near the head looking closer he perceived a thin little plate of gold with three false teeth attached to it which had apparently dropped out loosened by the shock when the manager let the head fall on the floor  the importance of this discovery and the necessity of not too readily communicating it to others instantly struck henry here surely was a chanceif any chance remainedof identifying the shocking relic of humanity which lay before him the dumb witness of a crime acting on this idea he took possession of the teeth purposing to use them as a last means of inquiry when other attempts at investigation had been tried and had failed  he went back again to the window the solitude of the room began to weigh on his spirits as he looked out again at the view there was a soft knock at the door he hastened to open itand checked himself in the act a doubt occurred to him was it the manager who had knocked he called out who is there  the voice of agnes answered him have you anything to tell me henry  he was hardly able to reply not just now he said confusedly forgive me if i dont open the door i will speak to you a little later  the sweet voice made itself heard again pleading with him piteously dont leave me alone henry i cant go back to the happy people downstairs  how could he resist that appeal he heard her sighhe heard the rustling of her dress as she moved away in despair the very thing that he had shrunk from doing but a few minutes since was the thing that he did now he joined agnes in the corridor she turned as she heard him and pointed trembling in the direction of the closed room is it so terrible as that she asked faintly  he put his arm round her to support her a thought came to him as he looked at her waiting in doubt and fear for his reply you shall know what i have discovered he said if you will first put on your hat and cloak and come out with me  she was naturally surprised can you tell me your object in going out she asked  he owned what his object was unreservedly i want before all things he said to satisfy your mind and mine on the subject of montbarrys death i am going to take you to the doctor who attended him in his illness and to the consul who followed him to the grave  her eyes rested on henry gratefully oh how well you understand me she said the manager joined them at the same moment on his way up the stairs henry gave him the key of the room and then called to the servants in the hall to have a gondola ready at the steps are you leaving the hotel the manager asked in search of evidence henry whispered pointing to the key if the authorities want me i shall be back in an hour      chapter xxv   the day had advanced to evening lord montbarry and the bridal party had gone to the opera agnes alone pleading the excuse of fatigue remained at the hotel having kept up appearances by accompanying his friends to the theatre henry westwick slipped away after the first act and joined agnes in the drawingroom  have you thought of what i said to you earlier in the day he asked taking a chair at her side do you agree with me that the one dreadful doubt which oppressed us both is at least set at rest  agnes shook her head sadly i wish i could agree with you henryi wish i could honestly say that my mind is at ease  the answer would have discouraged most men henrys patience where agnes was concerned was equal to any demands on it  if you will only look back at the events of the day he said you must surely admit that we have not been completely baffled remember how dr bruno disposed of our doubtsafter thirty years of medical practice do you think i am likely to mistake the symptoms of death by bronchitis if ever there was an unanswerable question there it is was the consuls testimony doubtful in any part of it he called at the palace to offer his services after hearing of lord montbarrys death he arrived at the time when the coffin was in the house he himself saw the corpse placed in it and the lid screwed down the evidence of the priest is equally beyond dispute he remained in the room with the coffin reciting the prayers for the dead until the funeral left the palace bear all these statements in mind agnes and how can you deny that the question of montbarrys death and burial is a question set at rest we have really but one doubt left we have still to ask ourselves whether the remains which i discovered are the remains of the lost courier or not there is the case as i understand it have i stated it fairly  agnes could not deny that he had stated it fairly  then what prevents you from experiencing the same sense of relief that i feel henry asked  what i saw last night prevents me agnes answered when we spoke of this subject after our inquiries were over you reproached me with taking what you called the superstitious view i dont quite admit thatbut i do acknowledge that i should find the superstitious view intelligible if i heard it expressed by some other person remembering what your brother and i once were to each other in the bygone time i can understand the apparition making itself visible to me to claim the mercy of christian burial and the vengeance due to a crime i can even perceive some faint possibility of truth in the explanation which you described as the mesmeric theorythat what i saw might be the result of magnetic influence communicated to me as i lay between the remains of the murdered husband above me and the guilty wife suffering the tortures of remorse at my bedside but what i do not understand is that i should have passed through that dreadful ordeal having no previous knowledge of the murdered man in his lifetime or only knowing him if you suppose that i saw the apparition of ferrari through the interest which i took in his wife i cant dispute your reasoning henry but i feel in my heart of hearts that you are deceived nothing will shake my belief that we are still as far from having discovered the dreadful truth as ever  henry made no further attempt to dispute with her she had impressed him with a certain reluctant respect for her own opinion in spite of himself  have you thought of any better way of arriving at the truth he asked who is to help us no doubt there is the countess who has the clue to the mystery in her own hands but in the present state of her mind is her testimony to be trustedeven if she were willing to speak judging by my own experience i should say decidedly not  you dont mean that you have seen her again agnes eagerly interposed  yes i disturbed her once more over her endless writing and i insisted on her speaking out plainly  then you told her what you found when you opened the hidingplace  of course i did henry replied i said that i held her responsible for the discovery though i had not mentioned her connection with it to the authorities as yet she went on with her writing as if i had spoken in an unknown tongue i was equally obstinate on my side i told her plainly that the head had been placed under the care of the police and that the manager and i had signed our declarations and given our evidence she paid not the slightest heed to me by way of tempting her to speak i added that the whole investigation was to be kept a secret and that she might depend on my discretion for the moment i thought i had succeeded she looked up from her writing with a passing flash of curiosity and said what are they going to do with itmeaning i suppose the head i answered that it was to be privately buried after photographs of it had first been taken i even went the length of communicating the opinion of the surgeon consulted that some chemical means of arresting decomposition had been used and had only partially succeededand i asked her pointblank if the surgeon was right the trap was not a bad onebut it completely failed she said in the coolest manner now you are here i should like to consult you about my play i am at a loss for some new incidents mind there was nothing satirical in this she was really eager to read her wonderful work to meevidently supposing that i took a special interest in such things because my brother is the manager of a theatre i left her making the first excuse that occurred to me so far as i am concerned i can do nothing with her but it is possible that your influence may succeed with her again as it has succeeded already will you make the attempt to satisfy your own mind she is still upstairs and i am quite ready to accompany you  agnes shuddered at the bare suggestion of another interview with the countess  i cant i darent she exclaimed after what has happened in that horrible room she is more repellent to me than ever dont ask me to do it henry feel my handyou have turned me as cold as death only with talking of it  she was not exaggerating the terror that possessed her henry hastened to change the subject  let us talk of something more interesting he said i have a question to ask you about yourself am i right in believing that the sooner you get away from venice the happier you will be  right she repeated excitedly you are more than right no words can say how i long to be away from this horrible place but you know how i am situatedyou heard what lord montbarry said at dinnertime  suppose he has altered his plans since dinnertime henry suggested  agnes looked surprised i thought he had received letters from england which obliged him to leave venice tomorrow she said  quite true henry admitted he had arranged to start for england tomorrow and to leave you and lady montbarry and the children to enjoy your holiday in venice under my care circumstances have occurred however which have forced him to alter his plans he must take you all back with him tomorrow because i am not able to assume the charge of you i am obliged to give up my holiday in italy and return to england too  agnes looked at him in some little perplexity she was not quite sure whether she understood him or not  are you really obliged to go back she asked  henry smiled as he answered her keep the secret he said or montbarry will never forgive me  she read the rest in his face oh she exclaimed blushing brightly you have not given up your pleasant holiday in italy on my account  i shall go back with you to england agnes that will be holiday enough for me  she took his hand in an irrepressible outburst of gratitude how good you are to me she murmured tenderly what should i have done in the troubles that have come to me without your sympathy i cant tell you henry how i feel your kindness  she tried impulsively to lift his hand to her lips he gently stopped her agnes he said are you beginning to understand how truly i love you  that simple question found its own way to her heart she owned the whole truth without saying a word she looked at himand then looked away again  he drew her nearer to him my own darling he whisperedand kissed her softly and tremulously the sweet lips lingered and touched his lips in return then her head drooped she put her arms round his neck and hid her face on his bosom they spoke no more    the charmed silence had lasted but a little while when it was mercilessly broken by a knock at the door  agnes started to her feet she placed herself at the piano the instrument being opposite to the door it was impossible when she seated herself on the musicstool for any person entering the room to see her face henry called out irritably come in  the door was not opened the person on the other side of it asked a strange question  is mr henry westwick alone  agnes instantly recognised the voice of the countess she hurried to a second door which communicated with one of the bedrooms dont let her come near me she whispered nervously good night henry good night  if henry could by an effort of will have transported the countess to the uttermost ends of the earth he would have made the effort without remorse as it was he only repeated more irritably than ever come in  she entered the room slowly with her everlasting manuscript in her hand her step was unsteady a dark flush appeared on her face in place of its customary pallor her eyes were bloodshot and widely dilated in approaching henry she showed a strange incapability of calculating her distancesshe struck against the table near which he happened to be sitting when she spoke her articulation was confused and her pronunciation of some of the longer words was hardly intelligible most men would have suspected her of being under the influence of some intoxicating liquor henry took a truer viewhe said as he placed a chair for her countess i am afraid you have been working too hard you look as if you wanted rest  she put her hand to her head my invention has gone she said i cant write my fourth act its all a blankall a blank  henry advised her to wait till the next day go to bed he suggested and try to sleep  she waved her hand impatiently i must finish the play she answered i only want a hint from you you must know something about plays your brother has got a theatre you must often have heard him talk about fourth and fifth actsyou must have seen rehearsals and all the rest of it she abruptly thrust the manuscript into henrys hand i cant read it to you she said i feel giddy when i look at my own writing just run your eye over it theres a good fellowand give me a hint  henry glanced at the manuscript he happened to look at the list of the persons of the drama as he read the list he started and turned abruptly to the countess intending to ask her for some explanation the words were suspended on his lips it was but too plainly useless to speak to her her head lay back on the rail of the chair she seemed to be half asleep already the flush on her face had deepened she looked like a woman who was in danger of having a fit  he rang the bell and directed the man who answered it to send one of the chambermaids upstairs his voice seemed to partially rouse the countess she opened her eyes in a slow drowsy way have you read it she asked  it was necessary as a mere act of humanity to humour her i will read it willingly said henry if you will go upstairs to bed you shall hear what i think of it tomorrow morning our heads will be clearer we shall be better able to make the fourth act in the morning  the chambermaid came in while he was speaking i am afraid the lady is ill henry whispered take her up to her room the woman looked at the countess and whispered back shall we send for a doctor sir  henry advised taking her upstairs first and then asking the managers opinion there was great difficulty in persuading her to rise and accept the support of the chambermaids arm it was only by reiterated promises to read the play that night and to make the fourth act in the morning that henry prevailed on the countess to return to her room  left to himself he began to feel a certain languid curiosity in relation to the manuscript he looked over the pages reading a line here and a line there suddenly he changed colour as he readand looked up from the manuscript like a man bewildered good god what does this mean he said to himself  his eyes turned nervously to the door by which agnes had left him she might return to the drawingroom she might want to see what the countess had written he looked back again at the passage which had startled himconsidered with himself for a momentand snatching up the unfinished play suddenly and softly left the room      chapter xxvi   entering his own room on the upper floor henry placed the manuscript on his table open at the first leaf his nerves were unquestionably shaken his hand trembled as he turned the pages he started at chance noises on the staircase of the hotel  the scenario or outline of the countesss play began with no formal prefatory phrases she presented herself and her work with the easy familiarity of an old friend    allow me dear mr francis westwick to introduce to you the persons in my proposed play behold them arranged symmetrically in a line  my lord the baron the courier the doctor the countess  i dont trouble myself you see to invest fictitious family names my characters are sufficiently distinguished by their social titles and by the striking contrast which they present one with another  the first act opens no before i open the first act i must announce injustice to myself that this play is entirely the work of my own invention i scorn to borrow from actual events and what is more extraordinary still i have not stolen one of my ideas from the modern french drama as the manager of an english theatre you will naturally refuse to believe this it doesnt matter nothing mattersexcept the opening of my first act  we are at homburg in the famous salon dor at the height of the season the countess exquisitely dressed is seated at the green table strangers of all nations are standing behind the players venturing their money or only looking on my lord is among the strangers he is struck by the countesss personal appearance in which beauties and defects are fantastically mingled in the most attractive manner he watches the countesss game and places his money where he sees her deposit her own little stake she looks round at him and says dont trust to my colour i have been unlucky the whole evening place your stake on the other colour and you may have a chance of winning my lord a true englishman blushes bows and obeys the countess proves to be a prophet she loses again my lord wins twice the sum that he has risked  the countess rises from the table she has no more money and she offers my lord her chair  instead of taking it he politely places his winnings in her hand and begs her to accept the loan as a favour to himself the countess stakes again and loses again my lord smiles superbly and presses a second loan on her from that moment her luck turns she wins and wins largely her brother the baron trying his fortune in another room hears of what is going on and joins my lord and the countess  pay attention if you please to the baron he is delineated as a remarkable and interesting character  this noble person has begun life with a singleminded devotion to the science of experimental chemistry very surprising in a young and handsome man with a brilliant future before him a profound knowledge of the occult sciences has persuaded the baron that it is possible to solve the famous problem called the philosophers stone his own pecuniary resources have long since been exhausted by his costly experiments his sister has next supplied him with the small fortune at her disposal reserving only the family jewels placed in the charge of her banker and friend at frankfort the countesss fortune also being swallowed up the baron has in a fatal moment sought for new supplies at the gaming table he proves at starting on his perilous career to be a favourite of fortune wins largely and alas profanes his noble enthusiasm for science by yielding his soul to the alldebasing passion of the gamester  at the period of the play the barons good fortune has deserted him he sees his way to a crowning experiment in the fatal search after the secret of transmuting the baser elements into gold but how is he to pay the preliminary expenses destiny like a mocking echo answers how  will his sisters winnings with my lords money prove large enough to help him eager for this result he gives the countess his advice how to play from that disastrous moment the infection of his own adverse fortune spreads to his sister she loses again and againloses to the last farthing  the amiable and wealthy lord offers a third loan but the scrupulous countess positively refuses to take it on leaving the table she presents her brother to my lord the gentlemen fall into pleasant talk my lord asks leave to pay his respects to the countess the next morning at her hotel the baron hospitably invites him to breakfast my lord accepts with a last admiring glance at the countess which does not escape her brothers observation and takes his leave for the night  alone with his sister the baron speaks out plainly our affairs he says are in a desperate condition and must find a desperate remedy wait for me here while i make inquiries about my lord you have evidently produced a strong impression on him if we can turn that impression into money no matter at what sacrifice the thing must be done  the countess now occupies the stage alone and indulges in a soliloquy which develops her character  it is at once a dangerous and attractive character immense capacities for good are implanted in her nature side by side with equally remarkable capacities for evil it rests with circumstances to develop either the one or the other being a person who produces a sensation wherever she goes this noble lady is naturally made the subject of all sorts of scandalous reports to one of these reports which falsely and abominably points to the baron as her lover instead of her brother she now refers with just indignation she has just expressed her desire to leave homburg as the place in which the vile calumny first took its rise when the baron returns overhears her last words and says to her yes leave homburg by all means provided you leave it in the character of my lords betrothed wife  the countess is startled and shocked she protests that she does not reciprocate my lords admiration for her she even goes the length of refusing to see him again the baron answers i must positively have command of money take your choice between marrying my lords income in the interest of my grand discoveryor leave me to sell myself and my title to the first rich woman of low degree who is ready to buy me  the countess listens in surprise and dismay is it possible that the baron is in earnest he is horribly in earnest the woman who will buy me he says is in the next room to us at this moment she is the wealthy widow of a jewish usurer she has the money i want to reach the solution of the great problem i have only to be that womans husband and to make myself master of untold millions of gold take five minutes to consider what i have said to you and tell me on my return which of us is to marry for the money i want you or i  as he turns away the countess stops him  all the noblest sentiments in her nature are exalted to the highest pitch where is the true woman she exclaims who wants time to consummate the sacrifice of herself when the man to whom she is devoted demands it she does not want five minutesshe does not want five secondsshe holds out her hand to him and she says sacrifice me on the altar of your glory take as steppingstones on the way to your triumph my love my liberty and my life  on this grand situation the curtain falls judging by my first act mr westwick tell me truly and dont be afraid of turning my head am i not capable of writing a good play    henry paused between the first and second acts reflecting not on the merits of the play but on the strange resemblance which the incidents so far presented to the incidents that had attended the disastrous marriage of the first lord montbarry  was it possible that the countess in the present condition of her mind supposed herself to be exercising her invention when she was only exercising her memory  the question involved considerations too serious to be made the subject of a hasty decision reserving his opinion henry turned the page and devoted himself to the reading of the next act the manuscript proceeded as follows   the second act opens at venice an interval of four months has elapsed since the date of the scene at the gambling table the action now takes place in the receptionroom of one of the venetian palaces  the baron is discovered alone on the stage he reverts to the events which have happened since the close of the first act the countess has sacrificed herself the mercenary marriage has taken placebut not without obstacles caused by difference of opinion on the question of marriage settlements  private inquiries instituted in england have informed the baron that my lords income is derived chiefly from what is called entailed property in case of accidents he is surely bound to do something for his bride let him for example insure his life for a sum proposed by the baron and let him so settle the money that his widow shall have it if he dies first  my lord hesitates the baron wastes no time in useless discussion let us by all means he says consider the marriage as broken off my lord shifts his ground and pleads for a smaller sum than the sum proposed the baron briefly replies i never bargain my lord is in love the natural result followshe gives way  so far the baron has no cause to complain but my lords turn comes when the marriage has been celebrated and when the honeymoon is over the baron has joined the married pair at a palace which they have hired in venice he is still bent on solving the problem of the philosophers stone his laboratory is set up in the vaults beneath the palaceso that smells from chemical experiments may not incommode the countess in the higher regions of the house the one obstacle in the way of his grand discovery is as usual the want of money his position at the present time has become truly critical he owes debts of honour to gentlemen in his own rank of life which must positively be paid and he proposes in his own friendly manner to borrow the money of my lord my lord positively refuses in the rudest terms the baron applies to his sister to exercise her conjugal influence she can only answer that her noble husband being no longer distractedly in love with her now appears in his true character as one of the meanest men living the sacrifice of the marriage has been made and has already proved useless  such is the state of affairs at the opening of the second act  the entrance of the countess suddenly disturbs the barons reflections she is in a state bordering on frenzy incoherent expressions of rage burst from her lips it is some time before she can sufficiently control herself to speak plainly she has been doubly insultedfirst by a menial person in her employment secondly by her husband her maid an englishwoman has declared that she will serve the countess no longer she will give up her wages and return at once to england being asked her reason for this strange proceeding she insolently hints that the countesss service is no service for an honest woman since the baron has entered the house the countess does what any lady in her position would do she indignantly dismisses the wretch on the spot  my lord hearing his wifes voice raised in anger leaves the study in which he is accustomed to shut himself up over his books and asks what this disturbance means the countess informs him of the outrageous language and conduct of her maid my lord not only declares his entire approval of the womans conduct but expresses his own abominable doubts of his wifes fidelity in language of such horrible brutality that no lady could pollute her lips by repeating it if i had been a man the countess says and if i had had a weapon in my hand i would have struck him dead at my feet  the baron listening silently so far now speaks permit me to finish the sentence for you he says you would have struck your husband dead at your feet and by that rash act you would have deprived yourself of the insurance money settled on the widowthe very money which is wanted to relieve your brother from the unendurable pecuniary position which he now occupies  the countess gravely reminds the baron that this is no joking matter after what my lord has said to her she has little doubt that he will communicate his infamous suspicions to his lawyers in england if nothing is done to prevent it she may be divorced and disgraced and thrown on the world with no resource but the sale of her jewels to keep her from starving  at this moment the courier who has been engaged to travel with my lord from england crosses the stage with a letter to take to the post the countess stops him and asks to look at the address on the letter she takes it from him for a moment and shows it to her brother the handwriting is my lords and the letter is directed to his lawyers in london  the courier proceeds to the postoffice the baron and the countess look at each other in silence no words are needed they thoroughly understand the position in which they are placed they clearly see the terrible remedy for it what is the plain alternative before them disgrace and ruinor my lords death and the insurance money  the baron walks backwards and forwards in great agitation talking to himself the countess hears fragments of what he is saying he speaks of my lords constitution probably weakened in indiaof a cold which my lord has caught two or three days sinceof the remarkable manner in which such slight things as colds sometimes end in serious illness and death  he observes that the countess is listening to him and asks if she has anything to propose she is a woman who with many defects has the great merit of speaking out is there no such thing as a serious illness she asks corked up in one of those bottles of yours in the vaults downstairs  the baron answers by gravely shaking his head what is he afraid ofa possible examination of the body after death no he can set any postmortem examination at defiance it is the process of administering the poison that he dreads a man so distinguished as my lord cannot be taken seriously ill without medical attendance where there is a doctor there is always danger of discovery then again there is the courier faithful to my lord as long as my lord pays him even if the doctor sees nothing suspicious the courier may discover something the poison to do its work with the necessary secrecy must be repeatedly administered in graduated doses one trifling miscalculation or mistake may rouse suspicion the insurance offices may hear of it and may refuse to pay the money as things are the baron will not risk it and will not allow his sister to risk it in his place  my lord himself is the next character who appears he has repeatedly rung for the courier and the bell has not been answered what does this insolence mean  the countess speaking with quiet dignityfor why should her infamous husband have the satisfaction of knowing how deeply he has wounded her reminds my lord that the courier has gone to the post my lord asks suspiciously if she has looked at the letter the countess informs him coldly that she has no curiosity about his letters referring to the cold from which he is suffering she inquires if he thinks of consulting a medical man my lord answers roughly that he is quite old enough to be capable of doctoring himself  as he makes this reply the courier appears returning from the post my lord gives him orders to go out again and buy some lemons he proposes to try hot lemonade as a means of inducing perspiration in bed in that way he has formerly cured colds and in that way he will cure the cold from which he is suffering now  the courier obeys in silence judging by appearances he goes very reluctantly on this second errand  my lord turns to the baron who has thus far taken no part in the conversation and asks him in a sneering tone how much longer he proposes to prolong his stay in venice the baron answers quietly let us speak plainly to one another my lord if you wish me to leave your house you have only to say the word and i go my lord turns to his wife and asks if she can support the calamity of her brothers absencelaying a grossly insulting emphasis on the word brother the countess preserves her impenetrable composure nothing in her betrays the deadly hatred with which she regards the titled ruffian who has insulted her you are master in this house my lord is all she says do as you please  my lord looks at his wife looks at the baronand suddenly alters his tone does he perceive in the composure of the countess and her brother something lurking under the surface that threatens him this is at least certain he makes a clumsy apology for the language that he has used abject wretch  my lords excuses are interrupted by the return of the courier with the lemons and hot water  the countess observes for the first time that the man looks ill his hands tremble as he places the tray on the table my lord orders his courier to follow him and make the lemonade in the bedroom the countess remarks that the courier seems hardly capable of obeying his orders hearing this the man admits that he is ill he too is suffering from a cold he has been kept waiting in a draught at the shop where he bought the lemons he feels alternately hot and cold and he begs permission to lie down for a little while on his bed  feeling her humanity appealed to the countess volunteers to make the lemonade herself my lord takes the courier by the arm leads him aside and whispers these words to him watch her and see that she puts nothing into the lemonade then bring it to me with your own hands and then go to bed if you like  without a word more to his wife or to the baron my lord leaves the room  the countess makes the lemonade and the courier takes it to his master  returning on the way to his own room he is so weak and feels he says so giddy that he is obliged to support himself by the backs of the chairs as he passes them the baron always considerate to persons of low degree offers his arm i am afraid my poor fellow he says that you are really ill the courier makes this extraordinary answer its all over with me sir i have caught my death  the countess is naturally startled you are not an old man she says trying to rouse the couriers spirits at your age catching cold doesnt surely mean catching your death the courier fixes his eyes despairingly on the countess  my lungs are weak my lady he says i have already had two attacks of bronchitis the second time a great physician joined my own doctor in attendance on me he considered my recovery almost in the light of a miracle take care of yourself he said if you have a third attack of bronchitis as certainly as two and two make four you will be a dead man i feel the same inward shivering my lady that i felt on those two former occasionsand i tell you again i have caught my death in venice  speaking some comforting words the baron leads him to his room the countess is left alone on the stage  she seats herself and looks towards the door by which the courier has been led out ah my poor fellow she says if you could only change constitutions with my lord what a happy result would follow for the baron and for me if you could only get cured of a trumpery cold with a little hot lemonade and if he could only catch his death in your place  she suddenly pausesconsiders for a whileand springs to her feet with a cry of triumphant surprise the wonderful the unparalleled idea has crossed her mind like a flash of lightning make the two men change names and placesand the deed is done where are the obstacles remove my lord by fair means or foul from his room and keep him secretly prisoner in the palace to live or die as future necessity may determine place the courier in the vacant bed and call in the doctor to see himill in my lords character and if he dies dying under my lords name    the manuscript dropped from henrys hands a sickening sense of horror overpowered him the question which had occurred to his mind at the close of the first act of the play assumed a new and terrible interest now as far as the scene of the countesss soliloquy the incidents of the second act had reflected the events of his late brothers life as faithfully as the incidents of the first act was the monstrous plot revealed in the lines which he had just read the offspring of the countesss morbid imagination or had she in this case also deluded herself with the idea that she was inventing when she was really writing under the influence of her own guilty remembrances of the past if the latter interpretation were the true one he had just read the narrative of the contemplated murder of his brother planned in cold blood by a woman who was at that moment inhabiting the same house with him while to make the fatality complete agnes herself had innocently provided the conspirators with the one man who was fitted to be the passive agent of their crime  even the bare doubt that it might be so was more than he could endure he left his room resolved to force the truth out of the countess or to denounce her before the authorities as a murderess at large  arrived at her door he was met by a person just leaving the room the person was the manager he was hardly recognisable he looked and spoke like a man in a state of desperation  oh go in if you like he said to henry mark this sir i am not a superstitious man but i do begin to believe that crimes carry their own curse with them this hotel is under a curse what happens in the morning we discover a crime committed in the old days of the palace the night comes and brings another dreadful event with ita death a sudden and shocking death in the house go in and see for yourself i shall resign my situation mr westwick i cant contend with the fatalities that pursue me here  henry entered the room  the countess was stretched on her bed the doctor on one side and the chambermaid on the other were standing looking at her from time to time she drew a heavy stertorous breath like a person oppressed in sleeping is she likely to die henry asked  she is dead the doctor answered dead of the rupture of a bloodvessel on the brain those sounds that you hear are purely mechanicalthey may go on for hours  henry looked at the chambermaid she had little to tell the countess had refused to go to bed and had placed herself at her desk to proceed with her writing finding it useless to remonstrate with her the maid had left the room to speak to the manager in the shortest possible time the doctor was summoned to the hotel and found the countess dead on the floor there was this to telland no more  looking at the writingtable as he went out henry saw the sheet of paper on which the countess had traced her last lines of writing the characters were almost illegible henry could just distinguish the words first act and persons of the drama the lost wretch had been thinking of her play to the last and had begun it all over again      chapter xxvii   henry returned to his room  his first impulse was to throw aside the manuscript and never to look at it again the one chance of relieving his mind from the dreadful uncertainty that oppressed it by obtaining positive evidence of the truth was a chance annihilated by the countesss death what good purpose could be served what relief could he anticipate if he read more  he walked up and down the room after an interval his thoughts took a new direction the question of the manuscript presented itself under another point of view thus far his reading had only informed him that the conspiracy had been planned how did he know that the plan had been put in execution  the manuscript lay just before him on the floor he hesitated then picked it up and returning to the table read on as follows from the point at which he had left off    while the countess is still absorbed in the bold yet simple combination of circumstances which she has discovered the baron returns he takes a serious view of the case of the courier it may be necessary he thinks to send for medical advice no servant is left in the palace now the english maid has taken her departure the baron himself must fetch the doctor if the doctor is really needed  let us have medical help by all means his sister replies but wait and hear something that i have to say to you first she then electrifies the baron by communicating her idea to him what danger of discovery have they to dread my lords life in venice has been a life of absolute seclusion nobody but his banker knows him even by personal appearance he has presented his letter of credit as a perfect stranger and he and his banker have never seen each other since that first visit he has given no parties and gone to no parties on the few occasions when he has hired a gondola or taken a walk he has always been alone thanks to the atrocious suspicion which makes him ashamed of being seen with his wife he has led the very life which makes the proposed enterprise easy of accomplishment  the cautious baron listensbut gives no positive opinion as yet see what you can do with the courier he says and i will decide when i hear the result one valuable hint i may give you before you go your man is easily tempted by moneyif you only offer him enough the other day i asked him in jest what he would do for a thousand pounds he answered anything bear that in mind and offer your highest bid without bargaining  the scene changes to the couriers room and shows the poor wretch with a photographic portrait of his wife in his hand crying the countess enters  she wisely begins by sympathising with her contemplated accomplice he is duly grateful he confides his sorrows to his gracious mistress now that he believes himself to be on his deathbed he feels remorse for his neglectful treatment of his wife he could resign himself to die but despair overpowers him when he remembers that he has saved no money and that he will leave his widow without resources to the mercy of the world  on this hint the countess speaks suppose you were asked to do a perfectly easy thing she says and suppose you were rewarded for doing it by a present of a thousand pounds as a legacy for your widow  the courier raises himself on his pillow and looks at the countess with an expression of incredulous surprise she can hardly be cruel enough he thinks to joke with a man in his miserable plight will she say plainly what this perfectly easy thing is the doing of which will meet with such a magnificent reward  the countess answers that question by confiding her project to the courier without the slightest reserve  some minutes of silence follow when she has done the courier is not weak enough yet to speak without stopping to think first still keeping his eyes on the countess he makes a quaintly insolent remark on what he has just heard i have not hitherto been a religious man but i feel myself on the way to it since your ladyship has spoken to me i believe in the devil it is the countesss interest to see the humorous side of this confession of faith she takes no offence she only says i will give you half an hour by yourself to think over my proposal you are in danger of death decide in your wifes interests whether you will die worth nothing or die worth a thousand pounds  left alone the courier seriously considers his positionand decides he rises with difficulty writes a few lines on a leaf taken from his pocketbook and with slow and faltering steps leaves the room  the countess returning at the expiration of the halfhours interval finds the room empty while she is wondering the courier opens the door what has he been doing out of his bed he answers i have been protecting my own life my lady on the bare chance that i may recover from the bronchitis for the third time if you or the baron attempts to hurry me out of this world or to deprive me of my thousand pounds reward i shall tell the doctor where he will find a few lines of writing which describe your ladyships plot i may not have strength enough in the case supposed to betray you by making a complete confession with my own lips but i can employ my last breath to speak the halfdozen words which will tell the doctor where he is to look those words it is needless to add will be addressed to your ladyship if i find your engagements towards me faithfully kept  with this audacious preface he proceeds to state the conditions on which he will play his part in the conspiracy and die if he does die worth a thousand pounds  either the countess or the baron are to taste the food and drink brought to his bedside in his presence and even the medicines which the doctor may prescribe for him as for the promised sum of money it is to be produced in one banknote folded in a sheet of paper on which a line is to be written dictated by the courier the two enclosures are then to be sealed up in an envelope addressed to his wife and stamped ready for the post this done the letter is to be placed under his pillow the baron or the countess being at liberty to satisfy themselves day by day at their own time that the letter remains in its place with the seal unbroken as long as the doctor has any hope of his patients recovery the last stipulation follows the courier has a conscience and with a view to keeping it easy insists that he shall be left in ignorance of that part of the plot which relates to the sequestration of my lord not that he cares particularly what becomes of his miserly masterbut he does dislike taking other peoples responsibilities on his own shoulders  these conditions being agreed to the countess calls in the baron who has been waiting events in the next room  he is informed that the courier has yielded to temptation but he is still too cautious to make any compromising remarks keeping his back turned on the bed he shows a bottle to the countess it is labelled chloroform she understands that my lord is to be removed from his room in a convenient state of insensibility in what part of the palace is he to be hidden as they open the door to go out the countess whispers that question to the baron the baron whispers back in the vaults the curtain falls      chapter xxviii   so the second act ended  turning to the third act henry looked wearily at the pages as he let them slip through his fingers both in mind and body he began to feel the need of repose  in one important respect the later portion of the manuscript differed from the pages which he had just been reading signs of an overwrought brain showed themselves here and there as the outline of the play approached its end the handwriting grew worse and worse some of the longer sentences were left unfinished in the exchange of dialogue questions and answers were not always attributed respectively to the right speaker at certain intervals the writers failing intelligence seemed to recover itself for a while only to relapse again and to lose the thread of the narrative more hopelessly than ever  after reading one or two of the more coherent passages henry recoiled from the everdarkening horror of the story he closed the manuscript heartsick and exhausted and threw himself on his bed to rest the door opened almost at the same moment lord montbarry entered the room  we have just returned from the opera he said and we have heard the news of that miserable womans death they say you spoke to her in her last moments and i want to hear how it happened  you shall hear how it happened henry answered and more than that you are now the head of the family stephen and i feel bound in the position which oppresses me to leave you to decide what ought to be done  with those introductory words he told his brother how the countesss play had come into his hands read the first few pages he said i am anxious to know whether the same impression is produced on both of us  before lord montbarry had got halfway through the first act he stopped and looked at his brother what does she mean by boasting of this as her own invention he asked was she too crazy to remember that these things really happened  this was enough for henry the same impression had been produced on both of them you will do as you please he said but if you will be guided by me spare yourself the reading of those pages to come which describe our brothers terrible expiation of his heartless marriage  have you read it all henry  not all i shrank from reading some of the latter part of it neither you nor i saw much of our elder brother after we left school and for my part i felt and never scrupled to express my feeling that he behaved infamously to agnes but when i read that unconscious confession of the murderous conspiracy to which he fell a victim i remembered with something like remorse that the same mother bore us i have felt for him tonight what i am ashamed to think i never felt for him before  lord montbarry took his brothers hand  you are a good fellow henry he said but are you quite sure that you have not been needlessly distressing yourself because some of this crazy creatures writing accidentally tells what we know to be the truth does it follow that all the rest is to be relied on to the end  there is no possible doubt of it henry replied  no possible doubt his brother repeated i shall go on with my reading henryand see what justification there may be for that confident conclusion of yours  he read on steadily until he had reached the end of the second act then he looked up  do you really believe that the mutilated remains which you discovered this morning are the remains of our brother he asked and do you believe it on such evidence as this  henry answered silently by a sign in the affirmative  lord montbarry checked himselfevidently on the point of entering an indignant protest  you acknowledge that you have not read the later scenes of the piece he said dont be childish henry if you persist in pinning your faith on such stuff as this the least you can do is to make yourself thoroughly acquainted with it will you read the third act no then i shall read it to you  he turned to the third act and ran over those fragmentary passages which were clearly enough written and expressed to be intelligible to the mind of a stranger  here is a scene in the vaults of the palace he began the victim of the conspiracy is sleeping on his miserable bed and the baron and the countess are considering the position in which they stand the countess as well as i can make it out has raised the money that is wanted by borrowing on the security of her jewels at frankfort and the courier upstairs is still declared by the doctor to have a chance of recovery what are the conspirators to do if the man does recover the cautious baron suggests setting the prisoner free if he ventures to appeal to the law it is easy to declare that he is subject to insane delusion and to call his own wife as witness on the other hand if the courier dies how is the sequestrated and unknown nobleman to be put out of the way passively by letting him starve in his prison no the baron is a man of refined tastes he dislikes needless cruelty the active policy remainssay assassination by the knife of a hired bravo the baron objects to trusting an accomplice also to spending money on anyone but himself shall they drop their prisoner into the canal the baron declines to trust water water will show him on the surface shall they set his bed on fire an excellent idea but the smoke might be seen no the circumstances being now entirely altered poisoning him presents the easiest way out of it he has simply become a superfluous person the cheapest poison will dois it possible henry that you believe this consultation really took place  henry made no reply the succession of the questions that had just been read to him exactly followed the succession of the dreams that had terrified mrs norbury on the two nights which she had passed in the hotel it was useless to point out this coincidence to his brother he only said go on  lord montbarry turned the pages until he came to the next intelligible passage  here he proceeded is a double scene on the stageso far as i can understand the sketch of it the doctor is upstairs innocently writing his certificate of my lords decease by the dead couriers bedside down in the vaults the baron stands by the corpse of the poisoned lord preparing the strong chemical acids which are to reduce it to a heap of ashessurely it is not worth while to trouble ourselves with deciphering such melodramatic horrors as these let us get on let us get on  he turned the leaves again attempting vainly to discover the meaning of the confused scenes that followed on the last page but one he found the last intelligible sentences  the third act seems to be divided he said into two parts or tableaux i think i can read the writing at the beginning of the second part the baron and the countess open the scene the barons hands are mysteriously concealed by gloves he has reduced the body to ashes by his own system of cremation with the exception of the head  henry interrupted his brother there dont read any more he exclaimed  let us do the countess justice lord montbarry persisted there are not half a dozen lines more that i can make out the accidental breaking of his jar of acid has burnt the barons hands severely he is still unable to proceed to the destruction of the headand the countess is woman enough with all her wickedness to shrink from attempting to take his placewhen the first news is received of the coming arrival of the commission of inquiry despatched by the insurance offices the baron feels no alarm inquire as the commission may it is the natural death of the courier in my lords character that they are blindly investigating the head not being destroyed the obvious alternative is to hide itand the baron is equal to the occasion his studies in the old library have informed him of a safe place of concealment in the palace the countess may recoil from handling the acids and watching the process of cremation but she can surely sprinkle a little disinfecting powder  no more henry reiterated no more  there is no more that can be read my dear fellow the last page looks like sheer delirium she may well have told you that her invention had failed her  face the truth honestly stephen and say her memory  lord montbarry rose from the table at which he had been sitting and looked at his brother with pitying eyes  your nerves are out of order henry he said and no wonder after that frightful discovery under the hearthstone we wont dispute about it we will wait a day or two until you are quite yourself again in the meantime let us understand each other on one point at least you leave the question of what is to be done with these pages of writing to me as the head of the family  i do  lord montbarry quietly took up the manuscript and threw it into the fire let this rubbish be of some use he said holding the pages down with the poker the room is getting chillythe countesss play will set some of these charred logs flaming again he waited a little at the fireplace and returned to his brother now henry i have a last word to say and then i have done i am ready to admit that you have stumbled by an unlucky chance on the proof of a crime committed in the old days of the palace nobody knows how long ago with that one concession i dispute everything else rather than agree in the opinion you have formed i wont believe anything that has happened the supernatural influences that some of us felt when we first slept in this hotelyour loss of appetite our sisters dreadful dreams the smell that overpowered francis and the head that appeared to agnesi declare them all to be sheer delusions i believe in nothing nothing nothing he opened the door to go out and looked back into the room yes he resumed there is one thing i believe in my wife has committed a breach of confidencei believe agnes will marry you good night henry we leave venice the first thing tomorrow morning  so lord montbarry disposed of the mystery of the haunted hotel      postscript   a last chance of deciding the difference of opinion between the two brothers remained in henrys possession he had his own idea of the use to which he might put the false teeth as a means of inquiry when he and his fellowtravellers returned to england  the only surviving depositary of the domestic history of the family in past years was agnes lockwoods old nurse henry took his first opportunity of trying to revive her personal recollections of the deceased lord montbarry but the nurse had never forgiven the great man of the family for his desertion of agnes she flatly refused to consult her memory even the bare sight of my lord when i last saw him in london said the old woman made my fingernails itch to set their mark on his face i was sent on an errand by miss agnes and i met him coming out of his dentists doorand thank god thats the last i ever saw of him  thanks to the nurses quick temper and quaint way of expressing herself the object of henrys inquiries was gained already he ventured on asking if she had noticed the situation of the house she had noticed and still remembered the situationdid master henry suppose she had lost the use of her senses because she happened to be nigh on eighty years old the same day he took the false teeth to the dentist and set all further doubt if doubt had still been possible at rest for ever the teeth had been made for the first lord montbarry  henry never revealed the existence of this last link in the chain of discovery to any living creature his brother stephen included he carried his terrible secret with him to the grave  there was one other event in the memorable past on which he preserved the same compassionate silence little mrs ferrari never knew that her husband had beennot as she supposed the countesss victimbut the countesss accomplice she still believed that the late lord montbarry had sent her the thousandpound note and still recoiled from making use of a present which she persisted in declaring had the stain of her husbands blood on it agnes with the widows entire approval took the money to the childrens hospital and spent it in adding to the number of the beds  in the spring of the new year the marriage took place at the special request of agnes the members of the family were the only persons present at the ceremony there was no wedding breakfastand the honeymoon was spent in the retirement of a cottage on the banks of the thames  during the last few days of the residence of the newly married couple by the riverside lady montbarrys children were invited to enjoy a days play in the garden the eldest girl overheard and reported to her mother a little conjugal dialogue which touched on the topic of the haunted hotel  henry i want you to give me a kiss  there it is my dear  now i am your wife may i speak to you about something  what is it  something that happened the day before we left venice you saw the countess during the last hours of her life wont you tell me whether she made any confession to you  no conscious confession agnesand therefore no confession that i need distress you by repeating  did she say nothing about what she saw or heard on that dreadful night in my room  nothing we only know that her mind never recovered the terror of it  agnes was not quite satisfied the subject troubled her even her own brief intercourse with her miserable rival of other days suggested questions that perplexed her she remembered the countesss prediction you have to bring me to the day of discovery and to the punishment that is my doom had the prediction simply faded like other mortal propheciesor had it been fulfilled on the terrible night when she had seen the apparition and when she had innocently tempted the countess to watch her in her room  let it however be recorded among the other virtues of mrs henry westwick that she never again attempted to persuade her husband into betraying his secrets other mens wives hearing of this extraordinary conduct and being trained in the modern school of morals and manners naturally regarded her with compassionate contempt they spoke of agnes from that time forth as rather an oldfashioned person    is that all  that is all  is there no explanation of the mystery of the haunted hotel  ask yourself if there is any explanation of the mystery of your own life and deathfarewell
